</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-463, an act to provide for compensation to 
those Canadian veterans who were taken prisoner by the Japanese 
in 1941 in Hong Kong and forced to work in labour camps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, Christmas Day 1941 started a despicable 
period of time when 2,000 Canadian soldiers who defended Hong 
Kong were interned by the Japanese and put into forced labour in 
Japanese industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that period of incarceration, Japan made a settlement of 
$1 a day in the early 1950s which was not a settlement in kind. 
The Canadian government went on in 1955 to conspire against 
further compensation to these same war veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is to set right a gross wrong that occurred many years

support.  I must be done.

am pleased to present a petition today signed by a number of 
Canadians, including from my own riding of Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that human 
rights violations continue in many countries around the world, 
including Indonesia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners also acknowledge that Canada is internationally 
respected for its defence of universal human rights and in this, 
the 50th anniversary of the UN declaration of universal human 
rights, the petitioners call on the government to continue its 
efforts to speak out against countries which tolerate violations 
of human rights and to do whatever is possible to bring to

Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gave you notice of this matter of privilege, and each party 
House leader, with respect to a news release yesterday by the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services.  I have sent 
Mr. Speaker a copy of this but it is short enough that I would 
like to read it. It is dated December 2: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Public Works and Government Services today 
announced the creation of the Parliamentary Buildings Advisory 
Council to provide advice on the Parliament Hill renovations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The Parliamentary Buildings Advisory Council will provide an 
important support mechanism to the renovation projects of 
Parliament Hill”, said [the minister]. “The Advisory Council 
will aim to make a valued contribution to improving the level of 
information, consultation and co-operation on preserving these 
important heritage assets”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Buildings Advisory Council will be comprised 
of membership from the private and public sectors, including: 
representatives of the Senate; House of Commons; the Library of 
Parliament; the National Capital Commission; Canada Heritage; as 
well as representatives of the private sector architectural and 
engineering professional associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Advisory Council will be an independent advisory board that 
will advise the Minister of PWGSC, as the authority accountable 
for the Parliament Hill renovations.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These texts are also available in French. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been disturbed for some time by the cabinet's attitude 
toward parliament.  Ministers seem to take great pride in 
avoiding interaction with this House.  A dangerous culture grew 
in the last parliament in which cabinet ignored this House and 
its members.  I can count on one hand the number of ministerial 
statements that have been made since this parliament reconvened. 
Those statements have been most often and appropriately prompted 
by expressions of public sympathy for disasters, yet they have 
not been announcements by government on policy or matters that 
should be brought to the attention of this House in the first 
instance.  The House of Commons is the place where the government 
is most answerable to the people who elected the members of this 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A culture of spin doctoring and media manipulation appears to 
have grown.  To date this House has been prepared to ignore it 
and to remain silent, while our right to be informed of 
government action and policy decisions has been superseded by 
default by government to the news releases.  It appears there is 
no one in this place, nor in government who asks whether this is 
an announcement that should be made by the minister to 
parliament. It is time for the House to draw a line in this 
regard.  I think that everyone in this place would agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, two days ago, in response to pleas from the 
opposition House leader, you admonished the fact that there were 
alleged leaks.  You quite properly appealed to members at that 
time to respect this House.  You said:  “The best place for 
announcements is here in this House, where we are.  This is where 
they should be made”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation is very much akin to the situation you were 
dealing with at that time.  It is very similar.  This is a 
ministerial announcement.  The place for this to have been made 
is here in this Chamber.  I would suggest there is not a member 
here who would disagree with that.  The minister of public works 
is dealing with a very important situation at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, yesterday I attended two meetings at which you and 
other House officers were present.  We met at the Board of 
Internal Economy.  We met with respect to a situation that had 
arisen in the Chamber coming out of question period.  I would 
wager that you as Speaker were not aware that this ministerial 
statement was taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of this place we are entitled in the first instance 
to hear in this Chamber of such important matters.  Are we not 
members of this place?  Do we not deserve that respect?  I am 
certain that if other members had been aware of this announcement 
there may have been reference to it.  There may have been 
reference to it at the informal meeting we held in your office, 
yet there was none.  Obviously the government was aware while 
opposition members were not aware. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple fact is that the minister of public works has 
attempted to avoid the House of Commons on this issue.  There is 
good reason for that.  It is becoming plainly obvious to everyone 
that there are serious problems with this project and the budget 
that has been attached to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister may try to play tough guy with the public servants, 
but we are watching him.  This is an abrogation of ministerial 
responsibility.  The minister obviously does not want to listen 
to the responses of the opposition parties and it is well known 
that he brooks no opposition.  Just ask the public servants who 
were hung out to dry by the minister before the examination by 
the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament we have an obligation to discharge and 
the place to do that is here in the House.  We cannot effectively 
do so if the ministry is systematically avoiding coming into this 
House to enter into parliamentary dialogue and exchange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been patient with the government and we have tried to 
make this place work, although there have been times when it has 
stumbled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public works minister seems to think this place is a museum. 
He calls this place a heritage asset.  But we are here as an 
asset ourselves to parliament.  Although I am not one content to 
sit on the shelf while the minister of public works runs 
roughshod over the House of Commons, I suggest that this is an 
insult and that he owes it to this place to consult and he owes 
it to this House to make announcements in this place if it is to 
truly be respected.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The particular museum piece is through with passive acceptance 
of the norms of the last parliament.  We are signalling that this 
is unacceptable and we invite other members to participate in 
this question of privilege and to join in this fight to assert 
that the authority of this House is to be respected, not only by 
the opposition but by government members as well.  Ministers have 
a duty to this place and to those who use this building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not alone in suffering the attack of the spin doctors. 
Your colleague in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, 
Speaker Betty Boothroyd, has repeatedly stated:  “When there is 
a major change of policy, a statement should first be made in the 
House”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am mindful of citation 352 of Beauchesne's and I 
am not arguing that there has been a breach of privilege per se, 
but I do argue that there is contempt of the House.  I would ask 
you to reserve your decision on this point in order that you may 
consider the consequences of allowing this conduct to continue 
and to continue unchallenged by the Chair and by the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have we reached the day when this House is so weak willed that 
we will allow this to occur?  Surely that cannot be the case. The 
time has come for parliamentary assertion of respect, not only 
for the physical premises, not only for these buildings that the 
minister of public works seeks to remedy and to fix, but respect 
for the members and all of the rights and privileges that flow 
from this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, there is a remedy that goes beyond a simple 
admonition from the Chair and I ask you to find that there is a 
prima facie circumstance to permit consideration by the House of 
a motion instructing the minister of public works to make a 
statement in the House, fully outlining the government's 
intention with respect to the restoration of the parliamentary 
precinct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, this is a request that a statement be made in the 
House and that perhaps the Speaker also consider issuing an 
admonition and that the minister apologize.  If you are prepared 
to permit this motion, I would move that that take place and that 
we refer the matter to a committee, if that is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the time has come and I believe, in respect to you, 
that you took a step in that direction yesterday by bringing the 
House leaders together and looking for solutions that will 
improve the way this Chamber works.  I am appealing to you on 
this matter.  This is not the first time this has happened. In 
fact it has become the norm in parliament that ministerial 
statements are made at the press gallery and not on the floor of 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a new member of this Chamber, but in the short time that I 
have been here I have seen this trend continue and I find it 
absolutely insulting, not only to members of the House but to the 
Canadian people.  Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate your 
consideration of this point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to rise on the same question of privilege that the hon. 
member opposite has raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the context of what he said that I wish to address the 
House.  In particular, it is the pattern that is being developed 
that I find a little disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that there has been more than one breach of the 
privileges that ought to be observed for members of parliament. 
We are here to represent the people and to represent the best 
interests of the people, and also to be judicious in the way in 
which public funds are spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the minister announced was in direct agreement with what 
the auditor general announced two days before.  He asked that 
such an advisory board be established.  That advisory board was 
suggested many years before.  In 1992 a similar suggestion was 
made by the auditor general and nothing was done.  To the extent 
that the minister is doing what the auditor general suggested 
should be done, that is fine.  I do not disagree with that.  But 
I do disagree with the fact that he took away the privilege of 
letting members know what the government is doing in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not dealing with a $100 million expenditure.  According 
to the auditor general's figure, we are dealing with a number of 
$1.4 billion.  Reparations to the parliamentary precinct were 
originally approved, if my memory is correct, at about $250 
million.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, projects worth $423 million have been approved.  Not 
all of that money has been spent, but the projects have been 
approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the minister appeared before the committee and 
suggested that there would be considerable additional 
expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the auditor general has said, upon examining the issue, that 
it is going to be $1.4 billion.  That is no small amount.  That 
this group should now act as an advisory board I think is a good 
thing.  However, the minister should have made the announcement 
here in this House.  That is the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of days ago the House leader for the official 
opposition said that there are leaks happening in the committees. 
He does not like those leaks taking place and neither do I.  I am 
sure, Mr. Speaker, that you do not like what is happening.  In 
fact, you expressed yourself to that effect and I commend you for 
doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before that we had the Minister for International Trade 
announcing the creation of a Canada-China parliamentary 
association before parliament had even created it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government appointed Mr. Landry to the millennium 
scholarship foundation at a time when there was no legislation 
before the House to set up the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a similar case with the Canadian Wheat Board.  Once 
again the government began implementing measures before the 
measures were approved by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise these issues because there is a pattern developing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this parliament began, the government set up a CPP board 
before the legislation authorizing this board was adopted by 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker said on November 6, 1997 that “the dismissive view 
of the legislative process, repeated often enough, makes a 
mockery of our parliamentary conventions and practices”. 
That is the issue that I wish to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sole source contracts that were addressed by the auditor 
general is another issue.  There were $4.4 billion in sole 
source contracts and 85% of them— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think we are getting away from the 
question of privilege.  However, I am getting the drift of what 
the hon. member is driving at and I will allow him to summarize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in summary, the point I 
am trying to make is that every minister ought to honour this 
House and give to this House information concerning a change of 
policy or a change in direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a major shift for the minister of public works to say that 
the parliamentary precinct will now have, as a co-ordinating 
body, a group of people from outside this parliament to advise 
the minister.  He should have said that in this House.  That is 
my point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
very briefly on this question of privilege, we should make a 
point of not confusing this question of privilege with other 
things that have arisen in the House lately with respect to the 
leaking of committee reports or the whole question of decorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing this is related to that has come up in recent 
days is the matter of more business being done in the House where 
it should properly done.  In that sense it is related to things 
that have come up in previous days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly want to agree that this kind of announcement 
should have been made in the House.  I want to make that point in 
the context of the larger argument that more ministerial policy 
announcements should be made in the House.  I would reinforce 
that general point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nature of this announcement had to do with the parliamentary 
precinct itself.  It seems to me that it would have been a 
perfect example of something that should have been announced here 
in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was announced outside the House without any foreknowledge, 
that I am aware of, either on the part of the Chair or others who 
are concerned about this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without breaching any confidences, I am aware of meetings that 
went on yesterday in which people were discussing this very 
thing:  the relationship between parliament and public works and 
what was going on here on the hill, et cetera.  Then, all of a 
sudden, we read in the paper that the minister of public works 
had made an announcement and did not even make it in the House 
where there would have been an opportunity to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this raises again, Mr. Speaker, whether or not you find 
that there is a question of privilege with respect to the whole 
question of the continuing inadequacy of the relationship between 
parliament and public works and the general lack of direction, 
lack of overall planning and lack of overall accountability for 
what happens here in the parliamentary precinct.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would call the House back to recommendations that were made in 
1985 by the McGrath committee, the special committee on the 
reform of the House of Commons in which we called at that time 
for the establishment of a parliamentary intendant.  That was the 
phrase we used.  It was somewhat along the lines of the 
congressional architect, which is what they have in the United 
States in Washington, D.C.  It is someone who is over both 
houses, over the congressional precinct and accountable to both 
houses, someone who could be the focus of decision making and 
planning for the parliamentary precinct including both houses, 
the hill, offices, et cetera.  We do not have that now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a continuing problem with both the media and the public 
trying to find out who is really responsible for the decisions 
that are made about what is going to be renovated, how much it 
will cost and what is the long term plan.  They do not know 
whether it is public works, the Senate or the House of Commons. 
Frankly sometimes we do not seem to know ourselves.  We as 
members of parliament read about things in the papers, decisions 
that have been taken somewhere else, and we have to answer for 
them when it comes to public works and the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should be one more occasion for the House to get its act 
together and try to clean up the confusion that exists with 
respect to the various roles of the House and public works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also reinforce the point, as I have whenever I get the chance, 
that more announcements should be made in the House.  I feel that 
this announcement should have been made in the House.  There 
should have been more consultation with the appropriate members 
of parliament and the appropriate bodies within parliament before 
such an announcement was made.  We should not have had to find 
out about this by reading the papers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this would not be a question of 
privilege in any case.  If it would have been a point of 
anything, which it was not, it would have been a point of order 
in reference to perhaps Standing Order 33(1) which relates to 
when ministers can make statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring this to the attention of the Chair.  This has nothing to 
do with a question of privilege, and I will get into that later. 
Standing Order 33(1) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Statements by Ministers, as listed in Standing Order 30(3), a 
Minister of the Crown may make a short factual announcement or 
statement of government policy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This standing order says that it is optional for the minister to 
make it and in areas of government policy, presumably important 
enough areas, to make the announcement on the floor of the House, 
again remembering the issue “may make”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning we heard accusations against the hon. Minister of 
Public Works and Deputy Government Leader in the House, in his 
absence.  The minister is here every day, as we all know.  As a 
matter of fact he consults regularly with all of us.  He is a 
member of the Board of Internal Economy.  He accepted to sit on 
that board at my request so that he could be in greater contact 
with all of us because of the important ongoing renovations on 
the Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He frequently attends, although not always as it is difficult 
for ministers to be several places at once, the Board of Internal 
Economy meetings and liaises very closely with House of Commons 
staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we have before us today the following proposition 
raised by a Reform MP.  Should or should not the minister of 
public works have adhered to a recommendation made by another 
officer of parliament, namely the auditor general?  That is 
exactly what he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general, an officer of parliament, made a 
recommendation in the House two days ago and the minister 
responded to it yesterday.  There are approximately 200 pages to 
the auditor general's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that mean that every minister who responded yesterday to 
the auditor general's report should have tabled or made a 
statement in the House of Commons?  That is an absurd 
proposition.  Even if it were true on a very major change of 
government policy, should that have been the case for the 
minister appointing an advisory council for himself? 
This is an advisory council to the minister of public works to 
assist him in his work.

individual ministers, we will have to make statements in the 
House according to what the House leader of the Conservative 
Party has just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that you wait, Mr. Speaker, until tomorrow to render a 
decision.  The Chair might find out later today that all this is 
a prelude to a press conference which others want to make later 
today in order to question the expenditures of the renovations of 
the Hill and so on, and has nothing to do with a question of 
privilege or a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were a betting man, I would bet right now there will be a 
press conference later today.  Maybe a senator by the name of 
Marjory LeBreton is organizing the press conference that is to be 
held later today.  Maybe it has everything to do with that and 
nothing to do with a point of order on the floor of the House, 
much less a question of privilege.  That is what I submit to Your 
Honour.  There are issues— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What a charade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I want to hear information on this question 
of privilege specifically.  I do not want members to get into a 
debate.  The hon. government House leader will probably summarize 
for us quite soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me summarize.  There 
is this morning a very important issue that involves the 
privileges of the House and I wish it would be raised by members 
of parliament, instead of doing what we are now.

access to a journalist to part of the precincts reserved for 
members of parliament.  It was on the front page of newspapers 
today.  It undermined everyone here and no one is raising 
anything about that matter today.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will hear one final intervention on the 
question of privilege. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
just have a couple of comments.  I believe we are getting into a 
bit of debate here which is not around the privilege issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of points I would like to answer which the 
government House leader brought to our attention.  One is that 
although we can indeed question the minister any time he is in 
the House, the difficulty is that if someone feels there is a 
question of privilege we must raise it at the earliest possible 
moment.  The government House leader knows that this is the 
earliest possible moment.  I think it is appropriate that it is 
brought forward now and I await your decision on it, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing inappropriate about bringing it forward now. If 
we had waited—who knows when the minister might be here—two or 
three days to bring it forward it would be out of order just 
because of lateness.  I think it is entirely in order to bring it 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is somewhat different from most ministerial announcements 
because it potentially deals with the privileges of members.  We 
see in the newspaper articles today that it may affect the 
location of members' offices, especially those of backbenchers. 
It may affect access to which buildings are to be used by 
committees and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises the concern level of backbench MPs.  Some members 
might say that the last time they talked to their representatives 
on the board they thought there was to be another way of handling 
the issue of who looks after the precincts of the Hill, who will 
be giving directions to the architects and who will be overseeing 
the minister's works so that it is not just a public works 
project or indeed renovations, work and costs riding herd on the 
availability of computer services and all that sort of thing. Who 
is looking after it on behalf of members of parliament?  It is 
certainly not the minister.  It is the board.  Perhaps there 
should be an oversight committee of parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as a final point, I remind the Speaker that on other 
occasions when things are announced in the press I believe the 
Speaker has already ruled that it is a trend we must be concerned 
with.  It is not just one incident in and of itself.  It is kind 
of like language in question period.  It is not just the one 
incident.  It is what happens over the course of time.  Backbench 
MPs may ask whether they are really relevant, whether they are 
important or whether parliament is important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue that this case is another one of a trend of ministers 
making statements that affect members of parliament.  Then we 
read about it in the papers and we do not have input.  It is a 
concern because of a trend, not just the one isolated incident.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I have been asked to reserve on this 
matter but I will not.  I will make a ruling now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that this is not a question of privilege, but I find it 
extremely regrettable that certain ministerial statements are 
made outside the House.  I, on a few occasions now, and my 
predecessors have recommended that the government be more 
respectful of the House.  However, perhaps there is a change to 
be made in the rules of the House because there is nothing in the 
rules of the House that allow me to enforce such a ruling.  As 
regrettable as some members find these events to be, there is no 
contempt until and unless the House as a body gives authority to 
the Speaker to enforce something like this on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case was brought up by the hon. member before.  What is 
involved are the parliamentary precincts.  This is a little 
different from any other thing.  Most of the interveners today 
are members of the Board of Internal Economy.  It is my view that 
this matter should be brought up at the Board of Internal Economy 
because it deals with the parliamentary precincts.  I am sure the 
hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough will have ample 
opportunity to put his views to this particular board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, if there is a trend continuing like the one of my 
sister speaker in the United Kingdom, unless and until there is a 
specific order of the House this can be done, as you all know, by 
introduction perhaps through the procedural committee.  I make 
that as a suggestion, but at the very least it should be brought 
up because it falls within the purview of the authority of the 
Board of Internal Economy.

Chamber so those who wish to debate can remain here and do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House and make a few 
comments on this bill to establish the customs and revenue 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation creates a national revenue collecting agency, 
the Canada customs and revenue agency, to replace Revenue Canada. 
The CCRA transforms Revenue Canada into a quasi-independent tax 
agency to take over the collection of personal and corporate 
income tax, provincial sales tax, the goods and services tax, 
customs duties and excise taxes on gasoline and alcohol levies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some provincial finance ministers have shown interest in this 
single tax collecting agency but they have not committed to 
participating.  Certain provinces are asking for greater 
flexibility in this tax policy which is an issue not directly 
related to the Canada customs and revenue agency. Sometimes 
caution is one of the better ways to go with an agency of this 
magnitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A possible condition for Reform support would be a strong 
taxpayer bill of rights.  Any taxpayer bill of rights would 
include a very clear statement on the accountability of the 
agency and a reinforcement of ministerial responsibility through 
an independent ombudsman and an office for taxpayer protection. 
Having an independent ombudsman would be the direction to go on 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims the agency should save the taxpayer some 
administration costs.  The projected estimates of savings run 
between $97 million and $162 million.  That is quite a savings 
provided that the projected efficiencies are built in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency would facilitate integration of tax information and 
reporting systems thereby improving the prospect of single window 
reporting and reducing the paper burden on small and medium size 
businesses.  This is something businesses and farmers have been 
asking for for years.  They have been asking for a simpler tax 
form and a simpler way of computing tax so they can better 
understand the regulations and how taxes are computed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the agency will be set up kind of throws up a red flag. 
It will have a board comprised of 15 directors.  The chair and 
two directors will be selected by the federal government.  This 
is similar to the set up of the Canadian Wheat Board for the time 
being. 
The other 11 directors would also be appointed by governor in 
council with input from the provinces which is a good idea. I 
could support that as long as these positions did not become more 
or less political plums.  So often that is the case.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One very good example is the Manitoba Freshwater Fish Marketing 
Board.  We have seen the appointment of a chairman being so 
political that in the end the friction which developed in the 
board resulted in the chairman having to resign from his 
position.  This is something we want to prevent in these types of 
government quasi-judicial at a distance organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada clients are looking for more streamlined 
services, improved response times and the reduction in the paper 
burden associated with compliance for tax, trade and customs 
transactions.  They want faster service that is easier to access 
and which is more responsive to their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What taxpayers and people who deal with this organization want 
most is accountability and a fair system which a lot of taxpayers 
feel is not there.  The conditions attached to the revenue 
collected in payroll taxes and GST seem to indicate that people 
are not treated equally and fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An independent ombudsman is a must.  We certainly do not want to 
create an agency that appears to be similar in power to the IRS 
in the United States.  That has created a lot of problems by 
false or improper taxation.  It has also led to people serving 
jail sentences that should never have been imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I worried about this organization being accountable and 
responding to the taxpayer as well as to government?  I have a 
couple of examples of what I have run into during the last year 
or two as a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year ago I was informed that a businessmen in a neighbouring 
town had a severe problem.  A day or two before Christmas his and 
his wife's accounts had been frozen due to what Revenue Canada 
felt were irregularities.  Imagine what kind of stress this put 
on the businessman during a period of celebration when people are 
happy and family come home to spend a joyful Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The businessman contacted me after Christmas to explain what had 
happened.  I was astounded that a person could be put into this 
type of position.  He had contracted to build a place of 
business, a manufacturing plant.  The people who signed the 
contract with him had not fulfilled their commitment.  They had 
cancelled some of the building project.  He was stuck with a 
contract where he owed payroll taxes and GST, but he had never 
completed the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had submitted $14,000 to an account so that Revenue Canada 
could re-evaluate the payroll taxes and other benefits it felt 
were delinquent.  When this became known, Revenue Canada quickly 
backtracked on the type of service the taxpayer had received and 
the account was settled under very reasonable conditions. 
But the stress and fear in this businessman were unbelievable. 
The personal tragedy of it was that he spent a Christmas worrying 
about what would happen to his business, not what other business 
people were encountering.

revenue and customs laid charges against him and fined him.  He 
appealed and won that case.  The government appealed it and lost 
but revenue and customs are still prosecuting other farmers under 
the same conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the democracy Canadians expect from the government. 
This is the type of democracy we hear about in third world 
countries where the government is the sole authority and does as 
it pleases.  This is why people in Canada are very hesitant to 
give an agency the power that the Canada customs and revenue 
agency will receive under this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to start off by deploring the time limit that has been set on 
our debate, courtesy of the government party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This procedure is termed a gag order because it limits our 
ability to pursue debate and exchanges on a bill. When a gag is 
imposed, it prevents us as parliamentarians from continuing the 
exchange on matters of great importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is little opposition to a bill, when we reach 
agreement promptly, when a bill is well put together and when 
everything appears to be in order, we make interventions in 
order to make some improvements, and then, relatively promptly, 
the debate leads to its logical conclusion, which is unanimous 
passage of the bill or, more often, its passage following a 
division to settle the outstanding points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a bill is more sensitive and more complicated, and when the 
positions of the various parties with something to say on the 
bill are harder to reconcile, then we need more time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some reason, the government deems it preferable to prevent 
us from continuing debate in an attempt to bring the various 
positions closer together and to find acceptable compromises. 
The government prefers to impose a gag order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the outcome be?  We will end up with a bill on which 
there will be a division, while considerable dissent still 
remains and consensus has not been reached, or in other words a 
bill that will be passed, despite its being badly put together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an affront to our democratic principles.  It is an affront 
to the quality of work that should come out of this House and, 
finally, it is an affront to the public's right to the best 
legislation possible in Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the situation we are facing.  This bill was not 
unanimously received, quite the contrary, and we oppose it for a 
number of real and significant reasons.  Rather than try to 
compromise or to align positions, the government, it seems, is 
insisting on its own position, will not budge, will not 
compromise. That is why it is imposing closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should now, because we have a limited time, simply reiterate 
our positions in the knowledge—and note how frustrating it 
is—that the government will not budge one iota on the bill 
before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is frustrating to know that, despite our efforts, our 
recommendations, our research and our concerns, the government 
is turning a deaf ear, preferring to stop discussions and have 
the bill passed.  Naturally, since the government has a 
majority, it knows it can impose its bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons does not exist for the government to impose 
bills.  A government that respects the opposition does not 
impose bills. 
The government is making a mistake, because this is an important 
bill affecting everyone.  One day, it will realize that there 
will indeed be the negative effects we predicted, and the public 
will let the government know just what it thinks in an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago, in the last parliament, the Bloc Quebecois, the 
NDP and the other opposition parties accurately predicted the 
adverse effects of the employment insurance reform.  We put our 
finger on its major flaws, which would end up depriving people 
of the income they need when they lose their jobs.  We predicted 
the adverse effects of the reform on the dynamics of the labour 
market and on the employment situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pointed all this out.  Two years later, it is obvious we were 
right.  The minister and government of the day took no notice of 
our objections and made no attempt to incorporate our 
suggestions for improvement into the bill.  Since the 
legislation has been in effect, hundreds of thousands of people 
have been hurt by the major flaws in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not one government minister would set foot in an airplane thrown 
together the way the House sometimes throws its bills together.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us is ill-drafted.  If it were an airplane, it 
would never get off the ground.  But it is proposed legislation, 
and the government is determined that it will fly, with 
predictable results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still ordinary folks who will have to defend 
themselves against this unjust and inefficient legislation, who 
will have to prove that they are right.  Worse still, even if 
they are right, if the law says they are wrong, then it is the 
law that will apply regardless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that the bill before us wants to 
concentrate tax collection in one agency that is, to all intents 
and purposes, independent of the minister. 
It is a bill that separates tax collection in Canada from our 
responsibility as parliamentarians.  This is a serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is serious because, the day something goes wrong in this 
agency, we will rise in the House and question the Minister of 
Revenue.  We will tell him that there is such and such a problem 
that should be corrected. Like all the other ministers hiding 
behind commissions and agencies, the minister will tell us that 
the agency in question is an independent body, with its own 
problem-solving mechanisms, and that it is able to take care of 
matters itself.  He will tell us that there is a complaints 
commission and that we should butt out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a bill like this, it is not the opposition the government 
is telling to butt out, it is the poor population of Canada. The 
problem is that the responsibility of parliament for an 
important agency in charge of tax collection is being removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old principle “No taxation without representation”. 
To confer on an organization operating almost at arm's length 
from parliament the power, duty and means to collect our taxes 
is certainly stretching this principle to the limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go one step further. In Quebec, we have our own 
department of revenue. 
My question to the government is this: Since the social union 
project to allow a province to opt out of a federal government 
program is now on the table and will be in the coming weeks the 
subject of further debate between the provincial premiers and 
the federal government, could and should Quebec not opt out of 
this project to have tax collected by an outside agency and 
collect both provincial taxes and all federal taxes and then, 
through the Quebec revenue department, send taxes collected on 
behalf of Canada to the Minister of Finance? The Quebec revenue 
department already does it, with great success and efficiency, 
for the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I am running out of time, I want to say that I appreciate 
having had this opportunity to express my views. 
I hope the government will consider withdrawing this bill 
forthwith.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-43, an act to 
establish the Canada customs and revenue agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a rare honour to witness a government bill that we believe 
is moving in the right direction.  I am pleased to see that Bill 
C-43 may reduce tax collection, administration and compliance 
costs, particularly if the provinces decide to opt in. My 
understanding at this time is that there is some interest by the 
provinces in these revisions.  However, none of them has yet made 
any kind of formal commitment.  Let us hope we can get them on 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporations, businesses and individuals alike will be pleased 
that they will no longer have to deal with a plethora of 
agencies.  By focusing the tax collection needs with the Canada 
customs and revenue agency, overall costs should be reduced. I 
believe all Canadians would be in favour of reducing the cost of 
government and its associated departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I believe there are some significant steps forward in this 
bill, there is a a lack of autonomous accountability in both the 
existing and the proposed bills.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed role of the agency is to be responsible to the 
Minister of National Revenue.  I believe we can do better than 
this.  When we deal with taxpayer money individuals want to be 
assured there is full accountability and redress if and whenever 
necessary.  If we want to upset someone we can be successful by 
telling him or her that they owe the government X number of 
dollars and that their options for disagreement are limited. 
This is true of people whether they be small business owners, 
corporations or individual taxpayers. Financial accountability is 
very important to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is very much in favour of a cost efficient use 
of Canadian taxpayer dollars.  This is one of our basic 
principles.  It is a grassroots principle that remains very 
important to all our constituents and to all Canadians.  The 
inefficient use and waste of tax dollars may be seen in many 
different examples at almost every level of government today. 
Citizens are always pleased to hear of positive changes and 
improvements to the government's use of their financial 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What appears to be lacking in the proposed revisions in an 
accountability process for the taxpayers.  We have heard it said 
already today but I believe there should be in place a taxpayer 
bill of rights.  Why would we need a taxpayer bill of rights? The 
answer may be seen in a letter I received from a constituent who 
had difficulties with Revenue Canada. I will read his letter for 
members and see if they do not agree that a multitude of problems 
exist with this situation.  The letter is dated August 27, 1998, 
addressed to the hon. Minister of Finance: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am writing you this letter because I have run into a problem 
with Revenue Canada which I hope you can help me with, as I feel 
you may have inadvertently caused this. Approximately 4 years ago 
when the Liberal Party first came into power, you and [the Prime 
Minister] requested the Canadian public to check their income tax 
for possible mistakes, as the country was severally in debt and 
could use any extra income it could find to help pay off the 
debt. If there were mistakes found there would be no penalties 
charged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I had never filled out my income tax, I felt that this 
would be an excellent opportunity to have the company who always 
does my taxes checked out.  So I requested Revenue Canada audit 4 
years of my taxes.  They found one error and charged $700.00. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then took this information to my tax preparation company, who 
admitted to the error, however, there was supposed to be a 
deduction from the $700.00 which Revenue Canada had not credited 
to my account, which would have reduced this amount by $350.00, 
leaving a balance owing of $350.00 which I paid.  It seems that 
even Revenue Canada can make errors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I returned to Revenue Canada to inform them that they had made 
an error and stated what my tax prep person had told me.  I then 
received a phone call from a lady from Revenue Canada.  She 
informed me that Revenue Canada only gave one free audit and that 
they had decided that my penalty would be $350.00, the exact 
figure of the error that Revenue Canada had made, so that would 
leave me owing another $350.00. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I phoned Revenue Canada in Victoria to complain.  I was then 
informed by a gentleman from Victoria that “If I was stupid 
enough to request an audit then I got what I deserved”.  I was 
really angry after that.  I went to my Liberal member of 
parliament for my riding and complained about the whole 
situation.  I was told they would look into the situation. After 
3 months when I returned to his office, they stated that they 
were unable to help.  The only way that they could see (a 
solution) would be to write to the appeals office in Victoria, 
which I did. I then sat waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I informed the MP's office that I wanted to take this to the 
media as I did not want to see anyone else get shafted.  They 
stated I should wait and see (what) would happen as they were 
sure that things would be straightened out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I waited a year and the only thing that changed was the balance 
owing to Revenue Canada, as I had refused to pay this penalty. I 
returned to my MP's office and they stated that they would see 
what happened.  I was informed a month later that the appeals 
office (had) never received the information from them and I 
should write you first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, an election was called and I did not feel that this 
would be an appropriate time for you to look into this or (for 
me) to go to the media. 
Now that the election is over and everything is settled in, I 
would like you to again look into this matter. I now see that 
Revenue Canada has a program for doing personal income tax.  With 
the problem I have had with Revenue Canada, I would not recommend 
anyone have Revenue Canada do their income tax and then charge 
them a penalty.  They would have no recourse and be stuck in the 
same position that I am in, as I would go to court before I would 
pay this penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been disabled now for the past two years and have not been 
able to work.  I now do not have the money to fight this in 
court, so I would have to go public and ask for money to fight 
this penalty, which I feel was unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would you look into this as they have taken my last GST 
cheque and the interest is mounting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you,

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we would all agree this case would make anyone angry and 
very untrustworthy of the tax system. I am thankful and hopeful 
that not every tax situation is like this one.  However, even one 
case is one too many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A taxpayer bill of rights would ensure that Mr. Gravonic and 
people like him would have recourse within the system rather than 
spending hard earned dollars on court appeals.  In order to be 
effective, the taxpayer bill of rights must include several key 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers must be able to read and understand the tax laws in 
plain language terms.  Legal double talk only confuses the 
situation. Taxpayers must be treated professionally and with 
courtesy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers must have a recourse method that allows them to 
complain about service and treatment that is below standard. This 
process must allow the taxpayer the right to move up the 
seniority roster and be heard by a senior official and in turn 
their superior if the answer is not satisfactory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers need the right to only pay the amount of tax due, no 
more, no less. Taxpayers need to know what any collected 
information will be used for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When dealing with the proposed Canada customs and revenue 
agency, taxpayers need the opportunity to represent themselves or 
to have someone represent them through any dispute resolution 
process.  Those people who are in dispute with the CCRA need the 
opportunity to record any meetings. All disputed claimants need 
the right to appeal first administratively and then, if 
necessary, legally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When taxpayers have acted in good faith and without any 
intention to evade, the proposed CCRA shall waive penalties and 
interest.  In cases where reassessments will cause severe and 
undue hardships, alternative repayment methods shall be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed CCRA will be entitled to seize or freeze assets 
when fraud and/or evasion is suspected, but only when the CCRA 
can show why such action should be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a long list but I believe they are all necessary.  They 
will only be strong when there is an autonomous office willing 
and able to stand up and support them.  This office needs to be 
an independent voice for the Canadian taxpayer which will 
represent and fully support the interests of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This office should be set up as an independent voice of the 
taxpayer, an office for taxpayer protection that represents the 
interests of the Canadian taxpayer. I see this office being set 
up similar to the role of the auditor general, a role that would 
report annually to parliament on the status of taxpayer and CCRA 
relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we need a taxpayer bill of rights in conjunction with the 
changes proposed by Bill C-43?  I believe so.  I believe that the 
53,500 taxpayers who filed appeals and objections last year all 
believe we need such a process in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the above reasons I find that unfortunately at this point I 
must oppose Bill C-43 unless the government commits to passing 
the taxpayer bill of rights with an office for taxpayer 
protection. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to join my Bloc 
Quebecois colleagues in telling the government why we, on this 
side of the House, are opposed to Bill C-43. 
There are four reasons for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will list them, then comment on each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the establishment of this revenue collection agency is, 
in my opinion, an abdication of political power. 
Second, the establishment of the agency is also an admission of 
powerlessness on the part of the minister. Third, I believe it 
is an anti-union measure. Fourth and last, but not the least, it 
reflects the centralizing vision of the Liberal government 
opposite. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT18"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT18"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1210

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I call this an abdication of the political power? Because, 
given the wording of the bill establishing this agency, the 
minister will now be able to hide behind the agency and say it 
is the agency's staff, not the minister, that is responsible for 
any wrongdoing, thus leaving it up to the agency to face the 
music. 
At the political level, we will no longer be able to question 
the minister in the House regarding any problem. I heard the 
Reform Party member mention one such problem earlier. Clearly, 
we must protect and, more importantly, maintain the principle of 
accountability to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also said the minister was powerless. I have always of him as 
a nice guy, because I have worked with him on other issues in 
the past. But, on the face of it, when I read the bill, I 
realized he is the only person I know who wants to fire his 
whole staff. He will not have anyone left, except perhaps his 
chauffeur. Why, then, should we keep the minister? Is the 
government telling us that we will no longer have a minister 
responsible for this issue? All this indicates that no one will 
be accountable in the House any longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also feel this initiative is an anti-union measure. 
I must remind hon. members that the public servants involved in 
customs or tax collections account for about 20% of the entire 
Canadian public service, one-fifth.  With one fell swoop, with 
passage of this bill, one-fifth of the federal public service 
would no longer be public servants, they would be employees of 
the agency instead.  They would then be subject to whatever new 
rules the agency felt like imposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some problems with the centralizing view of the 
government, because the intention in establishing such an agency 
is “to collect taxes from all Canadians”. Provincial taxes were 
also mentioned.  The bill even states that contracts could be 
signed with municipalities and other organizations. This is 
really wanting to grab the whole pie, slamming the door so no 
one else can get any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have trouble with all this talk of establishing agencies.  The 
Liberals tell us it will simplify things and avoid duplication, 
but it seems that those two words are synonymous for them.  By 
wishing to simplify things, they will create duplication.  For 
example, if this agency wanted to collect all of the GST and the 
TVQ, these are already rolled together in Quebec, and collected 
by Quebec. So what, exactly, are they up to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time the Liberals over there speak of harmonization, it is 
synonymous with interference.  They end up with their  hands in 
the pockets of individuals, provinces and municipalities.  This 
business of the social union is proof of this, as they are 
saying “We might give you part of it back, provided you meet 
certain criteria, ours”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the other provinces and the municipalities will not 
blindly fall into the trap of this new agency the government is 
creating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of this agency will remove its employees from the 
application of the Public Service Staff Relations Act.  In 
addition, the agency will be removed from the application of the 
Access to Information Act, the Privacy Act and the Official 
Languages Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that this is certainly not the case.  So if all this 
changes nothing, why create this agency at all?  We are told “It 
is to modernize the Canadian public service”.  “Modernize” is 
synonymous with “privatize” in the mouths of the Liberals.  It 
is becoming a bit annoying.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the word “privatize” frightens and bothers me.  I will 
give an example.  The Canada Post Corporation used to report to 
the government.  It was privatized.  Shortly before or after we 
were elected, Canada Post bought another private company, 
Purolator.  So this means possible amalgamation.  The government 
still talks of mail or equipment delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government perhaps contemplating an amalgamation 
involving this agency?  Does this mean that, following 
privatization, the agency would be in a position to decide what 
it wants and could decide to buy H & R Block, a company that 
helps people prepare their tax returns?  Could we expect the 
agency responsible for collecting to also be the one preparing 
the returns? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope those on the other side of the House will be able to say 
this is not the case.  However, in many cases, and I could point 
to a number of examples, some of which involve the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans, the government annoyingly wants to be both 
judge and jury.  That is not a very good thing for Canadian 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to speak briefly to clauses 15, 22 and 25.  I 
also have a point to make about clause 30.  More specifically, 
clauses 15, 22 and 25 provide for its operation, with a board of 
15 directors. 
Of course, these 15 persons will be appointed by the governor in 
council. The public must understand that what this really means 
is that they will be appointed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will the government appoint? Its friends of course, defeated 
candidates. These jobs are for a term of five years, and 
renewable to boot. This will make for a comfortable retirement 
to look forward to for some members opposite. The former 
solicitor general may want to look into this. We shall see; the 
future will tell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under clause 30.(1), the agency has decisional authority over 
its organization and general administrative policy. Basically, 
it will have control over all matters relating to organization, 
real property and personnel management, including the 
determination of the terms and conditions of employment. 
What does this mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of privatization, budget restraint and 
streamlining, should the employees who are declared surplus and 
probably have to take the jobs they are offered in the new 
agency already expect a salary cut? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not clear. The Liberals across the way never tell us 
about the nasty tricks they are about to pull. We have to be 
able to read between the lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid that they might not only cut the salaries of those 
working for this agency but at the same time increase the 
salaries of those running it. 
Will future directors or vice-presidents of this agency want 
their salaries to match those of their counterparts in a major 
bank, because they handle roughly the same amount of business? 
Is salary inflation to be expected? I am afraid so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I have noticed some consistency in the way the 
people opposite approach privatization. They started by 
privatizing postal services; this was done a long time ago. But 
under this government, railways, ports and airports have been 
privatized. Now they are talking about establishing a tax 
collection agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My message to the rest of Canada is this: Is Canada being put up 
for sale piece by piece? All the symbols on which this country 
was built—ports, airports, railways, and now tax collection—are 
being privatized and sold off one by one. This is the conclusion 
I leave my friends from the rest of Canada to ponder.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-43 shows that what the government has in mind is a long term 
project, of which this bill is but one step, the third one if I 
am not mistaken. To illustrate my point, I will refer to the 
establishment of two other independent agencies, ADM, the 
Montreal airports administration, and Nav Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43 seeks to establish the Canada customs and revenue 
agency, which will enjoy, under an illusory control, the 
excessive and even kingly power to collect taxes. It is a power 
that, until now, was the state's exclusive prerogative, although 
there was a time when such was not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the middle ages, until the 14th or 15th century, there 
was in Europe an institution called farmers general. These 
individuals were despised by the public, because they were 
mandated by the king to collect taxes. So, we are going back to 
the middle ages in this area. This is clearly a step backwards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a word about ADM, because of the obvious 
similarities between that agency and the one that the government 
wants to establish now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>ADM was given the power to manage Montreal's airports, without 
any government control. Seven people decided the future of 
Dorval and Mirabel airports. We all remember ADM's decision to 
transfer international flights from Mirabel to Dorval. So, seven 
individuals were given the power make a decision that turned out 
to be disastrous for a region of Canada called the greater 
Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, I asked a question about this in the House and was 
told that it was not the minister's responsibility, that it was 
up to ADM.  In other words, the minister told me he was washing 
his hands of the whole affair, in this case Mirabel airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nav Canada, which is responsible for navigation aids, was 
another similar creation.  It too is almost completely 
autonomous.  If Nav Canada were to decide tomorrow—and it 
could—to shut down a control tower, and we were to ask the 
minister about it, the minister could easily tell us that it was 
up to Nav Canada, not him, and that he was washing his hands of 
the whole affair, so to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency is more of the same.  It 
is part of a deliberate and long-term plan by the government, 
which is once again creating an agency behind which it can hide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From airport management and navigation aids, we have moved on to 
tax collection.  In creating these agencies, the government is 
looking for two benefits.  The first is to be able to reward its 
political friends with plum jobs not governed by public service 
pay rules.  The second is to create a buffer zone from which the 
government can safely blame the agency for anything that 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is scandalous, but I am objective enough to point out that 
there is one benefit to creating this agency, and that is that 
it will provide one more argument in convincing Quebeckers that 
there is only one way out of this rotten regime and that is 
sovereignty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak at this stage of 
Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has expressed constructive opposition to this 
bill from the beginning.  The government is laying open to 
question a vital principle, with its desire to create an 
instrument for collecting taxes that would allow it to encroach 
on others' areas of jurisdiction.  Take, for example, the taxes 
that could be collected in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the fact that the taxpayers' independence will be 
greatly diminished if they have to deal with this huge 
bureaucracy for tax collection. 
Every citizen must contribute his proper share, must participate 
in the government budget, but not excessively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are familiar with the cases of a number of people who have 
received notices of assessment and then, after these are looked 
into, it is found that a compromise could have been reached, 
that more could have been done.  Most of these cases are settled 
through the usual mechanisms, but not all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will lead to more such cases.  The government says it 
must collect a lot of money.  Such is the philosophy behind 
their collecting money for employment insurance, money deducted 
at source.  I fear the same attitude will be behind the proposed 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the employees of this agency need to be independent, 
and in the past their independence was linked to their status as 
public servants, which is likely to undergo a significant 
change.  They may end up more vulnerable to political 
interference.  In the end, the people will be less well served 
by the new formula proposed by the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument that the provinces, Quebec for example, could 
voluntarily come under the new proposal for this federal agency 
to collect all taxes, strikes me as rather fallacious.  It 
smacks of Plan B.  Some years ago, Quebeckers decided that they 
wanted part of their taxes to be collected by Quebec, so that 
the money would be divided as the Government of Quebec wanted. 
We agreed on the GST.  The GST is collected and administered by 
Quebec, which then hands it over to the federal government, and 
the future lies much more in this direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people, even federalists, were prepared to consider taking 
the opposite approach and, instead of letting the federal 
government collect taxes and giving it spending authority in all 
the provincial areas of jurisdiction, were to let any province 
so wishing collect taxes and remit a portion thereof for its 
share of services provided by the federal government, the entire 
dynamic of Canadian federalism would be altered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us is not based on this approach. 
Instead, it is based on ensuring that the federal government has 
an increasing number of ways in which it can invade the 
provinces' areas of jurisdiction, gradually strangle them and 
take their place.  Ultimately, the federal government is 
becoming ever-present.  This is one more way of confirming the 
old vision of Canada as a country with a single level of 
government, in which the provinces are seen as little more than 
overgrown municipalities.  They have very limited powers and 
they are certainly not seen by the public as the central 
authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may digress, last night I was astonished to learn that the 
first thing Mr. Charest did as leader of the opposition in 
Quebec was to ask that Canada's flag be present in the National 
Assembly.  This from someone who says he is in touch with 
Quebeckers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my impression that he has not completed his “Quebec 101” 
course, and that it may take years for him to understand. 
Sometimes too, a person has to be willing to understand.  There 
is, perhaps, something missing here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole dynamic is what underlies the bill before us.  The 
main focus of government for Quebeckers, the control centre, is 
the Quebec Legislative Assembly.  Quebeckers want to see it 
collecting as much of their taxes as possible.  We are not 
prepared to go before the federal government like lambs to the 
slaughter and to forgo our fair share of autonomy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was dormant for a long time. 
Preparations were under way for a very long time to try and get 
it past Parliament, and finally it was decided to table it.  But 
it is running into considerable opposition, particularly from 
experts in the field and from all those who work for the 
department and feel that this bill will make the taxpayer the 
loser in the long run and deprive them of the necessary autonomy 
to perform their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to propose another possible mode, one which the 
government ought to consider.  Instead of steamrollering a bill 
through like this, the provinces ought to have been consulted in 
order to see what model might have been acceptable to them, and 
whether there are any conditions which might prove to be of 
interest without making a government such as the Government of 
Quebec feel caught in a trap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax collection is certainly not the answer to all the country's 
ills, but it is the kind of issue that goes to the heart of what 
is really bothering people.  In its determination to ram this 
bill through, the federal government is invoking closure so as 
to cut off debate before all parliamentarians have had a chance 
to express their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no rush.  We do not have a national or international 
crisis.  We have a bill that is sadly in need of improvement. 
It is clear that the bill would have needed many more changes at 
report stage to be acceptable to the majority of parties in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the sort of issue that demands that we take the time to 
reach a consensus because it has a direct effect on the public 
through tax collection and through negotiations with individuals 
and with companies.  There has to be broad consensus on the 
approach. This was not a bill that had the support of the 
majority, such bills often standing up very well in the long run 
because enough thought went into them at the outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, we have a bill passed by a majority that has its head 
in the sand and has decided to ram the bill through, without 
making the necessary amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, and for all the reasons mentioned by the Bloc 
Quebecois members, I think it important that this bill be 
considered further and sent back to committee, or withdrawn so 
that it can be worked into something acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would do better to take our time to produce something 
acceptable and to remove all the irritants the bill contains for 
those who would like a government, such as Quebec, to be allowed 
to retain and to broaden its autonomy with respect to tax 
collection.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
today to speak to Bill C-43, which creates the Canadian Customs 
and Revenue Agency.  This Liberal bill is not new.  The 
government first mentioned it in the throne speech in February 
1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, like today, the Bloc Quebecois strongly rejected 
this bill, which we deemed centralizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to explain to you some of the reasons behind our 
opposition to this Liberal initiative.  First, this institution 
will become a superstructure, a super tax collection 
institution, which will enable Ottawa to extend its influence to 
all levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already know that this agency sprung from the imagination of 
senior tax officials in Ottawa.  They would really like to 
control a gigantic fiscal octopus extending its tentacles beyond 
the provinces to municipal and local administrations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their intent is to administer everything from provincial sales 
taxes to gasoline and alcohol taxes.  We should ask ourselves 
“Do Quebeckers and Canadians want to give such power to a single 
government agency?”  The answer, as you will agree, is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We oppose the creation of this agency because the government's 
obligation to account to the public and to Parliament will be 
weakened.  In its present form, Revenue Canada is responsible to 
taxpayers through the Department of National Revenue.  So at the 
moment, the government cannot evade difficult questions, such as 
the family trusts scandal, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the new agency would not be subject to the direct 
control of the House of Commons and would therefore face less 
rigorous parliamentary scrutiny. 
Once again, do Canadians and Quebeckers want to have an agency 
that the government can use as a cover? The answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This answer becomes even clearer when one is familiar with the 
Liberal approach to management: they constantly hide behind 
inquiries and independent agencies to avoid answering 
embarrassing questions. That is how they reacted to the 
questions raised concerning the involvement of senior military 
officers in the Somalia affair. That is also how they reacted to 
questions on air safety. They reacted the same way with respect 
to food inspection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, in the Standing Committee on Health, we heard the 
assistant to the auditor general and the president of the food 
inspection agency, another independent agency established 
recently, which is similar to the one contemplated by the 
government in Bill C-43: the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge hon. members to read the section of the auditor general's 
report dealing with how this transition was handled. When I 
toured Quebec over the summer, I visited a distribution centre, 
an income tax return processing centre in the riding of my 
colleague from Jonquière. I met more than 500 public service 
employees. All of them cautioned us about two things. 
The first one is the infamous pay equity issue. I will not bring 
it up again, because it has already been the subject of 
extensive debate in this House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point raised by public service employees, residents 
and voters from the riding of my colleague, the hon. member for 
Jonquière, is their concern about the agency that will be 
established under Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back to this morning's meeting of the standing 
committee on health. The auditor general once again showed that 
the transition from the Department of Health to a food 
inspection agency had generated major distortions. 
I will not draw a parallel, but allow me to voice my concerns 
about Bill C-43, which will establish a similar independent 
agency. I believe there is cause for concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the Bloc Quebecois critic on this issue and member 
for Saint-Eustache, expressed concern about it. It is important 
to take note of that concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continued in the same vein to avoid having to 
deal with the Prime Minister's involvement in police violence 
against students at the Vancouver APEC summit. We refuse to give 
the Liberal government another excuse to take cover and avoid 
answering the public's questions in an area as important as the 
collection of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada customs and revenue agency could also be prejudicial 
to people's privacy. As members know, we live in a world where 
computer technology is becoming increasingly important, and 
where private sector organizations buy and sell more and more 
personal information. The federal government has already dealt 
with the sensitive issue of protecting personal information in 
Bill C-54. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Chambly will be speaking soon. I remember his 
comments about the concerns raised by Bill C-54. The Liberal 
government is consistent. It is so uncomfortable with the 
principle of protecting personal information, that it even 
attempted to downplay this objective in the title of a bill that 
is supposed to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 is entitled an act to support and promote electronic 
commerce—“support”, “promote” and “commerce” are the three key 
words—by protecting personal information that is collected, 
used or disclosed in certain circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that, with this bill, the Liberal government is 
giving priority to commerce over the protection of personal 
information. We now fear that it may be pursuing the same 
objective with this agency, that is to maximize government 
revenues, without regard for the protection of personal 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the government is consistent, in Bill C-54 and Bill C-43. How 
can we confidently hand over so much personal information to a 
super-powerful federal agency, when it was designed by a Liberal 
government that will not give priority to the protection of 
personal information over the promotion of unfettered commerce? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is obvious. 
Canadians and Quebeckers cannot trust such an institution. We 
have serious concerns about the balance of powers that will 
prevail within the new federal agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who, exactly, will decide? In the end, who will be accountable? 
These are questions we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that if the federal government truly wants 
to improve the administration of tax laws and streamline their 
application, the solution is simple: Quebec already has a 
revenue department that does a good job of collecting taxes. The 
federal government should simply, once and for all, hand over to 
Revenue Quebec the responsibility for collecting all taxes in 
Quebec, and it should do the same with all the other provinces 
that want to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such decentralization would give some credence to the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs, who claimed again yesterday that 
the Canadian federation was open and decentralized.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, things are 
getting off to a bad start for Bill C-43. The government party is 
muzzling and gagging the opposition.  We are criticizing this 
bill, which will perhaps not foment a revolution, because that 
is already under way with Nav Canada and Aéroports de Montréal, 
for example, where partisan appointments are still being made 
consistently to a committee or a company, as those appointed are 
always friends of the party in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B> There are so many good Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> I hear the Liberal Party whip saying there 
are so many good Liberals.  Unfortunately for them but 
fortunately for us, the Liberals may not always be in power. 
That party has already overstayed its welcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are eliminating Canada's democratic past.  They 
wanted to give the federal government powers that could have 
been assumed by a neighbour, a friend or an enemy.  They wanted 
to gloss over our personal convictions so they could confer 
responsibilities on the federal government, which fulfilled them 
through the public service.  This was a social consensus among 
all taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this tax collection agency, who says that tomorrow I will 
not discover that my Liberal opponent in the 1993 or the 1997 
election is sending me my tax bill?  He could, on the strength 
of the election campaign in which we opposed each other, ask me 
to remit whatever he feels like, taking me out of the political 
circuit and into bankruptcy if he wants. 
This sort of thing could happen. The government claims to be 
serious and concerned about ensuring social and civil peace. I 
doubt it very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are matters the people have put in the hands of government 
and this they accepted willingly and wholeheartedly. That is 
what this government is scrapping. That was the word the 
government used in relation to the GST. They were supposed to 
scrap it, but scrap the GST they did not. Furthermore, as an 
admission of their incompetence I am sure, they let Quebec 
collect the GST. It seems to be working very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron:</B> It does not seem so; it is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> It is indeed working very well. But when we 
talk about government agencies, I think of Equifax, a company 
that makes the headlines every three weeks or so. 
Equifax gathers information for anyone who requests it. It is a 
sort of collection agency. No so long ago, Equifax sold 
information to organized crime gangs out to do certain people 
in. Equifax could not care less, figuring it gets paid to 
provide information; what it is used for is not its problem. 
This came out in court recently. Organized crime gangs out to 
kill an individual simply asked Equifax to gather information on 
this individual, so they could trace him, catch him and do him 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of ethics these agencies have. This is sad. The 
Liberals should realize this because, in four years, they will 
certainly be gone. And the next government will not be a Bloc 
Quebecois government. That much is sure, because this is not our 
goal.

in this House will probably hold the same line.  Perhaps then 
they will be the ones who are stuck.  Perhaps then they will be 
the ones who will pay for it.  This is a short-sighted policy. 
They do not see any further than the end of their noses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are placing their fates in the hands of agencies.  Yet 
there are political and social risks to this approach.  The 
social risks need to be looked at. 
Some, I know, will take it very badly to have money collected 
from them by people who have absolutely no vision of a just and 
equitable society, people for whom all means to an end are 
justified, that end being to collect taxes and probably get a 
commission for doing so.  Whether the taxes collected are 
actually owing is not important, all that counts is the cut for 
collecting them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably 20% of the federal public service, which was the 
object of a social consensus, is also being chopped.  People 
said “The government must assume its responsibilities and 
someone neutral will do this.  We will voluntarily submit to the 
authority of that neutral entity, the public service”.  But now 
we are starting to see the buddies of the regime, the PM's 
friends, being brought into the picture, and not for the first 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my colleague, the hon. member for Jonquière, nodding, and 
she is right to do so. 
Every day, I receive notices of appointments to boards of 
directors, in agencies such as Atomic Energy of Canada Limited 
or Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. For the fun of it, I 
took a look at the big book on financial contributions made to 
political parties. Without exception, the names of all those 
appointed to these boards is in the big book that lists those 
who made contributions to the Liberal Party of Canada, for 
example last year. This is getting to be a concern. People make 
contributions to the Liberal party in exchange for political 
appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last parliament, we passed a bill to prevent double 
dipping, that is to prevent those who are entitled to a public 
service pension and who are sitting as members of parliament, or 
those who are former MPs and have a job in the public service, 
from getting two incomes. This is what we call double dipping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we should take a look at what is going on at the Department 
of National Defence. There are at least eight or nine former 
generals or high-ranking officers, who are retired from the 
Canadian forces and collecting a full pension, which, 
incidentally, does not compare with the small pension a member 
of parliament gets after two terms. These people are hired as 
consultants by the federal government at $180,000, $200,000, 
$225,000 and even $250,000 a year. People get treated very well 
when they are friends of the Liberal Party.

must find other positions to appoint good Liberal troops, who 
may not be as educated or as competent. 
They will work in collection agencies harassing their fellow 
citizens and clamping Denver boots on their cars. Every trade 
has its value, of course, but nothing is too repugnant for an 
appointed Liberal. He can do anything he is asked to.

agencies similar to the one the Liberals want to set up. That 
system was abolished in 1949. I can assure you that prisoners

dignity. They were treated like animals. They suffered from

cost effectiveness. It had to be cheap. What is cheap is not a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to Bill C-43, an act to establish the Canada 
Customs and Revenue Agency. I support the motion brought forward 
by my hon. colleague from Saint-Eustache—Sainte-Thérèse, who is 
asking the government to withdraw this pointless piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should realize that this bill to set up an agency 
for the collection of all taxes in Canada is dead in the water, 
because the underlying principle on which the establishment of 
this agency is based, namely the signing of administrative tax 
agreements with the provinces, has yet to be applied in 
practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was introduced, not a single agreement or even a 
letter of intent had been signed with any of the provinces. 
So how do you justify a bill that obviously reflects the 
government's wishful thinking and the centralizing vision it is 
trying to ram down the throats of the provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill only reflects the centralizing vision of the Chrétien 
government, and we can never say often enough that, for the 
federal Liberals, rationalization means duplication and, 
ironically, harmonization means interference. Did the people in 
Canada and in Quebec ask for such an agency? To ask the question 
is to answer it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides being totally out of touch with people's real needs, the 
government is trying, with this bill, to stretch its tentacles 
beyond the provincial governments to municipal and local 
administrations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, what can we say about a government that delegates such 
a fundamental responsibility as collecting and administering 
taxes paid by corporate and individual taxpayers? Who will 
ensure that taxpayers' rights are protected? Who will ensure 
that personal information remains confidential? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this age of computer information and centralization of 
personal and financial data, people fear for their privacy, and 
rightly so. The agency as proposed would have a personal and 
financial data bank that should be of concern to taxpayers. They 
should be able to expect their government to protect access to 
this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill the government is abdicating its 
responsibilities toward taxpayers. 
Even though the government claims the agency will be accountable 
to elected representatives, the fact is this new structure would 
become an entity difficult to get around and to control.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may seem advantageous for the revenue minister to hide behind 
the agency to avoid giving a quick answer to embarrassing 
questions by members of parliament, but the taxpayers and the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois only see further delays in 
answering questions and more hurdles between problems and 
solutions. Moreover, the revenue minister himself should be 
leery of this new superstructure which might be beyond his 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like someone to explain where the so-called savings used 
to justify the new agency are going to come from. 
First, one further layer of bureaucracy is added in the form of 
an appointed management board which will require time, money and 
staff. Furthermore, senior executives will be entirely free to 
pay themselves salaries comparable to those of executives in the 
private sector. Finally, providing free services to provinces 
who want to harmonize their program with the federal income tax 
program will automatically bring an increase and certainly not a 
decrease in the agency's costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I ask where it is expected that there will be savings. 
It seems quite obvious to me that if there are any savings, 
there will certainly be made at the expense of frontline 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, 20% of public servants will no longer come 
under the Public Service Employment Act. Clause 30(1) shows the 
government's true intentions, which are barely hidden. It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>30. (1) The Agency has authority over all matters relating to:

</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>c</I>) Agency real property— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And this is where the section becomes interesting: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>d</I>) personnel management, including the determination of terms 
and conditions of employment of persons employed by the Agency. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 54 tells us even more. It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>54. (1) The Agency must develop a program governing staffing, 
including the appointment of, and recourse for, employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) No collective agreements may deal with matters governed by 
the staffing program. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The anti-union nature of this bill is quite obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the government shows that it is incapable of 
being a good employer, doubly so. It introduces a bill that 
threatens the job security of one-fifth of the public service, 
and after having shamefully delayed for many years dealing with 
the pay equity issue. This government has proven that it prefers 
strong-arm tactics to crush employees' collective demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that in my riding the union at the Taxation 
Data Centre in Jonquière represents 1,200 workers. 
Over the last several years, and with the spectre of this new 
agency looming since 1996, employees and local management have 
had to deal with a series of unbelievable adjustments, drastic 
budget cuts, a reorganisation of services between various 
taxation centres, the use of a large part of their operating 
budget to avoid the Y2K bug, while implementing costly new 
technologies requiring less human involvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this turmoil has required superhuman efforts to minimise the 
impact on jobs. So far, they have managed pretty well to avoid 
serious problems. The Taxation Data Centre still has an 
excellent reputation as regards the performance of its 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a region like ours, where unemployment is high, every job 
counts. 
What will be the impact of the establishment of this new agency, 
and how many jobs will be lost in the next two years?  Perhaps 
no job will be lost.  However, if there is little or no impact 
on jobs, then should we not conclude that, in order to save 
money, we will have to cut services to the public or impose user 
fees? 
Indeed, the agency will have the authority to establish user 
fees for the services which are useful to the users.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, this measure could mean user fees for individuals or 
small businesses, and that for the privilege of paying their 
taxes.  This takes the cake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government really wants to reduce overlap and 
duplication between the federal and provincial governments, 
really wants to reduce costs for businesses, taxpayers and 
governments, then we agree. 
In Quebec we already have our revenue department which collects 
provincial taxes and, since 1992, the federal GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying at the beginning of my remarks, I urge the 
government to withdraw this bill which will not save any money 
or simplify tax administration but will reduce parliamentary 
control over tax collection and administration, at the 
same time as threatening job security and working conditions for 
40,000 employees.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today on Bill C-43, an act to establish the Canada 
Customs and Revenue Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the House that the government had announced in 
the throne speech of 1996 that it would establish this agency to 
convert the current Department of National Revenue into a 
semi-independent agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency's mandate would be to act as a tax collector in 
Canada, but not only for the federal government. Indeed, as 
provided in the legislation, the agency could negotiate with 
provincial and municipal governments agreements for the 
collection of all kinds of taxes, including sales taxes, 
property taxes, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot approve this legislation which, from the start, aims 
only at centralizing the collection of taxes in this country, at 
downsizing the national revenue department workforce and, 
mostly, at establishing an agency that, once again, will come 
into conflict with the Quebec revenue department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quasi-independent agency would allow the revenue department 
to hide behind it to avoid taking its responsibilities. It would 
avoid its obligation to protect taxpayers against abuses of 
power. This is worthy of the imagination of officials who want 
to increase their power at the expense of the minister in order 
to make decisions in his stead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what is to be found at section 30(1) of the bill: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>30. (1) The Agency has authority over all matters relating to 
general administrative policy in the Agency; the organization of 
the Agency; Agency real property; and personnel management, 
including the determination of the terms and conditions of 
persons employed by the Agency. 
</UL>
<This is undeniably an anti-union measure against public servants 
who will no longer come under the Public Service Employment Act. 
The agency will be free to increase or decrease salaries and to 
hire and fire employees. About 20% of the public service will 
be at the mercy of the agency's board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And who is going to suffer? Certainly not senior managers, 
because those officials will have the power to pay themselves 
salaries like those in the private sector. It will be the 
support staff, the ones responsible for processing the claims, 
in short, the majority of the employees. This agency is more 
open to patronage and abuse of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister does not seem to realize the importance of the 
powers he is giving to unelected officials who are not 
accountable to anybody. Under the present structure, Revenue 
Canada is fully accountable to parliament and to the taxpayers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, parliament will have less control over the agency than 
it does now over the department. An agency would feel much less 
compelled than a department to be accountable, to provide 
answers to questions and deal with concerns raised by members on 
behalf of the public. Do we want to see the government resort 
once more to an agency to avoid answering questions on tax 
collection? The answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the creation of an agency that collects taxes for provinces 
and municipalities, do we have any idea of the volume of 
confidential data this agency will have?  With an agency of this 
size, an incredible quantity of personal and financial 
information will be in the hands of a single institution, which 
will be less accountable before parliament and before the 
minister than Revenue Canada is currently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main purpose of the Canada customs and revenue agency is to 
conclude new tax administration agreements with the provinces. 
When this bill was introduced, the government did not have a 
single agreement.  Quebec and Ontario were opposed, because this 
level of taxation should be the responsibility of the provinces, 
which should administer it.  The western provinces, which seemed 
cool to the idea at the start, are now opposed to it. 
Even Prince Edward Island has told Ottawa that it is not 
prepared to transfer other tax powers to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So where is the support?  The department itself says that the 
provinces want the agency to prove its mettle before they decide 
to give it more of their tax programs.  It is outrageous to 
think of supporting the creation of a new bureaucratic structure 
in the hope that the provinces might participate in it.  There 
are no agreements, but hundreds of public servants have already 
been released to work on this new agency the minister of revenue 
wants to impose on us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The business world should be the first to be interested in this 
agency.  And yet, the CCRA failed to impress small and big 
business.  The bodies representing small business expressed 
their distrust of the massive powers to be centralized in this 
agency. 
In a poll, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business 
indicated that 40% of the businesses that participated in a 
study Revenue Canada commissioned from the Public Policy Forum 
saw no point in having this agency. Over two thirds of these 
businesses felt that, with such an agency, the costs relating to 
their dealings with the department would be higher than they are 
under the existing structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By establishing a quasi-independent agency, the government is 
increasing the risk of fraud and of the sale of confidential 
information, for which there is a very lucrative market right 
now in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, there are no benefits in establishing such 
an agency. Quebec opposes the federal government's intention to 
centralize all tax revenue collection activities in one 
Canada-wide agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will continue to oppose the establishment of 
this agency, which does not benefit the taxpayers in any way, 
but may in fact cost them all they got, especially in terms of 
democratic rights. When problems arise, having to do with the 
administration of taxes or wrong decisions by Revenue Canada, we 
will no longer be able to question the minister. He will reply 
that the agency is calling the shots. And democracy will suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency is a costly exercise both in terms of money and time, 
the product of some wild brainstorm of senior department 
officials. It is an idea in search of a rationale that has yet 
to be found. We must put a stop to it before any more public 
funds are sunk into it. Any number of improvements can be 
contemplated within the existing structure, and they would not 
involve the kind of costs and disruption inherent in the 
establishment of an agency that is neither wanted nor required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the taxation employees' union think of it? It has ten 
arguments against this idea. 
First, by creating a tax collection superagency, Ottawa's 
influence would reach right into our communities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this agency, accountability to the public and to parliament 
will be weakened. The agency could threaten our privacy. Fourth, 
the agency is a classic example of empire building by Ottawa's 
senior bureaucrats from the isolation of their ivory towers. 
Fifth, the primary reason for establishing this agency is to 
sign new tax agreements with the provinces. Sixth, small and 
large businesses are not impressed with the new agency. Seventh, 
the agency will bring about new hidden taxes. Eighth, it will 
bring new costs. Ninth, the agency is already wasting money even 
if it does not yet exist. Tenth, the agency will be more 
bureaucratic than Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois opposes this bill and 
will be voting against it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am happy to have this opportunity to speak to Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent quite a few employees of Revenue Canada in the 
riding of Winnipeg Centre.  The city of Winnipeg is the location 
of a huge Revenue Canada operation with 5,000 employees.  Many of 
these employees who live in my riding have come to me with a 
great deal of apprehension and a great deal of fear about what 
this new superagency really means for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one we have talked to can point to any compelling reasons 
that we are making this move toward a superagency.  If anything, 
reason and logic do not seem to enter into this at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest fear that has been articulated is that it is really 
being driven by ideology rather than by any good reason, any good 
logical business plan or expectation of savings.  The real 
opportunities for savings within Revenue Canada will not come 
from the creation of some superagency. The real opportunity for 
revenue will come from having an adequate number of auditors to 
collect the taxes that are owing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A group of auditors made representations to our caucus just a 
week ago pleading this very case.  Billions of dollars of taxes 
are left uncollected each year because there simply are not 
enough auditors in the field doing the job and getting these 
revenues for the government to use. In other words, people are 
getting away with murder in terms of taxation because they are 
not being audited properly.  Taxes are not being collected 
properly.  This is the case which was made to us by senior 
auditors with Revenue Canada in their appeal to us to do 
everything we can to oppose Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditors expect that the situation will only get worse after 
the creation of the new superagency. The auditors feel, and I 
think quite justifiably, that the whole move toward a superagency 
is like a Trojan horse.  They think it is wrapped up in a package 
which would be palatable to the public but in actual fact it 
contains a lot of surprises waiting to be sprung on us, not the 
least of which is a move toward further privatization of 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The road toward ASD, alternative service delivery, 
superagencies, whatever we want to call it, is the road toward 
privatization and dismantling the public sector even in areas we 
know should be managed and controlled strictly through the public 
sector, like something as sensitive as the collection of our 
taxes.  Other ASD examples have been absolutely disastrous for 
working people.  They are always the last ones to be consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking specifically of the privatization at Goose Bay. 
All the non-military personnel were laid off and services were 
contracted out to an out of country company, Serco, to provide 
the same services that Canadians used to provide in good 
unionized well paying jobs. These same people were hired back at 
half the wages and are now working for a foreign corporation to 
provide services on our military base.  It is absolutely perverse 
when we think about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that kind of background and that sort of recent experience 
that has made Canadians apprehensive about Bill C-43 and the 
creation of this superagency.

Yvon Cyrenne of 
Raymond Chabot Martin Paré said in the chartered accountant 
magazine of March 1998:  “The creation of the customs and 
revenue agency would, for all intents and purposes, be an 
abdication of political power”.  I would add that it would be an 
abdication of political responsibility in that it would be that 
much more removed from elected officials having any purview over 
this collection.  It would be strictly in the hands of this 
freestanding, arm's length superagency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 5,000 employees of Revenue Canada work in Transcona and in 
Winnipeg.  Many of them live in my riding and many worked on my 
campaign.  Some of them were actually politicized for the first 
time in their lives because of what was about to happen to them. 
They were reaching out for some kind of political support from 
anybody who would articulate or voice their concerns.  I am glad 
to have the opportunity to that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have good reason to be apprehensive.  Nobody really knows 
what this is going to end up looking like.  Will it look like the 
Canada Post Corporation?  Will it be a stand alone agency like 
Canada Post?  I do not think so, although that comparison has 
been made.  If it were, then the workers should fall under the 
Canada Labour Code, not the Public Service Staff Relations Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in itself is a huge issue for the unionized workers who 
work for Revenue Canada. Where will the industrial relations be 
when all of the dust settles?  Can anybody answer that?  What is 
going to happen to their terms and conditions of employment?  Are 
they still bargaining with the same employer?  Is the employer 
that much different after they are removed from the public sector 
in that sense? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hundreds of questions that are left unanswered. Many 
were brought to our attention, as I said, when the employees of 
Revenue Canada came to our caucus just a week ago and articulated 
these fears.  Representatives from the Public Service Alliance of 
Canada, the Union of Taxation Employees and one other labour 
group were justifiably apprehensive about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term Trojan horse has been used.  I have heard the term mega 
taxman.  It does not matter what we want to call this new 
superagency, it is going to be something that Canadians will not 
recognize and will not be comfortable with.  Will it look like 
the IRS in the United States, a boondoggle like the IRS that 
answers to nobody? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we are saying.  When we get that kind of 
independence, there is room for abuse.  It is something that can 
grow out of control, beyond what it was initially designed for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a sense in the public sector, certainly within 
the federal government, of a belief in this right wing ideology 
that all things in the public sector are bad and all things 
privately run are good.  There is a belief that some inherent 
streamlining comes into play when things go into the private 
sector, as if there is no waste in the private sector. This is an 
absolute myth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a cruel myth in that this bashing of the public sector 
goes on. This atmosphere of contempt has been allowed to flourish 
across the country.  Public sector employees are knocking 
themselves out to do their best, often with limited resources and 
limited compensation.  Abuse is heaped on them.  Every time there 
is a deficit or a cost overrun they say “Oh, it is that bloated 
public sector.  If we could only shed some jobs out of the public 
sector”. There is this myth perpetrating that we can shrink our 
way to prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the private sector went through its decade of lean and 
mean, shedding employees and casting people off.  Many of them 
now realize they have gone too far.  They have cut all the fat 
and have cut into the flesh, the muscle tissue to where they 
cannot function any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is happening to our military.  This compulsion, 
this drive to cut, hack, slash and throw Canadians out into the 
street has left us with a human resources emergency in the 
military. The people who are being cut are the highly skilled, 
middle band of trained workers, the people who actually had 
administrative capacities, et cetera. 
We still have the foot soldiers, the grunts.  We still have 
plenty of generals.  It is that middle band of competent people 
who can actually do things which is disappearing. The restoration 
of funding overnight is not going to bring that middle band back. 
Those people are gone.  They are gone to the point where the 
whole organization is at risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Similar streamlining efficiencies, if we want to call them that, 
are taking place every time we see this idea of offloading to 
alternative service delivery.  That is really what the 
superagency is.  It is ASD.  It is getting the same job done in a 
different way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would argue it is a step backward in terms of service to the 
Canadian public.  We are buying into an unknown commodity for one 
thing.  The reservations brought to us by the UTE, the Union of 
Taxation Employees, are real, valid and justified concerns.  They 
are vehemently opposed to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has failed to prove to anybody's satisfaction 
that this is a good thing to do.  All we have heard is complaint 
after complaint that we are going into uncharted waters, that 
danger lurks in these uncharted waters. It will probably be the 
working people who will end up feeling the brunt of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should also be forewarned that we are going to 
lose valuable opportunities to collect revenues to the best of 
our ability. If we listen to the people at the front lines who 
really know what they are talking about, they say we need 500 
more auditors in the field tomorrow, not cutbacks and reductions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, this is the 
second time I have risen in the House to speak to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began my last speech by saying that Bill C-43 is a bureaucratic 
aberration, a serious blow against democracy, protection of 
personal information, respect for jurisdictions and service to 
the people, nothing less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After further consideration, I would say all that and more, 
because the purpose of this bill is not just to replace the 
Department of Revenue, but to create a body that will provide 
services to the provinces and municipalities for the 
implementation of programs and activities. 
These words appear beside the words customs and taxes throughout 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an agency that will not be subject to democratic 
control, that will operate at arm's length from the federal 
government, that will have the appearance of a public agency but 
that, in reality, will not be accountable to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is another attempt to lump all the provinces together and is 
the antithesis of what federal government is all about.  It is 
bureaucratic and undemocratic.  But the government goes much 
further; this bill gives it the authority to replace any other 
level of government in their program activities.  It is 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protest has been widespread. 
What is this government doing?  As usual, comfortable with its 
five-member majority, it charges ahead, creating problem after 
problem, with the mindset of a central government that, in the 
regions, would only have to deal with municipalities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is serious, especially on the eve of negotiations on the 
social union issue. It is serious because, while the provinces 
are fighting as hard as they can to maintain the powers given to 
them under the Constitution, the federal government, without 
warning, is moving ahead, ignoring all the legitimate protests, 
fears and concerns and muzzling the opposition. Why? Because it 
is annoyed with the opposition parties for expressing their 
disagreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few new arguments to make. I said this agency will be a 
business. Who will it serve, the public? No. It will serve 
clients. These clients will be provinces or municipalities. What 
will the directors' mission be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 42(1) says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every director of the Agency, in exercising their powers and 
performing their duties and functions, must 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) act honestly and in good faith— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, but why? This is why: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—with a view to the best interests of the Agency— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much for that. We have here a business that will act with a 
view to its best interests and whose job will be to collect 
revenues from taxpayers with whom it does not have the same 
relationship as the one that exists between the taxpayers and 
the state, the income tax return being a contract between the 
taxpayers and the state. We can say that. There are countries 
where things are done differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system we have developed here is based on a voluntary 
contract, namely the personal income tax return, which contains 
all kinds of confidential information. Trust is absolutely vital 
in exercising this civic duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also has the duty to build that trust. But how 
can that happen when we know from the start that this agency will 
be made up of an extremely large number of employees—40,000 is 
the number we have been seeing—who will no longer come under 
the Public Service Employment Act and who will therefore have 
difficulty keeping their union? I hope they will be able to keep 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will no longer be protected by this act, which allows them 
to fulfil their duty to the state and to the people. Will they 
be serving the people's interests? No. They will be serving the 
agency's interests, and that agency is planning to sign 
contracts with provincial and municipal governments for various 
activities and programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency may licence, sell or otherwise make available any 
patent, copyright, industrial design, trade-mark or other similar 
property right that it holds or develop. That is what the 
minister's bill says. It is an aberration in terms of democracy, 
in terms of personal information and in terms of service to the 
public. It does not make sense. It is unthinkable, but the 
government is doing it anyway. This is serious.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just look at the personal information aspect. We know 
that the people who will be processing income tax returns will 
no longer be protected by legislation. They will receive bonuses 
as a reward. That is what the bill says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Revenue should reflect on this some 
more and withdraw this bill that has to be a cause for concern 
for Canadians. It breaks the fundamental contract of trust 
between the taxpayer who signs his or her income tax return and 
the state, because the state is abandoning its role and its 
responsibility. That is the most serious part. There are a lot 
of  other things too but, essentially, that is the most serious 
part. 
The minister can say what he likes, he will no longer be 
accountable to this House because he will be able to blame the 
directors or the commissioner. He can smile all he wants, but he 
will not be able to restore people's trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a union and without the protection of the law, employees 
will be vulnerable to all kinds of pressure. We can think about 
employee turnover, which will make the issue of personal 
information an even greater concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all my colleagues and all the people who are interested in 
this matter, I urge the minister again not to go ahead with this 
undemocratic bill that goes against the public's interest. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to have this opportunity to speak again to Bill C-43. 
The member for Winnipeg Centre said that this bill is like a 
Trojan horse.  I echo his comments and the comments of other 
members of opposition parties who are very united in their 
concern about and opposition to this bill.  It is a sad day for 
parliament.  We faced a closure vote this morning and we can see 
that this bill is being rushed through by a slim government 
majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are questions that need to be asked on behalf of the 
Canadian people.  What is the imperative for having this bill in 
the first place?  What is the imperative for rushing this bill 
through the House by forcing a vote to meet the government's 
interests?  Those questions have not been answered.  That should 
concern Canadians because the subject of Bill C-43 is the 
creation of a new, privatized mega agency.  That should concern 
every Canadian and every member of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past two years during which this proposal has been 
contemplated a massive sales job has been undertaken by the 
minister, by the government and by senior bureaucrats to try to 
sign people onto the proposal.  We see today that as of yet not a 
single province has signed onto the agency.  The reality is that 
there is not a single binding letter of intent from any province 
to sign onto this new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from those who work at Revenue Canada.  They know 
what this agency would do, what its problems would be and 
presumably what should be done.  We have also heard from the 
professional sector and even from the auditor general.  From this 
we can see that there are problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is becoming increasingly clear that Bill C-43 is not the 
answer.  We have raised this continually in the House. 
In fact, Bill C-43 is taking us completely in the wrong 
direction.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Winnipeg Centre has pointed out, Bill C-43 
will amount to what is probably the largest act of privatization 
that this government has undertaken.  We are looking at the 
transfer of something like 20% of public service workers.  Forty 
thousand people will be affected by this transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us have heard some of the concerns that have been 
expressed by the people who work at Revenue Canada.  I really 
believe that their concerns should not be taken lightly.  In 
fact, we should be listening very closely to the issues that have 
been raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the issues?  First, there is the issue of 
privatization.  I believe that the government has not yet made 
the case to the provinces, to the House of Commons, or to the 
Canadian people as to why this privatization should take place. 
There are very serious concerns about the lack of accountability 
that will be caused by setting up a super agency that will not 
have the same kind of relationship with members of parliament 
that we have seen in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that we are talking about one of the core 
functions of the Canadian government, a function that sometimes 
people rail against and get upset about, the collection of 
revenue and taxes.  Nevertheless, it is very much a core 
function.  For that very reason I believe that it is incumbent 
upon us to fight tooth and nail to make sure that this parliament 
retains a relationship and accountability with this core service 
instead of allowing it to be let loose, allowing it to be 
privatized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information that came out recently in the auditor general's 
report is actually very damning about the bill which is before us 
today.  Some of the comments that the auditor general made in his 
report about Revenue Canada, in particular about the 
international tax directorate, tell us that only 52% of the 
directorate's staff at Revenue Canada headquarters are in 
permanent positions.  The auditor general goes on to say that 
“Because of the complexity and significance of international tax 
issues, we are concerned that frequent staff movements may 
prevent the directorate from maintaining the experience and skill 
levels required to provide an appropriate level of service to 
taxpayers and to manage the risks to the tax base that are 
inherent in international transactions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general continues in his conclusions and 
recommendations to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If parliament approves the establishment of the proposed new 
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, the Department will become a 
separate employer and assume most of the responsibility for human 
resource management currently shared with central agencies.  In 
the absence of a comprehensive human resource plan and strategies 
linked to the Directorate's business plan, the establishment of 
the new agency will not in itself resolve the problems outlined 
in this chapter. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to say:  “It is important that the analysis, 
planning and implementation of needed human resource initiatives 
be carried out as soon as possible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is a very serious issue that has been raised.  We 
have been told by the government, as it tries to sell this new 
super agency to parliament, to the Canadian people and, indeed, 
to the provinces, that we will see increased efficiencies, that 
we will see improvements, that we will have a better service and 
so on.  However, it should concern us when we see this 
information coming from the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find out that there has been a high turnover in staff and 
that, in actual fact, Revenue Canada has lost billions of dollars 
in revenue because it has not been able to attract the kind of 
personnel at a very high level to do the very complex audits 
which must be carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue, which was been flagged as far back as 1991 and again 
in 1996 by the auditor general, has simply not been addressed by 
Bill C-43.  In actual fact the government has lost a potential 
$2.5 billion to $3 billion in revenue since 1995 because it has 
refused to pay adequate salaries to attract the highly trained 
professionals who would perform these very complex audits. 
This year alone we lost a potential $1 billion in tax revenues 
from some of the largest corporations because these audits have 
not been carried out with sufficient frequency because the 
personnel is lacking.  Even Revenue Canada has acknowledged that 
it has lost about $500 million in tax revenues in the Toronto 
area alone because of the shortage of 500 tax auditors.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is directly related to the obsession of the government with 
cutting the public service, cutting out these kinds of key 
positions and now it is going further down the slippery slope 
toward privatization where we as members of the House will have 
less and less control and accountability over what this agency 
does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition has tried to put forward amendments to prevent 
this bill from going forward which is a reflection of the 
increasing and mounting concern around the proposal of the 
government to move in this direction and to ram this proposal 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I say to the minister and to the government if this 
proposal is so good and so beneficial then why is it that not a 
single province has signed on. The answer is that we know there 
has not been a sign-on because there are serious questions that 
have not been answered.  It is time for the government to 
acknowledge that the bill should be stopped and reviewed .  We 
should return to what the auditor general said and look at the 
real issues and address the problems contained within the 
department. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is interesting to listen to the opposition talk about the fact 
that not one province has signed on to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a reason for that.  The provinces, with the exception 
of Quebec, enjoy the fact that the government collects the taxes 
and the provinces do not have to take the heat for it. When 
filing income tax in Ontario there is a section which gives the 
formula for calculating provincial tax.  If the tax is being done 
by the taxpayer or an accountant, when they get to that page they 
are still in the mindset that they are filing their federal 
income tax and they are not thinking about the fact that there is 
a totally separate regime of tax collection at every provincial 
level.  Why would the provinces want to kick up a fuss about 
this?  The provinces want the federal government to have a system 
of tax collection that lets them off the hook and simply allows 
us to transfer the money.  It is not a surprise at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also not a surprise to me that not one province has signed 
on to this.  And I have not received one phone call in my 
constituency office in Mississauga about this issue.  And yet, as 
members I am sure will admit privately at least if not in this 
place, this is a bill that has had extensive work in this place 
and in committee.  It has been kicked around, dragged around in 
every one of our caucuses.  It has had presentations made.  It 
has been analysed from one end of the legislation to the other 
and yet there is not a public outcry or concern being expressed 
that we should, as the member says, scrap this piece of 
legislation.  I believe there is a reason for that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all talk at times in this place about there being only one 
taxpayer.  I use the example often of the ad I saw in a newspaper 
that had a mobile sign outside of a private garage called Paul's 
garage.  The sign said “Our price includes the PST, the GST, the 
EHT, the MBT, the MPT, the UIC, the WCP and the CPP”.  On the 
bottom it said “We would have included profit but we ran out of 
room”. 
The point I make is that we have a lot of taxes. Mr. Sekora, nice 
to see you.  We have those taxes simply because—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure the hon. member meant to 
refer to the hon. member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port 
Coquitlam and not to his name which he knows is out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was just seeing if you 
were paying attention.  Thank you for correcting me in that 
instance.  I could not remember the hon. member's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the point of taxation, with all these taxes that 
are there for legitimate reasons, that have been put in place by 
successive governments and regimes in various parts of the 
municipal sector, the provincial sector and the federal 
government, they are there to deliver programs to Canadians.  It 
is a burden, I do not deny that.  We hear people talk on the 
other side that we should just cut taxes, but what they do not 
talk about is what we do with that tax revenue.  What they do not 
talk about is the fact that I think it is high time that a huge 
organization like Revenue Canada is reviewed and changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about privatization, as the member opposite says. It 
is about more accountability.  Members opposite, particularly in 
the New Democratic Party, say is it not awful, because they would 
purport to represent the union involved in this which is 
frightened for jobs.  I do not blame them for being concerned 
about jobs, but the members opposite should know that there are a 
number of points that will ensure this place continues to have 
strong oversight over this agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament will review the agency's corporate business plan, 
just as it now reviews Revenue Canada's plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also review the agency's annual report regarding its 
performance during the preceding year.  I serve on the public 
accounts committee and we hope we will see it come to that 
committee.  We will be able to have witnesses come before us from 
the agency.  We will be able to investigate to find out if they 
are doing their job and serving Canadians well.  We will have 
opportunities for members of parliament to address us at the 
public accounts committee or speak in this place if constituents 
have concerns about the efficacy or how they are being dealt with 
in any way whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the agency is allowed to spend dime one, parliament will 
have to approve its appropriations, just as we do now for Revenue 
Canada.  This sky is falling mentality that we are hearing is 
nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an additional opportunity in this legislation for 
parliament to review the agency.  The legislation requires, for 
the first time, a full scale review of this legislation five 
years after it comes into force, and that is not an option.  So 
we know that once this bill is enacted and the agency is set up, 
it comes before our public accounts committee every year. If we 
call people we can review their budgets every year. They cannot 
spend money without the approval of parliament.  But we know 
there is a mandatory five year review of the agency.  It is a 
five year mandatory review but it does not prevent us from 
reviewing the agency on an ongoing basis if that is what we so 
desire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to me to hear members talk about less 
accountability to parliament when in fact this is a bill that 
will establish an agency that will be more accountable to 
Canadians, that will be more business friendly to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh.  Oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Members can laugh if they want, but 
that is clearly the intent of the minister.  The minister of 
revenue will continue to have control over that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal with an issue that we voted on earlier today in 
relation to this bill, time allocation or what the members 
opposite would call closure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc has put 188 motions to the bill.  There happen to be 
188 clauses in the bill.  So every single one of its motions 
reads the same, that clause 1 be rejected, that clause 2 be 
rejected, that clause 3 be rejected.  There are no suggestions 
for positive change coming from the opposition.  It is just 
trying to stall.  If we had good ideas, if any came from time to 
time from that neighbourhood, we would be interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is most astounding in all this is that the Bloc knows that 
Quebec is the only province that collects its own taxes.  We do 
not even collect its taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this day will never come but if I were ever sitting as 
the Chair in this place and had the opportunity to rule, I would 
have to rule that those amendments are contrary to the bill and 
are therefore out of order.  Therefore we should not need to put 
in time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members talk about time allocation as if it is some kind of 
terrible thing.  But the reality is that when we have 
opposition members simply being obstreperous, simply putting 
forth amendments with no thought whatsoever that are completely

frequent.  Eighty per cent of women with disabilities will be 
victims of sexual abuse in their lifetime.  These statistics are 
shocking but they cannot lead us to despair.  They must spur us

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister really think the answer to Canada's economic 
problems is to raise payroll taxes? 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the OECD report is a very good report.  It supports the 
general thrust and direction the federal government has taken 
since we have assumed office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply remind the hon. member that EI premium rates are today 
the lowest they have been in the last nine years.  The OECD also 
supports a Canada pension plan that is available to all 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
is simply not the case.  The minister has raised taxes more than 
any minister in the history of this country.  We have the highest 
personal income tax load in the G-7, 56% higher than the G-7 
average.  Those are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given those facts, how can the minister say he is following the 
OECD prescription? 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canada's payroll taxes are lower than the G-7 average. 
They are substantially lower than in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we have a Canada pension plan of which 
Canadians are very proud, which is part of the confidence 
building in this country.  Canadians know that when they take 
their retirement they will not be cast aside but will have an 
adequate living. 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let 
us address the issue of the Canada pension plan, this coming from 
the minister who has just fired the chief actuary of the plan 
because he dared to suggest that 9.9% was unsustainable, that it 
would have to go to 10%, 11%, 12% or 13%.  So what does the 
government do?  It fires the independent actuary of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the government's idea of listening to independent 
advice?  It sounds to me like the government has an agenda, an 
agenda to rip off Canadians through their pension system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member knows the government did not fire the 
chief actuary.  He was fired by the superintendent of financial 
institutions who operates an independent agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get back to the real agenda of the Reform Party.  Finally 
the hon. member has admitted it.  What he wants to do is destroy 
the Canada pension plan.  What he wants to do is take away from 
Canadians their right to have a fair and equitable pension. He 
objects to a sharing of risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he is looking for is pensions for the rich and nothing for 
the poor. That has always been their agenda. 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the problem is when the finance minister speaks about 
Reform policy he demonstrates he is truly a stranger to the 
truth.  There is no doubt about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I ask the hon. member to be very judicious 
in his choice of words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Scrooge has nothing on the 
finance minister.  The only appropriate response for the measly 
reduction in EI premiums is bah, humbug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is he is still ripping off Canadian workers to the tune 
of $300 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can the tax crazy finance minister not understand that his 
obsession with high taxes is killing jobs, killing investment, 
killing consumer spending and killing Canadians' dreams of a 
secure financial future? 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, 1.4 million jobs since we have taken office, over 
300,000 jobs this year alone, 57,000 new jobs in the last month. 
We are creating jobs faster than the G-7, faster than the United

<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the finance minister simply does not understand the 
Reform Party's position.  He is dreaming in technicolour.  I 
remind him that the jobs he is so proud of creating were created 
in Ontario and Alberta where they did cut taxes. He can take no 
credit for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He still does not understand so I will ask him very clearly.  He 
knows high payroll taxes and taxes in general kill jobs, 
investment and consumer spending.  When is this message going to 
get through?  When is he going to give Canadians the tax break 
they deserve? 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member says I do not understand the Reform 
position so I will refer to its report.  Reformers would cut EI 
premiums, but for employers only with not a penny for employees. 
How would they pay for that cut?  They would take $3.5 billion 
out of the health transfer. They would take $1 billion out of 
equalization.  They would take $920 million out of funding for 
aboriginal Canadians.

Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has confused the facts so much that 
it is a wonder he can really put a question together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, highways are a provincial jurisdiction.  The 
provinces set the priorities as to where they are built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past there have been different kinds of funding 
arrangements between the federal and provincial governments, but 
it was not until 1997 that the whole issue of tolls came into 
force.  In fact, they were not contemplated in any cost sharing 
agreement before 1997 when New Brunswick decided to apply tolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, of course, have responded to that by saying to them that the 
federal contribution should not be factored in as part of the 
tolling arrangement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am just quoting what the former federal minister said. 
It is his condition.  It is his policy.  He said that the federal 
contribution must stay in that cost sharing agreement and then he 
led the consortium that took that share out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not one cent of provincial money in that highway, even 
though the federal minister, when he was the minister, said it 
had to be there.  He broke the agreement himself.  He broke the

<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians do not rely on the government to tell them the truth 
about the Canada pension plan.  That is why we have an 
independent chief actuary to give us the numbers.  When that 
actuary warned finance officials that the CPP rate would have to 
climb above 10%, he was hauled on the carpet and it was 
suggested, and I suggest none too sweetly, that he change his 
report or else.  Six days later he was out of a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the finance minister allow his officials to pressure Mr. 
Dussault into changing the numbers on the CPP report? 
<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have already answered that question.  There is an 
interim chief actuary who has been appointed, Mr. Hakeman, who is 
extremely well qualified.  In addition, the government has gone 
to the Institute of Actuaries and asked it to suggest names of 
people who would be able to conduct an independent review. 
<P><A NAME="LINK147"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is disturbing to watch the forces of extremism that this minister 
employs to protect his empire.  The auditor general, for 
instance, says that his accounting practices are not right.  He 
says that is too bad.  When the actuary for the EI fund says to 
lower the rate to $2, he says no way.  When the chief actuary for 
the CPP says that the numbers are wrong, he says too bad, you're 
fired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why keep Canadians in suspense?  Since he is going to do 
whatever he wants anyway, why does the finance minister not just 
tell us, is the rate for the CPP 10%, 11%, or 12%?  What has he 
decided today?

made in terms of the EI premiums to the independent commission 
and the independent commission looked at that recommendation.  It 
then made a recommendation which the government accepted.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We took office in 1993. We faced an extremely difficult

being scalded with boiling water, burned, strangled, bludgeoned

<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status

great deal of action over the years to end violence against 
women.  But we know it is not enough.  That is why this summer in 
Iqaluit the federal and provincial status of women ministers came 
together and declared that it is time for all governments to 
cross political barriers, as well as federal and provincial 
barriers, and take comprehensive and co-ordinated action to end 
this.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general said that in 1993 to 1997 the federal

provinces received some 66% of that money while my province of 
Saskatchewan got only 3% and the west some 11.2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why this shortcoming for my province and western Canada?  Is it 
because we do not elect Liberals in the west? 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there were payments made to the member's province 
and other western provinces under the western grain 
transportation fund. There is of course the fact that money has 
lapsed in the highway funding for Manitoba and provinces west. 
This is something that has to be addressed at some point in time. 
That accounts for some of the differences.  There were longer 
term commitments for some of the eastern provinces that were made 
before this government ever came to power.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the minister to explain why the west, with 30% of the

<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, these funding agreements actually came into place 
and they were terminated.  Unfortunately what has happened in the 
last few years is that this government has been preoccupied with 
getting the books in order and dealing with the deficit. As a 
result, we need new funding for highways but not until the funds 
are available.  I think we have to look at the long term 
commitment for highway funding that will deal with western 
Canada's concerns as well as those of the other provinces.

since we are coming to the end of this session before winter

demonstrate all the important legislation that we are going to be 
passing over the next few days.  The Chair will know that it is 
all very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon we will complete the report stage of Bill C-43, 
the very important piece of legislation respecting the revenue 
agency.  Division bells will be held on Monday at 5 p.m., 
pursuant to an order of the House made yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow we shall consider the amendment made by the Senate to 
Bill C-25, the National Defence Act amendment.  I understand that 
this is changing only one or two words. This will be followed by 
report stage and third reading of Bill C-57, the Nunavut courts 
legislation and by reports stage and if possible third reading of 
Bill C-58, the railway safety bill. I understand that there are 
negotiations right now proceeding on Bill C-59, the insurance 
companies legislation, and I will get back to that later because 
so far they are not complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday we will begin with a motion to approve the appointment 
of the commissioner of official languages.  We would then attempt 
to complete any business left over from Friday if such is the 
case. We would following this deal with Bill C-35 respecting 
imports. There are also ongoing discussions concerning Bill S-21, 
the anti-corruption convention.  I indicated that there were also 
discussions on Bill C-59. Finally I do believe that there is 
consent to do the report stage and third reading of Bill C-49, 
the native land claims bill.  Hopefully we can accomplish all 
this business on Monday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday, we will consider the third reading of Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next Wednesday and Thursday the House will hold the annual 
pre-budget debate.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVILEGE 
</H3><P align=left>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
past two years, it has become common, if not systematic, to have 
reports of the standing committees of the House and the content 
of in camera discussions leaked to the media by Liberal members, 
before this information is officially tabled in the House. It 
was the case, over the past two weeks, with the report of the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs on nuclear 
non-proliferation, the report of the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage on amateur and professional sports, and the 
report of the Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and 
Access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such disclosure betrays the spirit and letter that must guide us 
in the tabling of reports from the Liberal majority, along with 
the dissenting opinions of the opposition parties in the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday evening, the report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance on prebudget consultations was no exception. It was 
leaked during the 10 p.m. CBC national news. The Liberal 
majority disclosed some information contained in the committee 
report which serves the interests of the federal government and 
which allowed the Minister of Finance to be in the limelight, to 
promote his tax reduction initiative and spout propaganda about 
the federal government's achievements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is contempt of the House, which may be punished. According 
to Maingot, in chapter 12, page 229: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of 
Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which 
obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House in the 
discharge of his parliamentary duty, or which has a tendency, 
directly or indirectly to produce such results may be treated as 
a contempt even though there is no precedent for the offence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disclosure of a committee report or of the content of in 
camera discussions by members of these committees, before the 
opposition's dissenting opinions are prepared and all the 
information is tabled in the House of Commons, constitutes 
contempt of the House and is a serious breach of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals' way of doing things is also an unforgivable 
affront to the privileges of those parliamentarians who 
respectfully and honourably comply with a rule which, for all 
intents and purposes, practically no longer exists. 
This also hinders the work of members, who make themselves 
available for intensive consultations throughout the country for 
two months and who see the results of their efforts and those of 
all the witnesses who took part in the exercise reduced to 
nought for purely partisan reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This disclosure of the report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance seriously undermines the credibility of the committee 
and of its members and creates an unhealthy working atmosphere 
in which suspicion and disrespect overshadow co-operation, 
loyalty and one's word of honour.  In fact, confidentiality and 
honour no longer seem to hold much meaning for the Liberal 
members of the Standing Committee on Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with these troubling incidents, I respectfully ask you to 
tell the House whether the rule of confidentiality still applies 
to House of Commons committee reports before they are tabled and 
whether it is a rule we must observe out of respect for 
parliamentarism and democracy.  That being the case, I ask you 
to consider the action taken by Liberal members of the Standing 
Committee on Finance as contempt of the House.  And, should you 
agree that it is, I am prepared to move a motion in the House 
that would allow the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs to conduct an inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, however, it turns out that this rule of confidentiality is 
no longer a sacred precept of the parliamentary system, we will 
conduct ourselves accordingly in future.  But it would be very 
unfortunate if that were the case, for the loss of this rule 
would strike a hard blow to democracy and to the credibility of 
this institution we all respect as parliamentarians.

accusation of this hon. member against anyone else in particular. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that, on the substance of the matter, that is whether 
or not it is acceptable for such documents to be leaked, of 
course, the answer is no. I will never agree with that. I have 
too much respect for this institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agreed—was it yesterday or the day before? —to have the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs look into the 
matter. In fact, I discussed this with my parliamentary 
secretary, who happens to chair the committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can be assured of my full co-operation, Mr. Speaker; I will 
do whatever it takes, even amend regulations if necessary, to 
have documents tabled as soon as possible after committee work 
is completed. I too want these leaks to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take issue with the member's allegation that it is members of 
one party in particular who systematically commit these 
offences. I am not so sure about that. Otherwise, I can assure 
you I would have put an end to this practice a long time ago. I 
do not know who is responsible, any more than the hon. member 
does, but, unlike him, I am not accusing anybody. I am simply 
saying that I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want, what we all want, I hope—I think I can speak for 
everyone in this House—is to find a way to end any practice 
that violates our rights and privileges. This is a very good 
example of the kind of thing that happens and should not have 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, I agree with the hon. member. I hope that the 
committee can complete its work, its research, and present its 
findings as soon as possible.

<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question of privilege will address two issues.  First, the 
reporting of this report in the media before being tabled in the 
House is an attack on the dignity of the House.  Second, the 
premature release of this report in the media is an affront to 
the authority of parliament since the finance committee made a 
specific decision to prohibit the publication of this report 
until tabled in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC network last night reported on the details of the 
report.  The CBC in its response to this report used words such 
as “the key recommendations are” and “the emphasis will be 
on”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the front page of the <I>National Post</I> an article says 
that the Commons finance committee will ask the federal cabinet 
to put in place a productivity covenant as one of its key 
prebudget recommendations to the finance minister. Other 
statements in the paper are: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its prebudget report to be tabled tomorrow, the committee 
calls on the... government to— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point the paper used quotation marks, giving the 
impression that it was quoting the actual report: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—“subject all existing government initiatives to an assessment 
which evaluates their expected effects on productivity and hence 
the standard of living of Canadians.  Every budgetary initiative 
should be judged according to this productivity benchmark”. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more disturbing is that on December 2 in the <I>National 
Post</I> Paul Wells wrote about the issue of leaked committee 
reports and made this comment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The catalyst for yesterday's round of soul searching was Reform's 
House leader who rose to complain that yet another committee 
report—this one from the subcommittee on pro sports—was leaked 
to a newspaper. 
The Toronto Star got that one, but we've scooped 
a couple of reports here at the Post. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Journalists are now publicly bragging about obtaining leaked 
reports.  The impression left with the public is that the 
authority and dignity of parliament is a joke.  On page 41 of 
Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I> it 
states that parliament: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—has the right to control and to prohibit the publication of its 
debates or proceedings. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the finance committee there was a discussion about the 
potential for this report being leaked to the media.  There was a 
consensus among all members of the committee that this report 
ought not to be published in the media before it was tabled in 
the House.  Since the committee has the right to prohibit the 
publication of its report, the publication of its report by the 
media is an affront to its authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast let us consider the authority of the courts.  When a 
court orders a ban on the publication of certain elements of a 
trial the media respect that order.  When the House or its 
committees order a ban the media ignore it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we have this situation because committee members do not 
have confidence that the government will seriously consider their 
recommendations.  They go to the media and hope at least to get 
some recognition from the public for their work.  At the same 
time the government views the committee process as a 
communication exercise reducing parliament to a minor bit player 
in the legislative and policy making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of parliament by the government is not subject to 
conventions or law or the Constitution, but it is subject to 
decisions by the communications department of the Prime 
Minister's Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a case this morning when a number of members were 
complaining about how the minister of public works chose to make 
an announcement outside the House regarding the renovations of 
the parliamentary precincts.  It is an example of how the Prime 
Minister's communications department makes decisions based on 
what is good for it, and the traditions of parliament be dammed. 
The media that published the recommendations from the finance 
report should be brought before the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs and asked how they received copies of 
the report.  The other matter to be determined would be whether 
the media deliberately disobeyed an order of the committee and 
whether there is any dignity left for the House to salvage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is the third or fourth time this subject has been 
raised in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I know it is a very serious matter for all members of the 
House and they regard it as serious, I reiterate that if members 
of a particular committee whose report was leaked or scooped or 
whatever feel sufficiently strong about what has happened, and I 
hope they will feel sufficiently strongly about it, they will 
take the steps to provide a fuller factual background for the 
House and not simply delegate this messy problem back to the 
House or delegate it to the committee on procedure and House 
affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If committee members feel strongly about their work on a 
committee they have the ability at that committee to take the 
steps to find out what has happened, then report it to the House. 
The House then deals with a better factual backdrop and takes 
steps perhaps involving discipline, perhaps admonishment. I do 
commend that to members.  Let them take care of their own 
backyard in their committees rather than simply complaining and 
offering it up to the Speaker and to the PHA committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
here we are once again.  I think I have been up in the House 
talking about this issue probably as many as nine times since the 
election, twice this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I probably have a clear idea of what you are going to say.  We 
are getting used to that too, and I understand your position on 
it, which I respect a great deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We brought this issues before procedure and House affairs. We 
talked about it this morning and we will be dealing with the 
issue.  I am not sure what the outcome of that will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware of even the offers that are made by various media to 
members of parliament suggesting that if we get the documents 
first perhaps we can have a front page or we will give a big 
scoop here and a big scoop there.  This is truly a result of 
members responding to that, so the integrity basically falls 
apart.  Once it starts, where does it stop? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned as much as anybody else about the authority, the 
dignity and the integrity of the House of Commons and its 
offices, but obviously some in here are not and that denigrates 
everybody in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues said we are responsible but we are not going to 
tolerate being scooped.  We will not be undersold in the House of 
Commons.  It is to the point now where I have to decide, if this 
cannot be stopped, whether we consider on this side of the House 
that reports in committee are just public documents.  We are not 
going to get into this.  We have upheld what we feel is the 
honourable thing to do and that is not to leak reports.  This is 
continuing consistently and it is getting worse.  I feel obliged 
to put the House on notice that we are not going to tolerate this 
any longer.  These reports have to be considered public because 
we are not going to be out scooped by any of these people who 
lack the integrity and the dignity they are supposed to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to have a long talk with our critics. 
We will get back to the House, but this is the last time I make 
this statement.  We are sick and tired of it, quite frankly, and 
I am not going to allow my colleagues, our critics, to be 
undersold by anybody in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
justice committee experienced the same kind of situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect the suggestion of the hon. member who sits on the 
justice committee that perhaps the committee should be looking at 
this, but there is no process by which we can do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chairs of the committees perhaps should take this seriously. 
If a motion were put by a committee member to the committee to 
look into and investigate to the best of its ability how a leak 
occurred, that would be different.  But I do not know whether the 
hon. member was suggesting that chairs of committees are prepared 
to accept and move on that kind of motion or whether those kinds 
of motions would simply be voted down by the government side.  If 
what I am hearing is a suggestion that we could do that, then 
that signal must come from the government side whose members 
control all the committees.  If that is the case, then perhaps 
these kinds of things will not be brought to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not even bring that issue to the House at the time it 
occurred because I knew how useless it would be. I did not have a 
name to present in conjunction with that complaint.  But I did 
speak to the reporter and I did, in a very diplomatic way, 
suggest he had been used by the government to leak a government 
report prematurely and he admitted that is exactly what happened. 
But when I asked him who was his contact person, he just threw 
his hands in the air and laughed.  I understand he cannot reveal 
and he would not reveal his contacts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is if there is a suggestion that the government side 
of these committees will look into these leaks, I think we will 
get to the bottom of it. I think we will stop at least the usage 
of House time in airing these things and having Mr. Speaker make 
the only decision that you can make when we cannot bring forward 
a name of a member of parliament responsible for the leak.

the second time this week that the same issue has been raised. 
Today, neither the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot nor any

suggestion really. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the House procedure committee to address this 
matter as soon as possible.  I would like some kind of 
recommendation to come forth to the House.

needed to curtail this type of thing.  Collectively members of 
parliament have this power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a first step, and I would like this done urgently, I want the 
procedure committee to deal with this issue and I would like some 
suggestions.  I do not like to go to the next step right away, 
but unless there are some suggestions forthcoming for the 
protection of all of us, then at that time I may consider just to 
have a debate in the House to find out what we will do as a 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One hon. member brought up a very strong point.  I do not know

have a look at it post haste and we will wait and see what the 
outcome of that is.

us as members.  We do our work and I think that in honour we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to correct an impression I left with the House as a result 
of statements I made on November 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In asking a question of the solicitor general respecting a 
flight taken by RCMP Commissioner Murray in the RCMP jet, I 
implied the only reason for the commissioner's flight was to 
attend a retirement party.  As I did not go on to say that the 
commissioner had other business in Vancouver and the timing of 
the RCMP retirement party was established to coincide with the 
trip, it was an unfair representation of the commissioner's 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity to meet with and personally apologize 
to the commissioner and he has accepted my apology.  I believe 
that politicians must be accountable for their statements, both 
in accuracy and fairness, and it is for this reason that I wish 
to register my apology with this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  So noted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to order made yesterday, the House will now proceed to 
Statements by Ministers.

<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the federal government has made a pledge 
to ensure that Canadians will continue to feel secure in their 
homes and on their streets.  Ensuring public safety is at the 
heart of this government's mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having recently been appointed Solicitor General of Canada, I 
want to build on the first annual statement made last year and 
reaffirm the government's commitment to combat organized crime as 
the key part of our public safety agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime is a serious and growing concern.  It is big 
business and it is a national problem that threatens public 
safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year my predecessor released key results of an 
independent study on the impact of organized crime.  The study 
assessed organized crime activity like money laundering, illegal 
drugs, economic crime, people smuggling, contraband smuggling and 
motor vehicle theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study confirmed that organized crime has an impact that goes 
far beyond the obvious violence and economic loss we suffer as a 
society and individually.  It affects the health and safety of 
all Canadians.  It has a devastating impact on our communities, 
our families and those most vulnerable like the elderly and 
youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime is an issue that is and should be a concern for 
all Canadians.  A recent poll shows that nine out of ten 
Canadians consider organized crime to be a serious problem.  This 
tells us our priorities lie in a co-ordinated strategy to 
effectively fight organized crime together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national workshop on organized crime last April was a major 
step toward achieving this objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the policing and law enforcement 
community, the provinces and territories, federal government 
departments and others that participated in this event.  We are 
building on their advice and expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working with all these partners, we have identified a number of 
shared priorities, combating drug abuse and the illicit drug 
trade, addressing high tech crime, fraud and other economic 
crimes, and reinvesting our national police services for an 
integrated national public safety network.

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime is an issue that spans our nation and transcends 
our borders.  No one jurisdiction can effectively act alone. 
Organized crime has no borders; it does not respect them.  At the 
international level we have been working very actively with our 
partners.  Over the past year we have expanded co-operation with 
the United States through the Canada-United States cross border 
crime forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October federal, provincial and territorial ministers 
responsible for justice recognized that organized crime was a 
serious and growing problem.  Their discussion resulted in the 
first ever joint statement on organized crime which set out eight 
shared principles of action.  The statement reinforced Canada's 
commitment to working together in partnership to combat organized 
crime.  I am pleased that the Canadian Association of Chiefs of 
Police strongly and publicly supported the joint statement.  I am 
confident we are on the right track, but we need to step up our 
fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is taking action.  Our next move will be 
to help take the profit out of organized crime.  Early in the new 
year the government will introduce legislation to curb money 
laundering.  These measures will provide new and powerful tools 
for law enforcement in addition to helping us work with our 
international partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged by the recent initiatives to combat organized 
crime that have been undertaken by a number of provinces. I also 
recognize the work of the RCMP and other agencies in my ministry; 
federal departments such as justice, revenue, citizenship and 
immigration; and other police forces and agencies that continue 
to target resources to fight organized crime in a more 
co-ordinated and focused fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My ministry and our partners are fully committed to doing what 
it takes to stamp out organized crime.  I look forward to working 
with CACP, police across the country, and the provinces and 
territories in my new capacity as solicitor general.  Together we 
will work to ensure Canadians continue to enjoy a level of safety 
and security that is unparalleled in the world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
on behalf of the official opposition I welcome the opportunity to 
respond to the solicitor general's statement on the state of 
security in Canada, in particular organized crime.  There is 
overwhelming evidence that organized crime is increasing at an 
alarming rate.  Today's numerous headlines on organized crime 
activities highlight the importance of action and commitment that 
the government get on with its job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that its effects are far reaching and devastating to 
our society both economically and socially.  The Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service is warning of the existence of 18 
international crime rings in Canada.  The CSIS report indicates 
that the cost of international crime to the domestic economy is 
$14.8 billion.  Drug trafficking, dumping of toxic waste, money 
laundering, smuggling of arms, contraband, counterfeiting, 
security frauds, software piracy and auto theft are some of the 
issues under the control of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CSIS is reporting that international crime organizations attack 
the very fabric of life in a democratic law based society like 
Canada.  Criminals involved in organized crime have successfully 
landed in Canada without any opposition due to our lax 
immigration policy and inadequate screening.  Organized crime 
with foreign origins poses a serious threat in many metropolitan 
areas of Canada, particularly on the west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The danger imposed by modern day organized crime is a serious 
and destructive force.  It imperils the security of our citizens 
and our nation.  This threat attacks us in our streets, in our 
businesses and, worst of all, in our school yards.  Organized 
crime is a threat to our economic sovereignty because the cost of 
organized crime in our society is astronomical.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The counterattack will require additional resources, legislation 
and co-operation provincially, federally and internationally. 
Canada cannot afford the continuing lip service the government is 
providing to the problem.  We need resources.  We need action and 
we need it now.  Canadians will only feel safe and confident when 
these resources are committed to this attack.  Crime is 
organized.  So too should government efforts be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join the minister in congratulating the work of the RCMP, 
justice, revenue, citizenship and immigration, and others.  I 
presume the minister also congratulates CSIS on its work.  All 
these agencies must work together if they are to be successful in 
the war on organized crime.  Effort must be made to avoid a 
duplication of resources and investigation by the agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking today's headlines as an example, “CSIS warns of 18 
international crime rings in Canada” and “RCMP charge four with 
eastern European crime links”, we must ensure there is no 
overlapping and squandering of essential but limited resources. 
In summary, no turf wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has said that crime respects no borders.  I would 
go even further and remind the minister that all those borders 
are not defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a related issue, according to a study published by Carleton 
University, Canada is especially susceptible to economic spies 
because it is one of the world's most open and trade dependent 
countries.  CSIS has warned that computer hackers pose a serious 
threat to national security.  Terrorists could hack into 
government networks to sabotage and steal important valuable 
information.  CSIS's own computer network was broken into.  It 
has been reported that the RCMP web site has been tampered with. 
A recent CSIS presentation shows that 28 federal departments have 
been hacked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Control of information is critical and concerns are not 
restricted to cyberspace.  The government even has trouble with 
low tech like ink on paper.  This past week access to 
confidential documents has been made easier, thanks to the 
federal government's decision to let contracts to bankrupt 
companies that are supposed to shred confidential documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  The documents were shipped out in their 
entirety, not shredded or burned as required, to destinations 
like China and Korea.  The government has not retrieved the 
documents.  Nor does it seem to care.  Some of these files were 
so highly classified by the privy council and national defence 
they should have been burned in front of witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's cavalier attitude does little to assure 
Canadians that their privacy and security has not and will not be 
breached.  I urge the government to get on with the job.  It 
seems that sometimes with the government more is said than done. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House today, but I am also a little bit 
disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me, the ministerial statement by the solicitor general is 
nothing but lip service. It is a perfect example of the kind of 
promises the Liberal government makes, promises that are based 
on noble principles but, unfortunately, never materialize. The 
statement by the solicitor general is just cheap talk, despite 
the fact that nine Canadians out of ten think organized crime is 
a serious problem in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is even more so since recent events have shed some light on 
the true role of the solicitor general within the government. As 
we know, his predecessor was forced to resign and even admitted 
that he was covering for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing can lead us to believe that the new solicitor general 
will be able to follow through on the intentions expressed in 
his annual statement. His role will be limited to that of the 
Prime Minister's valet, especially considering the fact that no 
Liberal member seems to have what it takes to be a true 
solicitor general. The solicitor general is really just a front. 
The true solicitor general is the Prime Minister and his staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering seems to be the new priority of this 
government. We must applaud this awakening that is kind of 
sudden but oh so salutary if we want to fight organized crime 
effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context, the Bloc Quebecois, through me, has introduced 
Bill C-435 to withdraw the thousand dollar note from circulation. 
It is a simple legislative measure which, according to several 
experts who were consulted, would really hurt the gangsters who 
threaten our comfort and our safety.

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one can dispute the merit of the legislative measure the Bloc 
Quebecois has proposed.  Canada is in fact the only western 
country with bills of such large denomination in circulation. 
In addition, it is a lot easier for money launderers to go about 
with ten $1,000 bills than with a suitcase full of $20s or $50s. 
It is worth noting that a study in the United States showed 
recently that most $100 bills bore traces of cocaine.  We might 
well ask ourselves what is to be found on $1,000 bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further bit of information.  The Bank of Canada determined in 
August that 3,372,000 $1,000 bills were in circulation.  In 
addition, 128,286,000 $100 bills are in circulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Withdrawing the $1,000 bill would be a positive step for the 
government.  It has the support of a number of representatives 
of the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding, I would point out that the government should 
swallow its pride, stop being arrogant with the opposition and 
the public at large and give Bill C-435, which I introduced on 
September 24, proper attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would show it is not simply a government of verbiage, but 
that it intends to take specific measures to fight this cancer 
known as money laundering and organized crime. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is always a pleasure to follow the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg.  I take this opportunity to welcome the new 
solicitor general to his new post.  He is, like myself, an 
islander.  He comes from perhaps a more gentle island, a little 
less rugged than my own, but from parts of my island we can look 
across the channel and see his island.  That is as nice as I will 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move now to address some of the comments he made today in 
his report.  First I suggest that he wants to build upon the last 
report which came before the House a year ago.  It will be tough 
going because there is very little foundation to build upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last year the commitments made by the previous solicitor 
general to combat organized crime have not come to any kind of 
fruition.  Indeed, all we have heard is another statement of what 
they hope to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read the definition of organized crime from the 
government's own document.  It includes economically motivated 
illicit activity undertaken by any group, association or other 
body consisting of two or more individuals.  It is beginning to 
sound like we might include leaked documents in this definition, 
given the point of order today.  The definition also includes, as 
I have suggested, formally or informally organized, negative 
impact of said activity, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The types of organized crime that take place in Canada would be 
shocking to Canadians.  It includes money laundering.  It 
includes the sale of illegal drugs.  It includes, which I think 
is particularly shocking especially to the generation following 
us, environmental crime and the way hazardous waste is either 
sold or hidden in the country.  It includes contraband, economic 
crime, fraud, migrant trafficking and motor vehicle theft.  The 
cost of these activities is in the billions of dollars.  The cost 
to the health of Canadians, particularly young Canadians, of the 
illicit drug trade is staggering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a statement from the government's document on the 
organized crime impact study which deals with the seizures of 
illicit drugs and the increase in the use of crack among 
adolescents, which has gone from 0.5% in 1993, the year when I 
believe that party took power, to 1.9% in 1995.  There has been a 
gradual increase in the use of illicit drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These types of activities require urgent action.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time that we have this report and the government 
talks about the need to combat organized crime, we have seen the 
downsizing of the RCMP.  We have seen the training centre in 
Regina suffer from funding cuts.  We have seen RCMP offices in 
British Columbia suffer from funding cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party call upon the government to 
reinvest in the necessary policing forces if we are going to 
actually be tough on crime in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the statement of the solicitor general.  I look 
forward to working with him in a constructive way to combat 
organized crime in this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I also want to begin by congratulating the new 
solicitor general, who is an Atlantic Canadian.  I can certainly 
say that he is going to have his hands full in the next number of 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that today's statement is an absolute and utter 
disappointment coming from the solicitor general.  It really 
consists of nothing more than another promise in a long line of 
promises from the Liberal government to introduce new anti-money 
laundering legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the fourth time in two years that the Solicitor General 
of Canada has made this specific promise.  The present minister 
is the third consecutive minister to make the promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me refresh the memory of the current solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1996, at a summit on organized crime, the solicitor 
general of the day spoke of the grave concerns with the same 
grave words used by the solicitor general today regarding the 
increased threat posed by organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general at that time promised to introduce new 
legislation to enact new financial reporting requirements 
regarding suspicious transactions and cross-border money 
movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirteen months ago, in November 1997, the solicitor general's 
immediate predecessor stood in the House and delivered his first 
and last ministerial statement on organized crime.  He too 
promised anti-money laundering legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April of the same year, the same solicitor general reiterated 
the same promise to yet again introduce anti-money laundering 
legislation at an organized crime summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government held summits and made promises, organized 
crime continued to increase and flourish in this country.  In 
particular, Canada has earned the unsavoury international 
reputation as one of the better places in the world for criminals 
to hide their illegal cash.  That is not a partisan comment on my 
part.  That is the conclusion of the U.S. State Department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its annual report on the international narcotics control 
strategy, the State Department of the United States called Canada 
“an easy target for drug related and other types of money 
laundering”. The report also put Canada in the same low category 
as Brazil and the Cayman Islands for its organized crime.  The 
U.S. State Department also cited Canada's weak money laundering 
laws as the main reason our country is viewed as a safe haven for 
many international criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More promises from this solicitor general are not good enough. 
The law enforcement community is tired of the promises and is 
tired of hearing about pending legislation.  They want action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not unlike the Minister of Justice, who has repeatedly 
expressed her commitment to table young offender legislation in 
this House.  We are still waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1998, a senior CSIS official said that organized crime 
in this country was at a crisis level.  It is ironic that 
yesterday's report from CSIS indicated that there are 
international crime syndicates operating in this country.  They 
have identified 18 international crime syndicates operating at 
this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's repeated broken promises to introduce new 
legislation against organized crime have kept Canada's doors 
open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also extremely disappointed that the solicitor general 
decided not to address the organized crime funding crunch in any 
meaningful way in his remarks.  The platitudes ring quite hollow 
for all law enforcement agencies when they do not see the dollars 
coming from this government to back them up.  Simply recognizing 
the problem is not good enough.  Calling it serious is not good 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initiatives in pending legislation do not cut it.  Last spring I 
challenged the solicitor general of the day to justify the $74 
million cut in this fiscal year to the RCMP's organized crime 
budget.  The solicitor general said that my information was 
wrong, much in the same way he denied having an inappropriate 
conversation with Fred Toole, much in the same way the Minister 
of Transport denied allegations today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those allegations came from the commissioner of the RCMP and the 
auditor general.  The fact is that the RCMP in their documents 
indicate that $74 million or 13% was cut from RCMP funding for 
policing services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was reaffirmed in a letter of July 1998 from the RCMP 
commissioner.  The one and only strategic priority of the RCMP 
federal policing services is protection against organized crime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specific responsibilities of federal policing services include 
the government's anti-smuggling initiative, proceeds of crime, 
coastal enforcement, immigration enforcement and the criminal 
intelligence program.  These areas are all in decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the solicitor general honestly expect this House or the 
RCMP, our national policing organization, to do its job in 
fighting organized crime when the budget has been absolutely 
gutted by the finance minister?  Both the solicitor general's 
predecessor and the RCMP commissioner publicly called for more 
resources to combat organized crime.  Front line police officers 
in every major Canadian city from St. John's to Vancouver are 
overwhelmingly asking that this resource be allocated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not matter what the solicitor general says unless he is 
prepared to back up the words.  The presence of biker gangs on 
the streets of Canada is becoming all too common a sight.  The 
strongest message that the solicitor general could give today 
against organized crime would be to restore funding.  Instead we 
get more of the rhetoric that we have heard time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's statement by the new solicitor general provided him with 
a golden opportunity to put his own stamp on his new ministry and 
to prove that he is more than just a nice guy who is busy 
undergoing on-the-job training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>RCMP, CSIS, corrections officers, customs officers and all of 
our law enforcement officers deserve our congratulations, 
particularly given what they are working with these days.  I urge 
the new solicitor general, if nothing else, if he really wants to 
do something about organized crime, to visit the finance minister 
and make a strong pitch for what is needed, more funding.

disappointed and even outraged to see that we are being gagged 
once again to put an end prematurely to the debate on Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why establish a customs and revenue agency? The Minister of 
National Revenue told us that changes in his department were 
needed to achieve certain objectives, namely to ensure quality 
services at a lower cost, fair administration, modern and 
effective management and, of course, parliamentary 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the minister must redefine methods and 
procedures within his department in order to achieve his 
objectives. However, changing the container does not necessarily 
means changing the contents. The minister naively believes 
that establishing this agency will make all the problems within 
his department disappear as if by magic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of serious problems within the Department of National 
Revenue, instead of putting all his energy into solving these 
problems, the minister is creating a monster that nobody wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there is a lot of work that needs to be done in the 
Department of National Revenue, because there are many problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, the auditor general, in chapter 15 of his 
September 1998 report entitled “Promoting Integrity in Revenue 
Canada”, talked about several incidents of misconduct within 
that department. We know that the nature of Revenue Canada's 
activities calls for a high level of integrity. 
The integrity of the organization is, therefore, an asset in 
that it impacts on the behaviour of those with whom Revenue 
Canada has business dealings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the auditor general, the establishment of the 
Canada customs and revenue agency will not solve the problems. 
In addition, the auditor general tabled his December 1998 report 
on Tuesday, and this included chapter 24 “Revenue 
Canada—International Tax Directorate: Human Resource 
Management”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the International Tax Directorate is the focal 
point for all questions relating to international tax rules.  We 
also know that international operations are liable to weaken the 
tax base. 
We know that international tax is a rapidly developing area with 
strong possibilities as far as tax receipts are concerned, but 
that there are serious problems in the human resources area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Key positions have been staffed by secondment, reassignment or 
acting positions. Only 52% of current headquarters staff are 
permanent in their positions.  The auditor general feels that 
frequent staff movements are a cause for concern in that they 
prevent the directorate from maintaining the levels of 
experience and qualifications required for the work to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also states as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of the new agency will not in itself resolve 
the problems outlined in this chapter. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first case, in the interests of fair administration, the 
minister should take all steps possible to ensure the integrity 
of all employees in his department before thinking about 
establishing such an agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second case, that of international taxes, it is much more 
obvious that the establishment of the agency will resolve none 
of what is going on because it is to the advantage of large 
companies operating internationally.  They make in the 
neighbourhood of $250 billion, which is an enormous tax base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International tax experts in big business are, for the most 
part, specialists from Revenue Canada or experts who have been 
sent there on special training assignments.  At some point, we 
come up against a lack of competence at Revenue Canada, but 
considerable expertise in big business. 
Big business takes advantage of the system, with the result that 
the international tax base dwindles, to the detriment of 
taxpayers who must shoulder an increasingly heavy tax burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government actually wants is to abdicate its political 
authority because it is incapable of assuming its 
responsibilities and making the necessary changes in its 
department and because it wants to hang on to the existing 
international tax system in order to benefit big business with 
its international transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government wants is to create a bank of handouts for 
its friends and supporters of the party, both with respect to 
administrators and with respect to big business and its 
international transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody wants this agency, not the provinces, not Quebec, not the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business and not Revenue 
Canada employees.  The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to the 
establishment of the Canada customs and revenue agency.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted to address Bill C-43 this afternoon, a bill introduced 
by the minister of revenue and Canadian Olympics lobbyist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had ample opportunity to debate Bill C-43 here in the 
House.  Why do we keep wanting to debate it?  It is that we 
think, perhaps unreasonably, that our Liberal friends, our 
friends in the government, might listen to reason on the fact 
that all those concerned will be affected directly or 
indirectly, in one way or another. 
They fear the passage of this bill and the fact that the way it 
is implemented could harm them and take away their 
responsibilities and their independence in their respective 
areas of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we are talking about SMBs, cities, provinces, or the 
largest of businesses, I think there is a consensus.  We are 
wondering why, in the face of such unanimity, the government is 
so obstinate?  It says “We want to continue, we want to 
continue, we want to continue”.  There is perhaps something a 
bit twisted there.  We may well ask.  Perhaps there is downright 
obstinacy on the part of the government and the minister 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the minister, in lobbying for Vancouver to hold the 
Olympic Games, forgot the file on his desk and his officials to 
the opportunity to move it along. 
However, I would be surprised if it were unionized staff because 
the 40,000 unionized employees at Revenue Canada stand to lose 
their rights and entitlements if the minister relinquishes his 
responsibilities and shifts them to an agency like the one he is 
proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While he was off campaigning for the Olympic Games in Vancouver 
at the expense of other municipalities, his employees, his 
staff, were moving this bill along, not accepting amendments and 
refusing to hear reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his fine speeches and his press releases, the minister kept 
saying “Yes, but we consulted”. Consultation has become a 
government catch phrase. True, they did consult. But did they 
listen during these consultations? Did they listen to those they 
consulted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, through the minister, says the provinces agree. 
The fact is that there is not a single province that agrees to 
have an agency like this one. This agency would be authorized to 
collect federal taxes. It may also be authorized to collect 
provincial taxes. I read speeches from Reformers, saying “This 
is good, because in British Columbia, it is total chaos in this 
respect. Therefore, it is OK for big brother in Ottawa to come 
out and say it can put your fiscal house in order”. This 
authority could extend to the collection of municipal taxes, and 
even to school taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an agency would definitely step in exclusive provincial 
jurisdictions, not only in Quebec but also in all the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government turns a deaf ear to the provinces, small and 
medium size businesses, public servants, members of the 
opposition, perhaps it is because it has a superiority complex 
or thinks it is perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, during the television program <I>Maisonneuve à l'écoute</I>, 
Pierre Maisonneuve asked the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs “Do you not find that you often sound like a grandfather 
with his grandchildren, or a father with his children?” This was 
said by Pierre Maisonneuve. “You seem to be saying I am the one 
who is right. Listen children, provinces, premiers and other 
provincial officials, I can hear your whining, but it is just 
whining”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like parents with teenagers. Parents tell them “you can 
argue all you want, father knows best”. There was a program with 
that very title. This is how the federal government seems to be 
behaving. 
The federal government is the only one in step. The others are 
all out of step. One wonders.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the provinces, the Bloc Quebecois and several other 
parties and stakeholders opposed to a bill like this one? 
Primarily, although not exclusively, because of the government's 
loss of accountability to the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is increasingly dumping its responsibilities. 
Could it be that it is becoming lazy? Is this the idea of a 
party in office? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of this agency, if it comes about, 
unfortunately will result in a loss of accountability. 
Some of my colleagues said “Just imagine asking the minister to 
explain a scandal of one kind or another involving the agency”. 
The minister would reply “It is not our responsibility. This is 
an independent agency for which the government is no longer 
responsible. We will ask questions, but it is no longer my 
responsibility”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The loss of accountability and responsibility on the part of a 
minister is like the lobbying minister for Vancouver, who just 
told us “I want to get rid of some of my responsibilities”. It 
also makes us worry about the huge powers that this agency could 
use. It would get these powers through the people appointed by 
the Liberal government to the agency's board of management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the board of directors of the agencies that were 
set up recently, it is not surprising to realize that true grits 
make up the majority of the board members. This agency that will 
collect taxes throughout Canada will be controlled and managed 
by people appointed by the Prime Minister. Things never change, 
which is why the people who have considered the issue and have 
legitimate concerns are not feeling too happy and secure right 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about the approximately 40,000 public servants at 
Revenue Canada who will no longer come under the Public Service 
Employment Act if this bill is passed? For these public 
servants, this means losing the fundamental rights to be 
protected they currently enjoy as employees of Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we not taking into consideration the views of small 
businesses, which have said unanimously or by a clear majority 
that they are against such a bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the questions my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois and 
members of the other parties as well as provinces and businesses 
have put to the minister but remain unanswered. I would like to 
know why the minister does not want to sit down with the 
provinces and why he does not want to examine how Quebec manages 
to harmonize the GST with the QST and then send what we owe to 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know where we stand in Quebec, in this respect. 
The Heritage Minister often talks about “victims” in the House. 
However if there are concrete and positive achievements, why not 
draw from their example?  Why always try to interfere with 
something that works in Quebec or another province? The federal 
father or grandfather is always explaining to his children that 
they did well, but he is capable of doing better.  He will crush 
the work of a province, a municipality or a region to prove he 
is the best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Bloc Quebecois are speaking on behalf of revenue 
employees, small businesses and individuals, and they are saying 
to the minister: “Listen.  Listen to us.  Listen to them.  Stop 
the juggernaut of tax collection. 
Let us work together on changes that will bring harmony”. But 
for the federal government “harmony” means to implement what we 
have decided, because anything we decide is good for you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers have had enough for a long time, but now we are 
hearing the same thing from other provinces which are saying: 
“That's enough.  Hold everything and listen to us”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
some hon. members in the course of this debate have said that 
they cannot support this bill unless it includes provisions 
ensuring that taxpayers are fairly and impartially treated by the 
agency. 
In effect they want to entrench the taxpayers bill of rights in 
the legislation itself.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind hon. members that in 1985 Revenue Canada 
was the first revenue administration to proclaim the rights of 
taxpayers with its declaration of taxpayer rights. This 
declaration is entrenched in the day to day operations of the 
department and is part of the public service's ethos that will 
carry over to the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43 also ensures that the Minister of National Revenue 
will continue under the agency to be accountable to the public 
and to parliament for all aspects of the agency's performance, 
including the way officials exercise program authorities such as 
assessing and collecting taxes and duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the agency members of parliament will continue to be able 
to deal directly with the Minister of National Revenue to resolve 
their constituents' problems.  If there is ever a problem of 
abuse of power, the minister will have both the authority and the 
responsibility to correct it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Revenue launched a fairness initiative 
in March of this year to solicit feedback on the fairness of 
Revenue Canada programs.  To ensure the entire process would be 
objective, Revenue Canada partnered with the Conference Board of 
Canada to analyse the results, hold a national symposium to 
verify priorities, and produce an independent report. According 
to this independent report, Revenue Canada is well regarded among 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to assure hon. members that feedback from 
consultations show that Canadians are pleased with the current 
declaration of taxpayer rights. The conference board report 
specifically states that Revenue Canada has already made 
significant strides in making fairness an ongoing part of every 
employee's job and that it is well equipped to provide fairness 
to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many suggestions have been received to make further improvements 
to the fairness of Revenue Canada.  Department officials are in 
the process of developing an action plan for the minister's 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to not being necessary, adding a taxpayers bill of 
rights to the agency legislation would have the effect of 
amending program legislation such as the Income Tax Act. 
Provisions such as those proposed should therefore be directed 
specifically at that act and other similar statutes that the 
agency would administer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some hon. members have also argued that five years is too long 
to wait for a parliamentary committee to review and assess the 
new agency.  I would like to assure those hon. members that there 
is nothing to prevent parliament from undertaking an additional 
review at an earlier date, if considered necessary. Allowing a 
period of five years to elapse before a formal review is 
undertaken is a fairly common approach in federal statutes. The 
reason for this timeframe is to give the agency adequate time to 
implement and fine tune its policies and to operate for a 
sufficient length of time for an effective assessment to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind hon. members that parliament will have other 
opportunities to assess the agency on an ongoing basis. It will 
review the agency's corporate business plan, just as it now 
reviews Revenue Canada's plan.  It will also review the agency's 
annual report regarding its performance during the preceding 
year.  Before the agency can spend any money, parliament will 
have to approve the appropriations just as it does now for 
Revenue Canada.  Finally, the auditor general will be the 
agency's auditor and will report to parliament just as he does 
for Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some hon. members have proposed that even if passed by 
parliament, this bill should not be proclaimed in force without 
the approval of at least one-half of the provinces.  There is no 
reason or rationale why the federal parliament would make coming 
into force of this federal statute subject to provincial 
approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure hon. members that the agency would provide the 
means to serve the collective interests of the federal, 
provincial and territorial governments as well as the national 
interest by setting the right conditions for even greater 
co-ordination in tax administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would stress that there is no obligation on the part of any 
province to have the agency administer more programs on its 
behalf.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency is about creating options and opportunities for the 
provinces.  It must earn the business of the provinces and would 
be well placed to do so once it is established. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All provinces, except Quebec, have left a door open to allow the 
agency to deliver services to them. Detailed agreements may not 
be signed until the agency has been established. This is why I 
invite all members of the House to support the bill so the 
agency can reach agreements with provinces to eliminate 
duplication. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-43, an act to establish the Canada 
Customs and Revenue Agency. This bill establishes an agency that 
will enforce and administer the Income Tax Act instead of 
Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, which was introduced by the government last June, is 
a result of the Speech from the Throne in the previous 
Parliament. At the time, the government announced its intention 
to set up a national revenue recovery agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has followed up on this and proposes in Bill C-43 
to establish a semi-independent agency that will be responsible 
for collecting all taxes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency would administer all forms of taxes, from provincial 
sales taxes to taxes on gas and liquor, on a country-wide basis. 
There is, to say the least, cause for concern when a single 
agency is given so much power, specially in an area of such 
importance as taxes. I believe we are justified in asking if the 
real interests of citizens can be protected by the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, this superagency will be able to expand its powers 
even more if provinces and municipalities accept. Indeed, 
according to the bill, this agency will be responsible for 
negotiating with interested parties to collect all forms of 
taxes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the numerous efforts of senior officials of Revenue Canada 
convince the provinces to allow Ottawa to administer their tax 
programs have failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government tabled its bill, not a single new tax 
administration agreement with any province was in sight, and not 
even a single letter of intent had been signed by a province to 
be part of an agreement. Quebec and Ontario categorically 
refused to even consider the possibility of dealing with the 
agency. Even P.E.I. has indicated that it is not ready to 
transfer further tax powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons for creating this agency is doomed to failure 
from the outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces simply do not want to relinquish to the federal 
government what little taxation power they have left. Quebec is 
no exception. The creation of a huge tax collection agency 
through which the governments hopes to extend its powers flies 
in the face of Quebec's position and demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, the Quebec government is all for improving tax 
legislation administration, which should be streamlined, but not 
at the expense of its own administrative authority. One way of 
making the system more efficient would be to have all tax 
collection operations, both provincial and federal, concentrated 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec revenue department already collects the income tax 
and other taxes in Quebec, as well as the GST. It could also 
collect the federal income tax.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's proposal is to have the Quebec revenue department 
collect all taxes in Quebec. Unlike the proposed federal agency, 
this department is fully accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find profoundly disturbing the concept of an agency not 
reporting directly to a government being responsible for all tax 
collection activities. How can we make sure such an agency will 
give priority to the public interest rather than to its own 
interests? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, in this era of computers and e-mail, many companies buy and 
sell confidential data. 
It is normal to wonder whether an agency, which will be less 
accountable than a department such as Revenue Canada, will be 
able to adequately protect people's privacy. It is easy to 
imagine the wealth of personal and financial information that 
could be concentrated in the hands of this body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, with the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, we are 
talking about 40,000 employees, that is 20 per cent of the whole 
public service that from now on will be at the mercy of the 
agency's board of management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 30(1) of the bill states that “The Agency has authority 
over all matters relating to general administrative policy in 
the Agency; the organization of the Agency; Agency real 
property; and personnel management, including the determination 
of the terms and conditions of employment of persons employed by 
the Agency.” Therefore, the Agency will have the power to raise 
or lower salaries, hire and fire employees and improve the 
managerial staff's terms and conditions of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, there is a very different salary scale in the 
private sector. Just think of the large banks' CEOs, for 
example. Everything in the current market suggests that 
officials and managers will be very well paid, whereas the 
working conditions of support staff, processing officers and so 
on will not be as good. This is hardly reassuring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said it wanted to modernize the public service 
and improve the way fiscal legislation is implemented. But it is 
on the wrong track with the establishment of this agency. 
Modernization and privatization are not synonymous. It is 
unfortunate that the government did not try instead to work 
together with the public service unions in order to find ways to 
improve the system. There is nothing to suggest that the agency, 
as defined in Bill C-43, will improve anything. Quite the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, according to a study by the Public Policy 
Forum, 40% of the businesses surveyed saw no advantage to this 
agency, and more than two thirds felt that it would increase or 
maintain their costs and, therefore, would have no positive 
effect in that sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the structure proposed in Bill C-43 adds another level 
of bureaucracy in the form of an appointed board of management, 
which would only have a supervisory role, or so the Liberals 
say. Nevertheless, this board will require time, money and 
additional staff, and the agency will still be accountable to 
Treasury Board for administrative issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the government is keeping all the old mechanisms in place 
while adding this new board. This means that we end up with yet 
another level of bureaucracy that makes the system even more 
cumbersome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just do not understand. 
If the mechanisms are the same and if, as the government says, 
the minister and his staff will still have control and will make 
sure the agency is transparent, then we certainly have good 
reason to wonder what purpose this agency will serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government saying these things to ease our concerns and 
is it planning to eventually give more latitude to this agency, 
or is it simply trying to shirk its responsibilities and to 
distance itself, among other things, from negotiations with the 
provinces on tax administration issues?

as fundamental as enforcing the Income Tax Act cannot be 
performed by an agency such as the one proposed in Bill C-43.

of our tax system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-43 
establishing the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the labour critic for the Bloc Quebecois I feel concerned by 
this bill. As the member for Manicouagan just mentioned, 20% of 
the public service of Canada will disappear, that is 40,000 
employees. This agency will be a quasi-private business, and it 
will be independent from the whole government administration. In 
our view this goes against public interest and it will also 
change the working conditions that prevail in the federal public 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also remind the House that this bill, slipped by us in 
June, at the end of the last session, is very insidious, 
particularly in an historical perspective. 
While I am not a constitutional law specialist, I know that this 
bill really goes against the spirit of the Constitution of 
Canada and of the Canadian confederation, two words that are no 
longer used because, over the decades, Canada has miraculously 
evolved from a confederation to a federation of provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is a perfect example 
of this. Again last night, we saw him on television mixing up 
issues and concepts. It is as if two and two no longer make 
four. It is difficult to know where this country is going and 
this is just the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People should know that the authority to collect income tax was 
the exclusive prerogative of the provinces in the spirit of the 
1867 Canadian confederation. 
Now the federal government, as it did before during economic 
crises or wars, is assuming the right to tax Canadians directly, 
going against the spirit of Confederation. This we can never 
stress enough, particularly on the eve of a debate as important 
as that on the Canadian social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this spirit we must be grateful and perhaps do like previous 
governments, such as the Duplessis government in 1954, which 
invoked the Constitution and its spirit when levying direct 
taxation. We must thank him for having done so because we can 
now rationally think and dream of making Quebec sovereign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Quebec government had not assumed this right to direct 
taxation, if it were still at the mercy of the federal 
government, historically, where would Quebec be? Where would the 
distinct society be? Where would our distinct character be? It 
is because of direct taxation that Quebec can, in conformity 
with the spirit of the Canadian Constitution—keep its dreams 
alive and reach its full development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the historical aspect I just mentioned. As a member of 
parliament, something else worries me in this bill. The bill 
uses wording found in a speech by the President of the Treasury 
Board and talks of modernizing the public service. That was the 
term used when unemployment insurance was reformed. The 
unemployment insurance reform gave birth to employment 
insurance. As the months have gone by, we have come to see what 
came out of that. Previously, about 80% of those paying 
unemployment insurance were eligible for benefits. Now, after 
modernization, 42% of those paying employment insurance can 
become claimants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Buzz words like “modernizing the public service” scare me. 
They indicate that the government has some very neo-liberal 
projects or intents. They are very anti-union and anti-labour. 
They encourage a weakening of the middle class and of unions, 
widening the gap between the rich and the poor in our society. 
They are the reason for statistics like the ones published today 
indicating that child poverty is growing in this country, in 
spite of the commitments the government made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These results did not appear as if by magic. They are the 
outcome of decisions made secretly without any of us being 
really made aware that they have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect one must remember in this bill is it will reduce 
once again the role of Parliament. Parliaments are more and more 
weakened, not only in Canada, but in all the western world, 
because elected representatives can no longer ask for 
accountability and the executive longer has any accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These past years, especially in the transportation area, very 
important decisions have resulted in the fact that Parliament 
can no longer ask for accountability in the management of public 
assets. I am thinking of Nav Canada and air traffic controllers, 
who used to be part of the department of transport.  When faced 
with certain decisions elected representatives used to be able 
to ask questions and question the government. This is no longer 
possible. This is a private agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking of Air Canada, where I met with union 
representatives last week. The union is very worried about the 
experiment under way at the Ottawa airport, where automated 
tellers will replace some Air Canada employees. They will 
directly serve clients, eventually causing massive layoffs. 
Parliament has no authority to ask for accountability because 
Air Canada has been privatized. Likewise with the CN, where they 
made massive layoffs but we were unable to talk about it here 
because it is a private agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And I did not mention the Canadian food inspection agency that 
was established a few months ago. Elected representatives could 
question the government on its management, but they cannot 
anymore, because it is a private agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take the ADM, Mirabel-Dorval. 
The government hid behind this organization and said it could do 
nothing. It gave a mandate to ADM and experts, who did what they 
could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, whom can we hold accountable? How is public 
interest served in all this? What is left for taxpayers who pay 
their taxes and see decisions being made which have an impact on 
their daily lives? Parliamentarians, who are asked questions—whom 
else can people ask but their elected representatives?—will have 
to give up sooner or later because they will not have the 
authority to hold accountable those who should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is losing control. This is very serious. This is 
very neo-liberal. This is very undemocratic. 
Disappointingly, this is done with the approval of senior 
officials, who instead of having the best interests of the 
public at heart only have theirs. Here is what is written in a 
clause on the loyalty directors will have to have for the 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 42.(1) states, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every director of the Agency, exercising their powers and 
performing their duties and functions, must 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>a) act honestly and in good faith, with a view to the best 
interests of the Agency—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the public interest when the bill refers to the best 
interests of the agency, an agency that is partly privatized and 
that will soon be fully privatized? The clause reads “must 
act... with a view to the best interests of the agency”. It is 
immoral to write such things. When one is paid by the state, one 
should act in the public interest. It is our first 
responsibility. We act on behalf of the state, not even on 
behalf of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members know how things work. A government that puts things like 
that in its legislation is not even trying to hide its intent, 
and this must be condemned. I cannot understand that the 
Canadian elites have not done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Quebec, this is a great lesson, in view of what we will all 
be called on to ponder. 
This is a unitary Canada, a centralized Canada, in which the 
provinces will become regional governments and in which Ottawa 
will control everything. This may be good for Canada—it is 
their problem—but it is obvious that Quebec must get out of 
this crazy situation as soon as possible, otherwise Quebeckers 
will become increasingly diminished and enslaved in that 
Canadian federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Yukon, the Environment; the hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, AIDS. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
wish to dedicate my speech to the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
I believe her to be a minister who has shown open-mindedness in 
the past, and I believe she has an understanding of  a number of 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask her, through you, Madam Speaker, to give a 
warm hand to our colleague, the hon. member for 
Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, who has done an excellent job for the 
official opposition in connection with Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> I am asking the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
to join in our enthusiasm and feign applause at least for Mayor 
L'Allier.  I believe she needs encouragement to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel obliged to explain to everyone listening why we, as a 
responsible opposition, I would even venture to say one of the 
best oppositions ever in the House of Commons, are opposed to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps:</B> Let's not get carried away here. We were in 
opposition too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> —this bill, which creates the Canada customs and 
revenue agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members should take just a second to imagine what it will 
mean if we pass this bill—and I cannot imagine in my wildest 
dreams that the hon. member for Hamilton East would stand up and 
vote in favour of such a bill. If we pass this bill it will mean 
that we have no belief in ministerial accountability and no 
belief in the quality of the Public Service of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If such a bill is passed, in one fell swoop, without any 
warning, and in a cavalier, peremptory and grotesque manner, 20% 
of the Public Service of Canada is eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to tell all ministers present, and I wish to tell the 
somewhat left-leaning wing of the Liberal Party personified in 
the heritage minister, that if they want to show interest in the 
public service, they ought to call for anti-scab legislation with 
all their might.  If the Liberals want to do something about the 
public service, what needs to be done is not getting rid of 
people but addressing the real problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to legislate labour relations, why does 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage not rise and congratulate the 
Bloc Quebecois, which since the early 1990s, when it appeared in 
the House, when she was on this side and was the Rat Pack 
incarnate in her vehemence, why does she not rise and 
congratulate the Bloc for having introduced antiscab legislation 
very early on?  Is this not democratic?  Is that not honourable? 
Is this not an issue the government should raise? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a whole lot of legislation we would support as the 
opposition, but do not ask me or the members of the Bloc to 
support this centralizing, anti-union, anti-province pile of 
papers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a challenge to put to our ministers present.  I would 
like the Minister of Canadian Heritage to stop writing and 
listen.  Perhaps she could tell us if there is one province 
supporting her bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge her to rise.  We all know her sweet voice that is 
sometimes cruelly silenced in Oral Question Period.  Could she 
tell us as Minister of Canadian Heritage and to the best of her 
knowledge—I know she is not responsible for this and has her 
arms full at the moment—but could she tell us if she can 
whether one province, her province of Ontario for example, 
supports this bill?  Does her friend Mike Harris support a bill 
like this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps:</B> He is certainly no friend of mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> We know full well that there is no support for 
this bill, which is obviously an unreasonable measure. This is a 
bill that you should forthwith ask all your pages to collect, 
Madam Speaker, so that we never hear about it again. That is the 
best thing that could happen to it. Do not think for a minute 
that we will let it go through without putting up a fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all here today to let our listeners know that, if passed, 
this bill will result in the establishment of a government 
agency that is not accountable to this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Minister of Revenue—who was so voluble when it came 
to promoting Vancouver's bid for the Olympic Games—unable to 
explain by virtue of what principle it is consistent with 
ministerial responsibility to surrender our powers and offload 
onto non-elected representatives the responsibility of destroying 
20% of the public service?  This is not serious. I think this 
bill should be immediately withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is at least ten good reasons justifying the Bloc 
Quebecois' opposition. First, as I said, there is no support for 
such a bill. There is an old principle in the British 
parliamentary system, which the heritage minister must know and 
which states that lawmakers must not legislate for no good 
reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that a bill like this does not address the real 
problems?  If the government wants to talk about taxation, it 
should get cracking and introduce a bill on Canadian transfer 
payments that would return to the provinces the money taken away 
from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1993, when the Prime Minister closed the red book, and 
now, the provinces have been done out of $42 billion.  Quebec 
alone lost $7 billion.  Is this the kind of federalism the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage wants to see?  Once again I ask 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage to listen to what I am saying 
and to tell me whether this is the kind of federalism government 
members favour, that is to say a system that allows the central 
government to literally destabilize the public finances of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a hot-headed and dashing young university student 
thirsting for knowledge, I was taught that federalism had three 
characteristics.  I was told it was a political system with two 
levels of government: a central government and provincial 
governments.  In their respective areas of jurisdiction, each 
level of government was supposed to be sovereign.  That was the 
first characteristic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second characteristic, they said, was that, under 
constitutional law, a higher level of government was not 
supposed to interfere in the affairs of so-called lower levels of 
government.  Well, what about bill like this, which goes right 
to the heart of taxation in Quebec?  I know that you will hardly 
believe it, Madam Speaker, but if this bill is passed, 
municipalities might even be asked to help with tax collection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anything more closely related to provincial governments 
than municipalities? Why would the federal government need to 
interfere in an area such as this one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that there is nobody in cabinet to defend 
Quebec's interests. Nobody in this government speaks for Quebec. 
They have no backbone when it comes to defending Quebec's 
interests. I am convinced we could not name a single minister 
who did so. Certainly not the member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges. He 
does not talk much. He is not one to raise his voice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, Madam Speaker, if I asked you, would you be 
able to name one minister who defended Quebec's interests when 
it came to putting an end to such interference by the federal 
government? No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the sad part about it. If not for the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois who are totally dedicated to defending Quebec's 
interests, which is why we are respected and have the support of 
the people, this bill would have passed without a hitch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, we will not let it happen because we have too much respect 
for the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fought hard to have our own tax system in Quebec. We just 
have to think of Maurice Duplessis, of the Union nationale, who 
asked Ottawa to give him back his loot. He was the first to 
create a direct taxation system in 1948. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we will not let it happen. The day is not over yet, and we 
still hope this bill is withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, would it be possible to have the unanimous 
consent of the House—which, I think, will be granted—to 
continue my speech for another ten minutes? I am not finished 
yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Does the member have the 
unanimous consent of the House to continue his speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps:</B> Madam Speaker, I know the member does not 
want to mislead the House. He mentioned a $7 billion cut in 
transfer payments, when he knows this is totally untrue. I want 
to give him the opportunity to correct this— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Order, please. I am sorry, 
but the debate must resume. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil—Papineau, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, in 
February 1996, in a rather trivial throne speech, the federal 
government announced the establishment of a national revenue 
collection agency. We believed this plan had been dropped, when 
just before the House adjourned last spring the revenue minister 
introduced Bill C-43 establishing the Canada customs and revenue 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say I support every amendment aimed at reducing the 
scope of Bill C-43 because the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to the 
creation of the Canada customs and revenue agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the minister pulled out of his hat like a rabbit, is not an 
innocuous collection agency, but an evil creature, a 
bureaucratic monster that threatens privacy, the rights of 
Revenue Canada workers as well as provincial jurisdiction over 
tax collection. Even the business community is against the 
creation of the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said he wanted the House to pass Bill C-43 before 
the holiday season. Why the rush? One wonders why he is going 
ahead when nobody wants this customs and revenue agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is proposing to alter the current structure of 
Revenue Canada by turning it into a quasi-independent agency. 
Therein lies the danger. 
This agency would be responsible for collecting taxes on behalf 
of the federal government, but also all manner of other taxes 
including sales and property taxes, if collection agreements are 
signed with provinces and municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will set out the arguments against this bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT74"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT74"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1650

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the customs and revenue agency is a threat to the privacy 
of Quebeckers and Canadians.  In this era of electronic 
communications, the risk of trafficking in personal information 
increases proportionally with the concentration of information 
within private organizations.  If it sees the light of day, this 
agency will have access to an incredible quantity of personal 
and financial information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, this agency would be less subject than Revenue 
Canada to ministerial responsibility and parliamentary control. 
Consequently, the dissemination of this personal information on 
taxpayers would not be under public surveillance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the CCRA could prejudice the working conditions of 
Revenue Canada employees, and even threaten their jobs.  In 
fact, 40,000 Revenue Canada employees would be removed from the 
Public Service Employment Act.  In two years, therefore, it 
could cut salaries, dismiss people, or decide on their working 
conditions, without their having a word to say in the matter. 
By adopting this bill, the government is using a heavy hand to 
modernize the public service, instead of seeking to reach an 
agreement with the unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the CCRA does not greatly impress small business owners. 
Business was meant to be the primary beneficiary, yet 
announcement of its creation met with an ambivalent reaction, to 
say the least. 
Organizations such as the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business expressed their distrust of the concentration of powers 
in the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a public policy forum study commissioned by Revenue 
Canada, fewer than 40% of businesses had any interest in the 
agency.  More than two thirds felt that it would cost as much if 
not more than the existing structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and this is vital, the Canada customs and revenue 
agency contravenes the federal principle that the provinces are 
sovereign in their areas of jurisdiction.  This is not the first 
time that the Liberal government has come crashing into 
provincial jurisdictions.  This agency will violate the division 
of powers between the federal government and the provinces. 
If the provinces have separate revenues, they should collect 
them themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who we cannot call overly 
sovereignist, rose some 30 years ago in opposition to the 
practice of having the federal government collect more tax than 
it needed to implement policies that were not within its 
jurisdiction.  He even thought at the time that such action was 
illegal.  In 1957, he wrote that “the federal government cannot 
legally have money in its coffers it claims after the fact to be 
for provincial use”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen if the federal government gives a central, 
Canada-wide tax collection agency the power to collect taxes in 
the place of the provinces and the municipalities?  In our 
opinion, it would be impossible to stop the centralization of 
the Canadian federation once the federal agency is given the 
power to collect taxes belonging to the provinces and 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is reasonable to assume that the federal government collects 
its own taxes so it can carry out its responsibilities under 
section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867.  However, its plan to 
entrust appointed officials who are not directly accountable for 
their actions with collecting provincial and municipal taxes is 
unacceptable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, at a time when the federal Minister of Finance is 
announcing that he has billions of dollars in surpluses, he 
should comply with the consensus reached by the provinces and 
give back the revenues he slashed in recent years, to allow them 
to look after health, education and social services, for which 
they are responsible under the Constitution Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we should not count too much on the members 
opposite in that regard. Indeed, the Liberal members' mandate is 
to defend the federal government, not the interests of 
Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example of the customs and revenue agency should convince 
those who have not yet realized it that, for the past 50 years, 
Canada has been headed inexorably toward centralization. The 
federal government, and particularly this Liberal government, 
has always tried to annihilate any desire for autonomy, whether 
at the Quebec, provincial or regional level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed customs and revenue agency will concentrate in the 
hands of a few superbureaucrats the power to dig into the 
pockets of Canadian and Quebec taxpayers, at the expense of 
Revenue Canada employees, small businesses and provincial and 
municipal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government already collects too large a share of tax 
revenues and it uses its spending power in an inconsiderate 
manner. 
We will not, on top of that, give it carte blanche to collect 
all taxes across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-43, which 
proposes the establishment of such an agency, and this is why we 
support all the amendments that seek to reduce the scope of the 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to address this House on Bill C-43, 
establishing the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. This bill 
stems from the Speech from the Throne delivered in February 
1996, when the government announced its intention to set up a 
national revenue collection agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CCRA for short will be spawned by the conversion of the 
existing Department of Revenue into an agency operating almost 
at arm's length from the government, whose mandate will be to 
negotiate with the interested provinces and municipalities an 
arrangement for the collection of all taxes in Canada. This is 
what this agency is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But where did the idea to establish this agency come from? 
Obviously, this has to do with the centralizing vision of this 
Liberal government, which keeps trying to strip the provinces of 
their powers in the pursuit of a single vision dictated directly 
from Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultations carried out across Canada show that this 
centralizing vision does not appeal to any of the provinces. 
None of them readily supports this bill. I do not understand why 
we are still debating it, when those concerned have not shown 
any interest in it, quite the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the principle of single window tax collection, 
whether the taxes are provincial or municipal, but in Quebec, 
the provincial department of revenue should continue to collect 
taxes as it has done quite competently for many years.  We are 
able, within the present structure, to collect all taxes, even 
federal taxes and the GST, until we no longer have to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the proposed federal agency, Revenue Quebec is fully 
accountable, as is Revenue Canada, at least until the federal 
government turns this department into a bureaucratic monster.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like to talk about accountability, because some words have 
apparently dropped from favour.  “Responsibility” is one such 
word.  But “accountability” has sunk even further in the 
popularity polls.  Whenever a minister is responsible, 
accountable, we at least have someone we can address, blame, 
make demands of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are living at a time when the responsibility of people and 
the accountability of those to whom they report is not valued. 
In a society such as ours, a modern society where youth are 
watching what their elders do, and I am one of those elders, I 
think it is too bad that we eliminate this very important aspect 
of the role of those in charge of large organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a major political abdication here.  An independent 
agency would mean that the Minister of Revenue could evade his 
responsibility to protect taxpayers against abuses of power. 
When we are talking about the Canada customs and revenue agency 
created by this bill, this is serious.  This government is 
forever taking cover behind independent agencies and shifting 
the blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of scrapie, to which we devoted much time and 
emotion, we never managed to find out who was responsible. 
We were told it was the agency, it was someone in the agency, or 
it was an agency regulation.  There was so little accountability 
that I would estimate they succeeded in destroying 10% of 
Quebec's livestock before the Bloc Quebecois woke people up 
demanding that they do something, and stop destroying flocks, 
because something was wrong and they had not looked into the 
matter.  But it was not serious, no one was accountable, it was 
the agency's fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation went on for months.  We raised the issue in the 
House several times. So if they have to keep increasing the 
number of agencies, it puts a society like ours at a very great 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why create an agency?  The bill does contain some very 
important provisions, such as clauses 30 and 50, to do with the 
agency's authority. 
The agency has authority over “personnel management, including 
the determination of the terms and conditions of employment of 
persons employed by the agency”. Clause 50 deals with public 
service staff relations. The agency would have control over 
classification, training, development, terms and conditions of 
employment, hours of work, awards, merit recognition, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the authority granted to the agency, we will have 
two classes of employees, those employed by the government, and 
those employed by an agency partly accountable to the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a public servant once, luckily only for a short time, 
thank God. I always wondered when I was in the public service 
why things that were simple were made so complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the area of taxation and revenue has a culture, as a 
government organization, which is such that the strict and 
austere rules of the public service as a whole do not apply, I 
believe there are all kind of ways to improve efficiency while 
keeping the same rules with some exceptions—this is what we look 
for within an accountability framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk some more about accountability because I believe 
it is a major issue. Why chose a complicated roundabout way, 
create different structures from those already in place and 
working fairly well—even though there is always room for 
improvement— to end up with two classes of employees, public 
servants and quasi-public servants who will be better taken care 
of because the agency will be able to do so? I object to that 
completely.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also very interesting things to be said about this 
bill. I am thinking, for example, of the accountability to the 
public and to Parliament. It always boils down to 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its present structure, Revenue Canada is accountable to 
Parliament and to taxpayers through the Department of National 
Revenue. The government cannot avoid difficult questions even 
though he would like to sometimes. When we discussed the family 
trust scandal, we could talk to someone, ask questions and get 
answers. If everything is diluted in an agency, things will 
happen and sometimes we will not even be aware of what is going 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will be subject to a less stringent parliamentary 
scrutiny than the one currently imposed on the revenue 
department. An agency would be less inclined to answer questions 
that members would ask on behalf of the public, compared to a 
department that has to be accountable. We know how the 
government is behaving these days, constantly hiding behind 
inquiries and independent agencies to avoid answering questions 
regarding air safety, food inspection, abuse of power by the 
RCMP and all kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, it is very difficult to see what we would get 
out of it. However the worst part of it, apart from the lack of 
accountability and responsibility, is the possible threat to our 
privacy. It is a major concern. Tests conducted with our social 
insurance number have shown how many firms, agencies and people 
have access to our personal information through a computer. 
It is a bit overwhelming when you go to a bank and ask to see 
the information they have on you. Three quarters of that 
information was not provided by you, but obtained through your 
SIN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a world where computers are everywhere and employees are 
supposed to be bound by professional secrecy—but we know how 
things are these days—and no one is accountable at the top, we 
have good reasons to ask ourselves serious questions. What kind 
of information do they have on us?  Who are they allowed to sell 
it to? We know it has been done before. What will happen of all 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new agency would be less accountable than Revenue Canada, 
which is itself subject to leaks. 
I do not know if people remember the old TV series on the future 
called Future Shock. It tried to define how to protect people's 
interests and it came to the conclusion that even our brain can 
be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not like to end up in such a situation. For all those 
reasons, the Bloc Quebecois cannot support the bill and will 
oppose it at all stages. The easiest way to put an end to our 
debate would be to simply withdraw it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to the motions in Group No. 2 before 
us, which we consider to be nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to express my objection and frustration 
because by its arrogance, the government has gagged us on this 
bill. Our time is very limited and we cannot discuss the bill in 
length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know to what extent provinces are favorable to 
the bill. 
New Brunswick is the only province suggesting that the bill is 
worth examining, that it could perhaps create economies of 
scale. However, before supporting the bill it wants to know what 
is in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask ourselves the following question. In order for this bill 
to be workable, would it be necessary to harmonize all federal 
tax legislation throughout Canada? If this is the case, what 
would be the cost? Members will recall that harmonizing the 
Maritime provincial sales taxes with the federal tax cost $3 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of people who came as witnesses before the finance 
standing committee were opposed to the bill. Public service 
union members were opposed to it. And more than 60% of small 
businesses are against it. Everyone is against it. Yet, with his 
arrogance, the revenue minister still wants to impose this bill 
on Quebec and the rest of Canada, when we know full well it is 
not workable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one another question the revenue minister has not 
answered and I hope a government member will be able to answer 
us. How much did the bill's formulating cost us, you, me and the 
other taxpayers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister likes to say, “we have created a new vehicle',. 
This new vehicle is not a Formula 1 race car. This new vehicle 
will not work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The revenue department set up 12 committees made up of lots of 
mandarins who worked on this for months, years even. How much 
did it cost us taxpayers, just to come up with this utterly 
useless bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something else I am wondering about in this bill. It is 
the position of the commissioner who will head the proposed 
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. This person will be appointed 
by the governor in council. There is a big chance he or she will 
be a friend of the governing party, someone who has rendered 
valuables services to the party opposite. He or she will hold 
office for a term of five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much will the commissioner be paid? What will the annual 
salary be? Is it possible this person will go to his bosses, the 
ministers opposite and tell them: “I have as many employees 
under me and I manage the same amount of money as the president 
of the Royal Bank, so I should get the same salary he is 
getting”. That is another absurdity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will simply be an added layer of bureaucracy. We are 
the first to admit that the revenue department may not be always 
up to par, so why add another layer of bureaucracy that will not 
solve any of the problems we now have with the department, like 
the auditor general told us this week. We simply do not 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only purpose this agency can serve is to take the 40,000 
public servants targeted here and tell them: “We do not need you 
any more”. The government is simply taking an axe to the Public 
Service Act under the jurisdiction of the President of the 
Treasury Board. They are looking for a way to say—and it will 
never happen—that they have cut expenses. It is not true. By 
creating this new agency, they are only shuffling the money 
around. There will be fewer employees, but the agency's staff 
will be better paid. We are getting four quarters for a dollar, 
as they say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am so vigorously opposed to this agency. We simply 
do not understand why it is being established. What is its 
purpose? Why does the government want to create this agency? 
They already created agencies like Nav Canada, ADM, the food 
inspection agency and the brand new Canadian wheat agency and, 
to date, none of these agencies are working. 
So why set up another one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are strongly against the creation of this agency, because we 
care about the well-being of all Canadians and most particularly 
about the well-being of Quebeckers. I urge all of the provinces 
to stand up and clearly tell the government: “This is not what 
we want. As provincial governments, we want to be able to 
collect taxes and hand Ottawa its share”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois and I are strongly opposed to 
this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad we 
finally got to Group No. 2.  I also regret that we have time 
allocation on this so that we cannot express our genuine concerns 
about these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we have been sitting here I wrote my newspaper column. One 
of the things I put in my column is that there are two ways of 
getting legislation through the House.  One is to engage in a 
fair and an even handed debate, negotiation, give and take, and 
to come up with a set of rules that is good for people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that when Canadians trust us to form the government I 
will not have changed my mind on this.  I believe it is a 
legitimate role for the government to listen to what members in 
opposition are saying.  I noticed one of the members over there 
gave a hearty laugh. I guess he is eagerly looking forward to 
being on this side of the House again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that happens I think it will be important for us, when we 
are on the government side, to recognize that everything may not 
be perfect every time.  If I have any role to play in it, I will 
listen very carefully to what the Liberals on this side of the 
House have to say on our legislation. I hope we will have the 
humility to receive fairly legislation the Liberals bring to our 
attention that they feel is not as good as it could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not spoken on this group at all and so I would like to 
address myself primarily to the motions put forward by the Reform 
Party, although the others also have merit.  I am not going to 
spend as much time on those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going on the assumption that this independent agency will 
happen. We have seen this over and over. The government will 
arrange for this vote to pass.  This government has already, with 
its majority, voted for closure.  I think this is the tenth time 
in the last few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not mention names since I am not allowed and I will not 
mention ridings since I do not want to embarrass anyone here, but 
some in the Liberal Party when they were in opposition raised a 
hue and cry when time allocation was used by the Conservatives of 
the day. The Liberals said this is wrong, it is a defeat of 
democracy.  The Liberals had all sorts of bad things to say about 
the use of closure.  Now they are on the other side and on 
command they vote in favour of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose I am setting myself up for another quotation maybe 
four or five years down the road, whenever the next election is, 
when we form the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to listen to these debates and to when 
an amendment is put forward to improve it.  That is what I am 
trying to do now.  I know members will not have been given the 
freedom by their party to vote in favour of these very reasonable 
and rational taxpayer protecting amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if we would find among them some statesmen, if we would 
find among them some politicians who will rise up and represent 
the people who sent them here, the electors, and they will vote 
in favour of those people instead of simply following the party 
line.  The purpose of my speech is to persuade Liberal members to 
do that and to give them solid reasons for so doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems with this agency is the question of 
accountability. Right now we have some degree of prime 
ministerial accountability. We have some ministerial 
accountability.  Last night on TV I saw a clip of the Prime 
Minister when he was leader of opposition. He wagged his finger 
and said “when we form government you can count on it that 
ministers will accept responsibility”. 
We have seen a number of instances in the last little more than 
five years where that has really not quite been the case.   Of 
course, the Prime Minister continues to say they have no 
scandals, because what he does is pinch his eyes shut and pretend 
they are not there and then he can proclaim that there were no 
scandals.  There have been a couple.  The Prime Minister said he 
believes in ministerial responsibility.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to do right now is simply challenge the Liberal 
members when the vote is held on these amendments to vote in 
favour of Motion No. 3.  Motion No. 3 increases the 
responsibility and the accountability of this new agency to 
parliament instead of making it into a faceless irresponsible 
bureaucracy whose function is to separate the taxpayers from 
their money and which will not have political of any other kind 
of accountability to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We insist that should be done.  We want to ensure that the 
employees, the directors and the commissioner of the new agency 
are held accountable not to the minister in the backrooms but to 
parliament directly.  I do not think anyone on the Liberal side, 
if they were on this side and the Reformers were speaking on the 
other side, would be against this motion. They would vote in 
favour of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not allow walking across two sword lengths of aisle 
change important principles we believe in.  I would simply urge 
them to do the right thing for taxpayers. I suppose basically 
everyone n the country is affected by this legislation.  That is 
another reason why it is so odious for the government to have 
invoked closure on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely necessary that the government so arrange its 
affairs that people believe in our government and believe in our 
tax system.  Our tax system is predicated on voluntary 
compliance.  If that is missing, the system falls apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen it in the last number of years where with the very 
undemocratic imposition of the GST many people have gone into the 
underground economy.  They do not agree with it.  They said it 
was not done correctly.  They did not have representatives 
representing them in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we just jam this legislation through, two days of debate and 
it is finished.  It is a fait accompli. It is mandatory for us. 
We have no option but to make sure people support this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take the full length of debate on it so that we as 
members of parliament can hear what our constituents are saying 
and we can respond to them and make sure the taxation system is 
fair, which I believe most people believe in.  I have yet to hear 
anyone in my riding say to me they do not want to pay any taxes 
at all.  But I have heard many times that they want fair taxation 
and a fair taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we vote in favour of Motion No. 3, put forward by my Reform 
colleague, it would help to provide accountability of this new 
agency to parliament.  It would help people to have faith in and 
to really have a good feeling about paying their taxes, something 
they have never had before in their lives.  I am sure the 
Liberals would want the taxpayers to feel good when they send 
their money to Ottawa.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in response to hon. members who are asking for the deletion of a 
number of clauses in Bill C-43, an act to establish the Canada 
customs and revenue agency, I will explain why such an agency is 
needed.  The most important reason is the demand of Canadians for 
streamlined and more responsive tax, customs and trade 
administration services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency is designed to improve services to Canadians, to 
businesses, and to provinces and territories.  This will be 
accomplished in a number of ways.  One way is expanding and 
improving the co-ordination and administration of federal and 
provincial revenue programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will result in a number of benefits: a reduction of overlap 
and duplication among levels of government, a potential for 
significant reductions in costs to governments, a potential for 
significant reductions in costs to taxpayers in complying with 
tax laws, one level of tax collector that will create major 
advantages for businesses, and an improvement in the competitive 
position of Canadian businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another benefit of the legislation is that it will improve the 
management of the agency.  The board of management will help to 
bring a client oriented focus to agency activities.  The board 
will also help to bring a strategic perspective to management by 
using some private sector techniques to ensure efficient and 
effective management.  The agency will be able to tailor its 
programs for administrative activities to meet its own needs.  As 
a result of this improved efficiency, the agency will be able to 
reinvest productivity gains in programs for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This improved management will also mean significant improvements 
for employees.  Employee representatives will be able to bargain 
directly with the employer.  This will result in more responsive 
and simplified staffing and classification systems.  In addition, 
a new approach of recourse will focus on alternative dispute 
resolution mechanisms such as fact finding and mediation.  This 
will also incorporate access to independent third party review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Design teams comprised of employees, managers and unions have 
been involved in designing the new human resource regime for the 
new agency.  The agency model proposed in the Canada customs and 
revenue agency is unique since it combines the strengths of both 
the public and private sectors while remaining fully accountable 
to parliament and the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In developing the Canada customs and revenue agency the 
department has been sensitive to the concern of the concentration 
of too much power in one place.  Tax, customs and trade 
administration affect the lives and livelihoods of most 
Canadians.  They want to be sure they are dealt with fairly and 
that their rights are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the design of the new agency the essential checks and 
balances that govern the activities and ensure the accountability 
of Revenue Canada have been maintained.  For example, the 
enforcement powers of the new agency will be the same as those 
currently provided to Revenue Canada through legislation like the 
Income Tax Act or the Customs Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a problem or a complaint, the minister will still be 
fully accountable to parliament and the public for the 
administration and enforcement of specific legislation.  The 
minister will have the authority, as is currently the case, to 
answer questions in the House and to ensure the agency is acting 
properly in its dealings with the Canadian public.  The existing 
provisions for accountability are being enhanced by the addition 
of three new accountability mechanisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The confidentiality of a taxpayer's personal information will be 
protected under the agency just as it is currently with Revenue 
Canada.  The authorities governing confidentiality are clearly 
set out in the legislation and they will not be changed by the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43 will permit the agency to offer new and better 
services to the provinces and territories.  For example, at the 
present time Revenue Canada can only collect provincial taxes 
that are harmonized with federal taxes.  The new agency would be 
able to collect non-harmonized taxes, expanding the potential for 
single window tax collection with considerable savings for 
businesses and individual Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greater co-ordination among the federal, provincial and 
territorial governments will simplify tax administration for 
Canadians and reduce costly overlap and duplication between 
governments.  Increased operational flexibility in the management 
of internal resources is a major change that will allow the new 
agency to adopt a more client oriented approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation will allow the proposed agency to customize 
its own resources and administrative functions to meet the needs 
of Canadians as well as those of its employees.  All of this 
means better service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doing something better is not an expansion of power but an 
extension of service, service to individual Canadians, service to 
businesses, and services to provinces and territories.  Better 
service means savings in time and money, savings in compliance 
costs for businesses and savings in administration costs for 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intention of Bill C-43 is not to create an agency with 
unlimited powers but rather to establish a framework with all the 
checks and balances for a more efficient agency.  The bill is 
important and beneficial, beneficial for the government, 
beneficial for business, and beneficial for individual Canadians. 
This is what is expected of good government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have a motion on the floor of the House right now.  It 
is one that I think is perfectly reasonable and that members 
across would like to support.  It is the one that says the agency 
should not come into force until at least half the provinces 
agree to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very reasonable.  We are a federation.  We tend to work 
together as a federation.  It will be a new program in which the 
federal government expects the provinces to participate.  Before 
the agency takes effect we should have an amendment accepted by 
the House that at least half the provinces sign on to beforehand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems I have with the agency is that nobody has 
actually said we are going to do this, we are going to sign on. 
We know, Madam Speaker, that your province will not sign on. 
Quebec will collect its own taxes.  We know hear the province of 
Ontario is not very enthused.  The member who just spoke is from 
Ontario.  She is very close to her premier.  Her premier will 
probably not sign on to it, at least not at this stage.  Maybe 
they will in four, five or six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until that happens the bill should not take effect.  In the 
provinces of Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Alberta there is 
a great deal of skepticism about the bill.  It is a brand new 
agency. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a new agency in this country. Income tax is now 
collected by the Department of National Revenue, but with this 
bill a new agency will be established, with approximately 40,000 
employees, or 20% of the federal public service. A good number 
of people are very unhappy with this bill: Revenue Canada 
employees, provinces and many taxpayers from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I moved an amendment to this bill, to get half of the provinces 
to agree with it before it was passed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see in the House the member from Abitibi.  He would certainly 
agree with my motion.  He is a great federalist.  I think he 
would also want to see the majority of the provinces agree before 
the bill proceeds.  It is a very reasonable motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It being 5.39 p.m., 
pursuant to order made earlier today, it is my duty to interrupt 
the proceedings and put forthwith every question necessary to 
dispose of report stage of the bill now before the House.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SALARIES FOR STAY AT HOME MOTHERS AND FATHERS 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK295"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK296">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
legislate to grant a salary to mothers and fathers who stay at 
home to care for their children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, I have tabled this motion many times 
already. 
In 1970, the royal commission on the status of women said that 
women who stay at home provide as much goods and services as 
women who have paid employment. And if they had paid employment, 
we could help our children and get some regions of Quebec and 
Canada out of poverty. We could review our approach and develop 
legislation that is most of all fair for all families, that 
gives back parents their primary responsibilities and allows 
them to choose the method they prefer to raise their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the guaranteed annual income system is much superior, we 
could provide an income supplement for all those who need it, 
not only for low income workers. Our findings reinforce the idea 
of implementing a guaranteed annual income to eliminate poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, I will read a letter from Julie Dupont, of the 
Montreal area, dated September 10, 1998. 
She says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not in the habit of writing letters to newspapers to 
complain or to make comments. I must say I do not have much time 
for that—my husband and I have five children between 18 months 
and nine years of age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 20, the day of our wedding 
anniversary, we received a nice gift from the federal 
government: a reduction in our child benefits. The notice was 
related to the new Canadian child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some gift! While 
our 1997 income was $11,530 less than our 1996 income, we were 
told that our tax benefits would drop by $82 a month. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is not the only one in this situation. In my riding, there 
is a couple, Germain and Clémence Côté, whose child tax benefit 
was reduced by $280 a month, and, furthermore, they are not even 
entitled to a GST refund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get back to Mrs. Dupont, whose tax benefit was reduced. 
Here is another quote from her letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a family of seven, I do not think one could say that we have 
a very high income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because I could not believe it, I reread the whole notice and 
the pamphlet that was sent with it. It says that this new 
benefit “... includes the basic benefit plus a new supplement. 
This supplement is the Canadian government's contribution to the 
national child benefit program”. It also says that the program's 
goals are “to reduce child poverty and to help the parents of 
low-income families to return to the work force”. I might also 
add that it discourages middle income parents who work to stay 
in the work force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we chose to have many children. And we live 
adequately on one salary. We live adequately because we are very 
frugal and because we have different strategies to save money 
and to get the basics in life without becoming the victims of 
the consumer driven society. We have simple needs and our life 
is focused on the lives of our children, to our great pleasure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, raising five children with an income like this means 
there must be limitations, sacrifices even. We are not asking 
for charity, but it would seem normal to me to receive a little 
support from society. After all, our five children will be 
taxpayers one day. Very few families want to have more than one 
or two children. We are constantly told how much courage and 
patience we have and so on. Of course, we have more courage, 
patience and energy than we need. The only thing that is lacking 
is the federal government's recognition of our valuable 
contribution to society, as parents of five future taxpayers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This letter is asking for a salary for the parent staying at 
home to raise the children, whether it is the mother or the 
father. It could be a contribution or a supplement. 
Right now, a committee of Liberals wants to pay stay-at home 
parents a supplement to foster the children's development. There 
must be something fairer for parents who stay home to take care 
of their school age children. We are not telling working women 
to go back home and cook. This is not the point.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is strictly about families, mothers raising their children. 
There are examples where families are losing money to federal 
taxes because they choose to take care of their kids at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a quote from a letter sent to me by the Centre de femmes 
de La Sarre: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is adequate pay for adults having decided to work at 
home, great, but every woman must have the choice between 
working full-time or managing the family home—. 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—We are pleased to see that you mention very clearly the large 
part of the work accomplished by women, in many cases without 
being paid— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>—The perverse effect of poverty among women and children has an 
impact on living conditions and education, but we should first 
address the problem of poverty without creating more problems 
concerning the isolation and excessive responsibility given to 
women with regard to the education of children. Women are not 
the cause of poverty, and they are not the solution to this 
problem either. It is the social conditions that are the cause 
of poverty. Consequently, the time has come to address the real 
social causes in order to fight more efficiently against the 
increasing problem that poverty is. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that your concern 
about the elimination of poverty among women and children is 
very important and very relevant. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This letter comes from Lulu Hébert, president of the Centre des 
femmes l'E.R.I.G.E. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She also writes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are expecting you, Mr. St-Julien, as our representative in the 
House of Commons, to adjust what you say in the House. Trying to 
take women and children out of poverty is in itself a good 
thing. But we must at the same time let families decide to have 
one of their members work in the home. This way, nothing would 
stop you from paying a salary with marginal benefits to an adult 
willing to work at home and that would give more opportunities 
to women who wish to invest outside the home. As the Centre des 
femmes, our objective is to improve women's living conditions, 
including the fight against poverty. This is why we are pleased 
to share our thoughts with you. 
We are hoping for your co-operation in considering this vision 
which supports greater equality between women and men. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this motion is to bring the government to 
legislate to grant a salary to mothers and fathers who stay at 
home to care for their children. The hon. member who prepared a 
document for the Liberal Party said “It is imperative, 
financially and socially, that the state do something to help 
children. Many studies underline this need and demonstrate 
beyond any doubt that the quality of early childhood care has a 
significant impact on the physical and mental health of children 
and on their social integration”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several reports on this were carried in the media in my area and 
in my riding. 
With regard to taxation and tax rates, why are families, in my 
region and elsewhere in Canada, penalized because of the number 
of children they have? Here are some examples. Mr. Germain's 
family loses $280 per month. Mrs. Côté is expecting her 10th 
child, so the 12 of them will be living on a net salary of 
$22,000 or $23,000. Why? We keep asking ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such situations exist in my riding. A destitute child grows up 
to be even poorer and does not function well socially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have reintroduced this motion in the House to hear what other 
members of our great parliament have to say, and to debate about 
legislating to grant a salary to mothers and fathers raising 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to hearing other members, and I will reply 
later.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to speak to Motion No. M-486 and in so doing to pay 
tribute to a group of people that go largely unnoticed in our 
modern society.  This group of people is largely made up of women 
but there are some men also.  This group is stay at home parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's society it is not easy to be a stay at home mom or 
dad.  Career paths are demanding.  To step off of that path can 
often mean various forms of reprisals or discrimination and 
second class status from many different sources.  Fortunately 
many parents are willing and able to make this commitment to 
their family.  In so doing they raise their children in the 
manner they think is best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss also if I did not recognize the extremely 
heavy burden that single parent families carry today.  Single 
parent moms and dads do not have this same option and in no way 
am I passing my judgment on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, today's society has picked up the pace of living 
tremendously from days gone by.  The cost of virtually everything 
from groceries and clothing to transportation and other 
essentials has risen faster than the incomes of most people. This 
continues to cause further economic strife in many families 
today.  Overall tax relief is necessary for families now, not at 
some distant time in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way that some of the economic stress can be relieved is to 
address how the child care expense deduction is formulated. The 
current system clearly differentiates between single and dual 
income families.  In addition, the expenses are only allowable if 
they are receipted, therefore restricting eligibility to 
institutional daycares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents that choose to stay at home are not eligible for this 
same tax credit.  The discrepancy between single and dual income 
families is apparent in how the child tax credit applies to them. 
One example of this is that in dual income families the lower 
earner must claim the child care expense deduction, thus ensuring 
that the value of the deduction is minimized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's proposal does nothing to address this disparity and 
inequity that stay at home parents face under our current tax 
laws.  Specifically I refer to their inability to claim the child 
care expense deduction.  Rather than treat all parents equally, 
this motion would divide people into a multitude of different 
camps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are at least four alternative options that should be 
looked at closely and used as a replacement for this motion. 
These alternative options would better address the inequalities 
that exist under the current child care expense deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first option would be to give further consideration for 
income splitting. The second option would be to give stay at home 
spouses access to independent RRSPs. While both of these concepts 
have merit, a further examination is necessary to determine the 
specific financial and operational considerations of them prior 
to any implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third consideration is to make the spousal exemption equal to 
the personal exemption.  In order to provide equity, the spousal 
deduction needs to be equal to the personal exemption of the 
primary income earner.  In light of a more demanding economy, 
this levels the field for those parents who are able to and 
choose to stay at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fourth consideration would be to convert the child care 
expense deduction into a refundable child tax credit for all 
children.  Currently this is only available to those parents 
using commercial daycare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time only 16% of families use commercial daycare. 
Contrary to past doctrines, current psychological and 
sociological research supports the concept that children become 
better balanced and more productive citizens when in the care of 
a family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parent of eight and a foster parent for over 25 years to 
over 140 children, I strongly believe in the role of the parent 
and the family institution.  However, I believe that Motion No. 
M-486 does nothing to lessen these pressures, nor does it really 
address the needs of today's families. 
<P><A NAME="LINK298"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to speak to Motion No. M-486. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Family issues are very important to me as a husband, a father 
and a grandfather and they are important to my constituents.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very encouraging that the quality of family life is 
finally receiving attention by this House.  For too many years 
the family has been ignored in the mad rush to be politically 
correct.  It is time the inequalities faced by stay at home 
parents by our current tax laws were being addressed.  As I have 
said before in the House, as the family goes, so goes society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge this motion may be a step in the right direction, 
however I am concerned with this motion which I will read for the 
benefit of those who may not have heard it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
legislate to grant a salary to mothers and fathers who stay at 
home to care for their children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned this motion does not fully address the unfairness 
inherent in our tax code.  The current Income Tax Act is 
discriminatory, plain and simple.  It discriminates against 
loving parents who forgo the riches of a second income in order 
to provide parental care for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will illustrate with the example of two families living side 
by side. Family A has a single income of $60,000 and mom cares 
for the children at home.  Family B has a combined income of 
$60,000 and daycare provides for the children.  In spite of 
living side by side, family A has an after tax income of $3,365 
less than that of family B. Why is there a difference?  Because 
this government discriminates against families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has a long history of representing the family. 
We are committed to fair family taxation.  We have consistently 
called for revision of federal income tax regulations to end 
discrimination against parents who provide child care at home. We 
support equitable tax treatment for one income families with 
dependent children. Family taxation should be simple, flexible 
and efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform would replace the child care expense deduction with a 
fully refundable child care expense credit.  This is a much 
better method to address inequities in the tax structure. Paying 
parents a small stipend to stay at home with their children only 
encourages further government dependency in addition to creating 
another layer of inefficient bureaucracy. A child care expense 
credit would give parents the freedom to choose how to care for 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize the most important caregiver for a child is its 
parent.  Study after study show how important parental care is to 
the long term emotional stability of children.  It is no 
coincidence that as we see the number of dual income families 
rise, we see youth crime skyrocket.  Strong families are the 
foundation of our society and preventing crime starts with a 
commitment by the government to support our families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public is squarely behind me and my party on this 
issue.  In a recent Southam News Compas poll, 82% stated that the 
government should make changing tax laws to allow one parent to 
stay home a priority.  Eighty-one per cent of respondents 
indicated they want the government to make families the 
cornerstone of a wide range of policies.  When working mothers 
were asked if they would rather stay home with their children or 
go to work, a majority said that they would rather stay home but 
felt they could not afford it.  Why?  Because of the oppressive 
taxes levied by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are elements in the Liberal caucus that do not agree with 
what I have to say next.  Seventy per cent of Canadians feel that 
the needs of children receive too little attention in divorce 
courts.  Sixty-two per cent feel that the needs of fathers are 
being ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken with many fathers who have never seen their 
children after they got divorced.  There are groups in this 
country supported by grants from this government that feel 
divorced fathers should have input into raising their children. I 
cannot imagine anything more heartbreaking than not being able to 
raise your own children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the right of fathers to play an equal 
part in the upbringing of their children.  There are members in 
the Liberal caucus who also support these efforts and I wish them 
all the best in their endeavours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people have spoken. Canadians want their government to ease 
pressure on working parents and to focus more policy on helping 
families.  This government needs to realize the people of Canada 
elected it and it is time for the government to sit up and 
listen.

thank the hon. member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, because I 
know his concerns, which motivated this motion, are genuine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we think this is the wrong venue. The member for 
Abitibi probably picked the wrong assembly, as the heritage 
minister knows full well.  Family matters should not be raised 
in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he wants to help women who deliberately chose to stay home, 
he should make representations to his own government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, he could ask his government to reinstate transfer 
payments.  Should I remind the House—the heritage minister knows 
this even if she chooses to evade the question—that the federal 
government has cut $42 billion since 1993.  Of course, it means 
that the various provincial governments are less able to offer 
services.  The heritage minister knows it and I wish she would 
make the necessary representations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, he should know what the Government of Quebec did in its 
field of jurisdiction. 
Coming from Quebec the hon. member for Abitibi must know that, 
since 1994, the Parti Quebecois government in the National 
Assembly—where it was re-elected with flying colours—has put 
considerable effort into implementing a family policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you a few examples: day care centres at $5 a day, 
something very important; the policy allowing children to access 
the education network with government assistance starting with 
kindergarten. We have also reviewed the tax legislation as 
regards income tax. Those are several initiatives that come 
under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go even farther, if we were able to do so in the 
National Assembly, with more financial resources. That is why it 
is very important to understand that the best service we could 
do, as federal parliamentarians, for provinces that want to put 
in place a real family policy would be to restore as soon as 
possible the funding that was unfairly cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member for Abitibi, whose intentions I do not 
question, really wants to help women who have decided to stay at 
home, he must also ensure that his government is fairer to them. 
How can he not be concerned by pay equity, for instance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows an appeal is now before the Federal Court. 
If heard, this appeal could mean much less money for women than 
anticipated because we continue to discriminate on the basis of 
sex in the public service, and the government was unable to 
remedy this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we be able to improve the employment 
insurance system. Again, I know very well that the hon. member 
is sensitive to these concerns but we cannot have this kind of 
inconsistencies within the same party. The hon. member cannot 
stand from his seat and ask the government to provide additional 
money to give women a salary when the policies of his own party 
have made them poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the hon. member ignore the issues of employment 
insurance and of access to maternity leave? Feminist voices 
within the cabinet were sadly silent with one possible 
exception. 
The qualifying conditions for access to maternity leave have 
been changed. It is now harder for someone receiving EI benefits 
to qualify for maternity leave than it was when the Liberals 
came to power in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before, you needed 300 hours of work to qualify for unemployment 
insurance, compared with 700 today. There is something missing 
in the hon. member's arguments. He should review this motion to 
make sure he addresses the real issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I know that feminist and women's organizations in 
general believe that saying “We will pay a salary to those women 
who choose to stay home” would send an extremely negative 
message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not dare even imagine what it would be like to be deprived 
of the presence of the Minister of Canadian Heritage if she had 
opted to stay at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps:</B> It is a free choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> We are very much aware that she has made 
another career choice.  We are pleased to have her with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> We would miss her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> I think it would be very wrong to send the 
message “If you are a woman who chooses to stay at home, you 
will get a salary”.  That is not what women are asking for. 
That is not what the feminist organizations are asking for.  And 
I believe this must be taken into consideration.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite right to say that it is a matter of free choice.  I 
come from a family of five children.  I have a twin brother, an 
older brother, a sister and a younger brother.  My mother 
decided to stay at home.  She gave her best for her family—and 
you can judge the results by what you see before you—but it was a 
free choice.  I am profoundly convinced of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question of not addressing the real problems.  The 
real problem is taxation.  The real problem is transfer 
payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are $42 billion short.  The province of Quebec is 
$7 billion short. 
Family policy ought to be developed at the provincial level. 
Why? Because of its connection with education and child care. In 
this respect, I call on the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You should have seen her in 1994. There was no holding her back 
from brandishing her little red book. What did that book say? 
That the government would create 150,000 new child care spaces. 
There was something about a national child care network. The 
Minister of Canadian Heritage has not forgotten that, has she? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening? First, funds should have gone to the 
provinces. Today, five years later, nothing has been done with 
respect to child care. I have even been told that $650 million 
earmarked by Treasury Board for this purpose had not been used 
because the federal government said that the provinces did not 
want this money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not true. I am convinced that all provincial governments 
want their own family policies. Had the government given them 
this $650 million and let them manage their own family policies, 
they could have used this money according to their own 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear, family is an important component of society. It 
does not always fit the traditional concept of family. We often 
talk about blended families. Two individuals who choose to live 
together and raise children form a family. There are all kinds 
of families nowadays. The traditional, nuclear family is no 
longer the norm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family in which I grew up was made up of two parents who 
lived together all their lives, with my mother staying at home 
while my father was the breadwinner, and five wonderful 
children. This may no longer be the norm, but one must accept 
such realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be sending an extremely negative, incomplete and 
strategically wrong message, and I would like the hon. member 
for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik to take that into consideration. I 
do not think that the status of women council and feminist 
organizations, which know about and have studied these issues, 
want the support—

I sincerely do not believe that women's organizations, women and

you that I rise on behalf of my colleague, the hon. member for 
Shefford. She is currently attending an international conference 
on an issue that comes under her responsibility in the 
Progressive Conservative caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to take part in the debate on Motion M-486, which 
provides that the government should legislate to grant a salary 
to mothers and fathers who stay at home to care for their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate the hon. member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik for moving this motion and for his 
relentless efforts to help Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say from the outset that I support any proposal promoting 
greater parental involvement in the first few years of 
children's lives. The purpose of this motion is to put these 
parents on an equal footing with those who work and enjoy tax 
benefits for expenses relating to child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But before getting to the financial aspects of such an 
initiative, let me talk about those ultimately concerned by this 
motion, the children. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous studies have shown that the quality of care received 
during the first few years of a child's life has a decisive 
impact on their physical and mental health, as well as on their 
ability to integrate into society.  It is therefore imperative, 
in my view, that the state make a special effort to help children 
from a financial as well as from a social standpoint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like most industrialized countries, Canada is at a crossroads. 
The choices that we will make over the next few years will 
determine our ability to participate in the economy of the 
future, an economy that will be increasingly global and knowledge 
based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we debate the strategic investments we will be required to 
make during this period of economic and social change, our growth 
could be impeded by a lack of vision which in turn could diminish 
the quality of life of Canadians and of children in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If economic growth is favoured at the expense of our social 
environment, problems could arise.  Studies on health and human 
development have highlighted the importance of investing in 
children during their critical formative years if we harbour any 
hope that our society of the future will be populated by well 
balanced, competent and healthy individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now widely accepted that each dollar we spend today on our 
children will ensure that we save double that amount in future on 
health care, social and criminal justice programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By enhancing support for children and their families during the 
initial developmental years we will be helping our children gain 
some self-confidence and learn to adapt more easily.  We will be 
promoting sound learning habits, positive social behaviour and 
good lifelong health habits. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investing in our children is therefore essential to ensure the 
quality of our social and economic life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when huge economic and social changes are taking 
place, and when the gap in revenues is getting wider, the 
pressures on Canadian families increase the risk that parents 
may have neither the time nor the ability to take good care of 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings us to today's motion. In light of what I just said, 
members will agree with me that it is important to give parents 
the means, the flexibility and the options they need to ensure a 
good start for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But before getting any further, let us take a look at the 
preferences of parents when it comes to child care. 
According to a 1997 poll by Compas Research in Alberta, 95% of 
respondents thought that it was better for parents to care for 
infants and pre-schoolers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An earlier country-wide poll by Decima Research found that 70% of 
households with young children and both parents working would 
prefer one of the parents to be able to stay home to care for 
the children, if they could afford to.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is therefore as follows:  should parents have to 
choose between a job that they need and the attention a child 
needs to become a healthy and responsible adult. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Norwegian government answered that question with a 
resounding no.  As of August 1998 it is allocating $570 per month 
per child under three years of age to households where one parent 
remains at home to provide child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we broach this issue by focusing on equal opportunity and 
equality between two income households and households where one 
parent must provide child care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, since each taxpayer finances tax benefits, 
without automatically claiming these benefits, could the current 
Income Tax Act be deemed discriminatory toward households where 
one parent stays home to care for the children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a thorny issue, if ever there was one.  However, this is 
the view held by the national forum on health.  It maintains that 
Canada is the only country in the industrialized world that does 
not take into account in the calculation of income tax expenses 
incurred by households where a parent cares for children at home. 
It further argues that households with children are discriminated 
against in the process. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would say that the child tax benefit, which incidentally 
should be indexed, provides assistance for low income households, 
and that parents who pay for child care are entitled to a tax 
deduction of up to $7,000 per child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But some people fall between the cracks: households that do not 
qualify for the child tax benefit and do without a second income 
so that one of the parents can stay home and care for the 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 14, 1997, the <I>Devoir</I> featured an article that tackled 
the issue head on, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about those who fall between the cracks?  The market alone 
has no answer, and neither do existing social solidarity 
mechanisms.  Another solution must therefore be found.  For some 
time now, people from widely divergent disciplines that rarely 
have anything to do with each other(economics, philosophy, 
sociology) are rediscovering the old idea of a universal income. 
All the proposals focus on the same principle:  pay each member 
of society a basic allowance, with no strings attached. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we reconsider at this time an idea hatched 200 
years ago by Thomas Paine, the great English human rights 
thinker, and later borrowed by 19th century French utopian 
thinkers and later still, by at least two Nobel Prize winners for 
economics who hold generally opposing views, namely Englishman 
James Meade and American Milton Friedman?  As far back as the 
1960s, they were calling for the introduction of a negative tax. 
We could give a Keynesian answer to that question:  When 
circumstances change, my position has to change as well. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not someone who has ever shied away from exploring new and 
innovative ideas that could shed new light on our social 
conditions which no longer meet the changing needs of a modern 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, I do not wish to comment on or argue the 
feasibility or even the eventual terms and conditions of a 
program to financially compensate parents who remain at home, as 
recommended in today's motion.  I will leave this up to those who 
are qualified to do that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I think we should do, however, is offer new opportunities 
to parents wishing to stay at home to care for their children, 
which would mean a better start and, ultimately, improved 
opportunities for this country's most important resource, our 
children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to address the private member's motion 
introduced by the hon. member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say at the outset that I applaud my colleague for his 
interest in the matter of support for families.  Last month we 
debated his previous motion on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few issues matter more to the government than nurturing Canadian 
children, both for their inherent value and for our collective 
future.  There can be no debate that we need to support all 
Canadian families if they undertake the important work of raising 
the next generation of workers, artists, parents and community 
leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government shares my hon. colleague's concern for Canadian 
families and the challenges they face.  However, I am not 
convinced that the best way to address those challenges would be 
by providing a salary for stay-at-home parents with pre-school 
aged children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize that the Income Tax Act already 
includes a number of provisions to assist parents who choose to 
remain in the home.  The spousal credit reduces income tax when 
one spouse earns little income and stays at home.  This measure 
allows the taxpayer supporting a spouse to reduce the amount of 
federal tax paid by $915. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the Canada child tax benefit is based on family income 
and provides a special annual supplement of $213 for each child 
under the age of seven for families where one parent stays home. 
This benefit is provided to three million Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the caregivers tax credit which offers a credit of 
up to $400 to individuals who care for either elderly relatives 
or disabled children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child care expense deduction available to working parents is 
designed to provide assistance to families who must incur child 
care expenses.  Without this support many would not be able to 
earn an income, attend school or take a full time training 
course.  Eight hundred thousand taxpayers count on this deduction 
to help compensate them for the additional costs they must bear 
for child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate should also focus on the crucial consideration of 
the needs of children.  While we must ensure that parents receive 
credit for the task they are doing, our overriding concern ought 
to be the health and welfare of the next generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is precisely because this government is committed to ensuring 
a good start for all of Canada's children that we launched the 
national child benefit system with our provincial partners.  It 
will help millions of low income Canadian families with children, 
regardless of their child care arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the additional $850 million committed in the 1998 budget, 
there will be a total of $1.7 billion each year in new income 
support for Canadian families.  This is in addition to the $5.1 
billion in existing benefits and will bring federal income 
support for families with children to just under $7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our innovative and progressive programs, such as the national 
child benefit system, will get Canadian children off to a good 
start in life by improving benefits and helping parents re-enter 
the job market so they can better meet their own children's 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though Motion M-486 is obviously well intentioned, our 
government remains convinced that the best course is to build on 
the programs we have and that is why I am unable to support this 
motion at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I would like to tell 
the hon. parliamentary secretary that there was a mistake in the 
amount of time allotted to her.  If it is her wish to do so, she 
may conclude her remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is 
one more point that I would like to make and I will take 
advantage of this bit of extra time.  I am speaking about the 
point raised by the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve when he 
suggested that this government wanted to take away Canadian 
women's maternity rights.  I believe if we check <I>Hansard</I> 
that is what the member said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the member and all Canadian women that this is 
the last thing in the world this government would ever intend to 
do.  Every woman has the right to be a mother and we would never, 
ever take away her maternity rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member can rest easy knowing that we are not 
trying to change human nature in this country.  We are trying to 
support those women and men who wish to be parents and raise 
their children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK308"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted to be able to speak to this important motion.  The 
parliamentary secretary has assured us not to worry, that the 
Liberals are in charge and everything will be fine.  I guess we 
should relax easy knowing that the family is protected. 
Yet I find it rather ironic that while it is undoubtedly true 
that the Liberals are committed in principle to supporting 
families and to not undoing the facts of biology, they do indeed 
tax families much more heavily if those families make the 
determination that one of the parents is to stay home and look 
after the children.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some firsthand experience with this since my wife has 
worked as a nanny.  The best and most important principle is that 
parents should be given a free choice as to who looks after their 
preschool children and their school age children before and after 
school.  Different parents for different reasons make different 
choices.  My wife has done such a great job raising our own three 
children so I can go on public television and tell all the 
members in the House that the family that had my wife as nanny 
probably could not have chosen better, except if their mother 
could have stayed at home, but she was working and that is her 
choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our children were young my wife said she would be a full 
time mom and stay with the children.  All our lives we lived on 
one income.  We chose to live on only my income because we 
thought it was very important for the children to at least have 
mom home.  It would have been wonderful if we both could have 
stayed. We would have been even more skinny than we are now. 
That would have been most unfortunate.  All those years we paid a 
penalty for that choice.  Had we made the same amount of income 
between us, with my wife earning some and me earning some, our 
tax bill would have been considerably less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember teaching night classes.  I taught at a technical 
institute.  One of the pleasures of that job was to teach night 
courses.  We had wonderful young people during the day and in the 
evening the institute filled up with working people who went 
there in order to upgrade their skills.  I taught mathematics and 
computing. I had a lot of people who wanted to learn how 
computers worked.  You can tell by my age that I was invented 
about the same time as computers were.  They were new when I was 
a young man giving instruction at the technical institute.  I 
worked Tuesdays and Thursdays.  I remember saying back then that 
I work on Tuesdays for Trudeau and on Thursdays I get to work for 
my family.  That was because even then the marginal tax rate was 
around 50%.  If my wife had been able to earn that money she 
would have had a lower taxation rate because that is the way the 
tax structure was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always felt that the real solution, not the solution this 
member is proposing of paying a salary with taxpayer dollars, 
is simply to arrange our tax system in such a way that families 
that make that choice are not discriminated against by the tax 
system.  That is something I strongly believe in.  It is 
something I hope this government will very quickly implement.  I 
do not expect it but I would like to see it in the next budget. 
We are probably only about two and a half months away from the 
next budget and I would like to see that happen in the next 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the Minister of Finance would say, as the parliamentary 
secretary just said, we value families. 
I hope he follows that by saying beginning today we will no 
longer have discriminatory tax practices against those families 
that choose to have one parent at home.  I would be so 
appreciative.  If that happened it would be very persuasive 
because it is such an important thing, although maybe not enough 
to make me vote Liberal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course I will not vote Liberal because the Reformers are the 
ones who thought of this and that is one of the reasons I joined 
the Reform Party.  We are promoting the idea.  That is one idea I 
really wish they would steal.  I think it is so critically 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember over the years sometimes it was tough, especially 
with my working overtime and being involved in a lot of voluntary 
organization for which I got no extra money.  Sometimes I did not 
get to see my family as much as I wanted.  I really wished that 
there would have been a less discriminatory tax practice even 
against the parent who was out trying to earn a living so that I 
would not have had to work as many hours in order to provide for 
my family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge the government to consider that.  Certainly the 
member who has brought forward this private member's business 
today has the right principle, to free up parents to make those 
choices.  We just disagree in the detail of how it should be 
done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to thank all the members who spoke on this 
motion. I honestly believe all contributions are important. I 
want to thank the Liberal member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, 
who seconded this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pick up on a few points. The member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve talked about the province of Quebec and 
mentioned 1994. It is true that, on September 18, 1994, the 
Premier of Quebec presented the major elements of the 
government's employment program. This program is aimed at 
reforming social security and creating a healthy fiscal 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any contribution to the discussions is welcomed. It is only with 
everyone's participation that we will succeed in developing a 
system that is efficient, fair, flexible and affordable and that 
will meet the existing and future needs of Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Quebec Commission of Inquiry on Health and 
Social Welfare, the first official proposal to provide an annual 
guaranteed income in Canada was made in 1971 by a provincial 
commission in Quebec, the Castonguay-Nepveu Commission, which 
proposed an income security program for that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, Quebec is part of the Canadian family, that is very 
important, but I did appreciate what the hon. member said about 
pay equity. Pay equity is a much talked about issue in the 
public service. However, nobody talks about pay equity in a 
family setting, for those who raise children, the mothers who 
stay home to take care of the children. They too should get a 
pay cheque and pension for that work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pay equity for work done at home is the fight of every Canadian 
woman and many Canadian parents today. It is a fundamental 
right. That is my position. We must find a way to help families. 
Giving more money to the poor will contribute to the eradication 
of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my documentation I read something on Newfoundland income 
supplement program that was set up in 1993. I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission believes that an aggregate guaranteed annual 
income, however modest, with an income supplement program based 
on an earnings test can be financed through savings made in our 
EI program and the replacement of the provincial welfare system, 
without any new taxes or increased deficit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to remind the House that we seem willing to 
grant tax breaks to hockey teams, to all of the Canadian hockey 
teams and hockey players who are earnings millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clémence Côté, from Val d'Or, always told me that there is a 
serious deficiency in the Canadian tax legislation, because it 
penalizes families with children, in the sense that the 
Government of Canada does not take into account the number of 
children a family has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I think we need to set up, on an experimental 
basis, a Canadian annual basic income program. 
This is the only way to assess how a guaranteed income program 
can help to eradicate poverty.

out”.

<P><A NAME="LINK312"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, in November 
I asked the Minister of the Environment to make a commitment to 
clean up the Marwell tar pit in Whitehorse.  It has been 
designated a contaminated site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environment Canada file No. 4186-3-19 of September 1989 provided 
background information on the contamination on this site.  It was 
a U.S. military refinery during World War II.  It was sold and 
then left.  There was an attempt to clean up the pit.  However, a 
large bermed storage tank has been left there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1958 Billy Smith was trapped in the pit and died of exposure 
because he sank into the tar.  In 1970 the land was transferred 
to the commissioner of Yukon.  Contrary to the Fisheries Act, the 
departmental analysis indicated that hydrocarbons, oil, grease 
and manganese have been released to or near fish bearing waters. 
The Yukon River runs almost directly through the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yukon has hundreds of contaminated sites.  This is just one of 
them.  In 1994 the Yukon government asked the then ministers of 
the environment and northern affairs to clean up the site.  These 
letters were acknowledged but never answered.  More recently the 
Whitehorse mayor has asked for the clean-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada negotiated with the United States $135 million to clean 
up old U.S. military sites.  There is also an abandoned DEW line 
site in Yukon as well.  But this agreement does not address or 
resolve the mess left by the U.S. military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government commit to protecting the vulnerable northern 
environment and start by cleaning up the Marwell tar pit. As well 
there are Conal road, the Haines highway, the pipeline, abandoned 
airstrips and another Conal pipeline. It is very critical.  The 
northern environment is vulnerable.  It has been over 50 years. 
Will the federal government take its responsibility and clean up 
the Marwell tar pit? 
<P><A NAME="LINK313"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the hon. member for Yukon on 
behalf of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
concerning contamination at the Marwell tar pit within the city 
of Whitehorse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The site is not under the administration and control of the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. The land 
has been under the control of the Government of Yukon since 
1965-66. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the department worked in partnership with both 
territorial and city of Whitehorse officials to assess the site 
in question.  As part of the assessment process, the Department 
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development funded two pilot 
studies investigating the effectiveness and feasibility of each 
of the two remediation options identified.  This work was funded 
under the Arctic environmental strategy which was established in 
part to assist communities with issues such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departmental officials in Yukon have and will continue to offer 
expertise and assistance to territorial and community officials 
in assessing and remediating contaminated sites within Yukon. 
The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in 
conjunction with an established public policy advisory group will 
address agreed upon priorities within the constraints of 
available funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Government of Canada recognizes that the north is a 
dynamic and important part of Canada.  That is why we work 
closely with our partners in a broad range of initiatives 
affecting the environmental, political and economic aspirations 
of northerners. That is why the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development will continue in its efforts to address 
environment issues in Yukon.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>AIDS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK315"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, last 
Tuesday, I asked the health minister, on world AIDS day, about 
the situation concerning the approval of medication in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is acknowledged the approval process for new drugs in Canada 
is not very competitive, and this is evidenced by the fact that 
two antiviral agents have been available for a year and a half 
in the United States, but are not available in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been estimated that the workload of the health protection 
branch, the unit that approves and market new drugs, is similar 
to what exists in the United States. However, here in Canada, we 
have one third of the resources available in the United States. 
I rose in the House several times to ask the health minister to 
review the process, to provide resources, and groups have 
proposed some solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of these solutions could be a joint approval process for new 
drugs. There is no rationale for a drug company that has an 
affiliate in Canada and one in the United States to submit the 
same research monographs in both countries, and this could be a 
joint process. This solution was proposed to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the solution has to do with the fact that the 
Health Protection Branch, now called the Therapeutic Products 
Branch, sees to it that different persons work on the analysis 
of the files at each stage of the process. With the Canadian 
AIDS Society and other organizations concerned with these 
issues, we think that one way to improve the drug products 
licensing process would be to mandate the same public servants 
from the beginning to the end of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I am asking the government to review this process. I would be 
very happy to work on it in a parliamentary committee, but 
members must know that Liberals have defeated a motion I put 
forward in the standing committee on health asking for the 
creation of a task force and a parliamentary committee on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Justice—who is not very knowledgeable in these matters, but 
very knowledgeable in other areas—will give me some hope. 
<P><A NAME="LINK316"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to be able to give a more detailed answer 
to the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve about the approval 
process for AIDS medication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian approval process is still one of the most highly 
respected drug regulation mechanisms in the world. At the 
present time, 13 antiretroviral drugs have been approved for 
AIDS therapy in Canada. There are several other medications 
especially designed to target opportunistic infections and 
illnesses affecting AIDS victims. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HIV-AIDS drugs submissions are eligible for priority review or 
fast tracking where there is probable clinical evidence that the 
drug may provide an important therapeutic gain.  A number of 
HIV-AIDS drugs were reviewed on a priority basis.  New drug 
submissions for HIV-AIDS drugs are generally reviewed within 
defined performance standards which are comparable to 
international standards. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Medication for HIV/AIDS that is still experimental, or is not 
for general sale in Canada, is accessible to Canadians through 
clinical trials, extended access programs, and the special 
access program.  The latter provides AIDS patients with rapid 
access to experimental drugs on special authorization at the 
attending physician's request. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additionally, with the announcement of the notice of compliance 
with conditions policy, drugs are permitted to be marketed in 
Canada when there is predictive rather than conclusive evidence 
of clinical benefit in the treatment of serious life threatening 
diseases.  Under this policy the drug product manufacturer is 
required to continue to study the drug in order to confirm its 
benefit. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada is involved in several initiatives which ought to 
simplify the drug examination process.  These include 
development of an electronic drug submission system, 
harmonization— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow, at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
