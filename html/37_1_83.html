Martin Cauchon (Minister of
					 National Revenue and Secretary of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada
					 for the Regions of Quebec), Lib.) </b>

	moved that Bill S-23,
					 an act to amend the Customs Act and to make related amendments to other Acts
					 , be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on
					 Bill S-23, a bill aimed at modernizing the entire administration of Canadian
					 customs operations. It addresses an action plan that will make it possible to
					 have better risk management at Canada's borders and to meet the needs of the
					 entire Canadian population in this modern age, that is the era of
					 globalization, and its realities, of which we are all aware. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier this week, it is particularly
					 important that this bill be passed without delay so that we may have the tools
					 we need to enhance our capacity to recognize high-risk individuals and goods at
					 the border before they enter Canada and North America. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to reiterate in the House that the Canada
					 Customs and Revenue Agency takes the security of Canada's borders very
					 seriously. We work in close collaboration with our federal and international
					 partners, sharing information and technologies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have a very close working relationship with our
					 counterparts in U.S. customs and immigration. We are however also aware that
					 border management is a constantly evolving process. That is why we have
					 established a plan on which we have been working for some time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the changes proposed by Bill S-23, the agency
					 will be able to focus its efforts on high risk travellers and goods while
					 simplifying border crossings for those in the low risk category.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be in a position, before these reach the
					 border, to combine risk management techniques and the transmission of
					 information obtained with leading-edge technology and through the use of
					 pre-arrival authorization mechanisms. This will bring about a fundamental
					 change to the way the customs agency operates. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must reiterate that prior to the tragic events in the
					 United States and even more so since, the agency has always had as its priority
					 the security of Canadians, protection of our border, the integrity of major
					 trade corridors and reinforcement of the North American perimeter.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk management approach to border management
					 called for in the customs action plan will enable the government to better
					 uphold these priorities. While we must take measures to enhance the safety and
					 security of Canadians and our border, let us not forget our other important
					 responsibility of ensuring the prosperity of the Canadian economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International trade and tourism are considered the
					 lifeblood of the Canadian economy. Let us not forget our accountability to
					 Canadians to ensure their continuity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to support the government's international
					 trade agreements and its agenda for trade and tourism, the agency needs to
					 modernize the way it carries out its customs operations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's ever changing environment, one of our key
					 goals is to maintain the flow of legitimate trade and travel across the
					 border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, the final elimination of duties between
					 Canada and the U.S. has further stimulated trade and enhanced both our
					 economies. Over the past five years the volume of trade and travel has steadily
					 increased. Every day we process 40,000 commercial entries representing well
					 over $300 billion worth of import trade each year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 100 million travellers cross our border each
					 year and over 80% of these travellers come from the U.S.</p>


	<A NAME="T1005"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1005"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1000"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1005)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CCRA has met the challenges of the last decade in
					 responding to globalization, changing business practices and advancing
					 technology. All this economic activity has had a major impact on customs
					 operations on both sides of the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in good shape today with a range of enforcement
					 initiatives and services that support the protection of Canadians and the
					 competitiveness of business. We are certainly proud of our successes so far.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are also aware of the gap that is growing
					 between the increasing workload and the resources we have available to achieve
					 our goals. This has forced us to re-evaluate how we carry out our dual
					 mandate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By launching our customs action plan, we have already
					 taken a huge step to meet this challenge. The next step takes place now with
					 the passing of Bill S-23.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our customs action plan is a crucial investment for the
					 future. In proposing innovative solutions to today's problems, the plan ensures
					 that our customs' processes will not stand in the way of Canadians' prosperity.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action plan provides for a complete risk management
					 system integrating the principles of pre-arrival data input and a system of
					 prior approval, all thanks to technology. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support this approach we are putting in place a fair
					 and effective system of sanctions. We believe Bill S-23 provides practical
					 measures to deal with non-compliance, from warnings to fines. These measures
					 should have an impact on those who choose not to obey the rules.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 provides options that will facilitate border
					 crossing and make it more productive in today's world. In essence, businesses
					 and individuals with a good history of compliance should be able to benefit.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance with the law is the key to the success of
					 this approach. Bill S-23 aims at improving compliance levels. We believe that
					 improved service and simplified processing will encourage voluntary
					 compliance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, in keeping with the other part of our
					 mandate which is to protect Canadian society, we will continue random checks
					 and monitoring periodically to ensure compliance with Canada's customs laws and
					 regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the customs action plan, we will be
					 implementing this fall the customs self-assessment program. This program is a
					 direct result of our consultations with members of the business community who
					 consider it their highest priority. The program is based on the principles of
					 risk management which provide for agreements with proven clients. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating importers who have been rigorously
					 selected prior to their approval, will be able to use their own administrative
					 system to meet our requirements for receipts and trade data. This will be a
					 comprehensive self-assessment system supported by our audit
					 activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program will also simplify the customs process by
					 offering increased speed and certainty to pre-approved importers who use the
					 services of pre-approved carriers and drivers to import low risk goods. There
					 is no doubt this is a great step forward in border management.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monetary penalties set out in Bill S-23 aim to
					 establish fair rules for businesses in Canada. This comprehensive set of
					 penalties will encourage people to observe the law, thanks to a series of
					 penalties that will vary in severity depending on the type and severity of the
					 offence committed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the agency is aware that some of its
					 clients may require a certain amount of time to familiarize themselves with all
					 of the requirements with which they will need to comply. This is why importers
					 will be given a transition period through April 1, 2002.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the case of the customs self-assessment
					 program, some of the penalties will take effect as soon as the program is
					 implemented.</p>


	<A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of Bill S-23 would also bring exciting
					 options for travellers. Many people will have heard of the CANPASS highway
					 program which was pilot tested in a number of locations in recent years. Under
					 this permit based program, travellers pre-approved by a rigorous training
					 process are permitted to use designated lanes at border crossings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the expedited passenger processing
					 system for travellers. Under this new program, EPPS participants will be able
					 to use an automated kiosk that will confirm their identity and membership in
					 the program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another initiative is the harmonized highway pilot,
					 also known as Nexus. Its goal is to provide a seamless service to pre-approved
					 low risk travellers entering Canada and the U.S. at these border points using
					 technology and a common card.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe these initiatives will serve Canadians well
					 by improving the flow of people and goods across the border and by
					 strengthening our ability to do job number one: protecting
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments to the Customs Act proposed in Bill S-23
					 would allow for the introduction of advanced passenger information and
					 passenger notification record. With those programs, customs officers will
					 receive certain prescribed information from commercial transportation companies
					 and drivers, crew members and passengers in advance of their arrival in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to clarify to the hon. member that this
					 is not new information. Customs officers can obtain the same information
					 through questioning travellers and examining their travel documents. However,
					 by receiving this information in advance, customs officers will be able to make
					 enlightened decisions prior to the arrival of people thereby making it easier
					 to identify high risk travellers and facilitating the movement of legitimate
					 travellers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency will continue to be vigilant and will
					 conduct random customs examinations. The instincts of our well trained,
					 experienced customs officers will continue to be our guiding force.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other examples that demonstrate the
					 importance of this bill. This is why I cannot insist enough on the importance
					 of moving forward with Bill S-23. I believe that this legislation is a bold and
					 innovative step in the modernization and management of Canada's borders.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 will help Canadians compete and prosper on
					 international markets. It will allow the agency to help maximize the flow of
					 commercial cargo and travellers in good standing. The bill will also provide us
					 with the tools we need to better protect our borders and our country and it
					 will allow us to ensure the safety of our communities and our families. I am
					 sure we all agree that Canadians expect nothing less. </p>

	<A NAME="Int-50552"></A><a HREF="#Int-50555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-50550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona,
					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of Her Majesty's loyal
					 opposition to address the second reading of Bill S-23, an act to amend the
					 Customs Act and to make related amendments to other acts. Bill S-23 comes
					 before the House at a great time of crisis when the eyes of Canadians, and
					 indeed the world, are upon our borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to thank our customs officers who, in the
					 aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, have been under incredible
					 pressure working extra long hours thoroughly checking thousands of travellers
					 seeking entrance to Canada. They are doing a tremendous and extremely valuable
					 job with limited human, technological and financial resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will address the initiatives enacted by Bill S-23 and
					 their impact on our economy and trade relations; and, more important, the
					 importance of our trade relationship with the United States and what is needed
					 to protect and stabilize that relationship. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a trading nation. Our economy has positioned
					 itself over the past decade to facilitate, expand and promote our international
					 trade relationships. None of these relationships are as crucial as our
					 relationship with the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the FTA and NAFTA the Canada Customs and
					 Revenue Agency handles over $500 billion in cross-border trade and processes
					 more than 108 million travellers each year. These numbers dictate that
					 efficient systems need to be implemented to keep pace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada-United States accord on our shared border
					 was signed in 1995 with a number of goals: to promote international trade; to
					 streamline processes for legitimate travellers and commercial goods; to provide
					 enhanced protection against drug smuggling and the illegal entrants of people;
					 and to reduce costs to both governments. The initiatives we are debating today
					 were derived to fulfill the accord's goals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The customs action plan began in 1998 involving
					 nationwide consultations with groups representing trade and traveller groups to
					 streamline the processing of goods and travellers based on risk assessment and
					 a fair, effective sanctions regime. I commend the minister and his department
					 for seeking industry input to reflect its needs and realities in these
					 amendments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canpass permit program contained in the bill allows
					 travellers who frequently cross the border by air or surface for legitimate
					 purposes to register with the government and pass through the border without
					 having to stop for questioning. These participants are thoroughly checked
					 before being accepted to the program and are subject to random spot checks to
					 ensure compliance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrative monetary penalties system, or AMPS,
					 is a new regime to help ensure compliance. In the past, penalties and sanctions
					 were rigid and in many cases too extreme for small infractions. For example,
					 the seizure of a vehicle is hardly an appropriate penalty for a $100
					 discrepancy in declared goods.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AMPS regime sanctions range from simple warnings to
					 punitive fines of $25,000 to match the severity and frequency of infractions.
					 The flexibility and discretion facilitated by this regime would allow fines to
					 be administered on the basis of fairness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Canadian Alliance's ongoing concerns with
					 our airports and ports of entry has been the ability of Canadian officials to
					 determine the identity of those arriving and the ability to separate arriving
					 passengers from other people in the plaza. We have called on the government to
					 utilize electronic technology to forward travel document information from
					 departure to destination to deal with those who arrive at customs without
					 identification.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of refugee claimants have arrived in Canada
					 without travel documents or identification, but they had documents when they
					 boarded a plane to get to Canada. The advance passenger information system, or
					 API, requires commercial carriers to provide information in advance of arrival
					 with respect to drivers, crew members and passengers.</p>


	<A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a step in the right direction. However much
					 more is needed to adequately meet the needs of Canadian security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 would allow for the examination of export
					 mail. As a Canadian dedicated to the protection and advancement of personal
					 liberties, I am uncomfortable voting for such an amendment. However I
					 understand the rationale for such procedures. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned about the frequency and discretion of
					 those who would be permitted to intercept and examine outgoing mail. We have
					 experienced many complaints of overzealous examination of inbound mail.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding of Edmonton--Strathcona, in an area called
					 Old Strathcona, there are a number of import based industries on the retail
					 front. Some of these industries import on a regular basis various artifacts
					 from Africa and Latin America. One of these importers has been in business for
					 over 10 years. They have an ongoing problem with customs at the border when
					 many of their products come into the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the changes prescribed in the bill would help
					 to address some of those problems. One of the biggest complaints made by these
					 importers is the fact that when their goods come from customs there is not the
					 required due diligence in respect of their products being in the right
					 condition so they can sell them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my constituents sustained $60,000 worth of
					 damage to his goods because of the way customs searched through all the
					 products that came through without proper attention to due diligence. That is
					 outrageous. In some cases that can make or break certain businesses, depending
					 upon the kind of business they are in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is unfortunate and it is due to certain rules
					 currently in the Customs Act that allow customs officials to check these
					 products. Once they start rifling through them the insurance on these packages
					 is no longer valid. Once damage has been done the recipient cannot get
					 reimbursed for any loss. That is a big problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of my concerns that relates to personal
					 liberties because we need to protect the flow of goods coming through. We need
					 to be thorough and do the proper checks. There is no doubt about that. However
					 we must respect people's property, their businesses and their livelihoods. If
					 that is not done effectively then many business owners would potentially lose
					 millions of dollars and unfortunately have products they cannot use or
					 sell.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initiatives and programs contained in Bill S-23
					 would benefit many Canadian companies in their administrative tasks by allowing
					 Canadians to import materials and products with greater ease. However
					 reciprocal programs on the part of the United States are lacking. The programs
					 do very little to help Canadian companies access American markets. These
					 initiatives do not help Canadian employees for whom the prosperity of their
					 families and livelihoods are contingent upon unfettered access to the United
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada-U.S. border is a clash in fundamental
					 philosophies. The U.S. customs service believes that its primary mandate is
					 enforcement, whereas Canada Customs believes that its primary mandate is to
					 liberate trade restrictions and collect revenues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the terrorist attacks in the United States
					 on September 11, our border security has come under increased scrutiny. The
					 debate over liberalization of border procedures may only be entertained within
					 a greater debate on national security, in particular border
					 integrity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can have it both ways: a border that expedites
					 international trade while closing its doors to terrorism, organized crime and
					 smugglers. What is required is a principled plan and the political will to defy
					 bureaucratic agendas, to ignore special interest interventions and to resist
					 the vices of political expediency.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is needed is a government that exhibits leadership
					 and resolve, two qualities yet to be displayed by the administration. Since the
					 tragedy of September 11, the Prime Minister has done little more than offer
					 platitudes and deflect blame. To continue along this path would only result in

					 job of policing their borders the U.S. would work with them. Last night
					 President Bush stated that there is no truer friend to the United States than
					 Great Britain. When Canada markets itself to the world our greatest selling
					 feature is our proximity to the United States and the privilege of being its
					 most favoured nation. What happens if that relationship were to be
					 diminished?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that a politician's enemy is a hypothetical
					 question. However I question how hypothetical it actually is. I read in the
					 <i>National Post</i> that Honda was reconsidering investing in Canada and was
					 contemplating redirecting that investment to the United States due to the
					 uncertainty surrounding the flow across the Canada-U.S. border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of recent tragedies Canada has been given an
					 opportunity to address our security deficiencies. There is an inherent
					 responsibility on the part of the government to do so. By taking immediate
					 action the government would not be capitulating to American interests but
					 rather responding in a practical and prudent manner. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I emphasize the importance of securing and expanding
					 our trade relationship with the United States. There is no turning back from
					 free trade. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No issue is of greater urgency than the security of the
					 North American perimeter. Our walls must be reinforced and entry and exit
					 security must be improved. By threatening the openness we have enjoyed along
					 the Canada-U.S. border we jeopardize billions of dollars of trade and tens of
					 thousands of Canadian jobs. Our very standard of living is at stake as over 87%
					 of our trade is done with the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concept is based on common sense. Canada and the
					 United States, through NAFTA and numerous other accords and treaties, are the
					 world's closest allies. We share the longest undefended border in the world. If
					 we want to maintain that relationship we must ascertain who is crossing that
					 border by first of all identifying who is in our respective countries. Only
					 when we can confirm the integrity of our external borders can we minimize the
					 scrutiny of our shared border. A bilateral initiative with the United States to
					 share border integrity is integral. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of immigration, those who argue deceptively
					 that strength in screening approaches are anti-immigrant are mistaken. Our
					 immigration policies must be generous. However they must be rigorous. We can no
					 longer have a policy of admit first, ask questions later.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policies and laws must protect the lives and
					 livelihoods of Canadians. We must weigh the concerns about the safety of our
					 citizens and the preservation of an open trade relationship with the United
					 States against our humanitarian responsibility to receive genuine refugees.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of displaced persons find refuge in Canada
					 every year. The vast majority are legitimate refugees. Many others are seeking
					 to circumvent the immigration system or gain access to Canada for the purpose
					 of criminal and terrorist activity. The latter comprise the minority of those
					 seeking asylum. However they have an astute knowledge of our laws and know how
					 to navigate their way through the system and carry out their agenda to the
					 detriment of Canadian society as a whole. Collateral damage occurs through
					 association by creating a negative impression of their ethnic or religious
					 community in Canada.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance does not criticize the federal
					 government's underlying intentions for granting refuge. Our grievances are with
					 the process. We want to help as many legitimate refugees as possible, however,
					 we believe stringent and secure refugee determination processes are in the best
					 interests of genuine refugees seeking entrance to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to have entrance to Canada granted, the
					 identity of applicants must be ascertained. Their whereabouts while in Canada
					 must be monitored. Those whose identities and backgrounds cannot be determined
					 must be detained and those whose applications for asylum are denied must be
					 deported forthwith. When it comes to accountability, this is the bare
					 minimum.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A message must be sent out to the world that Canada is
					 a home for those in genuine need of humanitarian support, however, those
					 attempting to take advantage and abuse our humanitarian generosity will be
					 punished severely and swiftly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjudication of refugee cases must be performed by
					 qualified officers. Political organizers, fundraisers and unsuccessful
					 candidates are not qualified to perform such a rigorous mandate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members know, I am quite sensitive to the issue of
					 refugees and Canada opening its arms to refugees. As like many in the House, my
					 family came to Canada as refugees. We fled the dictatorship of Idi Amin in
					 Uganda where our family was unfortunately kicked out in the early 1970s, three
					 generations living in a country we called home, where we built our own wealth,
					 friendship and families. Freedom was ripped away from us overnight without any
					 justification except that we were discriminated against because of the colour
					 of our skin. We did not fit into that particular community. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that unfortunate event in Uganda, my home country
					 where I was born, we were fortunate that we were able to come to Canada. Canada
					 welcomed us with open arms. If we look at the number of refugees during that
					 period of time from that particular region of the country and see how they have
					 contributed to this country with all the people who are either working now as
					 professionals, adding to the economy and to the community by volunteering, it
					 is fantastic to see those sorts of rewards that Canada was able to reap by
					 having such a generous and humanitarian policy for settling
					 refugees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what we need to focus on. We need to continue
					 to allow Canadians such as my family, who are so thankful that Canada welcomed
					 us here with open arms, and others who want to come to this country, to take
					 advantage of the opportunity and not abuse the laws. As I mentioned, those who
					 abuse the laws are in the minority. We need to make sure that people coming to
					 the country are not done in by the laws of this country, especially by those
					 who unfortunately want to abuse those laws. I am sensitive to that. I encourage
					 that. As a refugee I feel that we have to do as much as we can, but we have to
					 be rigorous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the most ardent proponents of reforming
					 Canada's immigration and refugee determination laws are new immigrants
					 themselves. They all went through the hoops and met every requirement. Not only
					 are they upset with those who abuse the refugee system, they are livid with
					 those of their community who abuse the system and commit crimes in Canada,
					 casting a negative light upon their community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is not doing its job properly. This is
					 evident with the backlash experienced by Canada's Islamic and Sikh communities.
					 Government mismanagement of the refugee system is a disservice to the immigrant
					 communities that are working hard to contribute to a country which has given
					 them so much.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion I would like to state the fact that the
					 bill was first introduced in the Senate, which is unelected and lacks
					 legitimacy to address legislation prior to the House of Commons, and I would
					 like to state the fact that the Canadian Alliance demand is for anti-terrorist
					 legislation to strengthen national security and eradicate terrorist activity
					 within Canada.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, in my first speech to the House since the
					 tragic events of September 11, I would like to take a few moments to extend my
					 most sincere condolences to the people who have been saddened by this terrible
					 event, on behalf of the people of Rivière-des-Mille--Îles, the people of Quebec
					 and of Canada. I wish to assure them that they are in our hearts, in our
					 thoughts and in our prayers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving now to Bill S-23 which was passed by the Senate
					 on June 7, the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of this bill provided certain major
					 amendments are passed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind hon. members that the Bloc Quebecois has
					 always been in favour of the movement of goods and services between countries,
					 and of free trade. The proof of this is, in fact, that the government of Quebec
					 and the Bloc Quebecois were the first to approve NAFTA under the Mulroney
					 government. At that time, I would also remind hon. members, our friends across
					 the way were against it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois and the government of Quebec were
					 also in favour of the open skies project. They are in favour of the FTAA. The
					 Bloc Quebecois has always been a supporter of free trade, provided individuals'
					 rights and culture are always respected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will discuss the background of Bill S-23. This bill
					 started out as a draft bill in the fall of 1998 when Revenue Canada, which has
					 now become the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, published a discussion paper
					 entitled “Customs Blueprint”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that document the department pledged first to
					 improve the services provided; second, to ensure that businesses and travellers
					 comply with the regulations; third, to identify efforts to end illegal
					 activities and threats to health and safety; fourth, to promote certainty and
					 consistency for travellers and business people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this discussion paper the Canada Customs and
					 Revenue Agency released the customs action plan for the years 2000-04. Customs
					 new approach is based on a comprehensive risk management system that integrates
					 the principles of self-assessment and information collection, as well as
					 special authorizations regarding the main following features: processing
					 techniques based on risks for travellers and business people; streamlined
					 processes when risks are low; more thorough processes when risks are greater or
					 when they are unknown. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we include in the unknown risks the new unknown
					 risk for everyone posed by terrorism? I think so. As for the second principle,
					 it was based on a fair and effective sanctions system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that this new approach is good in itself and
					 implements a way of doing cross-border trading and travel much more
					 expeditiously. It should be noted that the bill seems more geared to
					 Canada-United States transportation. More importantly though, it could be
					 adjusted to international travel in the near or not too distant middle future.
					 I do not remember seeing any mention of marine transport in the bill, but we
					 should start thinking about it. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill can therefore be summed up as follows: first,
					 it provides for the expedited movement of persons and goods into Canada;
					 second, it provides for streamlined clearance procedures for low risk
					 passengers by pre-arrival risk assessment of passenger information; third, it
					 provides for new requirements in respect of the provision of information
					 obtained under that act; fourth, it provides for monetary penalties in respect
					 of designated contraventions; fifth, it extends the deadline for requesting
					 reviews and appeals beyond current time limits; sixth, it harmonizes provisions
					 for the collection of amounts owing under that act with those of the Income Tax
					 Act and the Excise Tax Act; seventh, it makes technical and housekeeping
					 amendments; and eighth, it makes related amendments to other acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us be prudent. I would like the minister
					 responsible for the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency to be very prudent. My
					 question this morning is this: Will Bill S-23 address all the shortcomings
					 identified by the auditor general in his April 11, 2000 report with respect to
					 the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency? Let us again look at what the auditor
					 general said in his report.</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>We found that risk assessment is
						  incomplete: Customs does not have important information it needs from a variety
						  of departments and agencies to fully assess the risks its inspectors face. It
						  needs to know where the risks are highest so it can determine the best way to
						  control them. We have recommended that Customs work more diligently to obtain
						  information on the risks arising from the responsibilities it carries out at
						  ports of entry on behalf of other departments—Citizenship and Immigration
						  Canada, Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, for example—and
						  include them in its national risk assessment. It also needs to have up-to-date
						  memoranda of understanding with those departments, setting out their respective
						  roles and responsibilities. </small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit worrisome.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of this legislation concerns us
					 considerably, and I refer to mail searches. The bill provides a means for
					 searches of all mail of more than 30 grams in weight. This is disturbing
					 because it is a form of interfering with people's fundamental rights. When the
					 bill was under consideration in Senate committee, the Canadian bar submitted an
					 excellent brief on March 15, 2001 and I invite the Minister responsible for the
					 Canada Customs and Revenue Agency to note the position taken by the Canadian
					 Bar Association. The points it makes are certainly important. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, one point in this bill is of concern. It is
					 the power accorded the minister. The bill also contains many regulations. Most
					 of the points of law will be resolved by regulations.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister will have to define and make public the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois supports the principle of the law.
					 Indeed, goods and people must be expedited through customs, but not at all
					 cost. I think the minister will have to make certain changes to his bill for us
					 to support it completely.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can only support any government initiative designed
					 to facilitate trade and speed up customs procedures. We can only support a bill
					 that can improve these aspects and thus ensure that our country can export its
					 goods and services more easily to the United States and even elsewhere in the
					 world while promoting cordial relations with our trading partners.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we support in principle Bill S-23
					 introduced by our learned colleague the hon. member for Outremont.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we must be extremely careful because the
					 government has the unfortunate tendency to introduce bills that refer to all
					 sorts of provisions and regulations that have yet to be drafted. When
					 regulations can be twice as long as the bill itself, it is cause for concern
					 because we are not getting the full picture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of the bills introduced by the government in
					 recent years had this unfortunate feature. For example, the Bank Act provides
					 that regulations will come later. In the case of certain provisions, we are
					 still waiting for these regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem with Bill S-23 that also existed with
					 the Bank Act is the very broad discretionary powers given to the minister
					 responsible, in this case the Minister of National Revenue, who is in charge of
					 customs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must avoid this kind of situation since we can only
					 evaluate a bill on its merits if it includes specific provisions. In the bill
					 before us, there are at least three issues that deserve a much more indepth
					 review than is now possible without the regulations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, when the government talks about expanding the
					 CANPASS program so that more exporters and importers can move their goods more
					 rapidly through customs simply by showing their CANPASS membership card, we may
					 well wonder how we can evaluate the fairness and impact of this measure if we
					 do not know what criteria is used when deciding whether certain exporters or
					 importers should be allowed to qualify for the CANPASS program. They will be
					 able to pass through Canadian and U.S. customs more quickly. Another category
					 will be refused CANPASS accreditation after their cases are
					 considered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are we to evaluate the fairness of this decision?
					 What avenues of appeal are open to exporters and importers? It is important
					 that the criteria for accreditation be clearly known.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Because those who qualify under the CANPASS
					 program will have a competitive advantage over their competitors. Why? Because
					 they will be able to point to their CANPASS accreditation as a business
					 advantage and tell their clients “I guarantee you that there will be no wait at
					 Canadian customs. I will be able to clear the goods, and you will receive them
					 faster than if you use my competitor who does not have a CANPASS”.</p>


	<A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It becomes a bit like the ISO standard in industry. It
					 becomes a symbol of recognition of the performance of these exporters or
					 importers. If a company obtains CANPASS accreditation and another company in
					 the same sector or in another Canadian province does not, we need to know why.
					 Because the former has an advantage over the latter, as it would in the case of
					 ISO standards, because it can show that it is able to expedite its shipping
					 contracts for its clients.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example concerns the system for expediting
					 passenger movement. We have no indication of the criteria which will be used.
					 It is a bit disturbing when the minister is being given discretionary power, or
					 we are waiting for regulations yet to come, but we do not know the criteria
					 that will be used in awarding these accreditations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would also allow—and the privacy commissioner
					 highlighted this problem with Bill S-23—Canada Customs agents to open packages
					 weighing over 30 grams. Once again this raises some issues. Surely there is
					 some way to limit this power to open mail without a warrant and without any
					 legal reason. Surely there is some way to better define this aspect of the
					 bill. This is what we will work on in the coming weeks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we support this bill in theory since it will help
					 simplify trade, we have some serious concerns with regard to provisions
					 contained within the bill. To this end, we are asking—and I am sure that we
					 will have the co-operation of the minister responsible—that the minister
					 provide us with the bulk of the regulations at the same time as we are studying
					 the bill in committee specifically, so that we can get the whole picture of the
					 situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, I would invite the minister responsible
					 for the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency to come up with a work plan to review
					 new provisions regarding international trade, as well as the existing ones, in
					 light of the new circumstances, that is, the tragedy that took place some ten
					 days ago in the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, increasing security means tightening certain
					 customs regulations and increasing the resources allocated to border
					 surveillance. I hope the minister already has a work plan to review how Canada
					 protects its borders and to ensure that this is improved in view of the new and
					 terrifying events that took place in the United States the week before
					 last.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would ask the minister responsible, because
					 this is part of his mandate, to try to see how we could neutralize, in the near
					 future, the work of money laundering organizations that conduct their
					 activities all over the world and often have a base of operations in Canada. I
					 would ask the minister—because it is ultimately his responsibility—to review,
					 in co-operation with the Minister of Finance, even though it is the Minister of
					 National Revenue who is responsible for their implementation, the tax treaties
					 signed with some countries that are deemed to be tax havens. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1993 we have been asking the government to review
					 these tax treaties, to provide more resources so as to put pressure on these
					 tax havens to stop their unfair way of processing tax resources and
					 particularly money laundering activities, given what happened in the United
					 States and given the statements made by the western world regarding the fight
					 against tax havens and money laundering, which are the source of wealth of
					 terrorist groups. The government should take a serious look at this issue. I
					 will complete my speech after oral question period. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I ask hon. members of the House to join
					 with me today in recognizing the 20th anniversary of Ontario's blue box
					 recycling program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue box was the brainchild of Kitchener resident
					 Nyle Ludolph, a garbage collector with Laidlaw, who helped launch the program
					 in 1981. Two hundred and fifty Kitchener homes received the first blue boxes
					 and the program was soon expanded to 34,000 homes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ontario residents were eager to make use of the blue
					 box in their efforts to reduce, recycle and reuse. Today approximately four
					 million Ontario households have curb or depot access to recycling. In 1999
					 successful recycling helped divert 658,000 tonnes of waste from Ontario
					 landfill sites.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue box idea has been adopted by numerous homes
					 throughout Canada, the United States, France, Australia and the U.K. Recycling
					 is one of the simple ways Canadians can build a healthier and cleaner
					 environment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask hon. members of the House to join me in
					 recognizing this important anniversary.</p>

					 causing abnormal movement and postures. Often those afflicted by dystonia can
					 go a long period of time without seeking medical assistance because they are
					 unaware of the disorder.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately there are organizations such as the
					 Dystonia Support Group that is working to promote a greater awareness of
					 dystonia and providing support to known sufferers within the
					 community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate all the volunteers and extend my
					 appreciation and gratitude for their dedication and selfless giving.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, in June the finance minister said he would
					 introduce a fall budget if the economy worsened. Clearly the minister
					 recognizes that the economy has indeed worsened. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since June, 27,000 Canadians have lost their jobs. We
					 have seen the worst quarter in terms of economic growth in six years.
					 Universally economists are speaking of a global recession. Additionally, in
					 light of recent events, we now need to ensure more military and security
					 resources to defend the security of our borders, the safety of our citizens and
					 ultimately to meet our commitment to our allies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabinet is now proposing an economic stimulus package
					 that could run the country into deficit. Canadians deserve a full budget so
					 that their elected members of parliament can play a role in making the tough
					 economic decisions that lie ahead. Canadians want their priorities protected,
					 even if it means reducing frivolous and unnecessary Liberal spending. Canadians
					 do not want an unnecessary budget deficit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We call on the finance minister to honour his June
					 commitment and to table a full budget this fall.</p>

					 (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the attack on the United States last week
					 not only warned Americans of the destruction that terrorists can cause, but
					 Canadians have realized for the first time that no one is safe from terrorism,
					 including ourselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this very real danger, what do Canadians have the
					 right to expect of their government? First, they have the right to expect
					 strong anti-terrorism legislation that would ensure that Canada does not
					 harbour terrorists or terrorist groups. Such legislation would define terrorism
					 in a comprehensive manner, name and outlaw specific terrorist groups and would
					 ban fundraising and other support activities on behalf of terrorist
					 groups.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes would need to be combined with
					 legislative changes to existing laws, including amending our laws so that we
					 can extradite suspected terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to legislative changes, Canadians also have
					 the right to expect more resources to be directed toward enforcement. Adequate
					 staffing is crucial at organizations such as CSIS, the RCMP and national
					 defence. The good men and women who work in these organizations must have the
					 tools they need to get the job done.</p>

					 certainly are looking at that measure. It is also important to tell Canadians
					 what else we are doing currently. Pursuant to UN Security Council resolution
					 1333, on February 22 Canada passed regulations to “freeze without delay funds

	Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of
					 National Defence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Canadians strongly condemn the terrorist attacks
					 on September 11, many Canadians are also deeply concerned and reject George
					 Bush's dangerous new war that ignores the United Nations and international
					 law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Prime Minister tell George Bush on Monday that
					 there are not only two choices, the choice between the United States and
					 terrorism, but that there is a third choice, the choice of respect for
					 international law and the United Nations? Will the Prime Minister make it clear
					 that we reject George Bush's war?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this country respects international law.
					 The Prime Minister has made that very clear. We are a country that is a
					 democracy, that respects the rule of law. I am sure President Bush knows that.
					 What needs to be done though within that framework, within the rule of law and
					 within the framework of the United Nations is to deal with terrorism
					 effectively. It is a threat to the United States. It is a threat to us. It is a

	Madam Speaker, Question No. 58 will be answered today.
					 </p>


	<p>[<i>Text</i>]</p>


	<center><b>Question No. 58--</b></center>
		

	<b>Mr. Randy
					 White</b>:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the net impact on Canada's medical
					 system and social programs of the family reunification class of immigration
					 over the latest year period for which data is available, has the net impact
					 been increasing or decreasing, and has the family reunification class been a
					 net contributor to, or a net beneficiary of, Canada's medical system and social
					 programs over that same period?</p>


	<b>Mr. Geoff Regan (Parliamentary Secretary
					 to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons,
					 Lib.)</b>:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, with respect to Human Resources
					 Development Canada, since provincial governments administer social programs, it
					 is difficult to ascertain, with any degree of certainty, the impact of the
					 family reunification class of immigration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among immigrant families that have been in Canada for
					 10 to 15 years, the incidence of poverty, defined as the percentage falling
					 below the low income cut off, is comparable to that for Canadian-born families:
					 13% for immigrant families v. 14% for Canadian-born families in
					 1997.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, immigrants tend to have a higher level of
					 education and skills than other Canadians. In 1999, 57% of working-age
					 immigrants at landing had a post-secondary degree, compared to about 42% of the
					 Canadian working age population. Moreover, research shows that once immigrants
					 adapt to Canada and the demands of the labour market, the average income of
					 immigrant families exceeds that of Canadian families.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of reasons why immigrants may
					 experience problems integrating successfully into the labour market. For
					 example, individuals trained in a foreign country often encounter obstacles
					 having their education, experience, skills, training and credentials assessed
					 or recognised in Canada. This is why the January 2001 Speech from the Throne
					 outlined the need to attract skilled workers to Canada, and the government's
					 intent to work in co-operation with the provinces and territories to secure
					 better recognition of the foreign credentials of immigrants and to ease their
					 integration into Canadian society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note, however, that the share of
					 immigrants in the family class has actually been declining. Immigrants are
					 divided into three main groups: economic class, family class and refugees.
					 Between 1980 and 1999, the share of immigrants coming to Canada in the family
					 class fell from 34% to 29%, while the share of immigrants in the economic class
					 rose from 32% to 56%. Accounting for more than one-half of all immigrants in
					 1999, the economic class is much less likely to need to use social programs,
					 relative to the family class or refugees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human Resources Development Canada is unable to provide
					 an assessment of the net impact over the last 10 years of the family
					 reunification class of immigration on Canada's old age security, OAS, program
					 and the Canada pension plan, CPP, as statistics are not collected on immigrants
					 who come to Canada to join family members already established in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, newcomers to Canada must earn the right to
					 benefits just like any other Canadian. Social security agreements with other
					 countries can help people to qualify for OAS and CPP benefits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for the OAS pension is based on age and
					 residence in Canada. Newcomers to Canada have never been eligible for full OAS
					 benefits immediately upon arrival. Most individuals must live in Canada at
					 least 10 years after age 18 in order to get a partial OAS pension. However,
					 people who move from one country to another to live or work can qualify in less
					 than 10 years for Canadian pension benefits through the application of
					 international social security agreements. These agreements co-ordinate the
					 operation of the OAS program with comparable programs in other countries, and
					 enable individuals to maintain continuity in their social security coverage.
					 Through these agreements, an individual may qualify for a partial OAS pension
					 by adding together periods of residence in Canada and periods of residence
					 and/or coverage, credits, under the programs(s) of another country to meet the
					 minimum residence requirement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1996 the rules applicable to some immigrants
					 from countries with social security agreements with Canada were modified in two
					 ways. First, sponsored immigrants from a country with which Canada has an
					 international agreement are not eligible for the guaranteed income supplement
					 or allowance benefits during their sponsorship period, up to a maximum of 10
					 years, except in specific circumstances. The supplement and the allowance are
					 income tested benefits provided to people who are largely dependent on the OAS
					 pension. This change recognizes the responsibility of sponsors to support
					 immigrants during that time. Second, non-sponsored immigrants from these same
					 countries can earn the supplement or allowance benefit at a rate of 1/10 for
					 each year of residence in Canada after age 18.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for CPP benefits is based on participation
					 in the Canadian workforce. The CPP is designed to replace a portion of the
					 earnings from employment or self-employment that are no longer available to
					 contributors and their families due to retirement, disability, or death. To
					 qualify for a CPP retirement pension, a person has to have made at least one
					 valid contribution to the CPP. However, the pension would be very small. A
					 newcomer to Canada would have to contribute for several years to qualify for a
					 CPP disability benefit. A person has to have made contributions for at least
					 four years in the last six years. Survivors benefits are based on the
					 contributions of the deceased. Social security agreements can help people who
					 come from countries with social programs comparable to the CPP to qualify for
					 disability and survivors benefits. Each country pays in proportion to the
					 number of years or credits built up in the respective plans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, no
					 data is available as to the net impact of family reunification on Canada's
					 medical system and social programs. Although it is difficult to quantify their
					 contribution to Canada, family class immigrants do contribute to Canada's
					 economy. Parents and grandparents may serve as caregivers to working parents,
					 and other family class members may assist in family operated businesses which
					 creates employment for all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries are made up of individual families and this
					 reality is enshrined in the Immigration Act, which has as one its objectives to
					 facilitate the reunion in Canada of Canadian citizens and permanent residents
					 with their close relatives from abroad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to Health Canada, it does not maintain
					 such information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of the motion that
				Bill S-23, an act to amend the Customs Act and
				to make related amendments to other acts, be now read the second
				time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment.</p>

					 (Saint-Hyacinthe--Bagot, BQ): </b>

	Madam Speaker, as I was saying before being interrupted
					 for oral question period, we had certain reservations about the bill. These
					 were threefold.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, regulations are needed for certain
					 matters that strike us as crucial, including the criteria for accreditation of
					 Canadian or American individuals or companies, so that when CANPASS
					 accreditation is refused, the reasons for that refusal are known and corrective
					 action is taken in order to maintain healthy competition between Canadian and
					 American companies in the same sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we also have certain reservations about the
					 minister's discretionary power in certain cases. It is a failing of the
					 government that it always includes several provisions in a bill referring to
					 the minister's discretion. At some point everything is up to the minister's
					 discretion and this concerns us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for giving customs officers increased authority to
					 open mail in the case of envelopes weighing 30 grams or more, we question the
					 appropriateness of such a measure. Customs officers already have certain
					 powers, but it would be excessive to open mail without an arrest warrant or
					 serious doubts about the nature of a parcel. Even the Canadian Bar Association
					 questions these stepped up measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following discussions with the Minister of National
					 Revenue, who is responsible for the economic development agency, it wanted us
					 to have some assurances regarding the possibility of having regulations with
					 the bill, especially when it is examined in committee or at least of our having
					 a statement of principle or a political statement for certain parts of the
					 bill. It will be especially important to have a larger picture than that of the
					 bill in which we find incredible gaps that prevent our understanding things
					 properly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We got this assurance and I think we will watch how
					 things develop because the Minister of National Revenue and minister
					 responsible for economic development is not in the habit of saying just
					 anything. We will therefore await further developments in the hope that the
					 minister will provide the clarification we seek.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, at this second reading stage my party is
					 going to support this bill, but we will be waiting for developments from the
					 minister responsible who, let us hope, will meet our expectations. If at the
					 end of the process we are not satisfied with respect to the concerns we have
					 mentioned throughout this speech, we would have to oppose the bill unless there
					 are amendments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, we are in support of the bill's principles at
					 second reading because international trade could benefit. The administrative
					 problems encountered by certain companies and individuals in conducting
					 business with the United States in particular, could be reduced. This could be
					 a positive thing in the circumstances.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, the NDP caucus feels that Bill S-23 is
					 less about providing for the expedited movement of persons and goods into
					 Canada, or even about making technical or housekeeping changes to the current
					 practices, and more about economic sovereignty. It is about the larger issue of
					 the whole subject of North American integration and the ultimate disappearance
					 of our borders. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill, like many others introduced by the Liberal
					 government, is like a Trojan horse. The government introduces some fairly
					 innocuous bills or aspects to an issue but with a secondary objective. The
					 primary goal in this bill is masked around the issue of making sure that there
					 is a free movement of goods and services between Canada and the United States,
					 our major trading partner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some positive changes in Bill S-23,
					 particularly the lengthening of the period of time within which a person can
					 appeal a ruling by the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a necessary change to make given, for example,
					 the practice of people leaving the country to be married and then coming back
					 with gifts or jewellery stemming from that marriage. Many people did not
					 realize that there were huge customs duties on that material and there were
					 only 30 days to appeal. There have been cases where the opportunity to appeal
					 was lost. Changes in Bill S-23 will remedy this situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The larger issue pertains to our economic sovereignty
					 and about the move toward the integration of the North American economy with
					 the whole western hemispheric economy. Recent comments made by the ambassador
					 to Canada from the United States have given us even greater cause for concern
					 along these lines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been those who advocate the idea of
					 expediting the process by making comparisons with the European Union. It has
					 made recent changes to the movement across borders between its partners to make
					 the free flow of goods and services easier and less cumbersome. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship among Canada, the United States and
					 Mexico does not resemble the member states of the European Union. It has done a
					 much greater job to harmonize other necessary things even before contemplating
					 the harmonization of immigration policies, customs practices or shared
					 practices such as electronic passes that are being contemplated with retina
					 identification or palm prints. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are fundamental shifts in the way that we do
					 things. The Americans are saying we should harmonize with American immigration
					 laws and then enter into this new relationship. It is far more than a technical
					 change in the way people are processed as they cross the border. It does belie
					 a fundamental shift in the way that we view ourselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying in the Holy Bible that the lion shall
					 lie down with the lamb. In that case the lamb does not get very much sleep. We
					 are very concerned that as we enter into this relationship with the United
					 States it will be hugely to the benefit of the Americans and lesser to
					 us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the recent World Trade Center tragedy Bill
					 S-23 should be put on hold and frozen in its place until such time as we deal
					 with the issue of international security stemming from the WTC
					 tragedy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the wrong time to be dealing with issues of
					 economic sovereignty when we are so wholly dominated by the tragedy that
					 happened in New York. It is the wrong time to redefine our relationship with
					 the United States or to redefine our position as part of the North American
					 hemisphere. Bill S-23 would force us to enter into that argument and debate
					 long before we are ready.</p>


	<A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1215)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were reminded recently of the dangers of letting our
					 economic sovereignty slip away. The recent trend in the past 20 years has been
					 toward a branch plant economy. As we predicted, the development of a branch
					 plant type economic base is coming to fruition. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we said that if we lost control of our
					 industries and let the Americans dominate or foreign ownership take over,
					 Canadian industries would lose the ability to chart their own destiny. A
					 graphic example is at our doorstep.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frustrated Americans are saying that if Canada does not
					 fall into a complete goose step with the United States in its current military
					 exercises then they would reconsider allowing their plants to continue
					 manufacturing in Canada. They would withdraw their Canadian branch plants of
					 American companies costing Canada jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a perfect illustration of what we warned about.
					 If we lose our economic sovereignty we will lose our ability to have national
					 sovereignty and to chart our destiny as we choose instead of becoming part of
					 the American manifest destiny.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ultimately what western hemispheric integration
					 is all about. The Americans are deemed to be the inevitable and chosen ideal
					 that there should be one force in the western hemisphere and that it should be
					 the American economy and culture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are opposed to that. I am a fiercely proud Canadian
					 nationalist. When I look around the room for others with the same mindset I do
					 not see very many on either side of the House at this time.</p>

	<A NAME="Int-50815"></A><a HREF="#Int-50824"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-50814"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pat Martin:
				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am not trying to offend anyone with
					 the point that I am striving to make. Our primary concern as Canadians should
					 be to maintain our economic and national sovereignty. As a fiercely proud
					 Canadian nationalist I see very few other people speaking in those terms. We
					 used to hear that kind of argument from the Liberal benches back in the days of
					 Walter Gordon and Paul Martin Senior, and when the current member from Windsor
					 used to espouse those lines. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used to hear Liberal members talking about ensuring
					 that too much foreign ownership does not dominate Canadian industries. That
					 used to be a popular theme for them. Laws and regulations were put in place to
					 make sure that did not happen. Part of their argument was that if our economic
					 sovereignty was lost we would lose the ability to be a sovereign nation.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most paramount idea about being a sovereign nation
					 is to be able to chart our own destiny and control matters such as
					 international military exercises like the one we are about to see the Americans
					 embark on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been essentially threatened. President Bush
					 told us in his speech last night that countries are either shoulder to shoulder
					 with America or they are with the terrorists. I find that offensive as a
					 Canadian who is not unquestionably shoulder to shoulder with the Americans but
					 that does not make me shoulder to shoulder with the terrorists. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are advocating a third way to deal with the
					 international tragedy that happened at the World Trade Center within the
					 parameters of the international community, and that is to bring these criminals
					 to justice without embarking on a unilateral military exercise such as that
					 being contemplated by the U.S. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada must be cautious not to drift along with the
					 particular exercise. Unless we have control of our economic sovereignty we are
					 subject to the coercion associated with the threat of branch plants closing and
					 the border being sealed up. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the issues that concern us about Bill S-23.
					 The legislation should not be up for consideration in the House of Commons at
					 this sensitive time in our nation's history. The bill should be put back on
					 ice. The flow of goods and services across our border should be dealt with at
					 some less sensitive time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are hearing all the typical and familiar buzzwords
					 in the news that give us cause for concern about what is the real agenda. The
					 current ambassador of the United States to Canada is talking about the need for
					 a NAFTA plus. Bill S-23 is the Liberal government's answer to a NAFTA
					 plus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the House that sometimes the wishes of
					 Americans are brought about in a circular way for procedural reasons. In 1983
					 the previous ambassador of the United States to Canada, Mr. Paul Robinson, in a
					 <i>Maclean's</i> magazine article stated: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>--Back in January of 1983, I asked my
						  embassy staff to see what we could do to initiate a free trade deal with
						  Canada. I realized, of course, that the public initiative had to come from
						  Canada, because if it came from us it would look as if we were trying to gobble
						  up our neighbour.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had to get a Canadian entity to start calling for
					 the trade agreement, knowing full well that it was hugely to their advantage.
					 However the Americans wanted it to come from Canada. Otherwise Canadians would
					 see, in a very transparent way, that it was really their intention to gobble up
					 their neighbour.</p>


	<A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Toronto <i>Star</i> reports that then U.S.
					 Ambassador Robinson took the idea to Thomas d'Aquino, president of the Business
					 Council on National Issues and unofficial prime minister, at his Ottawa home.
					 He was exactly who the Americans needed to promote the idea of the free trade
					 agreement, an agreement that would be hugely in their favour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly enough, when the president of BCNI talks
					 about those days he reverses what history tells us and says it is important to
					 remember that it was Canadians who took the first step and asked for the free
					 trade agreement. It was in fact the U.S. ambassador visiting d'Aquino in his
					 home who asked for it, and d'Aquino dutifully delivered over the next number of
					 years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the NDP believe the issue of North American
					 integration is cause for great concern. It is a subject we should be debating.
					 We are not afraid of having the debate but we do not think it should be in this
					 context. It should not be wrapped in the envelope of the issue of customs and
					 excise. That is crazy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Trojan horse idea. We are ostensibly here
					 today to debate the idea of free movement of goods and services across the
					 international border between Canada and the United States, but the debate is
					 really about western hemispheric integration into one United States of America
					 from the Arctic Ocean to Tierra del Fuego.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It worries us when we hear the Liberal chair of the
					 finance committee saying that no one can deny that North American integration
					 is taking place. The newspaper article reports that he has emerged as the chief
					 advocate for a no holds barred debate on integration, an issue which did not
					 appear in Liberal election campaign literature in 2000. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the Liberal Party campaigned to trade
					 away what little is left of our economic sovereignty. I do not think its
					 intention upon re-election for a third term was to start passing legislation
					 specifically asked for by the U.S. ambassador, that would see us lose our
					 ability to chart our own destiny. I do not think the Liberals intended to
					 embark on such an agenda. I did not notice it anywhere in their party's year
					 2000 election campaign literature.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not against having a more open border at some
					 point. We are not against free movement of goods and services between us and
					 our neighbour to the south. However let us do it on equal terms. Let us do it
					 in a way similar to the way the European Union undertook integration. It had a
					 bigger problem. It has 15 nation states but it took care of basic social issues
					 first. It took care of the social charter that would equalize the standard of
					 living.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge historic imbalance in the power
					 relationship between Canada and the United States. That is why this is like the
					 lion laying down with the lamb. It is not a deal between two equals. It is a
					 deal between Canada and the largest economy in the world which happens to own
					 88% of Canadian industry. The U.S. already has a huge stake in Canada. It is
					 the remaining 12% of Canadian ownership of our industries that we are
					 bargaining with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us are not ready to give up on the idea of a
					 sovereign nation state in Canada that is unique and different and does not need
					 to harmonize with all things American. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance Party since it has been here has
					 thought that all things American are good and all things Canadian are retarded.
					 That is what we hear from the Canadian Alliance. It gets all its inspiration
					 from the right wing evangelical movement in the United States. Whatever Pat
					 Buchanan and Pat Robinson say in the United States, the Alliance brings here
					 and tries to sell to the Canadian public. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we are not buying it. We are not interested.
					 There are still enough of us intent on preserving a distinct identity that
					 Canada will not buy into that mindless idea.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hate to say it but there are those who would exploit
					 the tragedy in New York to expedite their vision of a single, integrated
					 western hemispheric identity. It is not fair to exploit the tragedy in New
					 York. The issue must be dealt with independently and not within the parameters
					 of a simpler debate about the free movement of goods and services.</p>


	<A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are those of us who still care about the issue. I
					 hate to sound like a Liberal but I probably sound like a Liberal from 1967 when
					 Walter Gordon, Paul Martin Senior and others who had a vision of a unique
					 Canadian identity used to stand proudly in the House of Commons and argue that
					 we should not be economically dominated by foreign nations. They used to set
					 rules and regulations about foreign ownership. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are the champions today? The only person outside
					 the NDP who has spoken out in a loud and clear way is David Orchard of the
					 Progressive Conservative Party. He asks those questions. Hardly anyone else
					 seems to. Members seem to have resigned themselves to the benign indifference
					 of the universe. They feel that American manifest destiny is inevitable and
					 that there is no point in fighting it because we cannot resist it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put it to the House that we must have this debate
					 without the emotional veil that has been thrust upon it by the tragedy at the
					 World Trade Center in New York City. There will come a time when we must make a
					 choice. Are we prepared to turn out the lights on the last shred of Canadian
					 nationalism? Are we prepared to resign ourselves to the belief that we are
					 merely Americans who are a little different?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. has sensed there is a difference today in that
					 our Prime Minister did not rush automatically into the vengeance mode the
					 Americans are justifiably feeling. No one blames the American government for
					 speaking in strong terms about the need to avenge the assault on New York City.
					 However our Prime Minister, to his credit, in the first reactions to the
					 tragedy at the World Trade Center did not jump immediately into line with the
					 American call for violent military intervention and revenge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now paying the price for that. A significant
					 number of Americans are disappointed with us. We first got snubbed when the
					 U.S. president met with the president of Mexico before meeting with the Prime
					 Minister of Canada. The second snub was in yesterday's speech, the single most
					 important speech the president has ever given and arguably one of the most
					 important speeches any U.S. president has given since the Checkers speech.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech did not contain one mention of Canada.
					 Canada was shut out and snubbed. We were chastised in a diplomatic way for not
					 being aggressive enough and falling into step, I would call it goose stepping,
					 with the military initiative with which the Americans have seen fit to avenge
					 the attack on their country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have pointed out some of the necessary and beneficial
					 points of Bill S-23. However we in the NDP request that the Liberals delay
					 consideration of the legislation until the World Trade Center tragedy has
					 settled. We ask the government to freeze Bill S-23 pending investigation into
					 its ramifications for western hemispheric integration.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I think I made it clear that NDP members
					 recognize the value of free and easy movement of goods and services between our
					 two countries. That is clear. However we are concerned because when the U.S.
					 ambassador to Canada calls for a more open border he is calling for retina and
					 palm scanners to identify people. He is calling for electronic boxes on the
					 bottoms of trucks that frequently cross the border so they can speed through
					 without being interrupted. If we adopt such changes the U.S. might also want
					 integrated immigration and perimeter security systems; in other words, North
					 America-wide shared security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a package deal. If we buy into what we see as
					 housekeeping changes to the way we process goods and people crossing the border
					 we must also buy into the idea of harmonizing our immigration system, customs
					 enforcement procedures and border security along our water perimeter. The NDP

					 has nothing to do with harmonization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the member turned on his television recently and

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole intent of Bill S-23 is to try to streamline
					 those processes and look at pre-approval or self-assessment with sanctions for
					 non-compliance. That is what the bill is all about. That is why it is needed

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that members on this side of the House met with

					 ready for the debate on automation of our border. There are a number of other
					 more practical aspects that I perhaps could have pointed out, such as the job
					 loss associated with the automation of the border crossings. That has not been

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also the hon. member's intervention tries to lead us to
					 believe that the bill was put forward as a result of the tragedy of the World

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the hon. member or representatives of the
					 Liberal Party this. If this bill has such great merit and there is no
					 subterfuge going on, why did it not originate in the House of Commons, as does
					 most government business? We could then have debated these things openly,
					 upfront and not have worried about what kind of a secondary objective the

					 was last week, but the United States was attacked. Several thousand Americans
					 did die in an unprovoked attack upon civilian targets, people who went about
					 their peaceful business. People of all races, all colours and all religions

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, let me be clear. There was no reference
					 to Adolf Hitler. When I mentioned the word goose stepping, I said that Canada
					 should not be quick to goose step behind one point of view without exploring
					 other avenues of recourse to settle this international tragedy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be settled in an international venue. The
					 United Nations has been raised as the logical place to deal with this. This is
					 not the same situation. There is no parallel in military or world history to
					 draw from in terms of a terrorist attacking a nation state with such a degree
					 of devastation. When we declare war, we declare war on another country, another
					 nation state.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a unique situation that calls for a unique
					 resolve. The NDP is calling for the Canadian government to find that third
					 choice. It is not a choice of shoulder to shoulder with the United States or
					 shoulder to shoulder with the terrorists. There is a third middle ground that
					 we should be seeking, and I am pleased to see that in most cases our government
					 is in fact following that voice of reason.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I raised it in the context of losing our economic
					 sovereignty, I used it as an example of one of the situations where we would be
					 less able to control our own destiny and where we would be bound to rush to the
					 aid, in an unquestionable way, of our dominant economic partner as we lost our
					 economic sovereignty and our ability to chart our own destiny as a
					 nation.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to speak on behalf of
					 the PC/DR coalition. I will begin my remarks by rebutting some of the comments
					 made by my colleague from the New Democratic Party. I count him as a colleague.
					 We worked together on the immigration committee, but I profoundly disagree with
					 the assertions he made in his speech today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin by rebutting the statement that can be
					 construed as being anti-American. At this time in our history this is not the
					 time to proceed along this way of thinking. The United States has been looking
					 for diplomatic solutions to the problem. It has not retaliated with a quick
					 strike. Are the Americans responding? Yes they are and so they should, and we
					 should be supporting them and be with them as well. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are looking at economic and multilateral solutions
					 to this crisis, They are bringing people along with them rather than striking
					 quickly in some act of revenge as the member seems to be portraying.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States is a country that has welcomed
					 immigrants from around the world. That was evident in the fact that there were
					 individuals tragically taken from 62 different countries in the event in New
					 York City. Let us not kid ourselves or try to pretend that our American friends
					 and very close family are not a strong country, a welcoming country or a
					 tolerant society because they are a tolerant and welcoming society. We have
					 more in common with our friends from the United States than the member seems to
					 know.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to rebut that way of thinking, particularly at
					 this time, and send a message to our American friends that all members in this
					 place would not be in sympathy with that kind of thinking because this is a
					 time for action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to turn to the bill before us today, Mr.
					 Speaker. It is good to see you in the chair. I know that you are a learned and
					 wise member of the House. I congratulate you on your ascendancy to the
					 chair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add that I was disappointed in some of the
					 comments made by the Minister of National Revenue this morning. In the face of
					 what has happened in the world, it seems the government is carrying on as
					 though nothing has changed. We are living in a different world now because of
					 the tragic events that happened on September 11. It appears as though the
					 government has simply blown the dust off a bill it had before this place
					 previously, added a few comments in the minister's speech at the beginning and
					 end, and has continued on as though nothing has changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans' response to this tragic event was to
					 gather congress together. They put together in 24 hours a detailed bill that
					 reflected the new realities of what was happening in the United States, the
					 amount of money that would be required to rebuild in New York and to increase
					 security. Within 24 hours there was a detail coming together and response of
					 America's leaders. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we have today in this place? A dusted off bill
					 that does not address the new realities as a result of the tragic events of
					 September 11. That is a shame. It demonstrates a lack of leadership from the
					 government to address the details that need to be addressed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with my colleague from Edmonton--Strathcona who
					 proposed an amendment that the bill be withdrawn for reconsideration because it
					 does not adequately address the new realities before us in our world, in our
					 country and in dealing with our biggest trading partner and closest friend, the
					 United States.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister today in the House talked about the
					 management of our borders as an evolving process. I agree. It is going to
					 evolve very quickly in ways that Canada needs to be engaged in and prepared to
					 act together with. The evolving processes could very well be that the Americans
					 say to us that they are moving on, that they want a secure border and perimeter
					 around North America because our systems are so integrated. Individuals who
					 come to Canada do have easy access to the United States. I do not think it is
					 unreasonable for our neighbours to the south to ask us to work together with
					 them. We need to do that and do it in more than just words. We need to commit
					 by action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would submit that the bill demonstrates the level of
					 commitment that the government has to making substantive changes that will make
					 an effect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my Liberal colleagues mentioned that there were
					 long border lineups. Yes, there are and that will continue for a
					 while.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister talked about a CANPASS program, a NEXUS
					 program and a kiosk program to help speed up trade. We had better give our
					 heads a shake if we think that the Americans will not look at those programs to
					 see if they need to be revised. We had better get into the game with our good
					 friend and closest ally because very quickly we could find ourselves on the
					 outside looking in. Should that happen, that will have a huge impact on our
					 economy, on our way of life and on our values.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if other members heard the speech by the
					 president last night. One thing I noticed was that he was firm in his resolve.
					 He has the American people, a united congress, the senate and the leadership of
					 the entire nation solidly behind him and he is moving ahead to gather that kind
					 of support worldwide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submitted earlier this week to the government that it
					 had the same environment within Canada in terms of people wanting to support
					 our friends and allies. The polls showed that approximately 80% of the people
					 wanted us to help and support our closest ally. Yet we see very little concrete
					 action. We hear words. We helped out at the very beginning. I acknowledge that
					 and I congratulate those involved. It is time to continue on helping in
					 concrete practical ways.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill fails to address those realities. We have many
					 border crossings in our country that are not open 24 hours a day. They have
					 remote cameras and close at 10 o'clock at night or midnight. Those are things
					 that have to be considered in this new reality. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there many access points from Canada to the United
					 States? Yes, there are. Do we want freer trade with America? Yes, of course we
					 do. However, to ignore the new realities of what has happened in our world is
					 just simply wrong. To ignore those new realities borders on negligence from the
					 government because our country's economy is so integrated with the Untied
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I and members of our coalition would liked to have
					 seen, and I think all opposition members would have liked to have seen, some
					 leadership from the minister on this bill in a way that would address these
					 kinds of concerns that I am bringing forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to focus on one particular aspect of the bill
					 called voluntary compliance. The minister talked about it this
					 morning.</p>


	<A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us spell out for people what that actually means.
					 What that means is that on the Atlantic coast and on the coast of British
					 Columbia ships arriving with goods are to call into a customs branch. That is
					 what voluntary compliance means. We do have large unprotected borders.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people were abusing the goodwill and freedoms of
					 this country by engaging in an illegal activity, would they, as they arrived on
					 our shores, pick up the phone and say that they are here, that they are
					 bringing in illegal contraband and that they will be moving through the United
					 States? No, that will not happen. We have a system in place that does not
					 address those kinds of things in light of the new realities that happened as a
					 result of September 11. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night in this place one of my colleagues from the
					 Liberal side mentioned that we should not be talking about this as a battle of
					 good and evil, that we just need to address the root causes and concerns of
					 this issue. The real issue is about those who would do things that are evil. It
					 is about a battle between good and evil. Though there may be just a few engaged
					 in that, those few can wreak havoc among the many, as we sorely found out. For
					 us to put our head in the sand and continue on as though nothing has changed is
					 simply wrong. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another colleague from the Liberal side quoted
					 President Roosevelt, in a time of similar circumstances, going into World War
					 II. He drew on the famous comment made that Americans should walk softly and
					 carry a big stick. It seems as though the motto of this government has become
					 to walk blindly and carry an empty bag of promises because there is a lot of
					 talk but not enough action. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actions we have seen from the government during its
					 eight years in power are slowly starving the resources of our intelligence
					 division, CSIS, within the RCMP, the RCMP and immigration funding, and an
					 integrated approach to sharing intelligence information between those different
					 agencies. It has had an impact and we are reaping the benefits of what the
					 government's policies have been in those areas for these past eight
					 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would hope there would be quick response, in light
					 of the events of September 11, to put more resources into those areas and to
					 consider working closely with our friends in the United States. We need to look
					 at the idea of a perimeter in which we are on the inside instead of a perimeter
					 where we are on the outside looking in, as my colleague from the NDP would seem
					 to want. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to touch on something my colleague from
					 Edmonton--Strathcona mentioned in his speech. He eloquently described his own
					 experience as a refugee fleeing from Uganda under the regime of Idi Amin.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to disavow the false argument that to consider
					 increasing security within our nation has to go hand in hand with the notion
					 that we no longer welcome immigrants or refugees to our country. Nothing could
					 be further from the truth. The two are not mutually exclusive. We can look at
					 increasing security in this country, and we must, but at the same time we can
					 remain a country with a very strong immigration policy that supports the
					 foundation of our country which was built on immigration. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, not to address security issues in
					 that area and others is simply negligent and cannot be done. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last seven to ten days many of us have been
					 taken with the events that have happened and how they have changed our world
					 forever. There is a lot of concern for many people, but there is concern on
					 this side of the House that the government will handle this situation as it has
					 handled others over and over again, and that is to sit and wait.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the talking points of taking a balanced
					 approach. Yes, that is good. However, what has happened too often with the
					 Liberal government is that a balanced approach has become a catch phrase for
					 doing absolutely nothing when something needs to be done and leadership needs
					 to be shown. If there were ever a time in our nation when our country, our
					 neighbour's country and our world were looking for leadership, it is
					 now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret that the Minister of National Revenue has
					 simply dusted off the bill from whence it came and reintroduced it without
					 considering the new realities that happened as a result of September
					 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will read some commentary from a news article of
					 today in the Toronto <i>Star</i>. It says:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>But nothing in the proposed bill,
						  which goes back to the Commons for second reading today, is new. Nor have
						  amendments or tighter border controls been introduced to the bill since last
						  Tuesday's terror attacks on the U.S. It was first tabled and passed in the
						  Senate last spring in a bid to speed trade over the border.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further on in the article it states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Top customs officials admitted to
						  reporters it would be difficult to refuse a CANPASS to anyone who was, like
						  “sleeper” terrorists in the U.S., perfectly integrated into the community with
						  no criminal history.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A CANPASS is an expedited pass to get people back and
					 forth across the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above article is part of this new reality. If we
					 think we can continue on without some implications of the events that have
					 occurred in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, we are dreaming. The
					 government is sleepwalking.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A better approach would have been to get the experts in
					 this area together, to consult with our colleagues across the border to address
					 the new concerns that have arisen as a result of last week's events. That has
					 not happened. It certainly is not reflected in the actions of the bill before
					 us. It is beyond me how we can pretend to continue on in this place without
					 taking concrete actions to address these problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope that we as leaders in this place get on
					 with striking committees quickly and with getting the people involved in trade
					 to the table here. We must make the concrete changes necessary to address the
					 new realities. We hope the government's motto will not be to walk blindly and
					 carry a bag of empty promises. It must take concrete action. It has the will of
					 the people and the support of the opposition parties to make these
					 changes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We implore the government to do the right thing and not
					 pass this bill, which does not address the concerns, but get on with making the
					 concrete changes that are necessary.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Grant McNally:</b> The member says that he is in
					 a dream world. Of course he is because he has not taken into consideration one
					 of the main points in my speech. If we do not get to the table with our
					 partners now after the changes of September 11 and start talking about these
					 kinds of things, a 12 hour border lineup is going to look like a short one for
					 those who are exporting goods from our country to the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had better get involved. The member says that this
					 is scaremongering. This is an honest question. It is something that the
					 government needs to consider. If it does not think about these things, it is
					 negligent and shame on the government.</p>

	Madam Speaker, another matter comes to mind. The hon.
					 member may have noticed in the <i>National Post</i> of yesterday, I believe, an
					 article about the U.S. seeking common immigration rules.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It states that the U.S. ambassador to Canada yesterday
					 sketched out the Bush administration's vision of a North American security
					 perimeter that would go beyond the use of technology to speed up border
					 crossings and go into the delicate substance of national refugee and
					 immigration policies. In other words, as I mentioned in my speech, the U.S.
					 ambassador is promoting the harmonization of immigration and refugee policies
					 as a subject to sharing the new technological advances to speed up the transfer
					 of goods and services across the border.</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I reflected on this in my speech. I will
					 remind my colleague again that those are things we need to consider, talk about
					 and debate. To reject them out of hand at the beginning of the discussion is
					 unwise. We will have the possibility of the reality of our biggest trading
					 partner keeping us on the outside looking in if we do not look at those kinds
					 of questions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me paint a practical application. Imagine that the
					 United States puts in place some regulations having to do with air travel such
					 that all flights in the United States have an air marshal on them. We have
					 already heard the Minister of Transport reject that in this place as a radical
					 notion. Let us say that our government decides we will not have air marshals on
					 our flights to the United States which originate in Canada. A very real,
					 practical application is that those flights would not get into American air
					 space any more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us not to talk with our closest trading partner,
					 ally and friend would be negligent. We must talk about these things. We must
					 consider them and take concrete action to work together. It will have a
					 devastating impact within our own economy and on our own way of life in Canada
					 if we take an anti-American, holier than thou attitude on these kinds of
					 things. We cannot do that. We have to get rid of that kind of rhetoric and
					 openly, honestly and in a bipartisan way work together to solve these
					 problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will impact all of us as members because it will
					 impact all of our constituents, no matter what region of the country we
					 represent. As we know, approximately 80% of our population lives within an
					 hour's drive of the border. To not ask these questions and not consider them at
					 the beginning of these kinds of debates would be irresponsible. We must
					 consider these kinds of questions raised by the member.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I will begin by saying that I consider
					 the comments with references to goose stepping made by the member for Winnipeg
					 Centre are a stain on the House. They should have been withdrawn and I regret
					 that the member chose not to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 is an act to amend the Customs Act and other
					 related acts. The fact that we are even talking about the bill today is
					 symptomatic of everything that is wrong with our government's priorities given
					 the tragic events of September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said last night, the government is behaving as if
					 there is no crisis, no urgency and no need for critical action. There is every
					 appearance that the government's posture is to defend the status quo on every
					 front.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of September 11 have been taken seriously by
					 other countries, but our government's priorities are clear. Given what we
					 witnessed last night with the speech from George Bush and given the absence of
					 our Prime Minister, I can only say that the message we as a country are
					 continuing to send out is doing a great disservice to Canadians, to Canada's
					 national interests and to the international community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is essentially unchanged from earlier bills
					 that have been kicked around. It is based on the 1995 Canada-U.S. shared border
					 accord. What we are doing with this legislation is unilateral action. We are
					 being boy scouts. This will speed passage. It focuses on frequent users and it
					 is a one way item for people going from the U.S. to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing is all wrong. It is wrong to approach this
					 unilaterally. For example, yesterday I met with representatives from the
					 Canadian Trucking Association. It clearly sees this bill in the very same way.
					 We heard comments from the U.S. ambassador to Canada and from Colin Powell, the
					 U.S. secretary of state. Canadians and Canadian industry in general know
					 intrinsically that the real issue here is not what is represented by Bill S-23.
					 The real issue here is anti-terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this week the government defeated an Alliance
					 motion which was very simple and straightforward. I will repeat it for the
					 benefit of Canadians because I think it is important that they understand what
					 we were trying to accomplish and how reasonable it is given our current
					 critical circumstances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We called upon the government to introduce
					 anti-terrorism legislation “similar in principle to the United Kingdom's
					 Terrorism Act, 2000”. Let me add that there is also anti-terrorism legislation
					 in the United States.</p>


	<A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation we are asking for would: name all known
					 international terrorist organizations operating in Canada; call for a complete
					 ban on fundraising activities in support of terrorism; and provide provisions
					 for the seizure of assets belonging to terrorists or terrorist organizations.
					 It would also call for the immediate ratification of the International
					 Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Canada signed
					 that convention years ago but it has never been ratified because the government
					 has not brought it before the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation would call also for the creation of
					 specific crimes for engaging in terrorist training activities in Canada or
					 inciting from Canada terrorist acts abroad. It calls for the prompt extradition
					 of foreign nationals charged with acts of terrorism, even if the charges are
					 capital offences, and the detention and deportation to their country of origin
					 of any people illegally in Canada or failed refugee claimants who have been
					 linked to terrorist organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt if we could find 10% of Canadians who would
					 disagree with the contents of that motion, but the government closed ranks and
					 defeated it. More troubling than that are the games that have been played since
					 that time on another front in this place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance asked for a list of officials to
					 be summoned before committees. For example, for the justice committee, the
					 solicitor general, the director of CSIS and the commissioner of the RCMP were
					 asked to appear. For the foreign affairs committee the Minister of Foreign
					 Affairs was asked to appear. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration was
					 asked to appear at the citizenship and immigration committee. For the transport
					 committee we asked for the minister and the president of Air Canada. We asked
					 that the Minister of National Defence, the chief of defence staff and the chief
					 of the Communications Security Establishment appear at the defence committee.
					 For the revenue and customs committee we asked for the Minister of National
					 Revenue and the head of Canada Customs and Revenue Agency to appear as
					 witnesses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a fairly comprehensive list of witnesses we
					 asked to have come before committees. This would be considered perfectly
					 reasonable, rational and responsible in most parliamentary and western
					 democracies. Anything less would be considered or construed to be a
					 dereliction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened since that time? At two of those
					 committee meetings Liberals pulled out of the meetings one at a time until
					 quorum could no longer be reached, to disallow the proceeding of those motions
					 to have those people come before committee. The government is trying to deny
					 this occurred but it did occur and it is simply unacceptable behaviour,
					 particularly at a time when we should not be playing games. If there is one
					 time when we want to empower our parliamentarians, it is at a time like this.
					 Instead, the government is doing the complete opposite.This is such a stark
					 contrast to what is happening in the U.S. congress, for example, where there is
					 a coming together and a national will, not only in congress, which is showing
					 leadership, but in the population as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we held a mirror up to Canada, we would see that the
					 direction the government has taken on this issue is reflected in divisions
					 appearing in our population at large even though 81% of Canadians, according to
					 very recent polling this week, are very supportive of complete support for the
					 U.S. in terms of military engagement and other activities.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the Canadian public is far and away
					 much further ahead than the government on this whole issue. The Canadian public
					 has been done a great disservice by the government's actions to date. We are at
					 the end of week one of a parliamentary session following the tragedy of
					 September 11 and we have yet to see clear direction from the government. We
					 have yet to see our Prime Minister even set foot in Washington or New
					 York.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote U.S. Secretary of State Colin
					 Powell. I am not the first one to quote him in this place. As a matter of fact,
					 I quoted him last night when we stayed in this place until midnight. Colin
					 Powell said: “Some nations need to be more vigilant against terrorism at their
					 borders if they want their relationship with the U.S. to remain the same. We
					 are going to make it clear to them that this will be a standard against which
					 they are measured with respect to their relationship with the United
					 States”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ties that bind us with the United States:
					 family ties, business ties, historical ties, the fact that we have aided each
					 other in times of war and in times of adversity. Given all of that, friendship
					 has to be earned. I can certainly call America our best friend because it has
					 earned and deserves that title. Right now Americans are questioning whether we
					 deserve that title. It will be based on performance, not rhetoric and empty
					 promises. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is essential now is not what is in Bill S-23. I do
					 not know what it signals other than the government has no important priority to
					 achieving anything real in terms of what is required in order to address the
					 current crisis that we are all in together in terms of
					 anti-terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to talk about a perimeter security strategy,
					 some unilateral boy scout border crossing ideas are out of place in the current
					 context in terms of timing and are not currently supported by Canadian industry
					 because the timing is wrong. Canadian industry and everyone is calling for us
					 to toughen up our perimeter security through an effective strategy. We have to
					 work with our American colleagues on achieving that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must take a step back, look where we are headed on
					 passage of people and goods between Canada and the U.S., and make some very
					 essential changes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that since NAFTA has come into
					 effect, trade and passage of people has increased tremendously between the two
					 countries. It has had a positive influence. I think the government has actually
					 taken a lot of the beneficial effects for granted. As soon as we do that, we
					 forget that there are responsibilities that go with all of that.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a huge industry that is potentially affected by
					 the lack of a perimeter security strategy and that could lead to problems with
					 delays at our border crossings. The government is not saying that we do not
					 have U.S. government buy-in on the direction of the bill. It is not prepared to
					 go there. It has not been prepared to go there even before September 11. Unless
					 we are in lockstep with the U.S. on this, then it is the wrong thing to do. It
					 is the wrong thing to do at this time anyway.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dichotomy here. The primary function of
					 customs border crossing officials under U.S. jurisdiction is enforcement. The
					 primary function and the reporting mechanism for our officials is collection of
					 revenue through duties and taxes. We have simply got it all wrong. Many, if not
					 most, of our border crossing customs officials agree that they are in the wrong
					 department. They should not be reporting to Canada Customs and Revenue Agency.
					 They are finding more and more that their job is dealing with criminal code
					 infractions, not taxes and tariffs. NAFTA did dispose of many of those. That is
					 not to say that we still do not have some tariffs and taxes to collect, but
					 that is no longer the primary function. If we have an anti-terrorism stance,
					 that is obviously one area where we could change everything. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. has its well recorded continuing concerns
					 about security risks emanating from Canadian jurisdiction. It is the opinion of
					 many people who are looking at this whole border crossing issue from an
					 academic perspective and it was clear even before the events of September 11
					 that there would have to be some major changes. We thought we had maybe a three
					 or five year window to make those changes. I always got the feeling that the
					 government thought maybe we had a five or a ten year window. The events of
					 September 11 have telescoped that time. We no longer have the ability to look
					 at the border crossing issue and perimeter security in that kind of time frame.
					 We need a sense of urgency. It virtually has to be one of our prime
					 considerations right now. It is a prime role of parliament and the government
					 to do this. Instead there is silence from the government and it is business as
					 usual. The bill makes no sense given the current context and the government is
					 pretending it is business as usual.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We clearly need to ensure that it is as hard or harder
					 for a terrorist to get into Canada than it is to go directly to the United
					 States. Nothing less is acceptable. This will be good for the security and
					 safety of Canadians and the security and safety of our neighbours. It will be
					 positive for international trade and it will be positive in every other fashion
					 as well. That is where we must go. We must do it with urgency.</p>

	Madam Speaker, my colleague's argument seems to be
					 rooted in the notion that the American authorities have criticized the security
					 at Canadian borders. I have listened to this debate all morning. This is the
					 fourth reference made to criticisms by Colin Powell. Sometimes I get nervous
					 that if something gets repeated often enough, it becomes fact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully aware of an interview that the American
					 secretary of state gave to ABC News in which he spoke the almost identical
					 words that the member referred to. For anyone who reads the transcript or heard
					 that interview, there is absolutely no misunderstanding that he was referring
					 to Afghanistan and Pakistan. That interview transcript appeared in an article
					 in the Toronto <i>Star</i>, subsequently followed by a columnist's paraphrasing
					 of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member has stated that Colin Powell, the secretary
					 of state of the United States, is critical of and has concerns with Canadian
					 border security. Is he prepared to table a document in the House, and I am not
					 talking about a columnist's paraphrase of an interview, which demonstrates that
					 the secretary of state for the United States has made a direct criticism of
					 Canadian border security? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member has made a very serious accusation here. I
					 think that this is an important time to clear this up. I therefore ask that if
					 he has such a document to table it. If he does not, then stand and admit that
					 he does not. Let us deal in fact not myth because I believe that is one of the

					 provincial level, companies such as Honda Motor Corporation, Toyota and other
					 auto companies have made major commitments to the province of Ontario. However,
					 the other day I was disturbed to hear the president of Honda Motor Corporation
					 say that he was concerned because of the border problems that we have in this
					 country. It is not the flow out of the U.S. into Canada that is the problem
					 right now, it is the flow the other way. The Honda people are really
					 questioning their commitment to this country and any future investments here.
					 If they are thinking that way, I think a lot of other people are as
					 well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are concerned about economic and social
					 security, not just national security. This is a very big issue. I would ask my
					 hon. colleague to respond to these kinds of problems which seem to be
					 emerging.</p>

					 Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, Canadian Alliance):
				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, before I begin my remarks on Bill S-23 I
					 want to comment on the speech that was made by the NDP member from Winnipeg. He
					 was asked to clarify his comments regarding Canada's agreement to participate
					 with the American retaliation against terrorism. He referred to it as goose
					 stepping with the United States, a clear reference to Nazism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Dewdney--Alouette and the member for
					 Vancouver Island North are right that the Prime Minister has not responded with
					 the due leadership Canadians want. However the Prime Minister is on his way to
					 the United States. While he is not meeting with the president of the United
					 States the Chamber needs to support the Prime Minister when he states that
					 Canada will support the United States in its response to the recent terrorist
					 acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely and thoroughly irresponsible for any
					 member of this Chamber to think it is Nazi-like behaviour. That is utterly
					 irresponsible on the part of the member from the NDP and I would urge him to
					 consider withdrawing that remark. Canada needs to stand united against
					 terrorism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not take pot shots at the United States by saying
					 that we are endeavouring to rid the world of terrorism and those who would
					 destroy the very pluralism the NDP says it was founded to protect. The hon.
					 member dares to say that the behaviour of standing united with the forces of
					 freedom and democracy is Nazi-like. That is intolerable and his constituents
					 will be ashamed of those comments. It is astonishing how we can be distracted
					 by some insufferable comments that drag the country down.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 is an act to amend the Customs Act and to
					 make related amendments to other acts. I am in favour of what is contained in
					 Bill S-23. However it does not effectively achieve its stated goal of
					 modernizing and simplifying border operations and providing a new vision for
					 border management and trade administration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members on the other side of the House might be
					 surprised by those comments. If they read the same overview I did, they are
					 probably wondering how one could possibly say that it does not achieve its
					 stated goal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could it be that I am not in favour of simplifying
					 border procedures or that I am opposed to reducing bureaucracy? Could it be
					 that I am ignorant of the fact that many of the proposed changes of Canpass,
					 EPPS, Nexus and customs self-assessment have already been successfully tested
					 in pilot projects? Was I unaware of the fact that Canada Customs and Revenue
					 Agency is planning to phase in the implementation of these initiatives at the
					 end of October and that the private sector is largely in favour of them? The
					 answer to all three questions is a very strong no.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these were ordinary times I would be more strongly
					 in support of this initiative but after the events of Tuesday, September 11, we
					 are not living in ordinary times. If all the initiatives in the bill were
					 implemented flawlessly the result would be to dramatically improve customs and
					 immigration procedures at Canadian points of entry. Specifically it would
					 facilitate the entry into Canada of preapproved travellers and it would reduce
					 border waiting times for Canada bound trucks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 would make it much simpler for Canadians to
					 import goods from the United States and for Americans to visit Canada. These
					 are both positive developments. However, unless Bill S-23 is mirrored by
					 reciprocal legislation in the United States, the end result will be to make it
					 easier to import U.S. goods into Canada than to import Canadian goods into the
					 United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a country whose standard of living is largely
					 dependent on a $90 billion plus trade surplus with the United States any policy
					 that would promote imports while discouraging exports should not be supported.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is easier to be based in the United States and
					 export to Canada than it is to be based in Canada and export to the United
					 States, businesses will choose to locate in the United States. The United
					 States offers manufacturers lower taxes than we do and the stability of a huge
					 300 million person domestic market with a per capital GDP of over $31,000. We
					 are now granting them easier access into Canada through Bill S-23.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23, unless it is mirrored by similar legislation
					 in the United States, gives manufacturers one more reason to pick a U.S.
					 location over a Canadian one with tariff free, hassle free access to the
					 markets of the other country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Bill S-23 were mirrored by U.S. legislation the
					 result would be terrific for Canadian businesses. The Canada-U.S. border would
					 be more similar to the national borders within the European Union and would
					 give Canadians further proof that NAFTA does indeed work.</p>


	<A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would allow just in time manufacturing operations to
					 span both sides of the border. This is important because just in time
					 manufacturing is a growing part of our economy, particularly in the auto
					 sector. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the GM plant in Oshawa buys its car seats
					 from Lear Corporation's seating plant in nearby Whitby. The Lear plant is
					 located beside a foam manufacturing plant. When GM decides to make a blue
					 sedan, the order for the seats is sent, usually in block orders, to Lear which
					 then sends the orders for foam. The foam company makes the seats and ships them
					 to GM. There is a loading dock at the GM plant right at the point of assembly
					 where they are installed. Within an hour of the time at which GM orders the
					 seats they are being unloaded right onto the assembly line and installed into
					 the cars. There is no warehousing and no inventory. This is manufacturing
					 perfection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this example the entire operation is based in
					 Ontario. Bill S-23 would allow a Windsor auto plant to enter into a similar
					 arrangement with an American supplier by drastically simplifying the
					 importation into Canada of products shipped by reliable carriers and being
					 imported by reliable persons. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 would allow an American manufacturer to enter
					 into a just in time contract with a Canadian buyer. Unless Bill S-23 is
					 mirrored by comparable U.S. legislation, a Canadian manufacturer would not be
					 in a position to enter into a just in time contract with a U.S. buyer no matter
					 how efficient the Canadian manufacturer is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just one example of how Bill S-23 could
					 potentially make the playing field uneven. Recent border shutdowns which caused
					 a parts shortage at 10 vehicle assembly plants in southern Ontario showed how
					 crucial free access across the Canada-U.S. border has become to the automotive
					 sector and to our economy as a whole.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>National Post</i> of Wednesday reported that the
					 shutdown prompted Honda Motor Company president Hiroyuki Yoshino to suggest
					 that Honda may build more plants in the U.S. to avoid similar future delays in
					 the movement of parts. Honda employs 2,200 at its plant in Alliston, Ontario.
					 We need to have policies to encourage it to expand, not retract. While Bill
					 S-23 may make it easier for Honda to import seats from Michigan it does not
					 make it easier for it to sell transmissions or subassemblies to the United
					 States Honda operations in Ohio.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless Bill S-23 is mirrored by U.S. legislation, the
					 message that other companies will get is to locate in the United States because
					 they will have no trouble getting parts from U.S. suppliers and exporting their
					 products to Canada will be a snap. Already past border simplifications have
					 made it easier to import U.S. goods into Canada than Canadian goods into the
					 United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we surf the web we will likely find that many of the
					 more sophisticated U.S. web merchants have GST registration numbers. They can
					 promise overnight delivery to Canada because as long as the GST is paid and the
					 product originates in the United States, Canada customs formalities have been
					 simplified greatly. It is not quite as simple for people shipping to the
					 U.S.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of Bill S-23 we would be one more step
					 down the road to making Canada's border with the United States even more open,
					 accessible, efficient and business friendly. We are building an autobahn into
					 Canada but unless we encourage the United States to reciprocate by building an
					 autobahn into the United States from Canada we will have an uneven playing
					 field, a situation in which Canada's balance of trade with the United States
					 would gradually decline, and with it our standard of living would also decline.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly I am not confident that the United States will
					 be building this trade autobahn any time soon. The home page of the U.S.
					 customs service has a banner that reads “America's front line”. They do not
					 consider it, as Canada does, a Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. They consider
					 their border people a front line. That sounds more like a fence than an
					 autobahn to me. After the events of September 11, I certainly cannot blame them
					 for wanting to defend that front line. Their buildings and institutions were
					 attacked and destroyed and their citizens murdered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can tell ourselves that we feel their pain and many
					 Canadians, including me, do feel a sense of loss and outrage at what happened.
					 However there are two basic realities. First, none of our buildings collapsed
					 and no Canadian institution was attacked. Indeed we may take solace from the
					 fact that most international terrorists probably could not find NDHQ, our
					 equivalent of the Pentagon, on a map of downtown Ottawa. Second, there are
					 reasons to suspect the possibility of a Canadian link with some of the
					 terrorists or their supporters who caused such devastation in New York and
					 Washington.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America was attacked and Americans want a fortress to
					 defend itself against further attacks. The words America front line reassure
					 Americans much more than open border with Canada.</p>


	<A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone has any doubt about that, just ask 10
					 Americans whether they would want an open border with Canada right now or if
					 they would rather have a front line, as advertised on the American customs
					 website.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now Americans have a sense of fear and that is
					 the mentality which we are dealing with. In other words, while Bill S-23 opens
					 trade from Canada to the United States, it does not do it reciprocally because
					 mirror legislation has not been developed in the United States, and a
					 heightened sense of security in the United States will not make it likely that
					 such legislation will see the light of day any time soon, at least not to the
					 extent that we would like it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This basic reality gives us one very simple choice. We
					 could either be within America's frontline or outside of it. If we are outside
					 of it, I would not expect to see the U.S. congress pass mirror legislation such
					 as Bill S-23 during my lifetime frankly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are inside the front line, it makes so much sense
					 for America to facilitate reciprocal trade with Canada, let their assembly
					 plants be fed by competing suppliers on both sides of the border and hope that
					 Wall Street and Washington will be working hard to create a U.S. equivalent to
					 Bill S-23. We all know that the more efficiently the border operates, the more
					 our collective economies will prosper. We must understand that if we see
					 borders as ways to collect revenue, the Americans see borders as a line of
					 defence, a crucial element in the defence of their republic.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the official opposition does have amendments
					 to this legislation. We hope that they will pass. We also hope that the
					 government sends a clear message to the United States that Canada hopes it will
					 announce similar legislation to Bill S-23 so we can expand free trade in a
					 broader context much beyond what we have and do it on a level playing field. I
					 fear that by enacting this legislation without the appropriate amendments and
					 guidelines, the government is sending Canada down the road to an uneven playing
					 field with trade in the United States. We want to make sure that does not
					 happen.</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, as I said, the communication strategy
					 for this particular piece of legislation would be difficult without it being
					 properly amended. The hon. member for Prince George is right. As a former
					 Prince Georgian, I know that there is a heightened sense of insecurity with
					 regard to trade with the United States, particularly because of the forestry
					 sector in north and central British Columbia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this going to be communicated? It is going to be
					 very difficult in the sense of how this legislation has unfolded and whether or
					 not we do get a signal from the United States about whether we will see
					 reciprocal legislation. That is why the bill needs to be amended. We need to
					 make sure that we have those sorts of safeguards in place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night on ABC, after President Bush's speech, J.D.
					 Hayworth, who is a republican member of congress, I believe from Tucson,
					 Arizona, and on the international trade committees in the United States, spoke.
					 He happens to believe, unlike the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime
					 Minister, that some of these attacks may have been based from Canada. These are
					 the sorts of questions he will be asking in the United States congress, and we
					 need to address them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Hayworth made a very interesting remark, especially
					 coming from a leading member of the republican side which is the majority in
					 the U.S. house of representatives. He said that he believed in free trade. Just
					 as it was important for our borders to facilitate free trade, and we must
					 encourage that, we also have a constitutional requirement to ensure America's
					 security. He said that in these times we could not ignore that first
					 obligation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States first responsibility and need in
					 these heightened times, which is appropriate given the polls in the United
					 States and the insecurity that people feel, is to have a heightened sense of
					 security at borders, not a heightened sense of trade efficiency. In that sense
					 I believe the finance minister, the international minister and the Prime
					 Minister should go to British Columbia, when the time is right and appropriate
					 given the current national security preoccupations, to ensure that those fears
					 are met.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, while he cannot to it
					 legislatively, needs to send a strong diplomatic signal to the United States
					 that reciprocal legislation will be expected. If it does not happen, then I
					 believe that down the line we may have to look at rescinding Bill S-23,
					 amending it and moving motions forward. This is another reason why in these
					 times the appropriate committees of the House of Commons should be
					 reconstituted as soon as possible.</p>

	Madam Speaker, based on what took place on September
					 11, I want to say for the record that I was very impressed by the Minister of
					 National Revenue in his response and the kind of work he did in light of those
					 horrific events. Also, I know for a fact that he instructed his officials to
					 see whether or not we could accelerate some of the implementation of the very
					 initiatives we are talking about today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact remains that we need to pass this in order to
					 get those initiatives into play and start to move in the appropriate direction,
					 given the circumstances at hand. It is very important that we proceed and
					 proceed accordingly and, more to the point, proceed in a very quick way given
					 all the events that have transpired.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His comments and the fearmongering naturally go with
					 members of his party with respect to lost jobs, the so-called border issues and
					 that Canada is somehow to blame for this. It is too bad those people opposite
					 always show negativity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member not think it would be much better to
					 have a co-operative non-partisan approach? In the United States we see
					 Democrats and Republicans working very closely in light of the kind of concerns
					 that have taken place. Instead of playing cheap politics, as the Canadian
					 Alliance is doing in this very grave matter, does he not think it would be more
					 appropriate to co-operate, roll up their sleeves and assist the government to
					 ensure that what we do in this very important matter is done on behalf of all
					 the people in Canada?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to score cheap political points. Members of
					 the Canadian Alliance are always good at that, whether it be matters of
					 immigration or the porous border. They are waiting for something they can hang
					 their hats on with respect to somebody in Canada being part of the so-called
					 bin Laden effort.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a sad state of affairs when they have to delve to
					 these depths and go to this length to try to drag the country down, when in
					 reality what they should be doing is assisting and making sure that we work in
					 a co-operative effort.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member opposite not think that it would be an
					 appropriate gesture to work together in the best interests of Canada because it
					 is in the best interests for us to support the Americans in this time of need?
					 Does he not think, from a philosophical point of view, that would be the best
					 way to go? It would be interesting to hear his response.</p>

					 clearly answered the questions about the security at our borders in the long
					 term, and the passport situation? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a reason why there is a heightened sense of
					 partisanship. It is because his government is not answering clear questions in
					 the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the hon. member's information, there is a
					 difference between the American system of government and the Canadian system of
					 government. In the American system the chief executive of that country reached
					 out to people with different political stripes and political values and asked
					 how together they could put forward a front. It took six days for the House to
					 reconvene before the Prime Minister even gave any other party in the House the
					 time of day.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, in the last week we have heard a great
					 deal about national security. I intend to direct my comments today to economic
					 security and social security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the intent or the purpose of Bill S-23? The
					 purpose is to enhance economic security in Canada. Some time ago Canada entered
					 a free trade agreement with our American friends. Since that time we have
					 participated in an impressive economic expansion in North America.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s we experienced double digit unemployment
					 rates in Canada and in the U.S. Even Canada, with a slowdown, has a 7% rate.
					 Our American friends are in the 4% category.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen a dramatic increase in real disposable net
					 income across the board and a dramatic increase in productivity, especially in
					 the United States. I think it is a fair comment to say Canada has really
					 dragged in those areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic expansion has permitted our federal
					 government, in a fair comment, to deal with some fairly major fiscal
					 imbalances. The economic growth has enhanced the revenues that are flowing into
					 the government, which has allowed the government to timidly reduce the burden
					 of taxation and to finance important government programs and some that are not
					 so important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net result is that our economic security and our
					 social security have been enhanced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern economists understand that we cannot have social
					 security with a second rate or third rate economy. Economic security, national
					 security and social security are inseparable. They are joined at the
					 hip.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today our economic, social and national security are at
					 peril. Why is this so? Our military is weak, the product of a decade of decline
					 and neglect by the government. We have serious problems with terrorist groups
					 in this country. Some people are in denial in regard to that, but the experts
					 are not. This is a product of a decade of decline and neglect by our national
					 government in terms of immigration and refugee policy. Loose, naive, and I will
					 use this term, politically correct policies have made Canada a safe and
					 comfortable haven for dangerous individuals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill opens up one lane on a two lane highway. It
					 frees up the movement of goods from this country to the U.S. What we do have is
					 a serious problem in the other lane. It is getting clogged up and blocked up
					 and there are serious questions as to whether that lane is ever going to open
					 up given the situation we are in right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our decade of decline and neglect on the part of
					 government has had the effect of essentially closing down that other lane. In
					 order to protect our economic security and our social security, we must free up
					 that blocked lane. </p>


	<A NAME="T1405"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1405"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1405)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite simply we should be looking very seriously at
					 harmonizing our immigration and our refugee policies with those of our friends
					 in the United States. I can see some immediate benefits from this. I know that
					 government bureaucracies and a lot of politicians who want to protect their
					 turf do not see the advantages but taxpayers do. We would have a much more
					 efficient system. Our public servants in the United States and Canada could
					 work together as a team in a co-operative manner, and if we did reduce the risk
					 of dangerous people coming into North America we would both win. Nobody would
					 lose. Our economic security would be improved, our social security would be
					 improved and our national security would be improved. By taking this step we
					 would improve security in a lot of respects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is designed to enhance trade between our two
					 great nations. Through decisions made by this government, certain sectors do
					 not participate in North American free trade. They are outside the parameters
					 of that arrangement. Transportation, culture, banking and certain elements of
					 agriculture are protected by the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a member of parliament from Saskatchewan. That
					 province is almost totally dependent on foreign international markets and
					 American markets. We do not have the luxury of protection. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very concerned about a projected bailout for Air
					 Canada. In my view any step by the government to bail out Air Canada would be a
					 confirmation that the government is perpetuating 19th century, family compact,
					 upper and lower Canada policies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a western Canadian I am extremely proud that a
					 strong air carrier has emerged in the west, a company called WestJet. It has
					 continued to increase revenues and profits even with this downturn. It has
					 raised its financing from private investors. It has not been in the pocket of
					 HRDC. It has not been knocking on the door of the department of industry and
					 commerce. It has won its customers from a giant, bloated, government protected
					 monopoly by giving customers a superior product at more attractive
					 prices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will illustrate that with one example. Three weeks
					 ago I flew by Air Canada to Ottawa via Toronto on a hospitality charge seat of
					 $1,044. With the crisis on I was discouraged from flying with Air Canada, so I
					 tried the competitor, WestJet, direct from Saskatoon to Ottawa at a fare of
					 $444, a net saving for the taxpayer of $600. I was surprised that in the rider
					 service the government is engaged in we almost have to fight with those people
					 to get a ticket with WestJet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the solution? Air Canada is sinking under its
					 own weight. It is a product of government protection. This is not a time for
					 its pals in Ottawa to bail it out. It is a time for policy makers to back off
					 and let the market sort it out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another solution is to bring transportation under the
					 umbrella of the free trade agreement and let our companies fully participate in
					 the North American economy, like we do in most other sectors. One minor benefit
					 we might get out of that is that customers in this country might get the
					 benefits of competition and some real choice.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a point I would like to emphasize. This family
					 compact thing is well entrenched in this part of the world, but where I come
					 from we are sick and tired of family compact arrangements. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I encourage our government to reverse
					 this decade of decline and neglect in terms of investing in our military and
					 our national security. I urge the government to seriously pursue a
					 harmonization approach with our American friends and allies in terms of
					 immigration and refugee policy. We are in a time of war and things have to
					 change, but if we want to preserve our national, economic and social security
					 we will have to change the way we do things. The old practices will not work.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something that I really find offensive in this whole
					 debate is the argument that a balanced, moderate way of dealing with terrorism
					 will be used. I have heard that term a lot. I wonder if Churchill, Roosevelt
					 and the allies said they would use a balanced, moderate approach to fighting
					 Hitler. That is nonsense. We have an evil force here and this is not the time
					 for some balanced, moderate approach. We are not talking about some social
					 policy in Canada. We are talking about a very evil force that is out to destroy
					 western civilization as we know it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the time to take a stand with the president of
					 the United States, decisively. I am really disappointed that our Prime Minister
					 was not sitting in the house of representatives side by side with Mr. Blair
					 last night. As a Canadian I found it embarrassing.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I have just a short comment and then a
					 question for my hon. colleague from the Canadian Alliance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier we heard from one of his colleagues in a
					 presentation to the House in which he talked about the $90 billion plus net
					 trade surplus that Canada enjoys with our neighbour to the south and how
					 important that is. Certainly that is one of the reasons why I do support free
					 trade and why I think most Canadians have seen the benefits of free trade.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However there are obviously some problems with NAFTA
					 and with free trade with our American neighbours. Given some of the problems
					 with Bill S-23, in that, as was stated earlier, without reciprocal legislation
					 from the Americans to allow easier access to their market by our corporations
					 and producers, we could see yet a greater impact on that trade surplus we enjoy
					 today and which is of such tremendous benefit to our Canadian economy.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems have developed at our borders, with much
					 justification I might add, given the tragic and terrible events of last week.
					 Nevertheless, given the problems that we have seen over this past week at the
					 borders, why would we move at this particular time to allow easier access to
					 importing goods from the United States when U.S. intentions are obvious? There
					 are some very real reasons why it is being forced to heighten its security at
					 the borders, and of course that does damage to our exports. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the hon. member would comment on why we
					 would proceed at this time without a commitment from the Americans to bring
					 forward comparable legislation in the United States.</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, that is a very good question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many aspects to it. The events that have
					 occurred recently are changing the way things are being done. We are in a state
					 of war. Many people do not understand that. If they watched the president of
					 the United States last night delivering his address, it was a wartime speech.
					 We are not going to be immune from it. It is global. And the president said,
					 “You are either with us or you are against us”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is my point of view. The timid response this week
					 by the government in this whole area bothers me. The United States is going to
					 change its policies. It is in a state of war. Business as usual is not going to
					 carry on. Maybe the Americans had some sort of agreement where they would
					 reciprocate on this issue, but until we get our house in order in terms of
					 immigration and refugee policies, they will be difficult to deal with at the
					 borders. It is as simple as that and I do not blame them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something we have to understand. I do not know
					 all the statistics on it, however, some 40% of our GDP or something in that
					 region is based on trade with our American friends. This is very disturbing to
					 me because if we lose a substantial portion of that, the government should
					 realize what that equates to. It means unemployment, increased spending on
					 social programs and real strains on employment programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see four or five ministers in the House right now
					 and we could basically trim their departments right down to nothing in this
					 situation in the interests of getting national, social and economic security in
					 place and protecting it. However, the government is just doing things the same
					 old way. It does not seem to think there is a war or a problem, but that it is
					 someone else's problem. I know it is not someone else's problem. This is a
					 world problem and we had better wake up. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just thought of one example that would hit the nail
					 on the head. We mentioned Honda and other ones. I was thinking of Magna
					 International, one of the world's largest auto parts producers. I am quite sure
					 many plants in Ontario produce parts that flow into the United States from this
					 just in time inventory system. With the borders being clogged and jammed by
					 American security interests, how long is that going to last? Assembly plants in
					 the U.S. are not going to use our plants as suppliers if they cannot get the
					 parts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to bring this issue into perspective. It is
					 more than just national security. It is social security and it is economic
					 security. If we are not here trying to enhance all three of these things, I
					 really wonder what we are doing in this place.</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I will reiterate my point. The events
					 that have taken place have been so extraordinary that the policy directives we
					 might have had six months or a year ago will be dramatically changed.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be very emphatic with the government. Ressam
					 was headed for Los Angeles bent on doing the same sort of things that happened
					 in New York. The American people apprehended him. Because of our politically
					 correct refugee system, the man lived in our country for six years. The
					 Algerians wanted him because they knew how dangerous he was. My understanding
					 was that we could not send him back because the Algerians may have done
					 something that we might have found offensive in dealing with terrorists. Canada
					 let him go back to Afghanistan for two years while he was waiting here in
					 limbo. We even allowed him to change his name. This is not an isolated case.
					 The king of Jordan has pointed out seven or eight of Ressam's
					 teammates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a problem with the harmonization of our refugee
					 and immigration system. It seems to me that the government has permitted one
					 province to build a firewall and build its own immigration system within the
					 country. I am not exactly sure how that will all fit into the equation if it
					 becomes necessary but it is another sign of decay and decline on the part of
					 the leadership of the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the end of it. Interpol's most wanted
					 criminal came back and forth to Canada about 17 times and nobody bothered him.
					 We could not even ask his wife whether she had a husband because the minister
					 of immigration found that offensive and sexist.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tamil tigers have something like 40 countries in
					 which they could seek asylum but they like our country. We have that warm, cozy
					 feeling here and once they are here they are pretty safe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans know these things. I would be really
					 surprised if anyone on the government side did not know that American
					 officials, whether it is the ambassador or whoever, are concerned about the
					 security in our country. It will impact on our border. If they had confidence
					 in our external border system it would eliminate a lot of problems on our
					 internal border. It would be more like the European situation. For years people
					 on the government side and I think my NDP friends have emphasized that we
					 should be doing what Europe does.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries in Europe do have very tight perimeters. As
					 much as business is being done inside countries, things move around pretty
					 freely, including labour. Maybe we should be looking at enhancing these same
					 things.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I realize there are just a few minutes
					 left but I would like to make some comments in reference to the speech we just
					 heard. I listened intently to the member's speech. He made a lot of good
					 points. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. member was concerned about a potential
					 response by the government to Air Canada, I would suggest that he have a chat
					 with his own transport critic. I was taken aback by the quick stand that was
					 taken, and then a 180 was done a day later. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly the market forces are probably one of the
					 solutions we have to give serious attention to, or if we are going to
					 compensate businesses for costs incurred through this crisis, we have to look
					 at compensating all businesses. I do not think we can pick one over
					 another.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened quite intently to the debate. There are a
					 number of issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been talk about perimeter and harmonization.
					 The bill deals with uses of various technologies--and this has been the subject
					 of ridicule, given the events that happened--to speed up things like
					 pre-clearance, things like going through one detailed security clearance
					 process and getting either a visa or some sort of instrument that allows people
					 to pass freely if they commute back and forth, things like that. These things
					 have been discussed. I remember having discussions with Congressman Lamar Smith
					 four years ago on these. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly if they do not have confidence in the
					 perimeter, they are not going to go ahead with these processes. That goes
					 without saying.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of the common perimeter, let us not kid
					 ourselves. Harmonization means Canada going to American rules. Then the member
					 says that is not an issue, that there is no downside to that. We are two
					 separate countries. Clearly this sovereignty versus security argument is a very
					 false dichotomy. We do not need to put it in those terms because what I am
					 hearing from various members is that there is a price for sovereignty. The
					 member from Peace River mentioned $90 billion. The economic impact is $90
					 billion so sovereignty was pushed aside.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to give this some thought. We absolutely have
					 to look at the perimeter argument. However I think the better way to approach
					 it is to say what are our objectives are. We do not want undesirables in our
					 country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind members that with respect to the crisis
					 that we are dealing with now, 16 of the 19, and it is undecided on two others,
					 did not slip through some porous bed and breakfast called Canada. They walked
					 in the front door of the U.S. with legal visas and their actual ID. Perhaps all
					 western countries were asleep at the switch on this issue, or the events as
					 they unfolded redefined or shifted the paradigm a little on us. But to stand
					 here and somehow claim that Canada was responsible, this was the most planned
					 terrorist attack in the history of the worlds. If the preferred route was
					 Canada, they would have used it. We have very little evidence of that. I am not
					 saying that some of these people may not have spent some time in Canada, but
					 they slipped by American authorities too. Therefore I do not think it is a time
					 to be pointing fingers. I think it is a time to be directing our energies at
					 solutions.</p>
