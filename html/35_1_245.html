	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the <I>Journals</I> of Thursday, October 19 show the vote on Bill C-106 
was deferred by the chief government whip to today at 5.30 p.m. 
pursuant to Standing Order 45. However, according to Standing 
Order 45(6)(a):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A division deferred on Thursday is not held on Friday, but is instead deferred to 
the next sitting day, at the ordinary hour of daily adjournment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The next sitting day is today and the ordinary hour of daily 
adjournment is 6.30 p.m., not 5.30 p.m.
<P>
	The chief government whip cannot unilaterally defer a vote from 
Thursday to Friday to Monday to any other time but the ordinary 
hour of daily adjournment, to wit 6.30 p.m. He could do it pursuant 
to Standing Order 45(7) but as as you know, Mr. Speaker, he would 
need consent from the three whips for that.
<P>
	He did not ask me so that leaves him with only one option which 
is unanimous consent. If it was done by unanimous consent the 
records would indicate that. The records show the vote was 
deferred pursuant to Standing Order 45.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if you would also check <I>Hansard</I> and the video for 
that day you would find that unanimous consent was not sought. In 
fact the government whip was not in his seat to be in a position to 
ask for unanimous consent; he was in front of the Speaker's chair. 
As you know, Mr. Speaker, it is from there that he asks that votes be 
deferred according to the authority granted him under the standing 
order. The standing orders in this case do not give him the authority 
to defer a vote from Thursday to 5.30 p.m. today.
<P>
	It may not even be necessary for you to rule, Mr. Speaker. The 
problem can be solved if the House gives its consent to have the 
vote at 5.30 p.m., which consent I and the Reform Party are 
prepared to give.
<P>
	My concern is not really with the time of the vote. The point is 
we should be careful about following the rules.  Our distinguished 
table officer, Stanley Knowles, once said that the opposition has 
only the rules for its protection, hence the authorities on 
parliamentary procedure emphasize the great importance to the 
opposition of the only protection it has, the protection of the rules.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is quite right in his vigilance in seeing that the 
rules are correctly applied and interpreted. I commend his efforts in 
this regard.
<P>
	I note that he is not objecting to the fact that the vote is 
scheduled for 5.30 p.m. this afternoon. I submit that the decision 
which the Speaker made at the time of the request last week was 
correct.
<P>
	I refer the hon. member to Standing Order 45(5)(a)(ii):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the sounding of the bells, either the Chief Government Whip or the 
Chief Opposition Whip may ask the Speaker to defer the division. The Speaker 
then defers it to a specific time, which must be no later than the ordinary hour of 
daily adjournment on the next sitting day that is not a Friday. At that time, the 
bells sound for not more than fifteen minutes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When the request was made on Thursday it was deferred in 
accordance with this standing order to the next sitting day that was 
not a Friday, which was Monday, at a time not later than the 
ordinary hour of daily adjournment. In other words, the chief 
government whip, who I believe made the request last Thursday, 
made it in accordance with Standing Order 45(5)(a)(ii) in 
requesting that it be deferred until Monday at 5.30 p.m. I believe he 
had that right under that standing order.
<P>
	I know that Standing Order 45(6)(a) deals with Friday divisions. 
It was intended as a rule to deal with divisions which might 
otherwise take place on Fridays, in saying that it went to the 
ordinary hour of daily adjournment on Monday. In respect of 
Thursday votes, that was intended as an explanation. However, the 
rule which allows the time to be fixed was set in Standing Order 
45(5), not in Standing Order 45(6).
<P>
	No doubt the hon. member makes a very neat point. However he 
has missed the other part of the rule, which in my submission 
applies in this case. That is the rule to allow the chief government 
whip or the chief opposition whip to set a time earlier than the 
ordinary hour of daily adjournment on any day when a vote is 
deferred.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15672"> 15672 </A></B>
<P>
	It would be incongruous if the rule relating to Thursday 
divisions was different from that relating to divisions deferred on 
any other day. If, for example, a division is demanded today, the 
chief government whip or the chief opposition whip may defer the 
division to any time tomorrow not later than the ordinary hour of 
daily adjournment. It would be incongruous if the rule were 
interpreted, as the hon. member has suggested, that where a 
division is demanded on a Thursday it must go to 6.30 p.m. on 
Monday and not to any intermediate time. It cannot go to Friday. 
That much the rule is clear on.
<P>
	I submit that Standing Order 45(5) allows for discretion in 
asking for a vote any time during the day on Monday, assuming 
that Monday is the next sitting day, no later than the ordinary hour 
of daily adjournment. That is the purpose of the rule, in accordance 
with the interpretation which has been placed on it over many 
years. The decision which was made last Thursday to defer the vote 
until 5.30 p.m. today by the Chair on request was absolutely 
correct.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, for today, as I have said, we are quite 
happy to accept 5.30 p.m. as the time for the vote. I submit it is 
your prerogative to examine the case put forward today versus that 
of the government benches to see what the technicality is.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank both members for their intervention on 
this matter. I have re-read the rules. What I would like to do at this 
point with your consent is have a brief look at the tapes and to 
revisit <I>Hansard</I>. I will rule formally later this day.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REGIONALRATESOFPAY">REGIONAL RATES OF PAY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider 
abolishing the Regional Rates of Pay, now in force for certain federal 
government employees, in accordance with its stated policy of pay equity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a good way to start off on a Monday 
morning, dealing with an issue that is not just temporal or 
philosophical. This is an issue that fundamentally affects far too 
many public servants right across our country.
<P>
	I do not know if it is luck or what it is, but this is the third time in 
two Parliaments I have been lucky enough to have my motion 
drawn for debate. The first time was in the second session of the 
last Parliament, in June 1990 and again in the third session in 
September 1991 a similar motion was also drawn for debate.
<P>
	It is an issue that is near and dear to my heart. It is an issue that 
has affected, over the years, tens of thousands of federal 
employees. And it is an issue, once again, that I believe should be 
brought to the attention of the people who are elected to represent 
these public servants. As members of Parliament we are supposed 
to be affirming in the House the equality of employees, the equality 
of individuals, the equality of opportunity and the equity of 
people's labour.
<P>
	I will talk a little about the regional rates of pay so that people 
understand exactly what they are. In years gone by, the federal 
government through the collective bargaining process, came to an 
agreement with its federal public employee unions that there 
should be regional rates of pay.
<P>
	This was done at a point in time when the economies were much 
different than they are today. It was done at a time when one could 
argue that there were vast differences in economic conditions in 
various parts of the country, say in Winnipeg, in Halifax, in Sydney 
and St. John's, Newfoundland.
<P>
	As total or global packages were negotiated it was agreed that 
there should be regional rates of pay. It meant that employees of the 
federal government who did a similar or identical job would get 
paid at a different rate based on where they lived.
<P>
	As time went on, initially the rates grew in numbers. With the 
development of our economy, with the genesis of the economy and 
the consolidation of transportation infrastructure across the 
country, it became increasingly apparent that to continue a 
discriminatory wage practice based solely on a single factor of the 
employee living in a certain area was clearly discriminatory.
<P>
	Over the last 15 years through successive collective agreements 
each and every time there has been the global negotiation, the 
number of regional rates has collapsed.
<P>
	They have gone from a high of 35 or 40 down to today where 
only 8 or 9 regional rates of pay are left. That is solid recognition 
that individuals' pay should be based on their qualifications and the 
job they do and not on where they live. Their fundamental wage 
package should not be based on where they live any more than it 
should be based on their language, colour, gender or culture. It is 
discriminatory. Today it still stands as a discriminatory practice. 
What does this mean? It means quite a bit to the people who are 
affected by these discriminatory wage rates.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	During the 1988 federal campaign one of the big issues in the 
Halifax-Dartmouth area was dealing with the general trades and 
labour group at the ship repair unit in Halifax. Its members were in 
a legal strike position. Treasury Board and the Tory government of 
the day in their haste to go to the electorate forgot to designate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15673"> 15673 </A></B>
<P>
them as essential employees. Therefore for the first time  ever the 
potential was that those employees might be in a strike position.
<P>
	One major stumbling block for those unionized workers in the 
negotiations going into the campaign was the regional rate of pay. 
They were doing the same job at the ship repair unit in Halifax as 
was being done in British Columbia. They had the same job 
classifications, the same jobs and were working on the same 
classes of ships, but in some cases the wage differential was as high 
as 28 per cent.
<P>
	The regional rate of pay was made an issue in the campaign, that 
it was a discriminatory practice. They were not seeking a 
commitment from the government of the day to collapse it all at 
once. They wanted a commitment that it would be recognized over 
the next one or two collective agreements that the rate should be 
collapsed.
<P>
	In 1989 a ships crews strike tied up the St. Lawrence Seaway. 
The government was not concerned until there was a freeze-up and 
the possibility that commerce going up the St. Lawrence Seaway 
would stop. At that time the ships crews strike caused legislation to 
come before this place to break the strike and put them back to 
work.
<P>
	What was the issue that caused that ships crews strike? It was the 
wage differential between the two regional rates. There was a west 
coast rate and an east coast rate and the dividing line went right 
down the middle from the Arctic Ocean. Conceivably, if a ship was 
in trouble in the Arctic it could be responded to by ships crews 
from either the east coast or the west coast. If they both got to the 
troubled ship at the same time, there was as much as a 20 per cent 
or 25 per cent wage differential. They were doing the same jobs on 
the same ships on the same high seas, sometimes in 15-metre 
swells. They were going out to save lives and there were two 
different wage rates which were based on where they lived.
<P>
	How much money did they get? This whole strike was caused 
because the ships crews from the east coast region were making 
between $19,000 and $21,000 a year. They wanted their pay 
package to go up to what it was on the west coast, about $22,000 to 
$23,000 a year. That was what caused the strike.
<P>
	When it went to binding arbitration after the legislation passed 
the House, the first thing that happened with the tripartite panel 
was that it collapsed the regional rate of pay. It saw it as 
discriminatory. The panel then went on to other non-monetary 
issues. The history with the last three or four cases that went to 
binding arbitration where the regional rate was an issue is that it 
was immediately seen as discriminatory and was collapsed.
<P>
	The east coast ships crews after they saw what happened at the 
tribunals told me: ``The next time we are not going to bargain in 
good faith. We will just tie it up and hope it goes to binding 
arbitration because the binding arbitration process will find the 
rates discriminatory and will collapse them''.
<P>
	There is a principle here which we should listen to carefully. It is 
the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. That is it, 
straight, clean and simple. Some will argue that if you live in 
Halifax you should get paid less than if you live in Winnipeg. If 
that is the case, why are 91 per cent of federal employees in Canada 
paid under national rates of pay? That means that while the ships 
crews or the ship repair unit charge hand in Halifax get paid up to 
28 per cent less than their west coast counterparts, other employees 
of the federal government are working in the same area and are 
getting identical rates of pay as their counterparts who are doing 
identical jobs in Toronto, Sudbury, North Bay, Victoria, Vancouver 
and St. John's.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	It does not make sense. It cannot be argued that a regional rate of 
pay has to be maintained so that it does not disrupt the local private 
labour market when at the same time 91 per cent of the employees 
are on national rates of pay. It simply does not make sense and is 
discriminatory.
<P>
	The government of the day of which I am a member will say that 
we are in a period of restraint. I understand that. Collective 
bargaining was suspended in the 1994 budget. That was not 
something I supported then and it is not something I support today. 
It is wrong. I support the collective bargaining process. I said it 
when that legislation came forward in the House and I will say it 
again today.
<P>
	The government indicated that once it got beyond its $900 
million or $1 billion in savings which it was trying to accommodate 
by the wage freeze and the suspension of collective bargaining, any 
further savings would be reallocated back into the pay packet. It 
would perhaps talk about the increments but certainly it would look 
at some of the pay equity issues.
<P>
	I implore the government today to see this not as one of those 
issues that affects just a few people. This is an issue of pay equity. 
Just as the government has committed itself at the earliest 
opportunity to address those inequities in pay equity as it is 
traditionally defined, I ask the government today to also extend that 
definition to regional rates of pay.
<P>
	What does it mean? The best numbers I have are from September 
1994 and they have changed. In September 1994 there were 
211,823 employees on the federal public service payroll. There 
were nine groups that were still under regional rates of pay which 
amounted to 23,233 people. That means 9 per cent of the Public 
Service of Canada is being discriminated against based on no other 
factor than where they live.
<P>
	Should we tell the charge hand down in Halifax who is being 
paid 13.7 per cent less than the west coast charge  hand that he 
should work only 86.3 per cent as hard as the individual on the west 
coast? Should the general trades and labour individual who is paid 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15674"> 15674 </A></B>
<P>
13.2 per cent less work 13.2 per cent less hard? No. The 
performance evaluations they face are exactly the same no matter 
where they live. I submit that their pay rate should also reflect that 
similarity.
<P>
	How much would it cost? To completely eliminate regional rates 
of pay in one round of negotiations would cost the government less 
than 1 per cent of its total pay envelope. It would cost less than 1 
per cent to stop discriminating against 9 per cent of its federal 
employees.
<P>
	As the government moves toward a time when it can reinstate 
collective bargaining, when it can start treating public servants 
with the type of respect they deserve, one of the number one 
priorities is pay equity. One of the number one priorities within pay 
equity is addressing the discriminatory practices of regional rates 
of pay.
<P>
	Looking around the Chamber there are members from all over 
the country. There are members from the west coast, from the great 
province of Quebec, from New Brunswick, from Saskatchewan, 
from Ontario. There are members from every province and 
territory in this place. All of us are paid the same based on the job 
we do for the people of Canada, not based on the place we 
represent.
<P>
	I close by urging members of the House to agree with the motion 
before us. Tell the government it is imperative that the horrendous 
discriminatory practice of regional rates of pay must go and must 
go quickly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the member for Dartmouth's comments. I must say that 
while I understand his motives I certainly disagree with some of the 
arguments he raised.
<P>
	In looking at the different regions in Canada, very quickly it is 
found that there are substantial differences in the cost of living for 
people in various regions. For example, in Vancouver the cost to 
acquire and maintain a house is much higher than in rural British 
Columbia or rural Saskatchewan. Looking at the cost of living from 
region to region, some people may do very well on $35,000 or 
$40,000 a year. However, other people are just skimping by on that 
kind of wage simply because so much of their earnings are going 
into their cost of living, particularly their housing.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	One size fits all does not and cannot work for a country the size 
of Canada. This is a huge nation geographically with hundreds of 
thousands of square miles of land. There are different realities in all 
parts of Canada. We cannot impose a one size fits all standard on a 
nation this size. That is why the collective bargaining process has 
recognized this disparity in the cost of living and why we have the 
differences in pay rates. I would argue it is not a discriminatory 
practice, but rather a  recognition of the reality of the cost of living 
in Canada by region.
<P>
	If we are to impose this kind of a one size fits all standard and do 
away with regional differences in pay, the people who are currently 
paid less to reflect the reality of their lower cost of living are going 
to benefit greatly. However, the people who are to be the losers are 
the ones at the top end of the scale right now who require their 
income to maintain their households and their cost of living.
<P>
	The member and the government have said that they want to run 
the government like a business. We agree with that. We think 
governments should be run like a business. I come from a business 
background and I know what it is like. In the construction company 
I formerly owned, people were working in different parts of British 
Columbia. The pay scales differed to reflect the reality of where 
they worked. For example, people were working in camps far away 
from home in areas that were remote and expensive to live in. Their 
pay scale was altogether different from that of people who could 
get up in the morning in the community they resided in and go to 
work.
<P>
	If we are to run government like a business we have to 
understand that the method of dealing with employees has to be 
reflective of that. We cannot adopt a one size fits all standard if we 
are to run government like a business. We have to look at it from 
the point of view of what makes sense.
<P>
	The other major concern I have with this motion is that it could 
be perceived by some as the thin edge of the wedge. Is this the 
beginning of an imposed minimum wage right across the nation? 
Will we have a minimum wage level established based on the most 
prosperous regions where the cost of living is highest and then have 
that imposed on the entire nation? There is real concern that may be 
the direction we will be going in if we adopt this kind of philosophy 
and attitude.
<P>
	With the greatest of respect to the member, I think I understand 
his motivation, but I certainly disagree with his arguments. For that 
reason we on this side of the House, certainly myself, will not be 
supporting this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, because of the strong interest from 
government members in supporting this motion and in supporting 
our colleague from Dartmouth who has been working on this 
motion for many years, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Labour and I will be splitting our time. We will each have five 
minutes.
<P>
	I congratulate my colleague for once again bringing this motion 
to the floor of the House of Commons. Whenever there is a motion 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15675"> 15675 </A></B>
<P>
in the House which deals  with national standards, I always try to 
stand and speak in favour of the motion.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	I am a passionate believer that Canada needs more, not less, 
regulation, programs and activities wherein the national standards 
of the country will be promoted and upheld. I happen to believe 
national standards represent the galvanizing feature or the glue that 
holds the country together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> More regulation, more government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> With respect to the 
member for Skeena, I did not say more regulation. I said 
regulations that have national standards.
<P>
	I come from industry as well and I have always favoured less red 
tape, much more efficiency in government and less duplication. 
However I believe the national government has a role to play in the 
country. I for one am totally frustrated. I do not feel comfortable 
with the offloading and dismantling program we are going through.
<P>
	The member has put forward a very good bill. Its impact on the 
treasury of Canada will be minimal versus the positive output from 
it.
<P>
	I say to the member for Skeena that I do not ever remember any 
member of Parliament on the government side saying that 
government should be run like a business. Government cannot be 
run like a business. If we are talking about efficiencies, absolutely, 
but I come from business and the difference between government 
and business is that business is only interested in earnings per share 
per quarter. It is only interested in profit. That is not the 
government's bottom line. Our bottom line, rather than the 
business bottom line, is people. We are interested in people. 
Business is only interested in profit as a bottom line. That is a big 
difference.
<P>
	It is nothing personal with the member for Skeena. It is an 
ideological view I have. Governments, and I cite my own province 
right now, are becoming so lean in their attitude that the people 
factor is really being hurt. We are here as members of Parliament 
not to look out for the advantaged. We are here to look out for the 
disadvantaged. I get a sense that governments are becoming so 
businesslike that we are almost becoming mean as governments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> The member whom I 
have immense respect for from Orillia says no. I am concerned 
about this matter. We should be skating with our heads up.
<P>
	I am happy to stand in the House to support the bill. I 
campaigned in my first election in Broadview-Greenwood for a 
strong national government. I believe the best way to help 
disadvantaged  regions and people who are disadvantaged is to 
make sure the national government is strong enough to ensure that 
those regions receive the same treatment as downtown Toronto, 
whether it be in education, hospital care, service to the public or 
whatever.
<P>
	I am happy to continue that thought process here. I salute my 
colleague from Dartmouth for making sure the government holds 
true to its red book commitment to be the government that rebuilds 
national standards in the country. What better area than to start with 
the Public Service of Canada which used to be recognized as the 
best public service in the world. The way we have been battering it 
around lately, it needs confidence and support to once again 
become the greatest public service in the world.
<P>
	I salute my colleague from Dartmouth for putting us back on the 
right path.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Joliette, on a point 
of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin: </B>Mr. Speaker, I do not know how much time is left. 
Normally speeches are 10 minutes long. When they are 20 minutes 
long, there are 10 minutes for questions and comments. And I think 
the 10 minutes must be nearly up. It would be difficult to allow an 
extra 5 minutes, as the member across the way announced earlier.
<P>
	I think that when 10 minutes are used up, by one party or the 
other, it is a total of 10 minutes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> On the question about dividing the 
10-minute time period in private members' hour into two 5-minute 
blocks, Standing Order 43 refers to government business and 
giving notice to the Chair through the whip and so on.
<P>
	Given that we have only six people who wish to speak it would 
be better if the hon. parliamentary secretary would finish his 10 
minutes. Then we will move across the floor and back to his 
colleague.

	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Joliette, again on a 
point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin: </B>Mr. Speaker, I beg your pardon, but you have just 
told the parliamentary secretary that he might finish his 10 
minutes. He is not entitled to 10 minutes, because the Reform Party 
has already used up a certain number of minutes. All that he can 
use is what remains after the remarks by the Reform Party member.
<P>
	Otherwise, provided a member announced his intentions in 
advance, he could book in advance all of the  time reserved for a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15676"> 15676 </A></B>
<P>
party by indicating that the 10 minute period would be shared with 
a colleague, if he were the first speaker.
<P>
	I believe that you should acknowledge everyone in turn, without 
going beyond 10 minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The parliamentary secretary has 3 or 4 
minutes more, if he wishes to use them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, today being 
Monday we are heading into the final week of the referendum. It is 
nice to hear a positive spirit coming from the Bloc. Hopefully it is a 
sign as we go through the final moments that Bloc Quebecois 
members and some of their constituents are starting to realize that 
being a part of this great Chamber, being a part of Canada, is a 
much more exciting challenge and a much more worthwhile one 
than separating and going on their own.
<P>
	Once again, my commitment is to national standards, which is 
essentially what the bill is all about. We are reinventing ourselves 
as a government and a country. We have to look at every 
opportunity presented to us to keep the country working. Often it is 
public service motivated because the Public Service of Canada 
touches every aspect of the economic life of the country. A vibrant, 
forward looking, well motivated public service plays an essential 
role in ensuring the economy and the policies related to the 
economy of the country are the right ones.
<P>
	The bill respects the contribution the Public Service of Canada 
makes, so let us all get behind it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me begin by 
thanking the hon. member opposite for acknowledging my positive 
spirit. He is extremely perspicacious, and I would remind him that 
yes is the response associated with positivism.
<P>
	I have listened with a great deal of attention and interest to what 
my colleague from Dartmouth has had to say. Let me congratulate 
him as well on his sincere concern with this problem. I feel that 
efforts must be made to ensure wage equity in all areas. It is a 
desirable thing for there to be wage equity, no discrimination 
according to gender, skin colour, race, religion, or geographical 
location.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Because, regardless of where a job is done, I am thinking for 
instance of a plumber who fixes a sink, whether in Trois-Rivières 
or James Bay, obviously it is the same job. Where this causes 
certain problems, and I think that certain differentiations need to be 
made, the issue cannot be decided as simply as that. Serious 
problems crop up in trying to attain this principle of equality.
<P>
	Of course, one could say: equal pay for equal work. But there are 
often differing incidental expenses in performing that work which 
need to be taken into consideration.
<P>
	The hon. member himself just now said that all members of this 
House are paid the same because that is normal, we all do the same 
work. I am sure that a member from British Columbia is just as 
good at his job as a member from Quebec, and vice versa. Except 
that the member from British Columbia who comes to do his job 
here in the House is given points for travel time, just as I, as a 
Quebec member, am given points when I come to do my job in the 
House, but the value of these points is not the same.
<P>
	We have the same salary, but when the member leaves 
Vancouver to do his job here in the House, his plane ticket costs a 
lot more than the mileage I would be allowed to come and do my 
job in the House. If the member had to pay this out of his own 
salary, he would be at a disadvantage. Today, he has the same 
salary, because someone else pays for incidentals and costs directly 
related to his job in Ottawa.
<P>
	The same applies to a plumber. Suppose a company is doing 
work at James Bay. If the company wants to attract qualified 
employees to James Bay to do certain jobs, such as electricians or 
plumbers, the individual who agrees to go and work in a remote 
area where his expenses will be higher will insist that by the end of 
the week he should have about the same net salary as his 
counterpart in Montreal. The hon. member did not mention this in 
his speech.
<P>
	I refer to remote areas, but we could also talk about isolated 
areas. When someone is asked to go to work in a location that is not 
easily reached except by plane, for instance, this individual will 
spend more to get to his job, in addition to suffering the 
inconvenience of isolation.
<P>
	Working in an isolated area is worse than working in a remote 
area, and there should be some compensation. If the hon. member 
means equal pay for equal work, fine, but members will have to 
suggest ways to compensate for additional expenses. Perhaps we 
could call it a remote area or isolated area allowance, or even an 
occupational hazard allowance, depending on the area.
<P>
	Take a firefighter, for instance. Someone who works as a 
firefighter in a small community of 15,000, 17,000 or 20,000 does 
not run the same risks on the job as a firefighter who works in a big 
city like Montreal or Toronto. The risks are not the same. The 
buildings are higher, and exposure to chemical products may be 
more frequent. The working conditions are quite different.
<P>
	If these differences are not reflected in the salary, it will be 
necessary to find a way to acknowledge them by providing an 
allowance. If an allowance is used, we still have the same problem, 
which is how to determine the amount of the allowance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15677"> 15677 </A></B>
<P>
	The union has argued that it is not easy to judge to what extent 
one job location warrants a higher salary than another location, 
because the work is the same. If there is a problem with salaries, 
determining the allowance will also be a problem.
<P>
	The hon. member for Dartmouth has remained silent about these 
issues. I am aware of union demands that everyone should be equal, 
but when they talk about making everyone equal, they mean raising 
the lowest salaries to the highest level in a given occupation. So 
that the hourly rate proposed for a plumber living in a small village 
of three or four thousand inhabitants where the cost of living is not 
particularly high is the same as a plumber working on a 
construction site in Montreal.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Obviously, no plumber is going to turn his nose up at a salary 
increase in such a region, without its being either remote or 
isolated. But these have to be taken into account.
<P>
	Getting back to the remote regions, a person has to pay more to 
get to work and, then, on top of that he has to pay more for 
everything he buys in order to live in this remote place, all of which 
comes out of his salary. A pound of butter in James Bay does not 
cost the same as in Montreal, because it has to be transported by air.
<P>
	So, if I pay employees the same salary for their work, the one 
living in James Bay will not have enough salary to live on there. It 
does not cost the same to build a house in James Bay or to live there 
or in Manicouagan as it does in Montreal or Toronto. I am in favour 
of equalizing by taking the best salary being paid in each place in 
society, but we do not want to end up with other inequities that 
would be just as unfair.
<P>
	We have to be careful in this matter before we legislate, because 
we also have to allow the business, the employer, to find labour, 
which at times can be hard to find. If you ask me-I was in 
education, I was an administrator in education-most teachers 
from Montreal or from my riding of Joliette, a beautiful riding in 
the province, asked to go and teach in Port Cartier, a very remote 
region, would not voluntarily go and work there for equal salary. 
As the region of Port Cartier would not have been sufficiently self 
sufficient to develop its own teachers, it would have had to go 
without competent people to teach there.
<P>
	The same thing would have happened in James Bay, 
Manicouagan and in other areas in other provinces. I am thinking 
of remote areas, in the woods, for example, areas hard to reach. 
Sometimes competent workers would not be hired, in order to be 
able to provide everyone with the public services to which they are 
entitled. This has been discussed with respect to certain trades but 
health care could have been chosen just as easily as my example of 
education.
<P>
	When people are entitled to equal services, their wages must 
enable them to pay for these equal services to which they are 
entitled, in all fairness and independent again of their gender, age, 
skin colour, religion and so on. These are the sorts of things I would 
like to see addressed by the hon. member for Dartmouth, who 
seems to have a well intentioned bill here, but one that does not 
seem to be detailed enough to ensure it would improve the situation 
instead of creating other areas of inconsistency or other labour 
relations problems.
<P>
	I would also like to see these matters discussed between 
employers and employees, and I think that good personnel 
administration means that, when disputes of this type crop up, they 
are discussed together, negotiated, in preference-by far-to 
letting the courts decide, as has been said.
<P>
	I am totally in agreement with the unions on this approach when 
there is a problem, instead of letting grievances develop and going 
before the courts to have the issue decided, which takes time and 
runs into thousands of dollars in costs as well. What is preferable is 
to allow employers and employees to discuss the true nature of the 
problem and to look together at where solutions lie.
<P>
	This motion will not be voted upon at this time, but it does show 
good intentions, and I hope the government will show an interest in 
it. I hope also, however, that the motion will be able to be translated 
into a bill which will do more justice to workers, to employers as 
well, and to the regions. Care must be taken to ensure that the 
regions do not end up in a situation where they will be unable to 
have with the services necessary for a quality of life and an 
environment to which they are as entitled as everyone else.
<P>
	I hope therefore that the hon. member for Dartmouth will seek 
the assistance of his colleagues in addition to his own opinions on 
this, and I am anxious to hear their input.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to support the motion put forward 
by my colleague from Dartmouth this morning. As we approach the 
second anniversary of the election that brought us here, I have 
come to appreciate the many opportunities available to members in 
terms of how items are put on the agenda and I realize just how 
talented the member for Dartmouth is in bringing these items to the 
attention of the nation. I bring to the attention of the House the 
credit he deserves on not only this one but on other issues.
<P>
	Before speaking to what I believe to be the merits of the motion I 
will address some of the concerns that were raised by colleagues 
who spoke previously.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15678"> 15678 </A></B>
<P>
	In response to the Reform member for Skeena, I think the first 
argument he made against the motion was on the grounds that we 
really had to recognize the differences in the cost of living in 
various places in Canada in terms of remuneration public servants 
receive. I challenge that on a couple of grounds. The country, the 
courts, and public sympathy are headed in the other direction. So 
even in the context of being responsive to the will of the nation, 
we are heading in another direction.
<P>
	More appropriate to the political affiliation of the member who 
made the suggestion, I wonder about the cost of bureaucracy in 
trying to determine pay packages on the basis of regional costs of 
living. I believe there would have to be a new department of the 
cost of living. I cannot see that being consistent with decreasing the 
cost of governance in Canada. Quite the contrary. That would be a 
pretty expensive proposition and one I think the member should 
reconsider in the face of his own party's positions on those issues.
<P>
	The second issue raised by the member for Skeena and repeated 
by the member for Joliette had to do with isolation pay and the need 
to recognize cost of living. I had the good fortune of visiting Iqaluit 
last fall with the social security review group, and I was shocked at 
the price of a banana in that community. I reassure both the 
member for Joliette and the member for Skeena that isolation pay 
and bonuses related to isolation would not be affected by the 
intentions of this motion. This would all be a part of job 
classifications and pay related to job classification and not related 
to isolation. Hopefully some of their concerns would be reassured 
by that.
<P>
	The member for Skeena mentioned that he was fearful that this 
was the thin edge of the wedge. I agree with the member, but I think 
we are heading in the other direction. I would turn that metaphor on 
its head and say quite appropriately that we are heading to the 
narrow point of the triangle, not to the wide edge of the triangle, 
and it is just a matter of time.
<P>
	It should not be surprising that I have fewer exceptions to take 
with the member for Broadview-Greenwood in terms of his 
comments, other than whether or not the nation requires national 
standards, the nation requires national values. Questions of fairness 
in remuneration speak to the need for a national value in Canada. 
That value is fairness, which the government has to acknowledge 
and respect. I say that because this discussion follows the recent 
debate on Bill C-64 on pay equity. It strikes me that the values 
behind this motion and that bill are the same. How can the 
government that supports the notion of pay equity based on 
questions of gender or minorities continue to support the notion of 
regional disparities in terms of how much public servants are paid 
depending on geography?
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	The other important consideration is the inevitability of this 
happening anyway. I suppose this would appeal to  members 
represented by the member for Skeena and the Reform Party in 
terms of the savings involved in doing this as an act of will rather 
than being forced to do it through the courts with all the costs 
associated to have these decisions forced upon us through the legal 
system. It is very important for us to recognize the need to do what 
ultimately will happen anyway without having to be told to do it.
<P>
	By way of history, the previous government reacted to the strike 
in 1989 in Halifax and Dartmouth by enacting back to work 
legislation contained in Bill C-49. At that time as part of that back 
to work legislation a conciliation board was established that 
concluded that regional rate policies would not be maintained 
much longer. That conciliation board labelled the policy 
discriminatory and ordered a new collective agreement to bring 
east coast and west coast workers into parity.
<P>
	We have already been told by a process the previous government 
put in place to deal with this inequity. It is long overdue that we do 
that. It is an important opportunity for this government to meet the 
commitments that were made to act in a fashion that is consistent 
with what we said in opposition. At that time many members said 
these were discriminatory practices.
<P>
	As I said before, this government is promoting equity in terms of 
pay regardless of gender and ethnic background. It would only be 
fair to eliminate discrimination based on geography as well.
<P>
	I will speak for a moment on the question of where this regional 
pay package idea came from. I do not know for certain but I assume 
there are a couple of historical factors that come into play here. My 
sense is that at the time these pay regimes were affected jobs were 
probably less well defined. Consequently what one did in terms of 
a job classification in one part of Canada was probably quite 
different from what one did as a part of a job classification in 
another part of Canada.
<P>
	In the course of collective bargaining over the years job 
descriptions and categories have become much tighter. The level of 
degree that was contained in the practice and exercise of some of 
these jobs has probably diminished significantly. The argument 
that might have been in place at one time no longer exists. I also 
think that at the time these regional pay packages were put in place 
there was a lot less mobility of labour. We are obviously moving 
across the country today with a good deal more frequency and 
efficiency than we did some time ago.
<P>
	The most important reason to support the motion by the member 
for Dartmouth is it reflects Canadian values. Many Canadians have 
lost their faith in this fine institution and in governance in general 
because they see things that they think should be fixed and which 
do not get fixed as quickly or as efficiently as they perhaps should. 
This is one of those things. People look at this and say if you are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15679"> 15679 </A></B>
<P>
doing the same job it seems only fair  that you should be paid the 
same, wherever you do it in Canada. We have to respond to those 
common sense arguments to win back the trust and confidence of 
those Canadians who watch every day as we make decisions.
<P>
	There was a point made that perhaps in the low wage areas a 
higher pay scale that would reflect the national number would have 
the effect of making it difficult for the local communities to 
compete with the public service in terms of pay packages. If 100 
per cent of the employees of the public service were affected then 
an argument might be made for that, although I would not accept it. 
However, given the fact that it is only 9 per cent of the public 
service left, it does not strike me that they should be the people who 
bear the brunt of that argument.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	I encourage my colleagues to support the motion put forward by 
the hon. member for Dartmouth. It is important to recognize that 
federal government employees are competent, efficient, hard 
working and deserving of the same compensation regardless of 
where they live.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in 
support of the motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Dartmouth that in the opinion of the House the government should 
consider abolishing regional rates of pay. It is an important issue 
for the hon. member and I am glad to see it being debated in the 
Chamber.
<P>
	As hon. members may or may not be aware, regional rates of pay 
have been in place in the public service since the 1950s. Under this 
system federal public servants performing the same jobs, with the 
same qualifications and the same experience, are paid different 
wages depending on where they live. This is clearly discriminatory.
<P>
	The federal government is committed to pay equity which quite 
simply means equal pay for work of equal value. We rightly 
condemn wage discrimination based on gender, race or religion. I 
believe discrimination based on geography is also wrong.
<P>
	In the public service we have people who are working for the 
same employer. Yet as of September 1994 over 23,000 federal 
employees were being paid lower wages than others doing the same 
work. In some cases the discrepancy is 25 per cent. There are two 
people doing the same job, with the same qualifications and 
seniority, but one earns 25 per cent less simply because of where he 
or she lives.
<P>
	I will give the House an example of how different that is in the 
public sector from what it would be in the private sector. I come 
from a railway background. In the railway industry there are 
unions. Some are conductors, some are engineers and some are in 
maintenance. We negotiate a collective agreement on a year to year 
basis.  No matter where a conductor, an engineer or a maintenance 
person working for CP Rail lives, they get the same pay based on a 
collective agreement. Quite frankly that is the way collective 
agreements have always been negotiated.
<P>
	I do not think it takes a leap of logic or great faith to understand 
that we cannot go on doing this in the public sector. Over the years 
the number of classifications affected by regional rates of pay have 
been dropping steadily. We have been moving however slowly in 
the right direction. Now the question is when we will take the final 
steps to rectify a situation that should have been rectified many 
years ago.
<P>
	Some members will be concerned about the cost of ending 
regional rates of pay. I agree that this is an important consideration. 
Treasury Board estimates the cost of removing regional rates at 
around $87 million per year. This would represent a 1 per cent 
increase in our total outlay for public service wages. While it may 
be difficult to argue for such an increase while we are cutting back 
in everything, at some point it will not be a discretionary 
expenditure.
<P>
	Members of the Chamber often wonder why there are regional 
rates of pay. The reason for them is that the argument can be made 
that people should be paid less based on where they live instead of 
being paid the same amount. Everyone seems to think we are 
asking for people to be paid less when we are asking for people to 
be paid a reasonable rate of pay at the same level as someone else 
living in Montreal, Toronto, Sioux Lookout or Dartmouth.
<P>
	I was in the House with the hon. member for Dartmouth when 
east coast ships crews went on strike in 1989 over discriminatory 
rates of pay. I recall the hon. member seizing the issue and holding 
the government of the day accountable. I remember Bill C-49, the 
back to work legislation, that was brought forward in this case. It 
established a conciliation board under the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act.
<P>
	If members look at the report issued by the board they will see 
that it is quite enlightening. It clearly states that regional rates of 
pay are discriminatory. It orders the government to eliminate 
regional rates of pay in that classification.
<P>
	We face another such situation. Logic and precedence state that 
the government will be forced to act. We will be forced to do the 
right thing. What would it say about this institution if we waited for 
another conciliation board report to tell us to act when we already 
know we have to act.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	The member has put the issue before the House in very succinct 
terms. Either we do it as a collective in the House of Commons 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15680"> 15680 </A></B>
<P>
because it is the right thing to do, or  we will have an outside body 
do it for us because it is discriminatory.
<P>
	As I mentioned before, in the private sector everybody in large 
unions gets the same rate of pay. In the House of Commons it could 
be argued that there is a bit of difference depending on where 
people live and their costs of living. The argument in northern 
Ontario is that the cost of food is higher and the cost of gas is 
higher. The cost of housing is much lower in Kenora-Rainy River 
than it is in Halifax, than it is in Toronto, than it is in Vancouver. It 
balances itself out in most cases.
<P>
	The motion put by the member is a very good one and should be 
supported by the government and all members opposite to give 
people work and pay based on their abilities, their seniority and 
their classifications, not on where they live.
<P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BRITISHCOLUMBIATREATYCOMMISSION">BRITISH COLUMBIA TREATY COMMISSION</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 20 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-107, an act respecting the establishment of the 
British Columbia Treaty Commission, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in the debate on Bill C-107 to raise a couple of objections with 
regard to the way the bill has been presented to the House.
<P>
	What we have here is enabling legislation that sets up the British 
Columbia Treaty Commission. At this point as we are debating this 
position in the House we have a British Columbia Treaty 
Commission. On the commission are certain representatives of the 
federal government who are making statements on behalf of the 
federal government. Yet there is no legal authority for them to do 
so.
<P>
	My purpose this morning is not to debate the particular details of 
the bill but to draw to the attention of the people of Canada-and 
those listening to us this morning will recognize it-that the bill is 
based on a recommendation of the Governor General of Canada 
who recommends to the House of Commons the  appropriation of 
public revenue under the circumstances and the manner and for the 
purposes set out in a measure entitled an act respecting the 
establishment of the British Columbia Treaty Commission. Then 
the summary of the bill reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This enactment, together with an act of the Legislature of British Columbia 
and a resolution of the First Nations Summit, establishes the British Columbia 
Treaty Commission. That commission will facilitate in British Columbia the 
negotiation of treaties among first nations, Canada and British Columbia.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a major undertaking, a very serious and a very necessary 
issue that needs to be dealt with. I make it abundantly clear to 
everyone in the House this morning that my purpose in rising to 
speak against the bill is not the business of negotiating land claims 
and treaty settlements in British Columbia. That is not my purpose.
<P>
	My purpose in rising concerns the issue of people going around 
the country without the legitimate authority of an act passed by 
Parliament. We should have settled the treaty business a long time 
ago.
<P>
	Now the British Columbia legislature has passed legislation. The 
summit comprised of bands and various tribes among the 
aboriginal peoples has established a resolution that appoints certain 
people legitimately. However the House has gone beyond letting 
people go out there and do something without the legislative 
authority to do so.
<P>
	This process disenfranchises the representatives of the House, of 
the people of Canada. It is wrong in principle and I object to it. I am 
not alone in that objection. Sitting on either side of me this morning 
are representatives of the constituency to the south, 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, and the constituency to the 
north, Okanagan-Shuswap. They too find it objectionable that the 
House should engage in the process of doing business in this 
manner.
<P>
	The purpose of the act so clearly stated is to establish the British 
Columbia Treaty Commission as undertaken in the agreement. The 
agreement refers to the agreement reached by the summit, the 
province of British Columbia and Canada.
<P>
	What does it do in terms of establishing the commission? 
Established by the joint operation of this act, an act of the 
legislature of British Columbia and a resolution of the summit, is 
the British Columbia Treaty Commission consisting of a chief 
commissioner and not more than four other commissioners.
<P>
	There was nothing until now. Yet they are travelling around the 
province of British Columbia setting up meetings. There was a 
meeting in my constituency last week. They are acting as if they 
were representing and negotiating on behalf of the Government of 
Canada. According to this act they could not commit the 
government to anything.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Were there discussions?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15681"> 15681 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Indeed there were discussions. Of course there 
are discussions and negotiations. What else would we expect? We 
need discussions to negotiate. What kind of comment was that? 
Is that the way the government runs things, with arrogance and 
presumption? That is not right.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Yes, arrogance and presumption is exactly what it 
is up to.
<P>
	I want to look at the purposes and powers of the commission in 
rather significant detail. The purpose of the commission is to 
facilitate in British Columbia the negotiation of treaties among one 
or more First Nations, Her Majesty in right of Canada and Her 
Majesty in right of British Columbia. The Westbank Indian band is 
already in step three of the process, yet the legislation has not yet 
been passed in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> We are trying to be 
efficient.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member suggests this is 
efficiency. Is it efficient to do things with two people who have 
elected representatives to represent them and make the legislative 
proposals that ought to exist there? If that is the argument, what is 
the point of electing people? What is the point of having a 
Parliament? What is the point of having laws if one person can 
decide what happens and the person happens to be the person who 
runs the privy council?
<P>
	Apparently the commissioners are running around the province 
representing Canada as a result of an order in council passed by the 
federal cabinet. That is how they run the country. It is not a 
democratic process and I object very strenuously to it.
<P>
	It goes beyond that. I want to go into the details and 
responsibilities of the commission. What is it supposed to do? It is 
supposed to do at least four things that I will draw to the attention 
of the House. It is to assess readiness in accordance with the 
agreement of Her Majesty in right of Canada and in right of British 
Columbia and one or more First Nations to begin negotiations. The 
commission is to assess whether or not a particular band or tribe is 
ready to start negotiations. That is its responsibility and it is a 
major responsibility. We should all have had input into that debate 
before the commission members went around talking to various 
people.
<P>
	It is to allocate funds. This is the authority that gives to the 
treasury the right to allocate funds. However, what has happened? 
It says to allocate funds that have been provided. By whom? By the 
finance minister to enable First Nations to participate in 
negotiations in accordance with the criteria agreed to by the 
principals. Is this not an interesting provision?
<P>
	We now have these people spending money, travelling around 
the country, being paid and incurring expenses on behalf of the 
Government of Canada. They are to divide moneys among the 
persons who are to participate in the negotiations. In accordance 
with what? In accordance with criteria agreed to by the principals, 
which are the summit, the legislature of British Columbia and 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	Finally, they are to encourage timely negotiations. Are we to 
suggest then that this commission is not to do the negotiations? We 
are getting into the details of the bill, which I said I would not do 
and I will not.
<P>
	I will simply say that I object strenuously to this method of 
retroactivity, this business of presenting to the House legislation 
after the fact. We have asked this of the people who have briefed us 
on this. We have asked them if this is really retroactive legislation 
and if they have already begun the process. The answer was yes. I 
object strenuously. I hope every member will make every effort to 
make sure this never happens again in the House.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure today to rise to speak on behalf 
of legislation that will have such great economic benefits for the 
people of British Columbia. With this legislation we can remove an 
obstacle that has hampered economic growth in B.C. for too long, 
uncertainty over ownership of land and resources. That uncertainty 
has carried a very high price.
<P>
	In 1990 a Price Waterhouse study asked forestry and mining 
interests in B.C. about the effects of the uncertainty created by 
unresolved land claims. The results are sobering: $1 billion in 
investments were not made in those two sectors alone; 300 new 
jobs were not created; 1,500 permanent jobs were adversely 
affected; $125 million annually in capital investment is lost 
because of the lack of legal certainty with regard to land and 
resources. Since the time of that study the price has continued to be 
paid, year in and year out.
<P>
	That is the toll we pay for leaving things unclear, uncertain, 
undefined. That is the price for refusing to sit down with our 
aboriginal partners and discuss rational solutions to real problems. 
That is the price opponents to this process will have us continue to 
pay. Here we have a chance to do something concrete, to create 
jobs and real economic growth for Canadians.
<P>
	In September Ms. Marlie Beets of the B.C. Council of Forest 
Industries was quoted as saying their members know they cannot 
afford to ignore treaty issues. There is solid support in the forestry 
industry to resolve this, even though the industry has concerns 
about what treaties might contain.
<P>
	People in the forestry industry of B.C. understand what is 
involved. They know they cannot function efficiently without clear 
policies. They know aboriginal  rights must be defined clearly so 
that everyone knows the rules of the game. They know their time 
has come to realize the potential of their province and to expand 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15682"> 15682 </A></B>
<P>
opportunities for the people. They want to get on with it. The 
proposition is simple: treaties will provide certainty and create a 
better climate for investment and economic growth. This is a 
reality that cannot be denied.
<P>
	Treaties will provide a land base for aboriginal people and with it 
a foundation upon which to build self-sufficient communities. This 
will allow aboriginal people to become involved in a range of 
economic activities that in the absence of a land base have been 
foreclosed to them. Commercial activities like mining, forestry, 
and tourism become far more possible to be pursued by First 
Nations. And the growth of strong, self-reliant, economically 
vibrant aboriginal communities strengthens us all, because it will 
bring positive economic spillover into non-aboriginal 
communities.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	For too long the aboriginal people of B.C. have been denied both 
their legal rights from the past and their hopes for the future. For 
too long they have suffered high rates of unemployment, low rates 
of literacy, and high rates of infant mortality and suicide. For too 
long we have denied ourselves the contribution they can make.
<P>
	This situation cannot be defended and it must not continue. With 
rights and obligations clearly defined by treaties, all British 
Columbians, aboriginals and non-aboriginals, will be able to get on 
with realizing the potential of the province and expanding their 
opportunities for advancement.
<P>
	This will be good news for the forest workers and the miners. It 
will mean an expanded tax base as the infusion of settlement funds 
stimulates economic activity and creates jobs. It will also mean 
lower social costs associated with the poverty and unemployment 
in aboriginal communities. It will mean the end of conflict and 
costly litigation and the beginning of co-operation and negotiation.
<P>
	These historic issues will not go away. They cannot be wished 
away. As long as the issues remain unresolved, investment will stay 
away and the jobs that must be created will go elsewhere. The 
spiral will continue: uncertainty creating fewer opportunities and 
fewer opportunities creating more social problems. The cycle of 
poverty and dependence will continue.
<P>
	These issues must be dealt with. We have a choice as to how we 
are going to do that. We can litigate at great expense to the 
Canadian taxpayer, knowing that at the end of this long, drawn out 
and often bitter process a court is likely to tell us to work out the 
details ourselves-something very similar to the negotiation 
process we have now-or we can negotiate directly from the 
outset.
<P>
	Surely it makes good economic sense to avoid costly court 
battles, which cast each party in the role of antagonist. It makes 
good sense to instead approach these issues as partners, prepared to 
give and take in the spirit of trust and mutual respect.
<P>
	Yes, there are real economic benefits in proceeding with treaties 
in B.C., but at the end of the day the most important benefit will not 
be felt in terms of dollars and cents; it will be felt in the lives of the 
individuals as they are given the opportunity to contribute further 
to the greatness of Canada.
<P>
	The benefits of holding a job cannot always be measured by 
points on a graph. Having a job is really about hope. It means 
having the ability to plan for the future in order to realize your own 
potential and advance your family. It means having the pride of 
contributing to the overall health of one's community. Is it better to 
leave things in a state of confusion or to sit down with our 
aboriginal colleagues and establish certainty?
<P>
	Perhaps it is expecting too much to hope that the Reform Party's 
vision of Canada is broad enough to include the first peoples, 
generous enough to expand the circle of opportunity, or far sighted 
enough to see the wisdom in finally completing this great 
unfinished business of our history. Surely it is not expecting too 
much to ask the Reform Party to take a hard headed look at the 
economics of treaty negotiations and admit that it makes real sense. 
Surely we can see the awful price we are paying for uncertainty. 
Surely even they can see the benefits of negotiating instead of 
litigating.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	I would ask that the Reform Party and all other parties in the 
House join us in helping to close the chapter of frustration and fear 
and help us to write a new one of understanding and opportunity. 
Let us finally complete the work our forebears began.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elijah Harper (Churchill, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
humbled to be here in the House to speak in Parliament where the 
laws are made. This is the supreme lawmaking body of the country, 
based on the principles of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, which says ``based on the principles of the supremacy of 
God and the rule of law''. We as aboriginal people, the first 
inhabitants of this country, have always known that.
<P>
	We are now debating once again what has been debated for years 
and years: land. The first order of business has not been concluded 
with the First Nations, the first inhabitants.
<P>
	The creator created all nations all over the world, created land, 
the trees, the environment we live in today. It so happens that he 
placed the aboriginal people in this country. Canada is an 
aboriginal word meaning community.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15683"> 15683 </A></B>
<P>
	Our ancestors welcomed many nations that came to this land. 
Today many nations benefit from the rich resources of this 
country. As aboriginal people, we seem to be living in a third 
world country in our own homeland. We have always declared that 
the creator put us here and the creator will always honour that, 
no matter what governments do, how they cut it and slice this 
country. The country will always be aboriginal land, Canada.
<P>
	Today we are talking about the B.C. Treaty Commission. Today 
we are also facing another crisis dealing with Quebec, another 
incident that would divide Canada. If it is the will of God to honour 
the people he placed here, the aboriginal people, the original 
inhabitants of this land, then Quebec cannot separate. We have put 
our faith in the creator to sustain us. This institution is based on 
that. The Canadian Constitution is based on that. As a matter of fact 
it is written on a piece of paper I have that in the principles of 
Christianity is found the liberty that has made Canada great. It is so 
great that in the United Nations' annual listing of the world's 
countries for 1994 Canada was ranked first out of 173.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Canada has benefited from the relationship with the aboriginal 
people. When we make treaties it has to be understood by every 
Canadian that we are here to co-exist, to welcome the Europeans, to 
live side by side with each other, to respect and honour each other 
and not to dominate. These treaties must also have the view and 
philosophy of the First Nations in this country because the creator 
put us here. We could not have given the land to anyone because we 
do not own it. We could only share the land and resources that 
would benefit everybody else in this country.
<P>
	We did not accept the European concept of land tenure which is 
to have property, to see it as a commodity and to exploit and 
develop it for the purposes of a company or one or a few 
individuals. Maybe that is why opposition members are afraid of 
the land claims we are making. Maybe they think we may become 
like them. We may acquire all these things and not share them. In 
assessing these things we tend to assess the successes of our land 
claims and businesses in our communities based on European 
values and not in relation to some of the traditional ancient values 
we used to have. However, they are coming back again today.
<P>
	We have to get back to the ancient roots because we are very 
close to the creator. The land has caused so much hurt. Look at the 
Oka crisis. Corporal Lemay died in that situation because the 
Mohawks did not want their ancestral burial grounds decimated. 
This summer in Ipperwash, Anthony ``Dudley'' George was killed 
as a result of land, another aboriginal burial ground.
<P>
	These issues have to be resolved. They have to be dealt with. Our 
way of thinking and our philosophy are ones  that have always been 
shared with other First Nations in this country, to share what we 
have, to share the land and resources. If we were to add up what it 
means in dollars and cents over the last 500 years I do not think it 
would even represent 1 per cent of the compensation to the 
aboriginal peoples. We probably would have been the wealthiest 
people in the world if we had been greedy and kept everything for 
ourselves. However, that was not our way of thinking.
<P>
	That is why I am so honoured and humbled to be here, to be in 
this House which was created on the principles I espoused and 
which this place has sanctified to say all these things. All of us have 
to be reminded daily because we make mistakes as human beings. 
Personally, it has been a difficult journey for me to be involved in 
mainstream politics, provincially, nationally and internationally, in 
promoting this kind of philosophy.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	The world's needs have come together because there is a global 
economy, a global movement which is happening, which is tearing 
our communities apart. It is influencing the communities in 
Canada. It is not just the aboriginal people, but Canadians as well. 
They feel helpless. They distrust governments. We have to restore 
trust.
<P>
	I support Bill C-107. It will begin the treaty making process in 
British Columbia where treaties have not been made in the past, 
except for northeastern B.C., in the Peace River area, where Treaty 
No. 8 was signed years ago, as well as the treaty concerning 
Vancouver Island. However, most of British Columbia has never 
been in the treaty making process where land has been settled.
<P>
	Our rights have never been extinguished. The Canadian 
Constitution has recognized that. There is not a requirement under 
the Constitution for any citizen or any nation to give up rights; 
rather, those rights which are recognized and affirmed in the 
Canadian Constitution should be expanded and defined. People are 
concerned about extinguishing land claims. They feel there should 
no longer be a requirement to extinguish land claims.
<P>
	Several reports have been made to government over the past 
years. One was the 1985 Coolican report entitled: ``Living Treaties, 
Lasting Agreements'' which determined that extinguishing land 
claims were no longer an option. Today there is another report 
entitled: ``Canada and Aboriginal Peoples: A New Partnership'' 
authored by A.C. Hamilton. That report will be discussed in the 
near future. There was also the interim report of the Royal 
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples entitled: ``Treaty Making in 
the Spirit of Co-existence: An Alternative to Extinguishment''. 
That report is also an alternative to extinguishing land claims.
<P>
	All of those reports suggest a new approach. All of them ask that 
we come together, that we respect each  other and that we negotiate 
in good faith. The rights of all individuals must be recognized. 
Whether they be aboriginal, government, business, or third party 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15684"> 15684 </A></B>
<P>
interests, their rights must be protected in order for us to co-exist 
without fear.
<P>
	I have heard some hon. members say that one law should be 
applied. Whose law should be applied? When our cemeteries are 
being desecrated, will the government remove the people who are 
occupying them? How would they feel if our aboriginal people 
were to go to their cemeteries? Whose law would be applied?
<P>
	We must bring this to the attention of the Canadian public. Our 
concept of land tenure is one of sharing the land and resources. If 
the Canadian people understood that, they would not be threatened 
by land claims. Their interests would be protected. Aboriginal 
rights would ensure that. Our forefathers have taught us for many 
years that our history is very rich.
<P>
	I have called for a sacred assembly to which all members will be 
invited. I have invited the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development. A letter will also be sent 
to opposition members inviting them to participate in the sacred 
assembly which will be held hopefully sometime in December.
<P>
	The sacred assembly is designed to bring together aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal leaders, spiritual leaders and religious leaders from 
all walks of life in Ottawa for the purpose of providing counsel and 
promoting reconciliation because of the events of this past summer.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	What I believe has been missing is the spiritual element of this 
whole process. The political process has failed us. We need to get 
back to our traditional spiritual roots. The prime objective is to 
restore that so that the spiritual leaders, advisers and elders can 
provide direction not only to our aboriginal leaders but to 
government leaders across this country as well. This is sorely 
needed and the time is right for us to address these things.
<P>
	With those few words, I thank you for listening. I recommend 
this bill to the members opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to address the House on Bill C-107, the 
British Columbia Treaty Commission Act. I am extremely pleased 
to be joining my hon. colleagues in speaking in support of this 
legislation. It is imperative that we give the treaty commission the 
legal foundation and powers it needs to get on with the job of 
settling the dozens of land claims that are casting a cloud of 
uncertainty over British Columbia.
<P>
	Settlement agreements acknowledge that claimant groups have 
some historic interest in the land which was occupied and used by 
their ancestors long before Europeans moved into the claim area. 
Equally as  important, land claims settlements pave the way for a 
better economic future for the beneficiaries. They do so by 
providing a financial package to the claimant group and by 
ensuring a secure land base and certainty over resource ownership, 
all of which are critical to establishing a viable economic base.
<P>
	The settlement of a land claim is not an end in itself, but a 
beginning. It is the beginning of a new era in which aboriginal 
people can regain control over their destiny, a destiny which has 
been taken from them. They can gain control of their economic 
future and reduce their dependence on government.
<P>
	Hon. members have heard aboriginal leaders say time and again 
that self-government will be meaningless without sustainable 
economic development that is controlled by the aboriginal people 
themselves. On the other hand, the expansion of the aboriginal 
economy can help counteract the human and economic costs that 
for so many years and for so many generations have paralyzed First 
Nations communities across this great nation.
<P>
	Economic development is critical to achieving the red book goal 
of strengthening aboriginal communities. Self-government, 
improved social services, better health care, more sensitive justice 
initiatives: the success of all of these efforts depends in part on 
strengthened local economies that provide aboriginal people with 
meaningful employment and reasonable levels of income.
<P>
	There are many examples of the positive impact land claims 
settlements have had on aboriginal economies and standards of 
living. The Inuit of the Nunavik region are a case in point. Under 
the terms of the James Bay and Northern Quebec agreement, the 
Inuit established the Makivik Corporation which among other 
things serves as a holding company for a wide range of businesses 
that are bringing tangible economic benefits to northern Quebec 
every day.
<P>
	I quote from the Makivik Corporation's 1994-95 annual report in 
which third vice-president Mark Gordon, who is responsible for the 
economic development program, made the following statement: 
``There is a common theme that unites all of our initiatives. That 
theme can be summarized by one word: control''. Control by the 
Inuit people of their own future, control to do good, to enhance the 
lives of Inuit people.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	The Inuit of Nunavik have certainly taken control of their 
economic future. The Makivik Corporation has used compensation 
funds to invest in a wide range of successful businesses that are 
providing employment and income to Inuit beneficiaries.
<P>
	Air Inuit and First Air, for example, provide critical 
transportation and delivery services both within Nunavik and 
between the north and other parts of Canada and Greenland. Both 
airlines are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15685"> 15685 </A></B>
<P>
major employers in the  Nunavik region and both reported 
profitable years in 1994.
<P>
	Makivik Corporation also owns the Kigaq Travel Agency which 
promotes travel in northern Quebec. Another Makivik subsidiary, 
Seaku Fisheries, is involved in commercial fisheries development. 
Among other things, Seaku manages Makivik's shrimp licence. In 
1994, 43 Inuit fishermen from Nunavik were employed on shrimp 
fishing vessels with collective earnings of close to $700,000. The 
company also invested about $500,000 in 1994 in community 
based fishing projects.
<P>
	Seaku owns 50 per cent of Unaaq Fisheries which trains 
fishermen and pursues fisheries business opportunities at the 
international level. In 1994, Unaaq International completed 
consulting contracts for the National Capital Commission, the 
United Nations Development Program, the Canadian International 
Development Agency and Industry Canada.
<P>
	A newly created subsidiary of Makivik, Nunavik Arctic Foods, 
is commercializing Nunavik country foods, particularly caribou 
and ring seal meat. The food is harvested through traditional Inuit 
hunts, processed and packaged in four community processing 
centres and distributed throughout retail outlets throughout 
Nunavik. Studies have shown that during full scale operations of 
processing centres, 72 cents out of every dollar will remain in 
Nunavik.
<P>
	Makivik has also entered into a joint venture with other Inuit 
development corporations to form a Panarctic Inuit logistics 
corporation. This new enterprise recently joined with Frontec 
Logistics Corporation to successfully bid on a $288 million 
contract to operate and maintain the north warning system for a 
five-year period ending in the year 2000. Among other things, the 
agreement between the two corporations provides for the 
recruitment, training and hiring of Inuit workers.
<P>
	The Cree of James Bay region have also used their compensation 
dollars and other economic development funding to acquire and 
establish a very impressive portfolio of collectively owned 
businesses among other interests. The Cree holding company 
known as Creeco owns an airline and a construction company.
<P>
	Using funds from their 1984 land claim settlement, the 
Inuvialuit of the western Arctic region have pursued a wide range 
of economic development initiatives under the umbrella of the 
Inuvialuit Development Corporation.
<P>
	The most successful has been the Inuvialuit Petroleum 
Corporation which in 1994 realized an amazing 200 per cent return 
on the timely sale of most of its holdings in western Canada. The 
corporation closed the year with a $50 million investment portfolio 
and total assets of $117 million. The company has initiated a 
number of programs to provide direct benefits to Inuvialuit people, 
including employment training and development. It has an exciting 
future in the Canadian petroleum industry.
<P>
	The Inuvialuit also co-own the Northern Transportation 
Company with another aboriginal business, the Nunasai 
Corporation of Nunavik. In 1994 the Northern Transportation 
Company was named business of the year by the Northwest 
Territories Chamber of Commerce. Over the 10 years that the 
business has been owned by aboriginal people, it has contributed 
more than $100 million in taxes, purchases and payrolls to the 
territorial economy.
<P>
	Another successful Inuvialuit venture is the Umayst Corporation 
which markets musk-ox meat and wool. The Inuvialuit Regional 
Corporation has also formed an international investment house that 
caters specifically to native groups around the world. Based on its 
track record, in 1993 the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation was able 
to secure an $87 million loan from the Bank of Montreal, part of 
which was used to repay a loan from the federal government. 
Clearly Canada's investment and land claim settlements is a sound 
one.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Settlement agreements often include specific provisions for 
economic development that go beyond land and resource 
ownership and financial compensation. For example, as a result of 
the Nunavut final agreement, the Inuit of Canada's eastern Arctic 
have been guaranteed preferred access to economic opportunities 
in the area of guiding, sports lodges and the commercial marketing 
of wildlife products. The final agreement also provides for 
increased Inuit participation in government employment and 
contracting within the settlement area and includes the right to 
negotiate employment, training and other benefits for the 
developers of major projects.
<P>
	Similarly, the land claim settlements of the Gwich'in and Sahtu 
Dene and Metis recognize the need to expand the economic 
horizons for aboriginal people. The Sahtu agreement provides for 
economic development opportunities related to guiding, lodges, 
naturalist activities and commercial fishing. The Sahtu Dene and 
Metis will also be well positioned to take advantage of employment 
and business opportunities that will arise in the oil and gas sector as 
a result of the settlement agreement.
<P>
	The Council for Yukon Indians' final agreement also enhances 
opportunities for Indian people to participate in the territorial 
economy. Both the federal and territorial governments have made 
commitments to contract with aboriginal companies to provide 
Yukon Indians with access to government employment.
<P>
	The combination of land claim settlement agreements and other 
economic development initiatives have resulted in significant 
expansion and strengthening of the aboriginal economy in recent 
years. Twenty years ago a survey of aboriginal economic 
development in most regions of Canada would have revealed 
pockets of commercial activity heavily concentrated in natural 
resource based industries. Today there are literally  thousands of 
aboriginal businesses across Canada operating in all sectors of the 
economy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15686"> 15686 </A></B>
<P>
	In my province of Saskatchewan, for instance, there are over 700 
aboriginal owned and operated businesses enjoying tremendous 
economic success, doing well in the economy of Saskatchewan and 
indeed all of Canada. They provide employment to aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal people, paying the government tax revenue and all 
of the good things that go with sustained economic growth.
<P>
	These aboriginal enterprises include industry firms, 
transportation and construction companies, retail and service 
outlets, manufacturing operations, management consultants, 
computer companies, arts and crafts enterprises, tourist outfitters 
and recreation oriented businesses.
<P>
	Aboriginal businesses are also taking advantage of opportunities 
in new markets, such as authentic aboriginal tourism products 
which involve a combination of facilities and experiences that are 
uniquely aboriginal, experiences which are sought by many people 
from many nations.
<P>
	Market research by the government indicates that authentic 
aboriginal tourism products have the potential to generate revenues 
of $1.6 billion annually in the Canadian economy. Not only will 
this benefit the aboriginal business but all businesses and 
enterprises across this nation.
<P>
	Aboriginal business development is gathering momentum as 
First Nations, Inuit and Metis peoples seek to gain control of their 
economic destinies. In a 1991 survey of aboriginal people, more 
than 18,000 respondents indicated that they own or operate a 
business and 34,000 others indicated their intention to start a 
business within two years.
<P>
	Aboriginal people are proving to be astute business people. An 
independent study of 292 aboriginal firms that received financial 
assistance from Industry Canada revealed that 90 per cent of those 
firms were operating after two years. These businesses have proven 
to be good sources of employment for aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal Canadians alike. Of the 2,122 jobs created or 
maintained with support from Industry Canada, 1,486 were held by 
aboriginal people and 636 by non-aboriginal people.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	In addition to the business ventures I mentioned earlier, which 
are a direct result of land claims, there are many other examples of 
successful aboriginal entrepreneurship.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan the Meadow Lake Tribal Council, which 
represents nine First Nations, was the winner of the 1995 
prestigious Aboriginal Economic Developer of the Year Award. 
The tribal council has developed an impressive economic 
development strategy that sets out a  tremendous range of 
activities. Already a forestry company owned by the tribal council 
has generated 240 direct jobs.
<P>
	In La Ronge, Saskatchewan, Kitsaki Development Corporation 
has business enterprises which gross over $30 million a year and 
provide well in excess of 250 full time jobs for aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal people alike.
<P>
	In The Pas, Manitoba the Opaskwayak Cree Nation owns seven 
profitable businesses and is developing more. The latest venture is 
an $8 million, 70,000 square foot hotel complex that will open in 
1996. Another organization of Manitoba First Nations, the 
Southeast Resource Development Council recently opened a plant 
that will manufacture windows and doors for the nine First Nations 
in southeastern Alberta.
<P>
	Next year the first aboriginal owned hydroelectric plant in 
Canada will open in the Northwest Territories. The $26 million 
Cascades station will be owned by the Dogrib Power Corporation 
and most of the 100 jobs created by the plant will go to local 
Dogrib people.
<P>
	In Quebec the Mohawk Trading Company in Kanesatake 
markets office supplies, equipment, computers, software and 
furniture to a wide range of clients including federal departments, 
corporations like Pepsi-Cola and Colgate-Palmolive.
<P>
	On the east coast the Labrador Inuit Development Corporation 
has signed a multi-million dollar contract to mine and export rare 
anorthosite crystal to Italy.
<P>
	We are witnessing an increase in the entrepreneurial partnerships 
between aboriginal people and mainstream business communities. 
Such partnerships, joint ventures and strategic business alliances 
are essential if the aboriginal community is to capitalize on 
opportunities throughout the economy.
<P>
	In northern Ontario, for example, the Mussel White Mine 
Development project involves an agreement between Placer Dome 
Mining and four First Nations. Under this agreement 60 jobs will 
be created at the mine site. The Long Lake First Nation in northern 
Ontario has also negotiated an agreement that provides for 
employment, job training and opportunities with Long Lac Forest 
Products:Buchanan Brothers. This agreement has resulted in 65 
jobs for First Nations people.
<P>
	Despite the impediment of unresolved land claims, British 
Columbia First Nations are also pursuing business opportunities. 
Since June 1995, for example, the Skeetchestn First Nation and the 
Chia-Na-Ta Corporation have been working together to grow 
ginsing on 544 acres of reserve land in the Kamloops area for 
export to China and Hong Kong. In return for providing financing 
and land for the project, the First Nation anticipates approximately 
300 jobs and more than $14 million in profits over the 10-year 
agreement.

	On Vancouver Island the Nuu-cha-nulth Tribal Council has 
turned a former residential school into a resort. The 56-room lodge 
is being operated as a franchise of the Best Western chain. About 
70 per cent of its workforce is First Nations people.
<P>
	Most of my comments today have illustrated how land claims 
can contribute to the development of aboriginal economies. But 
resolution of land claims is also vital to non-aboriginal peoples 
since it creates a climate of certainty and often leads to economic 
spin-offs in neighbouring non-aboriginal communities, as well as 
many jobs for non-aboriginal people.
<P>
	Strengthening aboriginal communities provides new 
opportunities and wealth creation possibilities for all Canadians. It 
has been estimated that if aboriginal people were to achieve the 
employment and wage parity with other Canadians by the year 
2000 it would boost our gross domestic product by a whopping 2.3 
per cent. A stronger First Nations community means stronger 
regional economies and a stronger country.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Hon. members can rest assured that this government will 
continue to support business and economic development initiatives 
among aboriginal people. We will do so not simply for the 
economic benefits but as a litmus test of our beliefs in fairness, 
justice, and equality of opportunity, as we stated in the red book.
<P>
	Over the years we have not paid the attention we ought to 
allowing aboriginal people to fully participate in the Canadian 
economy. We have not paid attention to the great opportunities we 
can experience by everybody working together. When we treat all 
people in this land with dignity and with respect, when we work 
together, when we do not see the colour of a person's skin, when we 
do not see the race of a person, when we do not make distinctions 
based on religion, when we reach cross that gulf that has been 
created to share and to work together, it is then that our nation can 
prosper.
<P>
	These are times in which we hear many intolerant statements, 
many hurtful statements. However, these are times when we must 
be all the more vigilant in our fight for equality and dignity for all 
people.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to point out the 
economic gains that could be made for all people by settling some 
long-unfinished business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>
<P>
	<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to hear people from all walks 
of life supporting land claims. I consider this a misnomer, but it is 
called land claims today. As far as we are concerned, we are not 
claiming the land; the land is already ours. For lack of a better 
word, we call it land claims.
<P>
	I would like to comment briefly and then ask a question of the 
hon. member. There was some question about what the legal basis 
is for the B.C. Treaty Commission. The B.C. Treaty Commission is 
presently acting as an agent within the authority of the three 
parties, which are of course the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, the provincial government, and the 
aboriginal people. In order to obtain funding for negotiations, the 
government had to seek the necessary appropriations from 
Parliament, which it has done. To allay the fears that there is no 
legal basis for the commission, we can rest assured the commission 
does have a legal basis.
<P>
	I will return to the land claims issue in British Columbia and 
some of the issues the hon. member was talking about. One thing 
we have managed to achieve in a very short space of time as 
aboriginal people is to establish that we are a force to be reckoned 
with. People with little tolerance for aboriginal issues have a 
problem with the existence of land claims.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	It was not so long ago that a previous prime minister of our party 
questioned that very thing but quickly turned around and realized 
that we do have a basis for land claims. The Right Hon. Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau questioned that in the early 1960s but realized that 
we did have a basis for recognition of aboriginal rights. Since then 
it has been acknowledged that there is indeed a basis for the 
negotiation of land claims.
<P>
	In the past, aboriginal people have always been at a disadvantage 
in that it seemed we did not have anything to negotiate with, 
whereas the government had everything at their disposal to 
negotiate with. Too late for a lot of us, we realized we had a lot 
more to negotiate with than we thought. There was no clear 
definition of who owned the land and held the title. As a result, a 
recognition of the fact that we were here precipitated the land 
claims negotiations in the 1970s. Today we have settled quite a 
number of those negotiations and are continuing to settle them.
<P>
	Now we are just starting on British Columbia, which is only 
right. They are long overdue for justice. I must question whether 
justice will ever really be served at this late date to the aboriginal 
peoples of British Columbia because of other interests and the 
agreement beforehand of not dealing with privately owned lands. I 
have to wonder about all this.
<P>
	I was just wondering if the hon. member could elaborate a little 
more on what his role was as the former chair of the aboriginal 
affairs committee. How did he see the positive benefits of land 
claims as relates to the aboriginal peoples across the land, more so 
maybe in the province of Saskatchewan.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15688"> 15688 </A></B>
<P>
	I was in a conference this morning where they were discussing 
aboriginal forestry. I must admit that my knowledge of forestry 
is somewhat limited. I have very little knowledge of trees. Ask 
me about snow and how to define snow in 25 different ways and 
I can do that, but forestry is not my area of expertise. It looked 
like a very good program that was going on where they wanted 
to have joint ventures and co-management.
<P>
	I was just wondering if the member might elaborate a little more 
on what co-management or joint venture in Saskatchewan is and 
whether it is in his area of expertise as a result of his chairmanship 
of the aboriginal affairs committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. parliamentary 
secretary for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development for his question.
<P>
	In my experience, we are just seeing for the first time the effects 
of land entitlement settlements upon the people of Saskatchewan. 
This is a result of longstanding grievances between First Nations 
and the government. Approximately 26 First Nations signed land 
entitlement projects, which compensated them for land that was not 
allocated to them at the time of the signing of the treaty but which 
should have been.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	I believe it is a very positive development in Saskatchewan. I 
believe there will be a lot of economic development projects. These 
economic development projects will benefit both the aboriginal 
and non-aboriginal communities.
<P>
	Within Saskatchewan we have to learn to better live together and 
work together. As in other places, we see that there can be 
intolerant attitudes expressed from time to time. However, in 
Saskatchewan nobody is going away. The aboriginal people will be 
there in the future and the non-aboriginal people will be there in the 
future. We must learn to get along and work together.
<P>
	When people begin to see the benefits of the land claims 
settlements to the economy in general there will be an acceptance 
of the process. We will learn that what benefits one group in 
Saskatchewan will benefit all. When one group succeeds we all 
succeed.
<P>
	In the area of resource management, we need to see that all 
people will begin to respect one another and will be able to sit 
down at the table to learn to work together and respect each other. 
We must not say things that can inflame the situation. We must 
work together so that all people will live together with mutual 
respect and dignity, now and in the years to come.
<P>
	We must learn to live together and work together. The land 
claims settlements, as well as a number of other initiatives, will 
give us the opportunity to do so. We need to ensure that all people 
will strive for peace and will work together in mutual respect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Loney (Edmonton North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased and honoured to be able to stand in the House today to 
speak on the British Columbia Treaty Commission and its second 
annual report.
<P>
	The report, released June 27, 1995, and tabled in the House on 
October 19 by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, cites the participation of the majority of First 
Nations in British Columbia and the progress being made at several 
negotiating tables as evidence that this voluntary treaty making 
process is working. In the four months since the report was 
released, significant progress has been made in the negotiation of 
treaties in British Columbia.
<P>
	When the report was released, 43 First Nations, representing 
approximately 65 per cent of the First Nations population in British 
Columbia, had entered the six-stage treaty process. By October 20, 
1995, the number of First Nations participating in the process had 
increased to 47, representing over 70 per cent of the First Nations 
population.
<P>
	In June seven First Nations had progressed to stage three 
framework agreement negotiations. Framework agreements have 
now been signed by the first four nations: the Champagne Aishihik, 
the Gitksan, the Wet'suwet'en, and the Sechelt. These First Nations 
are involved in stage four of the process, the negotiation of an 
agreement in principle.
<P>
	Framework agreements have been initialled with three other 
First Nations: the Teslin and Tlingit Council, Gitanyow Hereditary 
Chiefs, and the Ditidaht First Nation.
<P>
	Stage three framework negotiations are in progress with four 
First Nations: the Kaska Dene Council, the Lheit Lit'en First 
Nation, the Squamish First Nation, and the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal 
Council.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	The British Columbia treaty commissioners have made several 
recommendations relative to the challenges being faced in the 
process. They recommended that the principals and the parties to 
the negotiations continue to commit extraordinary effort to public 
information and that principals take a greater role in public 
education on a province-wide, regional and local basis.
<P>
	The commission notes that in its first annual report it was critical 
of the principals for not fulfilling their obligation to inform the 
public. It adds that since then substantial progress has been made in 
the area of public information. The principals have made 
considerable effort to inform the public about the process and the 
issues, all in a spirit of openness.
<P>
	Another of the commission's recommendations centres on the 
necessity of both levels of government to make full use of their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15689"> 15689 </A></B>
<P>
consultation processes so that the community at large will be 
confident that its voices are heard and its concerns are considered.
<P>
	The province-wide treaty negotiations advisory committee 
meets on a regular basis to provide advice to both the federal and 
provincial governments on sectorial issues such as fisheries, 
energy, petroleum and mineral resources; lands and forests; 
wildlife and governance. Regional advisory committees are being 
organized at the local or regional level in areas where First Nations 
are entering the treaty process. The government is committed to a 
consultation process that works effectively. Such a process is 
critical to the success of the treaty making process.
<P>
	In this year's report the commissioners also recommend that an 
interim measures agreement be negotiated in a meaningful and 
timely manner so that the treaty negotiation process is not 
undermined. Interim measures are of critical importance to First 
Nations and should be included as a necessary element in a 
co-ordinated treaty making process. Interim measures should 
provide First Nations with adequate protection of their affected 
interests until a treaty is in place, thus avoiding the necessity of 
litigation.
<P>
	The federal government is prepared to consider requests for 
interim measures where the issues are critical to concluding the 
treaties. The commissioners recommended that the principals 
review the current funding program to ensure that First Nations 
have adequate funds to prepare for and carry out negotiations and 
to enable the commission to carry out its responsibilities in 
allocating funds in a fair, independent and effective manner. The 
issue of funding is under review by the principals.
<P>
	The commissioners also recommended that the principals 
address ways to effectively manage a treaty making process where 
more than 43 First Nations will be involved in negotiations. This 
issue has become even more critical to the principals as there are 
now 47 First Nations involved in the process. The principals are 
involved in discussions with each other and with the commission to 
find creative ways to manage these complex negotiations while 
respecting the right of all 196 First Nations in British Columbia to 
participate in this historic treaty making process.
<P>
	I am pleased to report that the implementation of the 
commissioners' sixth and final recommendation is nearing 
completion with the introduction of Bill C-107, the British 
Columbia Treaty Commission Act, in the House on Wednesday, 
October 18, 1995. The enactment of the bill, together with the 
resolution of the First Nations Summit and the provincial Treaty 
Commission Act, will formally establish the British Columbia 
Treaty Commission as a legal entity.
<P>
	Chief Commissioner Alec Robertson, Q.C., and Commissioners 
Barbara Owl Fisher, Will Battam and Peter Elugzik continue the 
work begun by their  predecessors in fulfilling the commission's 
role as the keeper of the process. Miles Richardson was recently 
nominated by the First Nations Summit to replace Carol T.
<P>
Corcoran, one of the original commissioners. These individuals are 
to be thanked for their dedication and perseverance during these 
trying times. This is a new process and they have worked long and 
hard to ensure that the process will work.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	During the first year of operation the commission's emphasis 
was on accepting First Nations into the process. As the parties 
move into framework and agreement in principle negotiations, the 
commission's role will be focused on monitoring and facilitating 
progress.
<P>
	The commission and the government are committed to the treaty 
making process and to doing everything possible to ensure that it 
carries the people of the province of British Columbia into the next 
century with healthier communities and more productive 
relationships.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I said earlier, it is always a pleasure to listen to people who 
have some understanding but also support the aboriginal people.
<P>
	In the long run land claims is a misnomer. I guess the whole 
issue evolved because of the fact that all of a sudden more people 
were here than had been previously, since 1492. Prior to that we 
had been a stable population.
<P>
	Christopher Columbus came over in 1492, which reminds me of 
a joke that should not be taken seriously. Dick Gregory, a comedian 
born in 1932, said: ``You have to say this for the white race. Its 
self-confidence knows no bounds. Who else could go to a small 
island in the south Pacific where there is no poverty, no crime, no 
unemployment, no war and no worry and call it a primitive 
society?'' Basically the same thing happened here when 
Christopher Columbus arrived.
<P>
	However the reality is that this is 1995. We have gone through a 
lot of changes over the years. Now I think we are finally getting the 
recognition that should have been there right from the beginning.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member on the British Columbia 
Treaty Commission. What will the B.C. treaty commission do to 
ensure that all British Columbians are informed of the treaty 
negotiation process?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loney:</B> Mr. Speaker, in reply to the hon. member's question, 
as part of its duties the British Columbia Treaty Commission is 
responsible for the provision of a  public record on negotiations. 
The commission is required to report annually to the legislature, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15690"> 15690 </A></B>
<P>
Parliament and the First Nations Summit on the progress of the 
negotiations.
<P>
	Recently the commission released its second annual report to the 
principals detailing the progress of the negotiations. I have 
encouraged the new commissioners to play a larger role in 
informing the public on treaty negotiation issues.
<P>
	In addition, a number of other steps have been taken to ensure 
that the treaty negotiation process is accessible and open to all 
British Columbians. These steps would include establishment of 
regionally based advisory committees, public forums, regional 
information meetings, a toll free phone number and brochures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the last few years the public information programs 
developed around the treaty negotiation process have expanded 
from public forums and open houses to include a wide range of 
different activities covering the province. It is a fantastic positive 
model, one that reaches into every home, every community, every 
institution within each and every one of the communities in 
question.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	I commend the government for introducing a model of that 
nature. All parties to treaty negotiations in British Columbia place 
a high priority on effective public information. That is the key to 
success.
<P>
	Without information we operate in darkness, in ignorance. 
Decisions are made without the proper facts, without the proper 
support systems, without the proper introduction of the major 
parties concerned in helping to bring about the most effective 
decision that will cater to the needs of all parties concerned.
<P>
	There are many opportunities for the public to learn about treaty 
negotiations and the treaty making process. These opportunities are 
being provided through activities undertaken provincially, 
regionally and locally. To date this government and the other 
governments involved are doing a fantastic job in notifying all 
parties concerned of the process and where, when and why 
activities must take place.
<P>
	At the provincial level the tripartite public education committee 
or TPEC takes the lead. The committee consists of members 
representing the three principals who are representatives of the 
Canadian government, representatives of the province of British 
Columbia and the First Nations Summit.
<P>
	For clarification purposes I would like to read from the act what 
we mean by the summit:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Summit means the body that is established to represent the First Nations in British 
Columbia that agree to participate in the process provided for in the agreement to 
facilitate the  negotiations of treaties among First Nations, Her Majesty in right of 
Canada and Her Majesty in right of British Columbia.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	At the provincial level TPEC's primary objective is to plan, 
organize and implement province-wide public education programs 
on treaty negotiations.
<P>
	I digress. Later in my presentation I will discuss the value of the 
process introduced in the province of British Columbia.
<P>
	At the outset of the treaty negotiation process in 1994 the 
strategy developed by TPEC focused on holding public forums in 
communities around the province. Between June 1994 and today a 
total of fourteen forums have been held in British Columbia; five 
on Vancouver Island in Port Hardy, Nanaimo, Campbell River, Port 
Alberni and Victoria; three in the north in Prince Rupert, Smithers 
and Prince George; one in Cariboo-Chilcotin in Williams Lake; 
one in the Kootenays in Cranbrook; one in the interior in Kelowna; 
one on the sunshine coast in Powell River; and two in the lower 
mainland in Chilliwack and Vancouver. Two more forums will be 
held within the next few weeks in the lower mainland, one in 
Richmond and one in Delta.
<P>
	The fact that so many have already taken place shows that the 
model is a dynamic one. We are reaching the people we should be 
reaching.
<P>
	These community events begin with an informal open house 
where the public is able to view displays and videos, pick up 
information and speak one on one with negotiators. The open house 
is followed by a forum, a formal panel discussion involving not 
only the principles of negotiation but also the B.C. Treaty 
Commission and the local first nation. After the presentations the 
floor is open to questions from the audience. The forums are 
moderated by a high profile member of the community. This is a 
dynamic community interacting model.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	The critical and most crucial facets are where the individual who 
has a concern can come to the public meeting, identify with one of 
the leaders or one of the representatives of TPEC and discuss on a 
personal basis problems, issues or concerns relating to problem 
that will be discussed in the general meeting.
<P>
	Then follows information. The information giving process is 
critical. It is absolutely essential that information at this stage be 
given in a very objective manner, that it is clean, precise, not 
nebulous, not sweeping generalizations. The facts must be given as 
we know them in the real world.
<P>
	Because three parties are involved in this process and because 
community representatives and community leaders are there from 
all facets of the community, the chances of success of giving a very 
accurate, true picture of whatever the scenario might be is far 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15691"> 15691 </A></B>
<P>
greater than having a bureaucrat come in from Ottawa or from 
Victoria to make a presentation on behalf of the  governments in 
question or even a First Nations representative making a 
presentation on behalf of all First Nations people in British 
Columbia.
<P>
	We know from research that if all parties do not get involved in 
the decision making and searching for information processes, the 
picture will be tainted, tainted because a person at the top, if he has 
the responsibility for giving the information, has a very slim 
chance of presenting a real picture of what is happening at the 
grassroots.
<P>
	Let me give an idea of what I am talking about here using a board 
of education as an example. It could be any institution we have 
created in the country. The chief executive officer will have a chain 
of command. The information will be coming from the grassroots 
up this chain to the office of the chief executive officer. The chief 
executive officer is paid a very grand salary and is responsible for 
all operations within his institution which might encompass 
thousands of people. He is responsible for their behaviour and 
actions and the outcome. Do you think for one moment that chief 
executive officer will be presented a true, accurate picture of what 
is happening at the grassroots? Of course not.
<P>
	All research reveals that as information flows upward to the 
pinnacle, to the top of the pyramid, it slowly but surely takes on a 
new meaning, a new perspective, a new perception. Whatever the 
motivation might be, whatever the reasons might be, the 
information reaching the top is not the truth. This is one of the 
major reasons why this model introduced by the government of 
British Columbia has all the partners and all of the participants 
partaking in a variety of ways with a multitude of strategies. They 
are contributing at the grassroots and affecting the people who are 
making the decisions at the top end as well as middle management. 
This model is dynamic. It is one of the most fruitful models we 
have at the present time in our democratic society.
<P>
	These community events begin with an informal open house. 
This is crucial. People must come into an atmosphere and 
environment where they feel at ease. It has to feel as if they are 
coming into a family reunion where they can openly and honestly 
discuss their concerns and perceptions with each other. It must not 
have the atmosphere of a formal meeting dictated and controlled by 
one chairperson.
<P>
	After the presentation, the floor is open to questions from the 
audience. That is another crucial stage of this process. The people 
that are asking the questions may not have the same perception as a 
chairperson or any other of the major players has in this session. 
The person asking the question may have a completely different 
background which in turn affects how he or she perceives what is 
being presented in this meeting. If this person's perception is off 
balance or it is not in harmony with the perceptions and actual 
concepts that are being presented  by the leaders of these groups 
then I think we have a problem.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	However, in this model the people who are responding to the 
concerns and to the questions must have the background to 
understand the people who are asking the questions. It is absolutely 
essential that in this model we have representatives of the First 
Nations people who have a very in depth, comprehensive 
understanding of what this treaty and this model are all about and 
what the process is all about.
<P>
	I would rather see someone from the First Nations who is 
capable of handling that role presenting an information package or 
responses to questions raised by First Nations people than someone 
coming from the department of Indian affairs in Ottawa telling the 
people in British Columbia that this is the way it is and these are 
the answers to the questions.
<P>
	My perception will never be the same, no matter how long I 
work with First Nations people. I could work with them for years 
and I would never have the same type of perception of any situation 
as they have simply because I have not been raised in that culture. I 
have not been raised in their environment. Therefore, their 
experiences would be far different from mine.
<P>
	The forums are moderated by a high profile member of the 
community. As more First Nations groups move into stages three 
and four of the treaty process, TPEC is expanding its activities to 
include issue oriented forums, with more focus on what is 
happening at the negotiating table and workshops for the media. 
The first media workshop was held in Nanaimo last week and was 
extremely well received.
<P>
	A second level of public information activity takes place at the 
regional and local level. As part of the readiness preparations, the 
three negotiating parties establish a tripartite public information 
working group to support the negotiations. This is critical. We may 
have some of the most dynamic, shattering, exciting, zestful kind 
of experiences within that public forum but if the information that 
is being shared and generated is not shared with other people in the 
community who could not be in that public hall, all is in vain. All 
we are doing it helping to develop a gap between those who know 
and those who do not know.
<P>
	Therefore, it becomes much more difficult to convince the 
public who do not have the first hand knowledge to really and truly 
comprehend what is going on. If they are making judgments based 
on ignorance then we have trouble. We then have negative 
reactions to anything that is being proposed in the media.
<P>
	It is critical how the information is handled, the media that is 
involved, their perceptions and the kind of interpretations they 
give.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15692"> 15692 </A></B>
<P>
	This working group develops a strategy, an action plan for the 
negotiation and takes responsibility for implementing the plan in 
the communities which fall within the traditional territories. It is 
extremely important to realize that these people must have an 
awareness of the communities in question. The model they might 
introduce to a community like Nanaimo may not not be exactly 
the same as the one they might introduce in a community like 
Powell River. They must have a knowledge and understanding of 
the people involved in each of the communities. What are the 
concerns in that community? What are the things people are 
saying in coffee shops? What are they saying on the reserves?
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	What kind of reaction are we getting to things we have already 
done? What kind of feedback are we getting from the major players 
from what we have done in the past? All of this has to be taken into 
consideration in making a global perception of the community 
where we are going to present this information package, or become 
involved in a process with the three partners and other members of 
the community.
<P>
	A variety of initiatives have been implemented throughout the 
province. Some examples of programs include resource centres 
being established for the community at large on the sunshine coast, 
in Kelowna and in the Cariboo-Chilcotin area. These will be 
located in the local libraries.
<P>
	The libraries will be provided with a set of three binders. One 
contains all information pertaining to the treaty negotiation 
process. I have not seen the binder, but I am hoping that the 
instructions regarding process are clean, clear, concise and 
understandable. The second contains all information specific to the 
negotiations being carried out in that community. The third 
contains all documentation pertaining to the local consultation 
process.
<P>
	Newspaper supplements are being produced in Kelowna, Prince 
George and Williams Lake. These will be inserted into local 
newspapers to provide the widest distribution of information about 
the negotiations to the community. Extra copies will be produced 
for use as handout material at public events.
<P>
	Open houses are held from time to time in each negotiation area 
to allow the public to informally meet with negotiators to discuss 
matters relating to the negotiations. This is dynamic because there 
is no set formula or schedule, but when the need arises within a 
community for an open house it materializes.
<P>
	This is extremely important because when the emotions rise, you 
must strike when the iron is hot. If the people are really agitated 
and very concerned about some issue, they should have an open 
house as quickly as possible if that is a strategy that they feel is 
going to be  the most effective in giving the information to all 
parties concerned.
<P>
	A local organized public forum has been held in Prince Rupert. 
These forums involve not only negotiators, but also members of the 
community to discuss issues in depth. The forums are normally 
taped by the local community cable television stations and 
rebroadcast. We are very fortunate that often the local community 
television stations will rebroadcast some of these events two, three 
or four times at different times of the day to make sure they hit the 
various listening audiences that are available at that time.
<P>
	Information about negotiations is often made available through 
other public events. For example, in the north, information booths 
have been set up at annual trade shows, giving negotiators wide 
exposure to those attending the show. Another example was the 
information booth set up for the Burrard negotiations at weekend 
canoe races and at a shopping mall as part of a week long native 
heritage days event.
<P>
	Those are some examples, but I could go on and on because the 
human mind is a very creative thing. If you take the tethers off the 
human mind and allow it to be free to create, you will find that the 
individuals concerned will come up with a multitude of strategies 
on how to share information with each and every concerned person.
<P>
	The working groups are also actively seeking opportunities for 
negotiators to speak to community groups, such as chambers of 
commerce, municipal councils, unions, churches and business 
groups. All of these activities involve a media component. The 
working groups have developed networks with the local media and 
keep them informed, as well as seeking specific opportunities for 
negotiators to be interviewed by reporters and appear on radio talk 
shows.
<P>
	An important aspect of public information work at the local level 
is developing partnerships and alliances with community groups. 
Efforts are under way on a continuing basis to develop linkages 
with educational institutions, business associations and community 
organizations in an attempt to encourage ongoing dialogue with the 
communities.

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to tell the hon. member that his 
time has expired. Perhaps there will be more in questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
inclined to agree with the member who as I understood it stated that 
we cannot have a true settlement unless the grassroots are 
consulted.
<P>
	The inference I took was that he was saying the grassroots at the 
aboriginal level should be consulted. This is not a criticism; I am 
just stating that I was not at  all clear as to whether he also believed 
as I do that there must be a full consultation process at the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15693"> 15693 </A></B>
<P>
grassroots level with the non-aboriginal community as well and 
that they must be involved in the process.
<P>
	He did refer to partners participating. Again, I agree with that. I 
believe he also mentioned about people making decisions at the top 
end. I suggest to him that the problem with the process as it is 
presently envisioned by the federal Liberal government and by the 
NDP government in British Columbia is that people are going to be 
making decisions at the top end for the non-aboriginal community 
and there is going to be insufficient input from the grassroots, as he 
put it, in the non-aboriginal community.
<P>
	Since coming to Ottawa I have experienced that consultation is a 
word which is frequently used very liberally, if I may use a play on 
words, particularly by the civil service. Consultation really means 
that they are going to go through the process of appearing to 
consult, but after all is said and done, the die is cast and the 
decision has been made.
<P>
	I would assume that the member believes in the equality of all 
Canadians as I do. Everyone of voting age meeting certain 
qualifications should have the right as a Canadian citizen to vote in 
any election. That also obviously extends to the broader issue of the 
equality of all Canadians. I wonder if the member would also agree 
with me that in the same way throughout this process there most 
probably are going to be ratification procedures for the aboriginal 
community which will be one person, one vote.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would agree with my party's position 
that there also must be a ratification procedure which would be 
outside of the ratification by this Chamber or by the legislature in 
Victoria. The ratification procedure should be on the basis of one 
person, one vote for all people in the affected area, be they 
aboriginal or non-aboriginal. This would give us the qualification 
that all people are equal regardless of race, language, creed, colour, 
religion or gender. Would the member agree that in order for this 
process to work we must have one person, one vote by aboriginal 
and non-aboriginal alike in order to have a final and concluding 
settlement of this issue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dromisky:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
questions and his perceptions. I have to agree with him that the 
democratic process is a viable one. All interested and concerned 
parties who in some way will be affected must be involved in the 
process.
<P>
	Because the negotiating process affects all people, it is possible 
that those who are interested and keenly want to become involved 
may do so. They may contribute to the process. That is why I say it 
is extremely important that people at the grassroots level do not shy 
away from the process but contribute to it.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	When it comes to the actual decision making, whether or not a 
vote should be here or a vote should be there, I am not too aware of 
the exact process or the technicalities involved. I am sure that all 
parties concerned will come to some decision as to how it should 
operate. I am sure they have, but I am not aware of the strategy they 
are using at the present time.
<P>
	From what I can gather it is a consultative process, one in which 
consultation takes place with all parties concerned. Information 
flows and decisions are being made in light of the information they 
have generated. Alternatives are carefully examined and some 
consensus must be reached within a legal framework naturally by 
all parties concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a brief supplementary to my 
friend.
<P>
	I wonder if he would give us his personal opinion. In order for us 
to arrive at a proper conclusion to this process as the aboriginal 
community will have one person, one vote, would he agree that the 
non-aboriginal community that is affected by the same process 
should also have one person, one vote? What is his opinion?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dromisky:</B> Mr. Speaker, my opinion is very simple. If the 
issue pertains to a treaty settlement in a particular reserve or area, 
the people involved are the ones who should be making the 
decision. There is no doubt about it.
<P>
	For instance in my own riding in the reserve of Fort William, if 
there is going to be a decision made regarding the reserve's 
boundaries and so forth, the people who are involved in that 
decision making are the ones who are on the reserve and other 
partners. For people who might be affected by the decision who 
live 10, 15, 20 miles away in my opinion I would not expect them 
to be actively taking part and casting a vote.
<P>
	Putting it simply, the people on the reserve are the ones who are 
being affected by the decision. Therefore they must through this 
process and come to some conclusion as to how it is going to be 
decided.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wonder if I might give a lesson to the hon. member 
of the Reform Party on government and land claims.
<P>
	In the aboriginal world, land claims have been going on for some 
time in which a particular group is formed to negotiate. For 
example the Inuit people of the Northwest Territories in the eastern 
Arctic formed an organization called the Tungavik Federation of 
Nunavut which in turn now is called Nunavut Tungavik Inc., to 
negotiate land claims agreements on the Inuit's behalf with the 
Government of Canada. The way the people of Canada, other than 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15694"> 15694 </A></B>
<P>
the Inuit people of the Northwest  Territories, took part was through 
their elected representatives, the Government of Canada and their 
member of Parliament.
<P>
	That is the process that has been used. I guess it is called the 
British parliamentary system where you elect your member of 
Parliament and he or she acts on your behalf.
<P>
	In the aboriginal people's case an organization was appointed. I 
am sure all aboriginal groups across the country have an 
organization, which is negotiating on their behalf and they in turn 
have to ratify whatever is negotiated.
<P>
	The people of Canada or people of a certain region, such as the 
people of British Columbia, will be represented by their elected 
representatives, whether it is the member of the provincial 
legislature or the member of Parliament for that particular region.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member might care to expand a little more 
on how the information should be disseminated to the public at 
large about the British Columbia Treaty Commission so that the 
people of British Columbia because they feel involved in it will 
feel that they have a role to play in the whole process.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dromisky:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have already given some 
information regarding process. As many strategies as possible must 
be created to inform the public. It may be costly. It may be time 
consuming. It may be consuming in terms of human resources and 
so forth, but it is absolutely essential for developing the proper 
mental state, perceptions and so forth that as much information be 
given to all members of the adjacent community as well as the First 
Nations people.
<P>
	I am sure that in the hon. member's communities as well as in a 
great number of communities with all the modern technology we 
have, with the creative individuals who exist in each community, 
we could come up with a multitude of very effective information 
giving and information sharing strategies.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
support Bill C-107, the British Columbia Treaty Commission.
<P>
	As many members are aware, the process of treaty making in 
British Columbia includes important third party consultations. In 
July 1993 the federal and provincial governments announced the 
establishment of the Treaty Negotiation Advisory Committee, 
TNAC. This is a 31 member organization that is divided into four 
sectoral advisory groups dealing with lands and forests, wildlife, 
fisheries and governance.
<P>
	Each sectoral committee has completed interest papers which 
give an overview of the impact of treaties on their economic 
resource used and regulatory requirements. There have been 
several common interests identified.  These include the need for 
certainty in treaty settlement, assured access to land base, fair and 
affordable agreements and avoiding impact on the existing 
employment base in smaller communities.
<P>
	TNAC members ensure that the interests and expertise of major 
industries, business, labour, environment and outdoor recreation 
groups and local governments are understood and are taken into 
consideration in treaty negotiations.
<P>
	TNAC advises governments on broad province-wide concerns 
and provides a forum for the provision of detailed information for 
discussion.
<P>
	The process aspect of treaty negotiations has also received 
considerable attention from TNAC members and their demands for

	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the residents of Hamilton Mountain are very concerned about the 
referendum campaign in Quebec.
<P>
	In countless conversations with my constituents many have 
expressed a strong desire to see Canada remain united. They want 
Quebecers to remain within Canada so that they do not lose the 
benefits of belonging to one of the world's most prosperous and 
successful countries. We want them as members of the Canadian 
family to enjoy all the privileges that entails.
<P>
	As a united country, we have managed to build a prosperous and 
progressive society. Both Canada and Quebec are better off united.

	On behalf of the residents of Hamilton Mountain, I would like to

to pay tribute to Roger Bernard who, with the help of his organizer, 
Mr. Robert Feeney, was able to accumulate over 60,000 signatures 
in support of Canadian unity.
<P>
	Mr. Bernard began a 23-day journey on July 1 of this year

	Mr. Bernard collected these signatures on a long trip spent

Quebec who are going through a period that is critical for their 
future. My riding, Timiskaming-French River, is on the Quebec 
border, and 30 per cent of the residents are francophones.
<P>
	Since time immemorial, people in Northern Ontario and 
Northern Quebec have done business with each other. Strong ties of 
friendship have developed between these two regions. There is no 
doubt that if Quebec separates from the rest of Canada, we would 
see a considerable decline in the level of interprovincial trade. 
Quebec's separation would also have a devastating impact on what 
now constitutes Canada's strength: our  trade, our economy, our 
national and international relations and especially our two cultures.
<P>
	Dear friends and neighbours in Quebec, there are no problems 
we cannot solve in order to build this beautiful country together. So 
on October 30, decide to grow with Canada and say no to 
separation.

	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois gives us a false impression of its interest in the situation 
of francophones outside Quebec. Compare the insincerity of its 
comments on the decline of francophones outside Quebec with the 
following statement sent by the mayor of Whitby to the mayor of 
Longueuil, as part of an exchange of letters between the two twin 
cities. It indicates that francophones outside Quebec have not been 
assimilated and have contributed to the education of dynamic 
communities.
<P>
	As Mayor Edwards said: ``I can assure you of the fond 
admiration and deep attachment felt by all citizens who have taken 
part in twinning activities since 1969, for our friends and 
colleagues in the city of Longueuil; I am convinced that the feeling 
is mutual.
<P>
	In Whitby, there are tangible and permanent signs of these 
exchanges which gladden my heart. From my window, for instance, 
I see Longueuil Park. A little to the north, Charles Garnier school is 
under construction, a school for French immersion which reminds 
us of the presence and growth of francophone communities in our 
country''.

open to cultural diversity, as are the thousands of voters in the

	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Helen Betty Osborne, a 19-year-old Métis girl, was 
brutally murdered in 1971 in The Pas, Manitoba. Sixteen years 
later Dwayne Archie Johnston was the only person convicted for 
the crime and sentenced to a life sentence with no eligibility of 
parole for ten years. An aboriginal justice inquiry also determined 
that the murder was clearly motivated by racism.

	Today, only seven years after his conviction, Mr. Johnston is out 
on day parole and can enjoy his weekends outside the prison. 
Newspaper reports state that there are a number of serious factual 
errors in the parole board's file on Mr. Johnston and that he 
``narrated his version of events in an emotionally flat, bland

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the following is a comment that was made in May 
1990 on the Prime Minister of Canada's position with respect to 
Quebec. It was said that ``For a year he has made political hay at 
the expense of Quebecers by telling English Canada that there 
would be no problem in Quebec if the Meech Lake Accord failed''.
<P>
	And who was the author of this commentary? A sovereignist? 
Not in the least. It was the present Minister of Finance who was 
denouncing the intransigence of the Prime Minister of Canada with 
regard to the demands of Quebec.
<P>
	It is all very well for the Prime Minister of Canada to try to 
rewrite history, casting himself in the role of Captain Quebec, but 
Quebecers remember that the person who was pulling the strings to 
make Meech fail in its attempt to meet the minimal demands of 
Quebec to reintegrate the Canadian Constitution was none other 
than the ``little guy from Shawinigan''.

hands of the man who, to again quote his Minister of Finance,

the separatist platform represents for francophones in other

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, francophones outside Quebec continued throughout the 
weekend to react to the intolerable comments made by the Bloc 
member from Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
	We all remember that last week, the Bloc member said in the 
House, and I quote: ``According to Statistics Canada, there are one 
million francophones outside Quebec, but just 640,000 speak 
French. They have been assimilated-the francophones-poof!'' 
she said, making fun of us francophones outside Quebec.
<P>

française de l'Alberta said, and I quote: ``The future of 
francophones in Alberta is more  promising than ever before''. Mr. 
Arès

<P>
was referring, for instance, to a commitment by Premier Ralph 
Klein regarding school governance by Franco-Albertans.
<P>
	Francophones across Canada, including those in Quebec, feel 
insulted. As Murray Maltais said in <I>Le Droit</I>, referring to the hon.

always think about what she says''.

Speaker, on October 16 I attended the funeral of a great Canadian, 
my friend Gaston Tremblay, whom I always knew as Gus, a native 
of Quebec.
<P>
	Gus retired to my riding in 1984 after a distinguished career in 
the RCMP. Gus had a talent for numbers, which he used as an 
RCMP auditor but also as a volunteer treasurer for many 
community organizations, including the Royal Canadian Legion 
and the Reform Party as my official agent during the election 
campaign. He attained a high rank in the Knights of Columbus and 
was past president of both the RCMP Veterans Association and 
Gateby intermediate care facilities.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	His talent with numbers gave him special insight regarding our 
national debt and as treasurer of any group he guarded their every 
dollar. Gus was a man of passionate convictions. He dearly loved 
his country and rejected the idea of hyphenated Canadians.
<P>
	I extend my sympathies to his family and join them in their grief. 
Gus Tremblay, my friend, will be sorely missed.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, after an 
urgent appeal from the chair of the No committee, Mr. Daniel 
Johnson, who asked him to announce his position on the issues of 
distinct society, veto rights and elimination of overlap, the Prime 
Minister of Canada, after humiliating his ally, Daniel Johnson, in 
New York by refusing to do so, finally agreed to issue a joint 
statement with Mr. Johnson dealing only with distinct society, and I 
will quote part of the statement:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We remind you that we have both supported the inclusion of this principle in 
the Canadian Constitution every time Quebec has demanded it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. What explanation does the minister have for the fact that 
the Prime Minister claims he has always supported the principle of 
a distinct society every time Quebec has demanded it, although he 
fought with such tenacity against the Meech Lake Accord which 
contained a significant definition of distinct society?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, I would appreciate it if you 
would make both your questions and your answers a little shorter.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I think if anyone reads the last paragraph of the statement, 
he will know exactly what the situation is, without the 
embellishments added by the hon. member for Roberval. I will read 
the last paragraph of the statement issued jointly by the chair of the 
No committee and the Prime Minister of Canada:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We state unequivocally that Quebec is a distinct society. We remind you that 
we have both supported the inclusion of this principle in the Canadian 
Constitution every time Quebec has demanded it. We have not changed our 
opinion on this subject and we always maintain our support for this fundamental 
Canadian reality. We have supported it in the past; we support it today and we 
will support it in the future, in all circumstances.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a clear-cut position; it indicates exactly what the No 
committee and the Prime Minister of Canada believe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, would the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs acknowledge that when the 
Prime Minister of Canada says that he has supported in the past, 
supports today and will support in the future, in all circumstances, 
the distinct identity of Quebec society, he is referring to the concept 
of distinct society in the Charlottetown Accord, a concept that was 
meaningless, being subordinate to the equality of the provinces, a 
concept that was rejected by Quebecers, and that the Prime 
Minister has always been opposed to the concept of distinct society 
as defined in the Meech Lake Accord?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the answer is no, and once again we must emphasize that 
the question on October 30 will be about the separation of Quebec 
from Canada.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois wants to separate Quebec from Canada. As 
for Mr. Parizeau, when the distinct society concept was raised with 
him, his comment was: ``I do not give a damn about distinct 
society, I do not want it''. That is what he said. And he is the leader 
of the Yes committee, while we have always insisted it was 
possible to be both a Quebecer and a Canadian and that it is in the 
best interests of Quebecers to remain in Canada in order to make 
the changes that are needed.

<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs knows perfectly well it is 
unconscionable for the Prime Minister of Canada to tell his ally, the 
head of the No committee, that the distinct identity of Quebec 
society will certainly not be enshrined in the Canadian constitution.
<P>
	Will the minister at least admit that the reason the Prime 
Minister will not include this distinct identity in the Canadian 
constitution is that he ran his campaign for the leadership of the 
Liberal Party on an anti-Meech Lake platform, so much so that the 
then Minister of Finance said in <I>Le Devoir</I> on March 9, 1990: 
``Jean Chrétien is about to destroy forever the credibility of the 
Liberals in Quebec''? Would he agree the Minister of Finance was 
right?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for the Bloc Quebecois does a poor job, 
as he often does, unfortunately, of presenting the position of the 
Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	In his speech in Quebec City last Thursday, the Prime Minister 
said: ``Quebec is a distinct society because of its language, culture 
and institutions''. Those who were opposed to change in recent 
years were the members of the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti 
Quebecois.
<P>
	We should remember that the Parti Quebecois not only rejected 
the changes proposed in the Charlottetown Accord but also 
campaigned to ensure that Quebec would not have the powers and 
jurisdictions included in Charlottetown.
<P>
	We must set the record straight. Those who are in favour of 
continuing change and development in Canada and Quebec and 
who support the best interests of Quebec are not those who want to 
break up the country and separate Quebec, with all the negative 
consequences that would ensue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the joint statement issued by the Prime Minister of 
Canada and the leader of the No side on the weekend in an effort to 
cover up the deep division between them, they say that they have 
not changed their minds about the distinct society and that they still 
believe this basic Canadian reality should be acknowledged.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs admit honestly 
that the real position on the notion of a distinct society is the one 
expressed by the Prime Minister on September 11, 1995, when he 
said that there was absolutely no need to enshrine in the 
constitution the fact that Quebec francophones are distinct from 
other Canadians. Dixit Jean Chrétien.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not going to repeat the last paragraph of the 
statement again, because the answer is the same.
<P>
	However, what is important to see is that the official opposition 
is trying to shift attention away from the real issue of the 
referendum debate. In the referendum debate, the Bloc Quebecois 
and the Parti Quebecois want to separate Quebec from Canada. 
Their aim is not a partnership, as Mr. Bouchard has finally agreed. 
Their aim is not a distinct society either. These are empty 
questions, because Mr. Parizeau has clearly indicated that he could 
not care less about a distinct society.
<P>
	Their aim is to separate Quebec from Canada, and they will be 
responsible for breaking up Canada and causing the ensuing 
negative effects for Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would ask the minister how Quebecers can trust the 
Prime Minister of Canada when he claims to be in favour of the 
concept of a distinct society when we know those who made him 
head of the party, like Clyde Wells, are completely and 
unconditionally opposed to a distinct society-thank you Clyde, 
we remember-and will never permit the Prime Minister to go 
back on a commitment he made in the leadership race, which he 
won specifically because he was opposed to the Meech Lake 
Accord, unlike the present Minister of Finance, who was in favour.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, I would ask you to not use 
the name of any member who has sat here in this House and to 
always use their title as minister, if that is the case, or of leader of 
the opposition, rather than using their name.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what counts at the moment is finding out which option 
will enable Quebec to best cope with the problems of the world to 
come. The Prime Minister of Canada agreed with Charlottetown, 
which contained a whole series of measures that would have 
enabled Quebec to acquire certain jurisdictions it wanted. The Parti 
Quebecois was the one opposed.
<P>
	The option that will enable Quebec to continue to develop and 
cope with its problems in the future is the option that implies that 
Quebec will remain in Canada, where it has developed 
harmoniously for 128 years and that it will continue its quiet 
revolution within the constitution. I would point out that the first 
quiet revolution took place while Quebec came under the 
constitution.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to change the subject from constitutional ills to the 
over-riding economic interests of all Canadians, including 
Quebecers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. The minister will 
know that the Canadian dollar is continuing to fall today in 
international markets.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> I know the Bloc does not take this 
matter seriously but I would like to ask the question anyway.
<P>
	International investors know that the prospects of a yes vote do 
not mean a new and better economic union between Quebec and the 
other provinces but the end of the economic union we have today.
<P>
	What measures has the minister taken to assure the international 
financial community that Canada will fulfil all the financial 
obligations it has contracted on behalf of all Canadians including 
Quebecers and that it will fulfil these obligations regardless of the 
outcome of the Quebec referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has 
asked two questions.
<P>
	In terms of the first one on the value of the dollar, as the hon. 
member knows Canada has a floating exchange rate. Under those 
circumstances the value of the dollar is established by the markets. 
When the occasion requires, the Bank of Canada will intervene to 
ensure there are orderly markets.
<P>
	On the second question relating to Canada's obligations, I am 
very confident international and domestic markets are completely 
assured that Canada will under all circumstances fulfil its 
obligations.
<P>
	However I should like to take advantage of the question asked by 
the hon. member to reaffirm, without any hesitation and without 
any equivocation, that Canada stands 100 per cent, four square 
behind all its obligations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to a recent article in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> the Minister of 
Finance made reference to the fact that the premier of Quebec, Mr. 
Parizeau, acknowledged Quebec's liability for one-quarter of 
Canada's debt in a 1990 speech. This would be consistent with the 
stated desire of the separatist government to use the Canadian 
dollar.
<P>
	Has the minister sought any public reassurance at this time from 
the Government of Quebec to the international financial 
community that it would maintain its full share of Canada's 
financial obligations regardless of the outcome of the Quebec 
referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again the hon. 
member accurately reflects a citation by the current premier of 
Quebec that in the event of separation he felt Quebec's share of the 
national debt should be proportionate to its share of the population, 
i.e. 25 per cent. That is a position that has also been reflected by a 
number of the leading separatist leaders.
<P>
	I think we all understand the tremendous negative consequences 
that would flow from any kind of break up of the country, in turn 
leading as well to negotiations over the debt. That is why I reaffirm 
that it is very clear that what we are dealing with here is not an offer 
of partnership. It is not some kind of an amiable separation. We are 
dealing with the rupture of the country.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	The fact is this debate is about the future of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
speaking of the rupture the minister refers to, he will know that 
during this campaign Mr. Lucien Bouchard, the Leader of the 
Opposition, has indicated that-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I ask you, colleagues, to please refer to either the 
riding or the title of a person rather than their name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Thank you for that reminder, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition has indicated during this campaign 
that Quebec might renege on its share of Canada's debt obligations. 
Of course a statement like that is not at all consistent with the 
stated desire of the Government of Quebec to use the Canadian 
dollar.
<P>
	Has the Minister of Finance sought to reassure international 
financial markets that the Leader of the Opposition is not a member 
of either the Government of Canada or the Government of Quebec 
and may not speak for either in this regard?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first, I think the point 
is a valid one. The Leader of the Opposition will not be speaking 
for anyone in the event of separation; the Premier of Quebec is Mr. 
Parizeau. So, clearly, Mr. Bouchard will be out of things.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Name the riding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin:</B> Ah, yes. No, I did not mention his name.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15701"> 15701 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as regards the use of the Canadian dollar, I think 
the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier of Quebec have 
deliberately created an ambiguity. They talk about using the 
Canadian dollar, and yet, on two occasions-in Ahuntsic, last 
week, and in Portneuf, six or eight months ago-the Leader of 
the Opposition said very clearly that the separatists intended 
giving up the certainty of the Canadian dollar for the uncertainty 
of the Quebec dollar.
<P>
	When we ask ourselves where this double talk is coming from, 
we know very well. Mr. Parizeau wrote in <I>L'Actualité</I> that it was 
simply a ruse, that he intended to favour the Canadian dollar, but 
that, ultimately, he wanted a Quebec dollar.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs.
<P>
	The desperate appeal by the leader of the no side, Daniel 
Johnson, to the Prime Minister of Canada addressed not only the 
distinct society but also Quebec's right of veto and the elimination 
of duplication and overlap between the federal government and the 
Government of Quebec. These elements are covered in the 
document currently being distributed by the no side, via the 
director general of elections.
<P>
	Since the joint document has absolutely nothing to say on the 
question of the right of veto and the elimination of duplication and 
overlap, can the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs tell us 
whether the Prime Minister will give in to Mr. Johnson's plea and 
make his point of view known to the people of Quebec on these two 
issues before the 30th?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the official opposition is clearly attempting to cloud the 
issue; it is spreading ideas that are totally contrary to reality. On the 
question of a distinct society, the leader of the no committee and 
the Prime Minister have stated their position very clearly.
<P>
	In the case of the right to veto, the no manifesto is clear, and the 
Prime Minister has also indicated that the entire membership of the 
no side approves. But the problem we are facing now in the 
referendum is that the official opposition is attempting to make 
people believe that the referendum is about something other than 
separation. That is why we must repeat again and again that what 
the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois are attempting to do, 
what their leaders clearly state as their intention, is to separate 
Quebec from Canada. There is no other truth, and the opposition's 
questions are aimed at having Quebecers believe something that 
does not correspond to reality. The issue is separation.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the chair of the no committee has been very clear in 
making this urgent appeal for the Prime Minister to make his point 
of view known on the distinct society, the right of veto and the 
elimination of duplication and overlap before October 30, Daniel 
Johnson has said so himself.
<P>
	Why does the government persist in concealing its true 
intentions from Quebecers? What more is there that you want to 
conceal from Quebecers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, unfortunately, when it comes to concealing things from 
Quebecers, I believe that we have said, and have proof of having 
said, what was going to happen; it is the members of the opposition 
who have tried to make Quebecers believe that partnership is 
possible.
<P>
	It is the members of the opposition who have tried to make 
people believe that a large number of Quebecers could retain their 
Canadian passports. And it is the members of the opposition too 
who are trying to convince people that it will be possible for 
Quebecers to keep the Canadian dollar.
<P>
	I would submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that it is the members of the 
opposition who are trying to invent stories, tell stories, fairy tales, 
to the people of Quebec. I repeat, October 30 is about separation. 
That is what the leaders of the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc 
Quebecois are saying and it is the truth.

Mr. Speaker, Canadians would hope that this is an isolated incident. 
Unfortunately, it is not.
<P>
	Access to information documents show that Rear Admiral 
Keller, who is currently the chief of financial services at NDHQ,

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	Last spring, the Prime Minister mentioned that one of the ways 
to eliminate duplication by Quebec and Ottawa would be to let 
Ottawa collect all taxes from Quebecers. Last week, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs again suggested this as a way to eliminate 
duplication.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs tell us whether 
the Prime Minister or the minister himself or his colleagues 
discussed with Daniel Johnson the approach suggested by the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs for reducing duplication, in other 
words, to have all taxes payable by Quebecers collected by the 
federal government and to close the Travail Québec centres?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as far as duplication is concerned, I think what we must 
consider here is whether both parties are acting in good faith when 
they want to negotiate agreements to eliminate overlap.
<P>
	I may point out that before the Parti Quebecois was elected, we 
had signed twelve agreements with the province of Quebec to 
eliminate duplication. We have signed a total of 64 such 
agreements with the other provinces. However, since the Parti 
Quebecois was elected on September 12, no agreements 
concerning duplication have been negotiated.
<P>
	My point is that the Parti Quebecois has shown it did not have 
the slightest interest in reducing overlap of any kind because, as 
Mr. Parizeau pointed out, it is not interested in making federalism 
work. It wants to get out. That is their goal, that is what they want 
to do, and that is what they are working for.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, would 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs acknowledge that the last 
federal proposal on eliminating duplication and overlap was an 
agreement on manpower which was turned down by Daniel 
Johnson, the Premier at the time, and by the present Minister of 
Labour, who both called this agreement unsatisfactory?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, what the Quebec Minister of Labour called the agreement 
does not alter the facts.
<P>
	The facts are that the federal government offered to transfer to 
the provinces, including the province of Quebec, all spending on 
educational institutions in the provinces, including both programs 
and money. The province of Quebec turned down this offer and in 
my opinion proved once again they did not want to negotiate any 
accommodation with the federal government.
<P>
	We are prepared to make certain accommodations, but they are 
only interested in separation.

	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
government has a long history of using tax dollars to fund 
megaprojects that end up costing us billions. Petro-Canada is just 
one example.
<P>
	Now the Chinese premier has visited Canada and walked away 
with another megaproject deal. The government is planning to use 
the Canada account to finance Atomic Energy's sale of two 
CANDU reactors to China.
<P>
	Does the government not realize it is broke? Does it not realize 
Canada cannot afford to finance a dime, never mind several billion 
dollars worth of taxpayers' money on this sale?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
ought to take pride in export sales of Canadian technologies. These 
sales are done on a basis that will provide the maximum amount of 
returns to the Canadian public. I can assure the hon. member this 
will be the case here.
<P>
	The Chinese market, I do not need to remind anybody, is a very 
important market and is one that is growing at considerable length. 
It is important that this country establish itself.
<P>
	On the first point regarding Petro-Canada, thanks to the minister 
of energy and mines we have completed the most successful 
privatization of almost any western country in the past decade.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
they gave it away.
<P>
	My supplemental is to the Minister of Natural Resources, since 
that is who was quoted here. I quote that minister even further: 
``The Canadian government will no longer be in the business of 
negotiating massive support packages for energy megaprojects''. If 
we are not subsidizing megaprojects at home any more, why are we 
considering doing it overseas where the risk to the taxpayer is even 
greater?
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me point out to the hon. member that export 
financing is a normal part of doing business in this country and in 
most other countries.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance has pointed out in relation to Candu 
technology, we have technology which is second to none in the 
world. We want that technology to help solve the energy problems 
of nations such as China. If we are going to compete with other 
nations in relation  to that technology, it is important to provide 
export financing.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	Last week, the deputy chair of the no committee, Ms. Lisa 
Frulla, demanded that Ottawa withdraw completely from the area 
of culture, declaring that Ottawa had no business interfering in this 
area of exclusive Quebec jurisdiction.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs tell us whether it 
is his feeling that, in the field of culture as in the other questions 
raised by Daniel Johnson, Quebecers will be given no response 
before October 30?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, all of the questions by the Official Opposition are along 
the same lines and our response is that the federation, that Canada, 
has been very flexible in the past.
<P>
	It has allowed the province of Quebec, like the other provinces, 
to acquire a considerable amount of power, even spending power. 
In the sixties, the federal government had around 60 per cent of the 
spending power, and now it is the provinces and municipalities 
which have more than that 60 per cent.
<P>
	The immigration agreement is one that was signed without any 
constitutional amendment. It is totally possible to settle the 
problems that exist without constitutional amendments. And if I 
may remind the Opposition of one final point, it is they who 
refused to allow Quebec the decentralization contained in the 
Charlottetown accord, while the Prime Minister approved it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> A supplementary 
question, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs expect the 
people of Quebec to think that there would be a place for Quebec in 
his Canada after a no in the referendum, when we are familiar with 
the points of view of his Prime Minister's best buddies, Clyde 
Wells and Roy Romanow, and when we know that his Prime 
Minister systematically refuses to give any hope whatsoever and 
any response whatsoever to the pleadings of his allies on the no 
side?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, there has always been a  place in my heart, in my soul, in 
my 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15704"> 15704 </A></B>
<P>
intellect, for Quebec as a part of Canada, because it is within 
Canada that Quebec succeeded in developing the world's best 
standard of living.
<P>
	It is within Canada that Quebec and the people of Quebec have 
succeeded in attaining a level of democracy unequalled anywhere 
in the world. In what country in the world could there be a leader of 
the opposition with the right to speak out in the House on what he 
sees as the future of Canada as an entity?
<P>
	I am proud to belong to a country with such democratic values. I 
am proud to belong to a country which values sharing as Canada 
does. I am proud to belong to a country which redistributes the 
wealth of advantaged provinces to the least advantaged. And for 
these reasons, the men and women of Quebec will vote no in the 
referendum on October 30.

	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the health care system is a source of great pride for 
Canadians all across the country. It is an important component of 
our nation's identity. The constituents of 
Bramalea-Gore-Malton and indeed all Canadians are worried 
that their health care benefits may be reduced or eliminated.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	Will the health minister assure Canadians that the basic 
principles of the health care system will never be abandoned by this 
government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
during the last election, this party committed to preserve the 
universal medicare system which all Canadians enjoy. We said we 
would also preserve the five principles of the Canada Health Act, 
but that we would work as active partners in order to make our 
health care system more efficient and more effective to address 
changing realities.
<P>
	We also said that we would not support a system which offered 
better quality or faster access for rich Canadians versus the rest of 
Canadians. We have acted on this. That is what the October 15 
deadline was all about. Canadians from coast to coast, wherever 
they live can rest assured that this government will continue to 
protect and enhance our health care system.

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	The minister has stated before in the House that he supports 
uniformity of gasoline standards between Canada and the United 
States. As the minister is aware, this past Friday the U.S. Court of 
Appeals ruled in favour of Ethyl Corporation to sell the gasoline 
additive MMT in the U.S. This is the same substance this 
government wants to ban.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that in view of the U.S. decision this 
government has no reason to ban MMT in Canadian gasoline, a 
substance that makes cars run cleaner?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure the hon. member has a relatively recent model of motor 
vehicle. Mine is rather old. He should know that all the motor 
vehicle manufacturers, North American as well as Japanese have 
told us that the diagnostic systems in the new vehicles are put at 
risk by MMT. Consequently, warranties will not be respected by 
the manufacturers where MMT is used in the fuel.
<P>
	This is the purpose of the gasoline. That is why it is made. That 
is what it is used for. Surely to goodness the hon. member would 
like to ensure that the industry has the opportunity to respond if 
indeed the determination in the U.S. continues to hold. In fact, at 
this time MMT is not available in fuel in the United States.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Reform has long pushed this government to conduct 
independent scientific tests on MMT, yet our view is scoffed at. 
Legislation to ban is now known not to have been based on good 
science at all. Obviously, the decision was politically partisan 
rather than to help the environment.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Industry admit that Reform was right all 
along? Will he admit that there should have been independent tests 
before trying to ban it, a ban that now appears to be completely 
useless in view of the minister's harmonization goals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not know where the hon. member stands except awfully close to 
the petroleum companies on this particular issue.
<P>
	I can tell him where we stand. We stand with the consumers. We 
stand with the people who are purchasing the vehicles that are 
using the fuel. We stand with the people who are looking to have 
their warranties respected. We need to have standards that are 
consistent north and south of the border. They are not right; they 
are wrong. Let them talk to the makers of the vehicles.

<B><A NAME="15705"> 15705 </A></B>
<P>
that federal buildings in the Outaouais area and elsewhere in 
Quebec would remain federal property until negotiations on them 
were concluded.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	Will the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs acknowledge as 
well that common sense and reason along with the rules and 
practices of international law in the matter of state succession 
provide very clearly that, when sovereignty is proclaimed, all of 
the assets of the federal government located on Quebec territory 
automatically become the property of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I see the opposition is opinionated, not to mention hard of 
hearing. This is the sort of question that makes it hard to 
concentrate on the goal of the referendum. The goal of the 
referendum is as follows: ``Do you want to separate from 
Canada?'' This is the question. All the rest are hypothetical 
questions, which have no bearing.
<P>
	In the present matter, once again, we must not get carried away 
with marginal issues. What those of us on the no side want is for 
Quebecers to remain in the federation, because it is in their interest 
and in Canadians' interest for them to do so and this is why we are 
going to vote no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would point out 
to the minister that we are talking about what he said himself. So if 
there is a diversion, he is the cause of it.
<P>
	As Quebec has paid for over 20 per cent of all federal assets in 
the rest of Canada and abroad, will the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs acknowledge that Quebec will be 
entitled as well to its share in the ownership of these other federal 
assets and this is why Canada will hasten to negotiate a quick and 
equitable division the day after the referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the statement I made is true, it speaks for itself and it 
stands. What is important is that, in the last week of the 
referendum, we can no longer divert Quebecers' attention onto 
such matters, we must concentrate on the basic issue, because a 
third of the voters in Quebec still believe they will continue to 
remain in Canada, even if they say yes. This is wrong. Quebecers 
must know the truth, and the truth is that separation will mean they 
can no longer live in Canada.

Saskatchewan, was my opponent in the last federal election. Guess 
what? He has been appointed to the National Parole Board. On a 
daily basis, that is more lucrative work than being an MP. It pays to 
be a loser if you are a Liberal.
<P>
	Can the solicitor general describe to the House the rigorous 
selection and screening process used to assess the qualifications of 
appointees to these plum positions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the position was the subject of a public advertisement. Candidates 
submitted applications. The applications were reviewed by the 
chair of the parole board who carried out an interview process and

merit that the decision was made.

Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	At the recent Beijing conference the government committed 
itself to implementing gender based analysis throughout federal 
departments and agencies. The need for this analysis is to 
determine the different social and economic impacts that 
government policies will have on women and men.
<P>
	Will his department ensure that full gender based studies in 
matters relating to his next budget will be undertaken and tabled in 
the House when the next budget is delivered?

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as indicated by the 
hon. member, the Secretary of State for the Status of Women 
unveiled a new policy on gender analysis which was very highly 
applauded by all of the countries that were there.
<P>
	In the past, individual budget decisions have been studied for 
their impact on women. It is therefore a major step forward that 
now each and every government department must look within its 
own decision making process to make sure no decisions are taken 
that are hostile to women. It is the view of the government that all

	<B>The Speaker:</B> This morning the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan rose on a point of order relating to Standing 
Order 45 and the timing of the deferred vote scheduled for 5.30 
p.m. this day.
<P>
	His argument is that this vote should have been scheduled for 
6.30 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 45(6)(a), when a vote is 
deferred on a Thursday.
<P>
	The hon. parliamentary secretary to the government House 
leader counter-argued that Standing Order 45(5)(a)(ii) allows the 
chief government whip to designate another time than the ordinary 
hour of adjournment so long as he does not set the vote down for a 
Friday.
<P>
	I have reviewed the matter and find that the wording of Standing 
Order 45(6)(a) is very specific. It reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A division deferred on Thursday is not held on Friday, but is instead deferred to 
the next sitting day, at the ordinary hour of daily adjournment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Because of this very specific wording I can only conclude that 
the hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan has a point. Standing 
Order 45(6)(a) clearly states what is to happen when a deferral of a 
division is requested on a Thursday and a Friday.
<P>
	The hon. parliamentary secretary to the government House 
leader did allude to a possible incongruity between the two 
standing orders. He may wish to pursue that aspect with the 
committee that he so ably chairs.

	For now, and until the House changes the wording of the

	The hon. member has asked if he can rise on a point of 
clarification. If an hon. member wants clarification I will be very 
happy to speak with him or her in my chambers. I find that I am 
being asked more and more for clarification of decisions that I have

	With regard to the points that come up I beg that you give me 
latitude so I can carry out question period in a judicious manner. Of 
course a point of clarification can be raised but many times when a 
point is raised I am led into hypothetical cases which could be

points to be clarified about a particular decision I will be happy to 
speak to you in my chambers about it. When we keep having these

every single day of the week rather than the ambiguity which some 
could perceive as being in the rules at the present time.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, it is my understanding that if the 
whips of the major parties agree that the vote will be at 5.30, which 
I presume is the agreement reached, I do not have to ask for 
unanimous consent of the House.

but that the vote is going to be at 5.30 and that is so ordered.

initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
considering the very unfortunate events that have taken place on 
the lower mainland relative to the murder of a young lady and other 
events relating to that, it is very timely that I received in my office 
today a petition to return the rights to the citizens from criminals.
<P>

	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36 I have a petition to present on behalf 
of my constituents.
<P>
	It has been traditional that the Government of Canada divide the 
national defence related furniture moving business among local 
independent movers on an equitable basis, which policy has 
provided excellent service at reasonable rates.
<P>
	The petitioners pray and call upon Parliament to resolve to veto 
any proposed change to the present tendering process of the 
Department of National Defence and to support the present system 
of tendering.

	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to present a petition on behalf of Surrey North constituents and 
other Canadians. There are about 400 signatures.
<P>
	The constituents draw attention to the record of the merchant 
navy in World War II as the fourth arm of the armed forces and call 
upon the government for benefits similar to those enjoyed by 
veterans.
<P>
	It is also my hope that the government will follow through on its 
commitment to recognize veteran merchant seamen who were put 
in harm's way due to the war.

	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two 
sets of petitions to present. The first group of petitioners, some 63 
of them, is saying that the cutting of old growth forests diminishes 
the national diversity of our environment, our country, our culture 
and our people.
<P>
	The petitioners request that Parliament order an immediate 
moratorium on the cutting of old growth forest reserves to promote 
the policy internationally.

	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the second 
petition is from 94 petitioners who say that job experience is a vital

influence all aspects of business potential.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners request that Parliament increase the 
co-operative aspect between productive business enterprises and 
education systems.

	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
before me a petition that has been signed by 424 people.
<P>
	These people are very concerned that high risk offenders upon 
their release from prison are more and more frequently committing 
crimes that result in serious personal injury.
<P>
	The petitioners believe that there would be fewer such incidents 
if Parliament would enact legislation permitting the use of 
post-sentence detention orders. Specifically the petitioners request 
that Parliament pass Bill C-240 dealing with high risk offenders.

have three petitions to present, two of which concern the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>

	The second petition was occasioned by the violent death in my 
riding of Mr. Louis Ambas and the petitioners are primarily from 
my riding.
<P>
	They pray and request that Parliament amend the Young

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BRITISHCOLUMBIATREATYCOMMISSION">BRITISH COLUMBIA TREATY COMMISSION</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-107, 
an act respecting the establishment of the British Columbia Treaty 
Commission, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The member for Edmonton East has the floor and 
has 17 minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rose 
today in support of Bill C-107 respecting the British Columbia 
Treaty Commission and the process that has been developed in 
treaty making in British Columbia which included, specifically, 
third party consultations.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	The process aspect of treaty negotiations has received 
considerable attention from TNAC members. Their  demands for a 
more open negotiation process and less stringent confidentiality 
requirements have really stimulated media interest and some 
public criticism. The government has responded by removing 
TNAC confidentiality requirements. This has improved the 
members' capacity to consult with and to represent their 
organizations more effectively.
<P>
	The provincial minister of aboriginal affairs, the hon. John 
Cashore, attends most of TNAC meetings and the federal minister 
has met with TNAC on four occasions including most meetings 
held so far in 1995. The member of Parliament for Vancouver East 
has agreed to be the personal representative of the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development to TNAC. However I 
will take this opportunity to introduce members of the House to 
some of the people participating in the treaty negotiation advisory 
committee and to the TNAC group.
<P>
	The key treaty negotiation advisory committee member is 
Michael Hunter. He is a representative of the Fisheries Council of 
B.C. He has significant government experience as part of the 
federal team that negotiated the 1985 Canada-U.S. Pacific Salmon 
Treaty. He is a former employee of the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans and has been on the fisheries council for about nine years. 
He has served on numerous fisheries advisory committees as well 
as on international trade consultations. His organization, made up 
of the major fish processing companies, is most concerned with 
ensuring that claims settlements do not create more problems for 
the B.C. commercial fishing industry.
<P>
	Paddy Greene is a lifelong commercial salmon fisherman from 
Prince Rupert. Mr. Greene has also been actively involved in the 
advisory processes of the DFO on fish allocation and fisheries 
management. He has served as commissioner on the Canada-U.S. 
Pacific Salmon Commission and was recently manager of the 
Prince Rupert Fishermen's Co-op. He sits as the northern 
representative on TNAC and chairs the fisheries committee. He has 
been most concerned about the implementation of the DFO's 
aboriginal fisheries strategy and legal sale of aboriginal fish food.
<P>
	Dennis Brown is a representative of the United Fishermen and 
Allied Workers' Union. Mr. Brown has risen through the ranks of 
the union, serving in various capacities including Fraser River 
organizer before becoming an executive member. He has worked 
effectively on easing tensions between commercial fishermen and 
recent Vietnamese entrants. The UFAWU includes both harvesters 
and plant workers, many of whom are native people. The union is 
most concerned about job losses in an already downsized industry. 
He will point to the many aboriginal plant workers and commercial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15710"> 15710 </A></B>
<P>
harvesters as examples of how to create and maintain job 
opportunities for natives.
<P>
	Guy Rose is a representative of the British Columbia 
Cattlemen's Association. Mr. Rose's family has been in  the 
business for three generations. Usually soft spoken, he is concerned 
by the apparent lack of understanding some politicians have 
displayed concerning the impact of claims policies on third parties. 
He perceives that the general population is concerned by the 
generous benefits that may be provided. His group's main concern, 
however, will be continued access to provincial crown land at 
reasonable cost for grazing needs.
<P>
	Susan Anderson, although designated as the alternate for the 
B.C. Federation of Labour, has attended almost all committee 
meetings on behalf of the president, Mr. Ken Georgetti of the B.C. 
Federation of Labour, and is a historic supporter of native rights. 
Ms. Anderson has referred frequently to the need for better 
compensation and adjustment programs for those industries and 
workers affected by claims agreements.
<P>
	Bill Wimpney is a representative of the B.C. Wildlife Federation 
and is outspoken and direct. He is usually constructive and well 
prepared. He is continually mindful of the BCWF members' 
interests. He also chairs the wildlife sectoral advisory committee. 
The BCWF represents about 40,000 anglers, hunters and outdoor 
admirers throughout B.C. Mr. Wimpney has worked on preparing a 
statement on his organization's position on native issues and some 
bottom lines his members expect in negotiations. These relate 
specifically to access, endangered species protection and 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Marlie Beets is the vice-president of aboriginal affairs with the 
Council of Forest Industries and was the former alternate for the 
Cariboo Lumber Manufacturers' Association. She is from 
Williams Lake and has been associated with the forestry industry 
for many years. COFI is most concerned about the further loss of 
harvestable timber resources and has indicated that minimum land 
transfers balanced with a larger cash component would be 
preferable.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Lloyd Whyte represents the interior forest industry coalition, an 
umbrella group for the three interior forestry organizations. He has 
been concerned about the cost sharing formula between Canada 
and B.C. and believes it will provide more land to native people in 
the interior than on the coast. He also chairs the lands and forest 
committee on which he sits as representative for the Cariboo 
Lumber Manufacturers' Association.
<P>
	Ken Sumanik is the representative of the Mining Association of 
B.C. He was the chair of the energy, mines and petroleum resources 
committee. His organization represents large mining and 
exploration operators in B.C. They have indicated they are facing 
serious economic difficulties due to commodity prices and 
environmental standards. The industry is most concerned that 
claim settlements not impede its ability to explore efficiently 
developed mineral deposits. It is not so much concerned about to 
whom royalties are paid as long as the  opportunity remains to 
explore and develop B.C.'s mineral and petroleum resources.
<P>
	Jerry Lampert is president of the B.C. Business Council. He 
recently stepped down as the organization's designated 
representative but usually attends agenda items involving the 
ministers. He was appointed by the B.C. Business Council when 
the respected James Matkin stepped down. Representing a large, 
diverse group of major private sector corporations, the business 
council acts mainly as a group to lobby governments. It will be 
most concerned with ensuring ministerial participation in TNAC 
meetings as the best means of ensuring its views are heard by the 
decision makers. The council also seeks to minimize the impact of 
settlements on B.C. employers by ensuring that the cost of treaty 
settlements does not add to the tax burden of businesses.
<P>
	Dick McMaster is the representative of the Fishing Resort 
Operators Association and the Council of Tourist Associations. Mr. 
McMaster speaks for a growing sector in the B.C. economy. Many 
of the areas seen as ideal for tourism and recreation are also 
priority areas for many claimant groups. Tourism and sport fishing 
operators will seek to ensure their continued access to and use of 
those areas. This includes freshwater fishing and wilderness 
enjoyment. Mr. McMaster has been an active member of the 
committee and frequently participates in committee discussions.
<P>
	At a March 1994 meeting he stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The more economic effort natives are involved in now, the less there will be 
the pressure for more land and cash when treaties are settled.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Although Richard Taylor is an alderman for the Union of British 
Columbia Municipalities he chairs the governance sectoral 
advisory committee. He chaired the early negotiations with the 
government to establish and define a joint third party consultation 
process. He has promoted the UBCM position on the need for local 
governments to be represented or present at the treaty negotiation 
table.
<P>
	These are very respected British Columbians. The Government 
of Canada appreciates the time they have taken from their very 
busy schedules to participate in this very meaningful and important 
consultation process.
<P>
	The job before these people is a great one. They carry the 
responsibility of representing vast interests of B.C.'s economy. 
They are building economic well-being not only for the immediate 
generation but for generations to come. They carry the 
responsibility of representing the vast interests of B.C.'s industry. 
TNAC is an integral part of the process. TNAC will develop 
positive, realistic and fair recommendations to enhance the 
negotiations.
<P>
	The long term success of the process lies with the partners of the 
process. We need to encourage and congratulate all those who will 
participate.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I listened to my colleague from 
Edmonton East I could not help but get a sense of one reason the 
bill was going through the House so quickly and with so much 
co-operation. Obviously it is because of the tremendous team that 
has been put in place and the co-operation the team is bringing 
to the table not only in the sectors of tourism, mining, forestry, 
et cetera, but in all levels of government.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	My community, which is downtown Toronto, is going through a 
very difficult time. The brotherhood of carpenters and joiners, the 
drywall lathing and installation workers, a very large union of 
about 2,800 members, has been on strike on and off since June and 
has voted recently to go on strike. Less than 1,000 members 
decided this. At a time when our economy needs to be working at 
full throttle we have in Toronto a situation in which the leadership 
and the various principals cannot seem to co-operate. The people 
who are affected by this, the thousands, are suffering.
<P>
	Yet here in western Canada we see a beautiful example of all 
levels of government coming together. All the principal 
stakeholders and all the various sectors of the economy have come 
together. We see that a piece of legislation goes through the House 
in no time flat. The community in western Canada and ultimately 
all Canadians will be the beneficiaries.
<P>
	I appeal to the leadership of that very strong union in my city to 
use this example in British Columbia as a possible model on how to 
get all of those people back to work in Toronto.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in 
the debate on second reading of Bill C-107 regarding the 
establishment of the British Columbia Treaty Commission.
<P>
	The negotiation of treaties offers Canadians a chance to look at 
the issue not only from a historical perspective but also from a 
modern reality. The tabling of this legislation on the British 
Columbia Treaty Commission gives us an opportunity to discuss 
the implications and the importance of treaty negotiations in B.C.
<P>
	Members from British Columbia, including my hon. colleague, 
the Minister of National Revenue, understand only too well the 
importance of these negotiations. The history of British Columbia 
and the various interests speak for a process, in a sense beg for a 
process such as this.
<P>
	This legislation reflects not only how current treaty negotiations 
are done but how critical they are. The situation we have today 
regarding negotiations is much different than when the numbered 
treaties on the prairies were settled. It bears discussion on the kind 
of  relationship aboriginal people across the country have with their 
treaties.
<P>
	I stand in the House of Commons as a representative of the 
Government of Canada and as an elected member for my 
constituents. I stand here also as someone whose whole life has 
essentially evolved around the whole issue of treaties in terms of 
the kinds of inalienable rights that aboriginal people have 
discussed, debated and put on their priority list throughout the 
years of discussing the Constitution and land settlements. The 
treaties have always arisen as a major priority.
<P>
	If people have a sense of passion, a sense of direction and vision 
about their interpretation of the treaties, it comes from the fact that 
it is a much analysed subject but also very personal. My 
grandfather who is a chief, Zaul Blondin, was a signatory to Treaty 
11. In that signatory I see many things not just for me but for the 
future of my people. In relation to British Columbia I can see the 
same kind of intent, the same kind of compassion, passion, 
dedication and determination about the process when it relates to 
not just one group but all of the groups. My frame of reference is 
from my experience. My experience is from the perspective of the 
First Nations.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	I know the numbered treaties for the First Nations I referred to in 
my area, 8 and 11 in the Northwest Territories, set a very 
interesting perspective for the future of a people; the Dene people 
guided by these two treaties, the language itself, the immense 
vision by the people who signed those treaties, the people who had 
the vision. It was not colloquial. It was not parochial. It was not odd 
and simple. It was very visionary.
<P>
	This language, as long as the grass grows, as long as the sun 
shines, as long as the rivers flow and as long as this land shall last, 
are not just words. They have given the opportunity for aboriginal 
young people to have post-secondary education. They have given 
the opportunity for people of aboriginal descent, no matter where 
they live and who are treaty, to have accorded to them the 
appropriate health programs and services to deal with taxation 
issues, health issues, hunting and fishing rights and related issues 
and issues still debated like housing. Those issues are being 
constantly debated.
<P>
	The numbered treaties in the prairies were signed in advance of 
settlement. The government of the day sought to ensure that 
certainty and title were confirmed before Europeans settled in what 
are now Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. Although certainty 
was the intention, the issue is yet much debated, the treaty is much 
debated, and most of the results are as of yet lacking definition or 
implementation and are not at all conclusive. That also begs for a 
process and hence we have the British Columbia one.
<P>
	There needs to be certainty. There needs to be very clearly 
spelled out the future for aboriginal people. I have  a document 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15712"> 15712 </A></B>
<P>
called ``Sovereign Injustice-the Forcible Inclusion of the James 
Bay Crees and Cree Territory into a Sovereign Quebec''. On page 5 
it talks about the unilateral alteration of aboriginal treaties:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Existing land claims treaties provide for a permanent federalist arrangement 
and include federal and Quebec governments (as well as aboriginal peoples) as 
parties. How can the PQ government claim it would be legal or legitimate for a 
secessionist Quebec to unilaterally alter existing treaties with aboriginal 
peoples in Quebec? On what basis could Quebec claim it can simply take over 
existing federal treaty obligations and unilaterally determine that the Canadian 
government would no longer be a party to the treaties concerned?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That question has a lot to do with certainty. Aboriginal people 
feel this is their homeland. They have an inalienable right, as my 
colleague from Churchill indicated earlier on in debate, that 
aboriginal people feel they have an inalienable right to this country. 
They cannot be separated from this country because it was the 
creator who put them here. They did not come from somewhere 
else.
<P>
	Treaties have a number of interpretations, some very spiritual. It 
is not only legal analysis, it is also a spiritual commitment, a 
spiritual determination that the aboriginal people have that 
relationship with treaties.
<P>
	In British Columbia the situation was much different. Certainty 
over the land question was never resolved prior to settlement. As a 
result we are now dealing with a situation that presents challenges 
that did not exist at the time the early treaties were concluded. 
Much development has occurred in British Columbia. There has 
not always been that attempt for partnership.
<P>
	In Canada and in the world there are no entities unto themselves 
that feel they can exist without partnership.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	Aboriginal communities understand with good measure what 
there is to be gained from those partnerships and of working 
together with other groups which is happening across the country, 
including in British Columbia, in the Queen Charlotte Islands. In 
the Haida Gwaii we have the first ever bicultural model, a Haida 
Gwaii trust. This is a trust fund between non-aboriginal and 
aboriginal people that resulted from an arrangement that came 
about with the federal government, the provinces, industry, as well 
as the aboriginal peoples themselves.
<P>
	These things can happen but they are not easy. No one will tell 
anyone familiar with the negotiation process that it is simple or 
easy. It is not. However it is necessary. It is necessary to go through 
rough waters. It is necessary to have a dialogue that is challenging.
<P>
	One of these challenges is the need for the government to 
represent third party and public interest at the treaty table. Let me 
put it this way. Those third party interests in terms of the treaty 
negotiation advisory committee are  well represented. The list was 
read previously by the member for Edmonton East. It explained 
there is representation and fairness there. There is nothing secretive 
or conspiratorial. It is an open process and very transparent.
<P>
	Canada recognizes the need to consult with third parties and to 
provide information to the public if treaties are to be lasting and 
beneficial for all Canadians. Some of my colleagues and I have 
spoken on a number of occasions about the importance of an open 
treaty negotiation process. How can we best as a government 
address the challenges in the areas of taxation, health, education, 
justice, policing, hunting and fishing rights, to name a few, in a 
global sense without a proper process?
<P>
	This year this negotiation process will lend to and aid this whole 
situation. Nevertheless, many people continue to falsely believe the 
treaty process in British Columbia is secretive, conspiratorial, that 
the whole truth is not being told and that a special deal is being 
made. This is not the case. This belief has been fostered by a lack of 
awareness, understanding, compassion and sensitivity. If those 
people were as informed as they should be this would not be the 
case.
<P>
	Information is a great enlightener. It pays to read and it pays to 
go to the source to negotiate to be with those people. Go to the 
source and meet with those people. That is what this country is all 
about.
<P>
	The negotiation of treaty under the auspices of the British 
Columbia Treaty Commission process is not one based on 
backroom deals or secrets. The treaty process has never been as 
open and as transparent as it is in British Columbia today.
<P>
	In B.C. we have set in place a province-wide treaty negotiation 
advisory committee made up of 31 organizations representing 
major economic sectors in that province. There was a time when 
this group operated under confidentiality rules. This is not 
uncommon. It happens when people are dealing with issues they 
feel deserve that kind of arrangement.
<P>
	Today, however, when providing advice to the government on 
treaties being negotiated under the B.C. Treaty Commission an 
openness protocol is at work. Many of the recent TNAC sessions 
have had and will likely continue to have media present. How much 
more open can it be?
<P>
	On local and regional levels negotiators meet regularly with 
regional and local advisory committees to discuss the topics being 
addressed at the treaty table. Of course this is part of the 
consultation process and allows public and third party interests 
direct access to the negotiators. That accessibility is one way of 
demonstrating to people that there is not any kind of conspiracy or 
a cover-up. It is a partnership.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15713"> 15713 </A></B>
<P>
	As far as actual treaty table talks, one of the items to be initially 
discussed during the readiness stage is the procedural document 
referred to as the openness protocol.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	These openness protocols have been agreed upon by the three 
parties at the table, the federal and provincial governments and the 
First Nations. Many of the treaty table members of the public and 
third party advisory committees can, if they so desire, attend and 
observe main table negotiation sessions. So it is open and people 
are welcome to attend.
<P>
	I know of one instance, the Sechelt treaty negotiations, where 
negotiation sessions are videotaped and replayed on the local cable 
station. I cannot imagine a more open process than that. I was in 
Sechelt in my previous incarnation, if I might, as the critic for the 
aboriginal portfolio for the Liberal Party. Their process on 
self-government, which is renowned throughout Canada and the 
world, has also been very open. The Sechelt people do not have 
anything to hide. They have a lot to be proud of and a lot to share, 
and they do.
<P>
	I assure members the public has not been shut out of the process; 
rather, it has been invited in and encouraged to attend. We are well 
aware the treaty process cannot happen in a vacuum. The public 
and third parties need to know about and be involved in the process. 
We encourage their input and involvement.
<P>
	This is a fairer process, much more acceptable than the kind of 
imposing process previously engaged in. Now it tends to be more 
of a partnership, one of equality. Maybe that is what is so 
objectionable to some.
<P>
	There are many threads the negotiation teams need to weave 
together for the modern treaty process to work, including 
representing the Canadian public and federal government at the 
treaty table, balancing effective negotiations with openness, 
ensuring the consultation process is an accountable one, and 
providing the public and media with timely information. Under the 
B.C. Treaty Commission process all of these threads are coming 
together. We are only at the beginning of the process, but we are 
moving toward strengthening the social, economic, and legal fabric 
of British Columbia with regard to land claims.
<P>
	In Canada the treaty process has a past that forms an integral part 
of our history. It has a present. Many of us here in the House of 
Commons have seen the passage of modern treaties, as in the James 
Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement and the Inuvialuit Final 
Agreement. It has a future through the passage of legislation 
establishing the B.C. Treaty Commission and the negotiation and 
settlement of treaties under its auspices. That is why I am here 
today, to help usher in Bill C-107 and to ensure the job of treaty 
negotiations can continue in the province of B.C. so these 
negotiations can ultimately reach a successful conclusion.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that treaty making is a world-known 
process. Treaty making is done between nations. Treaty making is 
done between various groups. It is an honourable process. It is not a 
process that begs criticism or any kind of misunderstanding. It is an 
honourable process. It is a process that will allow partnerships to 
develop. It is generally a process of honour that when you have 
made a treaty it will in fact help to deal with some of the tougher 
questions governments have to deal with. It solidifies for 
governments, for communities, for peoples the programs and 
services. The arrangements that are made become clearer. They 
should, anyway.
<P>
	In the myriad of claims and the whole conglomeration of land 
questions regarding title in British Columbia, with the whole issue 
of hunting and fishing, fishing rights and the Sparrow case, let us 
hope this process will lend some clarity, some definition, some 
partnership that will allow these groups to come to some 
conclusion and reach some of the results that have long been sought 
after and long wanted.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
believe I have two questions for the hon. member. One is in relation 
to the time element here.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	We know this process has been going on for a considerable 
amount of time. The only reference I noted concerning time, which 
I believe was in the agreement of September 22, which this bill is 
based on, was in relation to funding, where it said ``the first five 
years''. Does the hon. member foresee this as a long, ongoing 
process again, or do we have a five-year or ten-year objective here?
<P>
	My second question relates to the bill. I think in clause 3 it 
actually says that the commission will assess the readiness of the 
principals to participate in the negotiations. What kind of authority 
does the word assessment mean? Does it mean they will assess and 
advise the principals that they are ready or not ready, or that they 
will assess and tell the principals that they can or cannot negotiate?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the whole issue of time, 
the only answer I can give is what has been prescribed in the 
working documents of the bill. I believe the member mentioned 
five years. For instance, Treaty 11 goes back to 1921.
<P>
	Each treaty has a life of its own. We should say that the B.C. 
Treaty Commission has been set up to facilitate the negotiation of 
modern treaties in B.C. Once the process is completed the B.C. 
Treaty Commission will no longer be required. The B.C. Treaty 
Commission agreement states that the principals, Canada, B.C., 
and First Nations Summit, ``shall terminate the BCT upon  
completion of their duties under their agreement or where BCT is 
no longer performing its duties''. It is based on whether it is able to 
complete its work or not. Once its mission is completed, then as a 
mechanism the commission will essentially be disbanded.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15714"> 15714 </A></B>
<P>
	The member talked about the authority. I do not have the answer 
to that. I can take it under advisement. I am sure the appropriate 
departmental officials are watching and will be able to get back to 
the member with an answer.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak in this debate on Bill C-107, 
following the member for Western Arctic. She has referred to her 
grandfather, a signer of Treaty 11 in the early 1920s, and talked of 
the passion, vision, and wisdom of the men who signed that treaty. I 
can tell the House and those watching the debate today that those 
qualities are very much in evidence in the granddaughter, in our 
hon. friend the member for Western Arctic. I would like to pay 
tribute to her as my colleague in the House, in caucus, and in 
cabinet for the qualities she brings to issues such as this. She 
contributes so much to assist us in our deliberations. It is indeed a 
pleasure to speak following her in the debate.
<P>
	The events this summer in British Columbia and in Ontario have 
made all members of the House painfully aware of the tension in 
native communities across Canada. This is the result of years of 
injustice and poverty. This government is resolved to overcome 
these problems through the new partnership it envisages with 
Canada's First Nations. One of the first and most important 
unresolved problems in this relationship and in creating a better 
relationship between aboriginal peoples and other Canadians is the 
question of treaties in my home province of British Columbia.
<P>
	I remind the House that British Columbia is unique in Canada, in 
that the process of signing treaties has never been completed. Only 
a handful of treaties were signed in the pre-Confederation period. 
These include the Douglas treaties of southern Vancouver Island, 
the area that includes my riding of Victoria, which indeed were 
signed by Governor Douglas with the First Nations of the area in a 
very farsighted move. And in 1899 Treaty No. 8 was signed with 
the First Nations of the Peace River area in northeastern B.C. 
Generally speaking, British Columbia is without a treaty system. In 
the rest of British Columbia the issue of aboriginal rights remains 
largely unresolved due to hundreds of years of neglect by 
successive colonial, federal, and in particular provincial 
governments.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The First Nations have wanted to resolve these problems. 
Repeatedly they have pressed for treaties, but only in this decade 
did the provincial government have the willingness to negotiate 
with them and with Ottawa. Previously it maintained that there was 
no need to  negotiate and it said that whatever rights to land and 
resources the aboriginal people may once have had were 
extinguished long ago. The result was decades of legal acrimony as 
the First Nations sought settlement through the courts of what they 
were unable to achieve through the negotiations process.
<P>
	I would like to mention in particular one case of great 
importance. In 1973, more than 20 years ago, the Supreme Court of 
Canada was asked in the famous Calder case whether aboriginal 
title to the Nisga'a traditional territory had been extinguished. 
Chief Frank Calder, with whom I had the privilege of sitting in the 
British Columbia legislature and who is now a constituent, a friend, 
and adviser of mine, led the way in achieving recognition of 
aboriginal land title. In that case all six justices accepted that 
aboriginal title had existed in the past. Three ruled that it had been 
extinguished, but three ruled that it was unextinguished and that the 
government was obliged to negotiate treaties.
<P>
	Since then the federal government has accepted the need to 
negotiate treaties in British Columbia. We have been negotiating 
with the Nisga'a people for these last 20 years, but resolution of the 
negotiations was next to impossible without provincial 
participation because of their responsibility under our Constitution 
for crown lands. That changed in 1990, when Jack Weisgerber, who 
was then the minister for aboriginal affairs in the province of 
British Columbia, announced that the province of British Columbia 
was willing to drop its traditional opposition to tripartite 
negotiations. It was this announcement of Mr. Weisgerber, who is 
now the leader of the B.C. Reform Party, that paved the way for the 
B.C. Treaty Commission.
<P>
	I would like also to pay tribute to Mr. Weisgerber's premier at 
the time, Mr. Vander Zalm, who was indeed responsible for this 
major breakthrough in the attitude of the British Columbia 
government toward the question of negotiation with First Nations 
people.
<P>
	Today Mr. Weisgerber is leader of the provincial Reform Party 
and apparently is an opponent of this negotiating process, like his 
federal Reform brethren. I find it sad and ironic that Mr. 
Weisgerber, who should be proud of his role in the historic process 
of resolving this longstanding injustice, is now renouncing what is 
in my mind the finest moment of his political career.
<P>
	I would ask the federal Reform Party to support the old Jack 
Weisgerber, the old Social Credit Jack Weisgerber, who was willing 
to help break a 120-year of pattern of injustice, and not the new 
Reform Jack Weisgerber, who wants to continue with the 19th 
century attitudes into the 21st century.
<P>
	Many critics of this process, including many in this House, have 
emphasized the high costs of settling land claims. Indeed, there 
will be costs. I look at the <I>Sun</I> newspaper of Thursday, October 19, 
where the title on the city and region section says ``$10 billion 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15715"> 15715 </A></B>
<P>
figure  baffles Ottawa''. There is cost to settling land claims. When 
we are trying to settle issues that should have been resolved over a 
century ago, there will be a cost, a cost for long delay as well as the 
cost of the settlement itself. But there are also steep costs if we 
keep putting negotiations off and if we keep putting them off any 
further than now.
<P>
	For example, in 1991 a Price Waterhouse study indicated that 
every year land claims go unsettled in British Columbia the 
province suffers the following consequences. $1 billion in potential 
investment in forestry, mining and other resource sectors is lost. 
Second, 300 jobs which would otherwise be created are not created. 
Third, 1,500 jobs are adversely affected. Fourth, $125 million in 
capital investment is lost or deferred.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	That is the price of inaction as outlined by the Price Waterhouse 
study. It is the price the critics of the process would have us 
continue to pay year after year until eventually it would be the 
courts which would force governments to pay billions more than 
they would have to pay if we settled these negotiations and these 
matters through fair, open negotiations with the First Nations 
people.
<P>
	To help achieve this goal the B.C. Treaty Commission was 
established. It consists of five commissioners, five outstanding 
British Columbians, who represent the interests of all the parties to 
the negotiations. Two of the commissioners are nominated by the 
First Nations Summit, one by the provincial government and one 
by the federal government. The chief commissioner is duly 
selected and appointed by all three of the principals, namely the 
First Nations leadership, the federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	The First Nations Summit includes all the First Nations in B.C. 
which have agreed to participate in the B.C. Treaty Commission's 
six-stage treaty negotiating process. The summit provides a forum 
for First Nations involved in the treaty process to meet and discuss 
negotiations. As one of the principals of the process it continues to 
provide direction along with the governments of B.C. and Canada.
<P>
	Carole Corcoran was elected by the First Nations Summit as one 
of its first treaty commissioners. She also sat on the royal 
commission on Canada's future from 1990 to 1991. She serves on 
the board of governors of the University of Northern British 
Columbia. Unfortunately she had to resign recently.
<P>
	On October 4 the First Nations selected Miles Richardson of 
Haida Gwaii as the second First Nations treaty commissioner. Mr. 
Richardson was a member of the B.C. claims task force which 
reported to the governments of B.C. and Canada and the First 
Nations on how the parties could begin negotiations to build a  new 
relationship. Mr. Richardson's appointment is pending order in 
council approval at this time.
<P>
	The First Nations Summit has also elected as one of its 
commissioners Wilf Adam of the Lake Babine Indian Band. Mr. 
Adam, a former chief councillor of the band, is chairman of the 
Burns Lake Native Development Corporation and is co-founder of 
the Burns Lake law centre.
<P>
	The British Columbia appointee is Barbara Fisher, formerly 
general counsel and Vancouver director of the Office of the 
Ombudsman. She currently practises part time as counsel to the 
B.C. Information and Privacy Commission.
<P>
	Since last April the Government of Canada's representative on 
the commission has been Peter Lusztig, who is a professor of 
finance at the University of British Columbia. He also brings 
considerable breadth of experience from the community, having sat 
on B.C.'s royal commission on automobile insurance and the B.C. 
commission of inquiry into the tree fruit industry. In 1991 he also 
chaired the Asia-Pacific initiative advisory committee which was 
struck by the federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	Since last May the chief commissioner, the fifth commissioner, 
has been Alec Robertson, Q.C. The legal community is familiar 
with his past work as president of the B.C. branch of the Canadian 
Bar Association, as chairman of the Law Foundation of British 
Columbia and as a member of the gender equality task force of the 
Canadian Bar Association.
<P>
	I have given some details of these individuals to show all 
members of the House that the B.C. Treaty Commission consists of 
five distinguished Canadians who are doing their utmost to ensure 
that the comprehensive claims process moves along in a timely and 
orderly manner.
<P>
	It was mentioned earlier that one area where much progress has 
been made is with respect to consultation with the citizens of 
British Columbia and the rest of the country. That is of course 
consultation outside of the responsibilities of the First Nations and 
the two governments.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	One of the recommendations contained in the commission's 
annual report which was tabled in the House last week is: ``Canada 
and British Columbia make full use of their consultative processes 
so that the community at large will be confident that their voices 
are heard and their concerns are considered''. This government 
strongly supports that recommendation. An effective dialogue, an 
effective exchange of accurate information is absolutely essential 
to concluding sound and sustainable treaties in British Columbia.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15716"> 15716 </A></B>
<P>
	Governments are using a number of consultative mechanisms 
to ensure that third parties affected by the treaty process voice 
their perspectives, their concerns, their interests, their ideas. We 
heard from one of the previous speakers on the government side, 
the hon. member for Edmonton West, how the treaty negotiations 
advisory committee provides advice to both governments on 
sectoral issues on a province-wide basis. To ensure that the 
interests of regional parties are being addressed, the negotiating 
teams work with local sectoral groups to form regional advisory 
committees or RACs as they are called.
<P>
	There is an overall umbrella of 31 organizations to which the 
member made reference which cover the general interests of people 
in the province. In addition, there are the local bodies or the 
regional advisory committees. They are formed in areas where 
negotiations are beginning. They include representatives from the 
local non-aboriginal governments as well as from a variety of 
sectors such as industry, business, social services, resources and 
environment.
<P>
	The establishment of a regional advisory committee is one of the 
conditions for the British Columbia Treaty Commission declaring a 
negotiating table ready for negotiations to commence. Eight 
regional advisory committees have been established in 
communities across British Columbia so far.
<P>
	The lower mainland regional advisory committee, which meets 
in Vancouver, provides advice to the provincial and federal teams 
that are or will be negotiating with the Burrard, the Katzie, the 
Musqueam, the Squamish and the Tsawwassen. Issues which are of 
concern to this regional advisory committee include the use of 
federal crown lands, treaty settlements, Stanley Park, taxation and 
provision of services to the aboriginal community.
<P>
	The Bulkley-Skeena regional advisory committee located in 
Smithers provides advice on negotiations with the Gitksan, 
Wet'suwet'en and the Gitanyow. Their concerns centre on the use 
of lands and resources, particularly forest and fish. Governance is 
also an important component.
<P>
	On my own Vancouver Island there are two regional advisory 
committees. The west island RAC in Port Alberni is working with 
the negotiators for the Ditidaht First Nation and the 
Nuu-Chah-Nulth tribal council to ensure that the interests of local 
communities are addressed. Issues such as interim measures, 
fishing, forestry and environmental concerns are being addressed.
<P>
	The south island RAC covers Victoria and extends north to 
Nanaimo. There are currently two First Nations in the first phases 
of the negotiation process, the Temexw and the Nanaimo. As other 
First Nations enter the treaty process, this regional advisory 
committee will be expanded to include representatives from 
additional interest groups.
<P>
	There are others. There are a total of eight in other parts of the 
province. I will not go into each one in turn but to say that the 
overall system of regional advisory committees is well in place. It 
is working well and all local interests in those areas are involved in 
the negotiation process.
<P>
	The regional advisory committee sets its own terms of reference 
including the meeting times, locations, subjects for discussion, 
openness of meetings and membership. The regional advisory 
committees are becoming more active in areas where the parties 
are moving into framework negotiations.
<P>
	Despite the regional advisory committees and despite the 
umbrella organization discussed by my colleague, there have been 
public criticisms of the consultative process. Concerns have been 
raised that the interests of non-aboriginal people were not being 
properly represented at the negotiating table. As has been indicated 
by my colleague from the Western Arctic, this is incorrect. In order 
to dispel many of these concerns, federal and provincial 
representatives have made significant efforts to convey 
information about the treaty process. Local community officials 
are contacted for input on appropriate representative organizations 
for inclusion on any RAC being formed in their area.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The treaty commission process ensures that both the federal and 
provincial governments are responsible for representing the 
non-aboriginal interests at the table. It is the role of both 
governments to listen to all these other interests, to consider their 
positions and their views and to develop a balanced negotiating 
strategy that fairly represents the interests of the communities 
involved, as well as of course the interests of the province as a 
whole and the country as a whole.
<P>
	This government recognizes that the treaty process is important 
to everyone and will affect not only aboriginal people. A 
consultation process that works effectively is critical to the success 
of the treaty making process. The federal government is committed 
to consulting non-aboriginal people and third parties throughout 
the negotiating process.
<P>
	Third party interests have been active in British Columbia 
throughout the treaty negotiations to date. They will continue to 
play an important role as these negotiations progress. The 
challenge before us is to ensure that we continue to develop a new 
relationship that encourages open dialogue and permits us to 
carefully consider all available options.
<P>
	It was a pleasure to rise today to speak in favour of Bill C-107.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have one question of the hon. member which relates to the five 
commissioners.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15717"> 15717 </A></B>
<P>
	I realize the act states in the beginning that it is the chief 
commissioner plus four and there is quite a good dissertation on 
how the four are selected, including the chief. I do not quite 
understand how this fifth one came to be. In that relationship also 
in the term of office, I understand the chief commissioner is a 
three-year term of appointment and the others are for two-year 
terms. Does the hon. member know if there is any number of 
reappointments or consecutive terms, that type of thing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes the fifth commissioner who is 
of course the chair of the representatives, is chosen through 
consultation among the two governments and the First Nations who 
are part of the treaty process. It is done essentially by a consultative 
process and agreement in principle on an individual.
<P>
	That was the case with Chuck Connaghan who served as the first 
chief commissioner and who set up the process. It was also the case 
for Alec Robertson who is currently the chief commissioner.
<P>
	With reference to the period of time, I understand the member is 
correct. There is a set period of two years but reappointment is 
quite in order. If any of the organizations, be it either of the 
governments or the First Nations people, wish to reappoint one of 
their appointees, that is perfectly in order and would happen. It is 
also true that the chief commissioner can be reappointed, although 
I have to say that is my understanding rather than my firm 
knowledge. I will get absolutely accurate information for the hon. 
member.
<P>
	It is important to make sure that in such an organization with five 
people in it we do not come to the end of the period of appointment 
and then start afresh with new commissioners. As the hon. member 
quite correctly pointed out in her question to the hon. member for 
Western Arctic, this is a difficult issue with respect to time. A 
continuity of personnel will be most important in making sure that 
we do not slide backward at any point in the process. I will get the 
actual terms dealing with the period of appointment for the hon. 
member.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak in support of Bill 
C-107 today.
<P>
	In 1990 Price Waterhouse estimated, as the hon. member who 
just spoke indicated, that about $1 billion of expenditures involving 
up to 1,500 jobs in the mining and forestry sector were likely to be 
affected if claims were not resolved. When we hear these numbers 
we must keep in mind that these are only two industry sectors and 
this study was over five years ago. In that report Price Waterhouse 
indicated that comprehensive land claims generate uncertainty for 
companies operating in British Columbia. I will get back to the 
factor of uncertainty.
<P>
	Factors creating uncertainty include right of access to land and 
resources, possibility of production or shipment disruptions 
affecting reliability as suppliers, and possibility of unsatisfactory 
compensation if a company is affected by a land claim settlement.
<P>
	Forestry and mining companies reported that they required a 
premium to invest in British Columbia rather than elsewhere 
because of the uncertainties related to comprehensive claims. 
Currently the premium is generally less than 1 per cent but it is 
expected to rise in the future. As indicated, the economic impact on 
the province of British Columbia is substantial.
<P>
	The report goes on to indicate that uncertainty surrounding 
settlement of the land claims issue will ultimately have an impact 
on the provincial economy. It is estimated that almost $1 billion of 
currently proposed mining and forestry industry investments could 
be affected by the non-settlement of comprehensive land claims, 
although land claims are generally not the only issue to be resolved 
before development can proceed.
<P>
	The economic impacts of such delays or cancellations could be 
summarized as follows: $50 million of capital expenditures could 
be lost each year; $75 million of capital expenditures could be 
delayed resulting in both lost opportunities and continued 
operation of less than efficient plants; and some 100 jobs stand not 
to be created each year because of the economic uncertainty. Such 
loss of growth of primary industry jobs means that the service 
sector will also be impacted and grow more slowly. Using 
generally accepted employment multipliers this is equivalent to a 
further 200 jobs not created throughout the province each year 
which might otherwise materialize.
<P>
	The report indicates based on the projects identified in the 
survey that ultimately some 1,500 permanent jobs could be 
impacted, together with related indirect and induced employment.
<P>
	It is important to refer to particular parts of the report because of 
the details contained therein. It is important to look at different 
aspects. There is reference made to the mining industry. The 
situation is a bit different at the mining development stage. A 
number of the participants indicated that they expected difficulties 
from unsettled land claims. Together the projects the participants 
indicated they had problems with represent about $680 million in 
capital expenditures.
<P>
	Extrapolating the results and analysing expected impacts, Price 
Waterhouse estimated that the mining investment of about $100 
million a year was likely to be affected by uncertainties related to 
comprehensive land claims in British Columbia. This represents 
about 12 per cent of annual private and public capital investment in 
the British Columbia mining industry. Based on the survey results 
about half the projects affected were expected to experience delays 
of about three years. The other half were expected to be cancelled.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15718"> 15718 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Along with these losses one has to look at another ancillary loss, 
legal costs. Comprehensive land claims in British Columbia result 
in legal costs to governments, companies and native organizations 
estimated by Price Waterhouse at about $5 million a year.
<P>
	In 1987, it is important to note, forestry, logging and wood 
products, manufacturing and pulp and paper manufacturing 
accounted for about 30 per cent of the GDP of the goods producing 
industries of the province of British Columbia and about 10 per 
cent of the province's GDP. In 1988 the industry was responsible 
for 87,000 direct permanent jobs representing about 6 per cent of 
total employment in British Columbia. The multiplier effect 
creates at least two more jobs for each direct job. Thus 261,000 
jobs in British Columbia can be attributed to the forestry industry, 
17 per cent of the total provincial workforce.
<P>
	Mining, oil, gas and related manufacturing account for about 15 
per cent of goods producing GDP and about 5 per cent of the 
provincial GDP. This is half the size of the forest industry in terms 
of GDP contribution.
<P>
	We must note the Price Waterhouse study was completed over 
five years ago in March 1990. A lot has happened in the resource 
industry and on the land claims front since that time. However the 
one thing that has remained consistent is the need to establish 
certainty in the province of British Columbia through the 
negotiation and settlement of land claims.
<P>
	The study conducted by Price Waterhouse involved leaders in 
the mining and forestry industries including senior executives, 
presidents and vice-presidents of companies, as well as general 
managers, chief foresters and managers of exploration and 
woodland operations. This is a critical point to understand the real 
impact of the lack of certainty on the land claims front to resource 
development and the impact the study has had in the industry. It 
signals the very broad recognition by industry from the boardrooms 
out to the field. The issue cannot be more emphatic. The settlement 
of land claims is long overdue.
<P>
	Price Waterhouse reported that unresolved, comprehensive land 
claims generate uncertainty to companies operating in British 
Columbia, as I have already mentioned. I will mention it again to 
emphasize it for third party members and get through to them that 
it is an important factor.
<P>
	Factors creating this uncertainty include the right of access to 
land and resources. For these companies the most important factors 
affecting the premium include future uncertainties regarding the 
outcome of injunctions related to land ownership or access, the 
possibility of production disruption, and future considerations 
regarding royalties and taxes.
<P>
	The respondents to the Price Waterhouse survey generally agree 
that companies, employees and governments all pay the cost of 
uncertainty related to comprehensive land claims. The survey 
respondents also agreed that generally the higher cost could not be 
passed on to consumers because the resource sectors in British 
Columbia sell on world markets and are price takers. None of the 
respondents reported having considered compensation for 
comprehensive claims when applying for federal-provincial 
government funding. Very few respondents actually reported 
having applied for government incentive programs in the past.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	These are very real concerns in resource based sectors in the 
province of British Columbia that consequently the economic 
stability not only of that province but the rest of the country as 
well.
<P>
	There has been considerable action on the claims front since the 
study was done. The province of British Columbia has entered into 
the negotiation process and over 47 nation groups in the province 
of British Columbia have submitted statements of intent to 
negotiate.
<P>
	The federal government is committed to resolving the 
uncertainty issues caused by the lack of treaties in B.C. The tabling 
of legislation for the creation of the B.C. Treaty Commission is one 
step toward the resolution of uncertainty.
<P>
	There is no doubt in anyone's mind that the Price Waterhouse 
numbers demonstrate a clear and resounding indication of the 
impacts and the costs associated with not resolving land claims in 
the province of British Columbia.
<P>
	We know we are losing over $1 billion in investment and over 
1,500 jobs in mining and forestry. The door is open to resolve the 
land claims issue, to achieve certainty and to move forward. We 
must act. The opportunity is here today with the B.C. Treaty 
Commission legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's comments with regard to 
the issue.
<P>
	A number of bands in B.C. have not agreed and have refused to 
sign on. They are actually arguing with other bands over who has 
what lands. Yet the member is saying to go ahead and spend the 
money with no commitment from the other bands. I do not 
understand this at all. It will be an ongoing argument between the 
bands and there will be no settlement.
<P>
	He blames this for impeding industry. It will impede industry. I 
will not disagree with that. It will not impede industry as much as 
the government has since it was elected. The government's 
regulations have tied up mining far tighter than any land claim 
agreement. Even the mining and logging industries would agree 
with that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15719"> 15719 </A></B>
<P>
	I fully understand that land tenure is a big problem in Canada. 
However that is into the area of provincial jurisdiction. They are 
trying to put the horse before the cart. It has already taken place 
without the legislation passing through Parliament and I do not 
understand that either. Maybe you can answer some of my 
questions.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I give the floor to the 
hon. member for Saskatoon-Dundurn, I remind members to direct 
questions and comments through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker it is nice to know that members of the 
third party recognize that this uncertainty is having an impact on 
industry in Canada. Hopefully, rather than being critical of what is 
being proposed, the third party will propose whatever it believes 
may be better. If its proposals are better we can discuss them.
<P>
	It is interesting to note the land claims, overlapping claims and 
the problems with them. Of course it is voluntary and entrance is 
voluntary. However it is hoped that as we proceed the parties and 
other groups in British Columbia will see the process is working. 
Since it is voluntary, hopefully other groups that are somewhat 
reluctant will join the program.
<P>
	A step has to be taken. We cannot throw our arms in the air and 
say that we have this problem but will do nothing about it. We 
cannot say that. We have to try to bring the matter to a resolution 
and help industry and people in the province of British Columbia 
and elsewhere in Canada bring the matter to a head. I just wish the 
hon. member had some constructive suggestions on how this 
matter could be dealt with if he is not happy with the process we 
have introduced.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too am very 
pleased to speak to Bill C-107. This is a very important bill and is 
long overdue. However the understanding should be that we are 
now at this stage and let us get on with it.
<P>
	Today marks the culmination of a long and at times very difficult 
struggle. It is born of British Columbia's history and is the product 
of many years of hard work and a lot of acrimonious debate.
<P>
	The issue of aboriginal rights in B.C. has remained unresolved 
for years. The negotiation process has gone on for decades. Many 
people have played a part. Many times the negotiators did not 
understand the cultural differences they were dealing with.
<P>
	My comments this afternoon will be very short. I will address 
only what one company in British Columbia has done to improve 
cross-cultural awareness which not only improves relations but 
improves business for all concerned.
<P>
	Aboriginal and non-aboriginal people often work in the same 
circles in both the private and public sectors, yet the level of 
awareness across cultures is often lower than it should be. 
Misinformation about the culture and beliefs of First Nations can 
create tension within an office and across the boardroom table. This 
tension negatively impacts on interpersonal and business relations.
<P>
	One of the best ways to increase knowledge about First Nations 
is through cross-cultural awareness training. An example of this is 
what I am going to speak about today.
<P>
	B.C. Hydro is a leader in this field. Once B.C. Hydro realized the 
benefits of working with aboriginal peoples it developed the 
aboriginal cross-cultural awareness training program to increase 
employee knowledge of First Nations culture. ``Taking an interest 
in learning about First Nations issues was the first step in 
improving relationships between two cultures,'' says Patrick Kelly, 
training co-ordinator of B.C. Hydro.
<P>
	The program has been so successful it is now offered to 
organizations outside B.C. The hydro program was developed in 
collaboration with aboriginal people and is delivered by First 
Nations people familiar with community, corporate and 
government operations.
<P>
	The program has three levels. Participants start with an 
information session about First Nations history, culture and 
languages. An overview on relationship building and conducting 
business with aboriginal people is also presented. Participants then 
progress to the next level which provides in depth information 
about a specific aboriginal group relevant to the client. The client 
also has the opportunity to acquaint the aboriginal group with its 
structure and interest. The third level of the program includes a 
facilitated face to face meeting between the client and the 
aboriginal group.
<P>
	To date B.C. Hydro has provided training for several 
organizations and businesses such as CN Rail, the Union of B.C. 
Municipalities, the Insurance Corporation of B.C., and the B.C. 
Lottery Corporation. Reaction to the program has been very 
positive. Two CN Rail employees who recently attended the 
session noted that the training will strengthen partnerships with 
First Nations and stimulate new ideas and strategies.
<P>
	Cross-culture awareness training can assist any organization that 
deals with First Nations. Ian Tait, B.C. Hydro's manager of 
business development and communications says: ``In light of the 
current treaty making process in B.C., it has become even more 
important for companies to build stronger relationships with First 
Nations''. I am sure anyone who is wishing to have information on 
this could contact someone at B.C. Hydro with regard to its 
aboriginal cross-culture awareness training program.
<P>
	I have recently been assigned to the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage. If ever we are to have an interest in the heritage 
of this country and who  probably has the most to gain or to lose, 
we certainly have a lot to gain by knowing our aboriginal and our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15720"> 15720 </A></B>
<P>
First Nations people and knowing more about their history and 
their culture. It is important that we understand what their culture is 
and try to work with it. If First Nations would understand our 
culture too, I believe that all in the community would be better 
served and business would be better served.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	My comments are very short. It is only to create awareness, 
which in turn will give better understanding, which will lead to a 
resolution and hopefully, passage of Bill C-107.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind the House that we 
are presently at the last stage of debate on Bill C-107, in which 
members are entitled to a 10-minute maximum intervention 
without questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-107. As a member of the 
Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development, I know the importance of the bill. I will spend a few 
moments talking about the federal government's perspective on the 
B.C. treaty negotiations.
<P>
	The federal government has a dual objective in entering into 
treaty negotiations: to achieve certainty as to the rights and 
obligations of all lands and resource users; and to establish a new 
relationship between First Nations and other citizens. It is 
important as Canada evolves to achieve a better relationship 
between our native people and the rest of Canadians.
<P>
	The interests which Canada brings to the treaty negotiating table 
are outlined in the preliminary document dated June 27, 1995. This 
was prepared by the federal treaty negotiations office.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has primary jurisdiction over issues 
such as financial benefits, governance and fisheries, while in other 
areas such as lands and wildlife it may exercise varying degrees of 
authority. Although the federal government does not have primary 
jurisdiction over all the topics which will be subject to negotiation, 
it has nevertheless declared its interest in every area. Overall, in 
concluding treaties in B.C., Canada's interest is ensuring that 
fairness, affordability, clarity and durability are present.
<P>
	The federal government has also identified its specific interests 
in negotiating the key components of the treaty. Those key 
components are lands and resources, financial benefits and 
governance. Let me outline some of the key elements of each of 
these components.
<P>
	In the area of lands and resources, we want to ensure the 
conservation of resources for the future use and benefit of all 
Canadians. We want to ensure that we promote and integrate a 
co-ordinated approach to land  and resource management. We also 
want to identify and consult with all interested and affected third 
parties and deal with them equitably. We obviously have to respect 
the legal rights of all of our citizens. The promotion of self-reliance 
of the First Nations is important and is one of the reasons I sit on 
the parliamentary committee. Last, with respect to lands and 
resources, we must safeguard Canada's over-arching obligations.
<P>
	In the area of financial benefits, we want to ensure in concluding 
agreements that they are affordable for all Canadians. That is very 
important. I believe we can work together with all parties to make 
sure that happens. We also have to ensure that there is no burden to 
Canada's economy and taxpayers.
<P>
	Most important, we must ensure there is fairness and equity 
among all the treaties concluded in B.C. and elsewhere in Canada. 
That is important for our government. We talked about that in our 
red book, that there be fairness and equity in all of our conclusions 
when we do these treaties. The last and most important one is 
promoting self-reliance in the First Nations communities.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	The main elements in the area of governance are establishing 
new relationships with First Nations. That is an important element 
for us. We are always striving to do that. I am watching this happen 
more and more in my committee. We are looking at it in a 
subcommittee on education of which I am also a member. We are 
looking at how those new relationships can be built so that First 
Nations can take their proper roles in the country.
<P>
	We want to establish clear and harmonious jurisdictional 
arrangements among all levels of government. We also want to 
maintain Canada's over-arching sovereignty and the application of 
the charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	We must make sure that First Nations institutions of government 
are democratic and accountable. This is coming more and more 
into play. Our native people want to be more democratic and 
accountable for their ongoing performance in Canada.
<P>
	We want to recognize the unique needs of various First Nations. 
That is very important as well. There are so many unique needs of 
our First Nations people. Through this treaty and this commission 
those needs, unique as they are, can be highlighted and 
accentuated.
<P>
	The means whereby Canada will achieve its interests will be 
determined through extensive consultations with third parties and 
ultimately through a process of negotiations with the First Nations 
and British Columbia.
<P>
	What is the vision for post-treaty British Columbia? The federal 
government has a vision for British Columbia after treaty 
negotiations have concluded with the province's First Nations. 
Canada seeks a society in  which new relationships are forged with 
First Nations, a relationship obviously based on respect and trust, 
one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15721"> 15721 </A></B>
<P>
that reconciles modern Canadian realities with the traditional 
native aspirations.
<P>
	Although Canada has a vision of what it would like to see at the 
end of the day, there is no prescription to define this new 
relationship. It will be built on a process, that trust I talked about, 
the respect I talked about. That will be negotiated by the three 
parties: the First Nations, Canada and British Columbia.
<P>
	The fundamental elements of Canada's vision for post-treaty 
B.C. include certainty, equity and finality, practical arrangements, 
and opportunities for economic development. That is very 
important because our First Nations are striving to build their 
communities. They are striving to be more independent, but that 
independence can only come if there is economic opportunity and 
development, if native people can forge their design and abilities 
around economic development and make their communities more 
productive. That would give the independence and self-reliance 
which is so important for our First Nations people.
<P>
	We have to make sure that the vision is workable, efficient and 
cost effective with these governance arrangements. What we will 
see in this vision at the end of the day are healthier First Nations. 
Nobody wants that more than the First Nations people themselves.
<P>
	Last, we want more harmonious relations and better neighbours. 
That goes without saying. I am very pleased to have had the 
opportunity to speak on Bill C-107 and, obviously, very pleased to 
support it.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a new member 
of the aboriginal affairs and northern development committee, I am 
pleased to rise and speak on Bill C-107, an act respecting the 
establishment of the British Columbia Treaty Commission.
<P>
	The B.C. treaty commission will be charged with the task of 
facilitating treaty negotiations, including the implementation of the 
inherent right to self-government. The bill will help all of us to 
understand something of the complexity involved in this process 
and something of the patience that is required. It will also help us to 
understand what that elusive phrase ``inherent right to 
self-government'' means.
<P>
	Self-government will be dealt with at the same treaty table as 
other items such as land and resources. The same principles and 
practices of openness which currently characterize the B.C. treaty 
making process will also apply to self-government negotiations.
<P>
	The federal government will not establish additional processes. 
These negotiations will be with the aboriginal groups that are 
involved in the existing treaty process in B.C. As the act outlines, 
the current chief federal  negotiators who work out of the federal 
treaty negotiation office will represent Canada in self-government 
negotiations.
<P>
	The budgets allocated for the B.C. treaty making process and 
managed by the treaty commission will support self-government 
negotiations.
<P>
	It is federal government policy to implement the inherent right 
of aboriginal people to self-government and it will focus on 
reaching practical and workable agreements on how 
self-government will be exercised. Rather than trying to define it in 
abstract terms or through lengthy and costly litigation, while there 
are different views about the nature, scope and content of the 
inherent right, negotiations among governments and aboriginal 
peoples are preferred over litigation. Consultation and 
co-operation, not confrontation.
<P>
	It seems to be without cause for any contradiction that in our 
modern society, and perhaps because we tend to follow practices 
from south of the border, that we are becoming less and less able, 
sometimes in government and civic affairs and interpersonal 
relationships too, to sit down and solve some of these problems 
without the help of high priced lawyers and legal experts. We could 
give many examples of the increasing cost of this sort of thing. 
Many of us have had first hand experience of that. I applaud the 
thrust of this bill.
<P>
	Given the different circumstances of aboriginal peoples, 
implementation of the inherent right cannot be uniform, nor will it 
result in a one size fits all form of self-government. There are 625 
First Nations in Canada and I am sure we would find at least 450 
different interpretations of what the inherent right means, 
depending on whether these are the Crees of northern Quebec or the 
members of Walpole Island or the Sechelt in B.C. Therefore, there 
are 625 negotiations to be completed.
<P>
	It would do us well to remember that for 200 years we have 
treated our aboriginal people in a paternalistic way. They see 
themselves as occupiers of this land before our ancestors arrived. 
They see themselves as people who agreed in a peaceful way to 
share that land with us. All too often our answer, when they were 
outnumbered, was to ignore them completely and push them on to 
the poorest land we could find and call it a reserve.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Self-government arrangements will be tailored to meet the 
unique needs of aboriginal groups and will be responsive to their 
particular political, economic, legal, historical, cultural and social 
circumstances.
<P>
	Let me add that the inherent right of self-government 
immediately does not include a right of sovereignty in the 
international law sense and will not result in sovereign, 
independent aboriginal nation states. On the contrary, 
implementation of self-government should enhance the 
participation of aboriginal people in Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15722"> 15722 </A></B>
<P>
federation  and ensure that aboriginal peoples and their 
governments do not exist in isolation, separate and apart from the 
rest of society.
<P>
	It is envisioned that these agreements about self-government 
will provide for the aboriginal First Nations a form of government 
somewhere between municipal government or provincial 
government where they will have self-government authority over 
the immediate day to day lives of their people and they will have a 
continuing relationship with the federal government.
<P>
	Lest we feel that these things are all going to be done very 
quickly and expeditiously and that Bill C-107 suddenly outlines the 
path before us with sign posts that will be met one after the other, it 
might be wise to summarize some of the subject matter that will be 
open to negotiation in the first instance, in other words the scope of 
these negotiations.
<P>
	They will involve the establishment of governing structures, 
internal constitutions, elections and leadership selection processes; 
membership; marriage; adoption and child welfare; aboriginal 
language, culture and religion; education; health; social services; 
administration and enforcement of aboriginal laws; policing; 
property rights; land management; natural resources management; 
agriculture; hunting, fishing and trapping on aboriginal lands; 
taxation in respect of direct taxes and property taxes of members; 
transfer and management of moneys and group assets; management 
of public works and infrastructure; housing; local transportation; 
licensing, regulation and operation of businesses located on 
aboriginal lands. Subject matters beyond those integral to 
aboriginal culture or strictly internal to an aboriginal group are 
open to negotiation.
<P>
	In these instances, primary law making authority would remain 
with the federal or provincial governments as the case may be and 
would prevail in the event of a conflict with aboriginal laws.
<P>
	These matters need to be understood and negotiated. They would 
include such things as divorce; labour and training; administration 
of justice issues, including matters related to the administration 
and enforcement of laws of other jurisdictions which might include 
certain criminal laws; penitentiaries and parole; environmental 
protection, assessment and pollution prevention; fisheries 
co-management; migratory birds co-management; gaming; and 
emergency preparedness.
<P>
	The third heading is subject matters where it is essential for the 
federal government to retain its law making authority. These are 
grouped under two headings in the act: the powers related to 
Canadian sovereignty, defence and external relations, 
international-diplomatic relations in foreign policy, national 
defence and security, security of national borders and international 
treaty making; immigration, naturalization and aliens;  
international trade, including tariffs and import-export controls.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	Other national interest powers involve the management and 
regulation of the national economy, the maintenance of national 
law and order, the protection of health and safety of all Canadians, 
federal undertakings and other powers including broadcasting and 
telecommunications, aeronautics, navigation and shipping, 
maintenance of national transportation systems, postal service, the 
census and statistics. While law making power in these areas will 
not be the subject of negotiations, the federal government is 
prepared to consider administrative arrangements where feasible 
and appropriate.
<P>
	The policy principles on which self-government negotiations 
will be based are the following: the inherent right is an existing 
aboriginal right under the Canadian Constitution. Self-government 
will be exercised within the existing Canadian Constitution. It 
should enhance the participation of aboriginal peoples in Canadian 
society. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms will apply 
fully to aboriginal governments as it does to other governments in 
Canada.
<P>
	Due to federal fiscal constraints, all federal funding for 
self-government will be achieved through the reallocation of 
existing resources as outlined in the 1995 budget. Where all parties 
agree, rights in self-government agreements may be protected in 
new treaties under section 35 of the Constitution as additions to 
existing treaties or as part of comprehensive land claims 
agreements. Federal, provincial, territorial and aboriginal laws 
must work in harmony. Laws of overriding federal and provincial 
importance such as the Criminal Code will prevail and the interests 
of all Canadians will be taken into account as agreements are 
negotiated.
<P>
	Members have spoken previously about respect and trust which 
are absolutely essential. I suggest another essential element if Bill 
C-107 is going to fulfil its promise and if we are going to get land 
claims on the road to settlement will be patience.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak in support of Bill 
C-107, an act respecting the establishment of the British Columbia 
Treaty Commission.
<P>
	It is important that we go back to the last Parliament when the 
Liberal members from eastern and western Arctic came to the 
House and made sure that parties on both sides of the House were 
fully acquainted with some of the difficulties, frustrations and road 
blocks that our First Nations have had over the years in trying to get 
some of these outstanding treaties resolved.
<P>
	I can reflect back to our very first year as rookie members of 
Parliament. Mr. Speaker, I remember being with you and our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15723"> 15723 </A></B>
<P>
caucus colleagues when we spent a long  weekend in Iqaluit. We 
were all immersed in the community and the culture. Many of us 
realized that old expression ``out of sight, out of mind'' reflected 
what has been going for many years with many of our First Nations 
communities.
<P>
	As I mentioned, the members from the eastern and western 
Arctic urged us on and we as a caucus and now as a government are 
fully participating in ensuring the realization of some of those 
priorities which interest the First Nations are becoming legislation.
<P>
	It is also a tribute to the government, specifically to the minister 
responsible for Indian and northern affairs. As one of our members 
mentioned earlier, some of these issues have been on the books for 
over 100 years. We just keep putting these treaties aside. The 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development probably had 
to twist some arms, because this has always been a tough issue to 
get on the front burner and get to the point where it becomes 
legislation on the floor of the House.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Today we can celebrate. Maybe there are some members in the 
opposition who do not like the process that is evolving as we get 
the issue resolved, but I am happy to hear that in spirit they are 
essentially supportive of the legislation. I think that is fair ball. 
There is always room for improving the process in this place.
<P>
	At times it strikes me as funny that the Reform Party tends to 
come from a background where they want less government, less 
red tape, and the activity around this particular bill has been that. A 
lot of entrepreneurial people from all levels of government and all 
sectors of the economy have worked together in a very constructive 
way. They have worked expeditiously, and now when they seem to 
be getting some real results the Reform Party is saying hold on a 
minute, we are getting a little head of ourselves; let us not be too 
efficient here, because we have to make sure that the MPs ratify 
this and place the seal of Parliament on it before we confirm or 
negotiate transactions.
<P>
	The Reform Party should know that all of those discussions and 
activities and exploration that have taken place are really 
conditional upon the work in the House. The Reform Party should 
not get too upset about the process, as long as in the end we get this 
resolved. I think that is where we are all coming from.
<P>
	I have worked over the last six years with my colleague from the 
Western Arctic, who has made me as a city member of Parliament 
much more aware of some of the difficulties some of our first 
peoples are having trying to get their dreams, policies, and 
objectives resolved. I believe all members would agree that our 
member for the Western Arctic has been very passionate about 
making sure that her communities and her people have been 
represented in this Parliament over the last six years.
<P>
	On behalf of my constituents in downtown Toronto, we support 
the government on this bill. We hope that our first peoples, with the
<P>
help of this bill, will realize a good part of the dream they have 
been working on for so many years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in today's debate on a bill 
respecting the establishment of the British Columbia Treaty 
Commission.
<P>
	I should start by congratulating the hon. member for Sault Ste. 
Marie, the hon. Minister of Indian Affairs, for succeeding in 
bringing this matter before the House, a very difficult task because 
of the full parliamentary calendar, and in convincing us all of the 
importance of this bill because it is indeed a very significant bill.
<P>
	I see that some of the members across the way do not share my 
opinion but this is nonetheless what I think about the whole issue.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	In May 1991, the Government of British Columbia made a 
commitment to ensure that the province would pay its fair share in 
the settlement of the land claims in question.
<P>
	In June 1991, the provincial minister of aboriginal affairs 
announced the approval in principle of the establishment of a treaty 
commission in charge of co-ordinating the start of land claim 
negotiations, as recommended by the task force that had been set 
up for this purpose and whose members included representatives of 
the various levels of government.
<P>
	In November 1991, the federal minister of the day, the hon. Tom 
Siddon as you may recall, approved 19 of the recommendations in 
the task force's report.
<P>
	In December 1991, the Premier of British Columbia, Mike 
Harcourt, and the provincial minister of aboriginal affairs, Andrew 
Petter, approved the task force's recommendations regarding the 
land claims in B.C.
<P>
	In the next 10 months, representatives of Canada, British 
Columbia and the summit negotiated the agreement on establishing 
the British Columbia Treaty Commission. The agreement on the 
BCTC specifies the commission's role, membership, financing, 
location, duties, powers, decisions, immunity, mandate and 
reviews.
<P>
	On September 21, 1992, the Government of Canada, then 
represented by Prime Minister Mulroney and Minister of Indian 
Affairs Tom Siddon, the Government of British Columbia, 
represented by Premier Mike Harcourt and Minister of Aboriginal 
Affairs Andrew Petter, and the leaders of the First Nations summit 
formally approved the commission's constitution by signing the 
agreement on the British Columbia Treaty Commission.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15724"> 15724 </A></B>
<P>
	The agreement on the BCTC requires the principals to establish 
the BCTC through legislative means. The federal and provincial 
governments agreed to adopt legislation to achieve this goal, while 
the summit agreed to pass a resolution to that effect.
<P>
	To enable the BCTC to start operating as soon as possible, 
commissioners were appointed on an acting basis by provincial and 
federal orders in council dated April 13, 1995 and April 14, 1993 
respectively and by a summit resolution dated April 5. These 
orders-in-council gave the commissioners the authority to carry out 
the agreed mandate pending the adoption of legislation to establish 
the BCTC as a separate corporate entity. This is of course the 
beginning of the process we are involved in.
<P>
	On April 15, 1993, chief commissioner C.J. Connaghan and 
commissioners Lorne Greenaway, Barbara Risher, Carole Corcoran 
and Doug Kelly were appointed to the BCTC.
<P>
	On May 11, 1993, the Summit passed a resolution to fulfil its 
role and support the establishment of this entity. On May 26 of the 
same year, the provincial bill was assented to pending the 
implementation of a federal statute. Political parties support the 
BCTC legislation.
<P>
	The hon. Tom Siddon, acting on behalf of the federal 
government, and the province of British Columbia managed to 
complete their negotiations on cost sharing by June 1993.
<P>
	In December, the BCTC started accepting statements of 
intention to negotiate from First Nations in British Columbia.
<P>
	You can see the series of events that finally led to us debating 
this bill in the House today.
<P>
	In April 1995, Alec Robertson was appointed chief 
commissioner and Peter Lusztig and Wilf Adam commissioners, 
while Carole Corcoran and Barbara Risher were re-appointed. 
Adjustments were made to expiring mandates. Some 
commissioners were re-appointed and, in other cases, new ones 
were appointed. On October 5, 1995, the Summit accepted Ms. 
Corcoran's resignation and designated Miles Richardson to replace 
her as the First Nations' representative.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	I would now like to take a moment to look at the duties of this 
commission we are in the process of officially establishing. The 
duties of the commission are as follows: to assess the readiness of 
the parties to begin negotiations, the parties being of course 
Canada, British Columbia and the first nations; to finance the 
participation of first nations in the negotiations, in accordance with 
pre-established criteria; to encourage timely negotiations; to 
maintain a public record of the status of negotiations; to assist, at 
their request, the parties to the negotiations in obtaining dispute 
resolution services; and to report on the status of negotiations to  
the Parliament of Canada and to the British Columbia legislature.
<P>
	In the few minutes that I have left, I want to discuss the status of 
negotiations. Forty-seven groups are engaged in the BCTC process. 
These groups represent 77 per cent of the 196 first nations in 
British Columbia. For those who are not from that province, it 
always comes as a surprise to hear that there are 196 first nations in 
British Columbia. In my riding, which you know well, I have the 
honour of representing the Akwesasne first nation, which is a 
Mohawk nation.
<P>
	This is not the time to talk about some of the problems which 
exist in that region of the country. However, I hope that, at some 
point, during a parliamentary debate, I can express my wish that the 
problems which we have been experiencing in the Akwesasne 
region can end, so that all can live in peace and harmony, and enjoy 
a degree of prosperity, while complying with the laws passed by 
this Parliament.
<P>
	I now go back to the progress made regarding the legislation 
before this House. The parties have indicated their readiness to 
negotiate. The negotiators signed framework agreements 
concerning, for example, the Teslin, Ditidaht and Gitanyow 
nations. The federal Minister of Indian Affairs, the hon. member 
for Sault Ste. Marie, signed framework agreements concerning the 
Sechelt and Gitksan first nations. He also signed other agreements 
concerning the transborder land claim made by the Champagne, 
Aishihik and Wet'suwet'en first nations. I apologize to aboriginal 
members for not pronouncing these names properly, but it is not 
out of disrespect.
<P>
	I hope that the House will quickly pass this bill, which is so 
important for these negotiations. I also hope that all members of 
this House will support this bill. Mr. Speaker, as you may 
remember, there was a rather sad episode in this House about a year 
ago when we discussed the issue of land negotiations in the Yukon. 
A parliamentary committee even had to sit throughout the night in 
an attempt to have a bill approved in committee.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Indeed, the committee sat all night, until six or seven in the 
morning.
<P>
	Needless to say that I hope we do not have to suffer such delays, 
and that we will proceed as quickly as possible to pass the bill 
currently before the House.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Mississauga East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to present to the House for third reading a bill on the 
creation of a mechanism to allow appeals of decisions made by the 
Cultural Property Export Review Board.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-93, an act to amend the Cultural Property Export and 
Import Act, the Income Tax Act, and the Tax Court of Canada Act, 
passed second reading on October 3. I thank my colleagues for 
their comments in the House and the progress of the bill. I thank 
those who gave input at the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to establish an appeal mechanism 
against decisions by the Cultural Property Export Review Board 
concerning fair market value of cultural property offered as a gift to 
museums, galleries, archives and libraries in the public sector.
<P>
	The mechanism is twofold: first the donor or the recipient 
institution may ask the Review Board to reconsider its first 
evaluation of fair market value. Donors who have obtained a 
second evaluation from the Board and are still dissatisfied may 
then go on to the next stage, appeal of the Board's decision to the 
Tax Court of Canada.
<P>
	As announced in the February 1990 federal budget, the 
responsibility for determining fair market value of cultural goods 
donated to designated Canadian museums, art galleries and 
libraries is transferred from Revenue Canada-Taxation to the 
Canadian Cultural Property Export Review Board.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The legislative amendments implementing this change became 
law in December 1991. In January 1992 the review board assumed 
this new responsibility.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Inadvertently, no provision for appeal from decisions by the 
board was included in the amendments, despite the fact that a right 
to appeal had existed previously.
<P>
	When Revenue Canada still had this responsibility, the lack of an 
appeal mechanism had raised considerable concern among donors 
and custodial institutions. The Minister of Canadian Heritage, in 
co-operation with the Review Board, undertook a series of 
consultations with the community concerned on the need for an 
appeal process.
<P>
	Subsequently we decided to propose legislative changes that 
would provide for the right to appeal to the Tax Court of Canada. 
Why should we adopt this bill?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What we want to do through this legislation is restore a natural 
right that existed up to 1991. With these amendments we have 
actually proposed two avenues of appeal over disputes concerning 
the fair market value of donations of cultural property to museums, 
art galleries, archives, and libraries.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The two tier process is effective in that it gives donors a chance 
to obtain satisfaction more quickly without having to go to court. 
The latter process is always very long and costly for all parties 
concerned.
<P>
	This mechanism is not only a boon to present and potential 
donors of cultural property. It is not only essential for museums, art 
galleries, archives and libraries, as present and potential 
beneficiaries of donations of cultural property. It is important for 
Canada as a whole and for all Canadians, now and in the future. It 
encourages donations of items that are outstanding examples of our 
heritage, so that these can be preserved, exhibited and appreciated, 
for the greater benefit of future generations.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage is responsible for a 
department where the concept of heritage is given its broadest 
possible meaning. Heritage means the set of values we share and 
the signs by which we recognize ourselves as being members of a 
group and, indeed, a country.
<P>
	Today, we can no longer restrict the meaning of heritage to what 
we have inherited from the past. Heritage is far more than just a 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15726"> 15726 </A></B>
<P>
collection of historical remains. Canada's heritage is first of all an 
expression of the ties that bind its citizens and of the unique 
identity of this country within the international community.
<P>
	One could say that the concept of heritage cannot be separated 
from our identity. In the present economic situation, the concerns 
of heritage and identity are sometimes seen as redundant or of 
lesser importance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Heritage and natural identity lie at the heart of economic and 
fiscal matters, for they animate and inspire the people and activities 
that drive the economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As a result of the various ways in which it interacts with other 
commercial enterprises, the arts and culture sector generates 
considerable expenditures which stimulate a direct demand for 
goods and services produced by other industries.
<P>
	In 1992-93, the direct and indirect financial impact on GDP 
totalled more than $24 billion.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	More than 600,000 corresponding jobs were created directly and 
indirectly the same year. The amendments we are proposing to the 
Cultural Property Export and Import Act, the Income Tax Act and 
the Tax Court of Canada Act will consolidate the sectors of the arts, 
culture and heritage by making it easier for those who give 
valuable cultural property to museums, art galleries or libraries.
<P>
	Investing in our arts, culture and heritage is investing in our 
collective future. These amendments are therefore of the highest 
importance to all Canadians, and particularly to the 60 million 
visitors to our art galleries and museums annually.
<P>
	I would like to point out here that Canada's museums were the 
first of its cultural institutions to be established. For example, what 
is now the Canadian Museum of Civilization was founded in 1881. 
It can be difficult for museums, galleries and libraries to acquire 
new collection items. They have not escaped the financial 
challenge of these difficult times.
<P>
	They have had significant cuts to their funding. Our museums, 
our art galleries and our libraries must therefore depend on the 
generosity of Canadians from all walks of life, on people who 
could have made money selling their artifacts, on people who, 
instead, have generously given them to us forever.
<P>
	To offset the drop in funding faced by our museums, art galleries 
and libraries at the moment, it is our job to come up with ways 
these cultural and heritage institutions can acquire cultural 
property that will enrich their collections. Collections are not 
simply the irreplaceable assets of museums, art galleries and 
libraries, they are their raison d'être.
<P>
	Policies and activities involving collections are among the basic 
mechanisms museums, art galleries, archives and libraries use to 
define and carry out their mandate.  Museums, art galleries, 
archives and libraries may find it very difficult to complete their 
collections, for reasons such as rapidly increasing costs.
<P>
	That is especially true for some art galleries, following the rapid 
increase in prices on the art market. The speed with which new 
products appear on the market make it very difficult for museums 
of science or history to show up to date collections. Donations of 
cultural assets to the collections are of definite financial value.
<P>
	For instance, the Cultural Property Export and Import Act 
concerns a very large range of cultural items, including works of 
art, historical artifacts, natural science specimens, archives or 
scientific and technological material of historic significance. Our 
government has committed to supporting the cultural sector in 
Canada. Data produced by Statistics Canada show that the 
Government of Canada remains by far the one that supports the 
most the cultural sector in Canada. The government wants to go on 
doing so by continually seeking new ways of promoting the 
development of the cultural sector.
<P>
	Innovative structural changes such as Bill C-93 will support the 
cultural sector without increasing the burden of Canadian 
taxpayers, so that they can donate their cultural properties instead 
of selling them to other countries. Canadians must be able to 
benefit from tax incentives such as those resulting from this 
legislation. These incentives encourage people to increase their 
support for our museums, art galleries and libraries.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. The hon. 
parliamentary secretary will certainly have the opportunity to 
conclude her remarks after the deferred division.
