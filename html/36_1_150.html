have the privilege to present, in both official languages, the 
fifth report of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, 
the central Canada freshwater fisheries report. In accordance 
with Standing Order 108(2), last May the committee undertook a 
study of fisheries issues in central Canada. Pursuant to Standing 
Order 109, the committee requests a comprehensive response to 
this report by the minister within 150 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very comprehensive and important report.  It deals 
with a number of issues regarding the Great Lakes fisheries that 
have never been addressed.  Some of the recommendations will be 
acted on.  One request is related to the sea lamprey, a 
non-indigenous species to the Great Lakes.  We have been dealing 
with this species recently.  Today I ask my fellow colleagues, 
all workers in the House and on the hill, to go to Centre Block 
to see the sea lamprey display in the rotunda. I ask that all 
here today make time to see that display today.

petition signed by many constituents in Ontario.  They are

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to present a petition signed by many of my constituents who 
are upset regarding the money being wasted on gun control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They point out that the commissioner of the RCMP in July 1997 
send a letter to the Department of Justice stating that of the 
88,162 violent crimes investigated in 1993, only 73 or .08% 
involved the use of firearms.

have two small petitions today.  In the first the petitioners 
draw to the attention of the House that the consumption of 
alcoholic beverages may cause health problems.  In particular, 
fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol related birth defects are 100% 
preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore ask parliament to require health 
warning labels to be placed on the containers of all alcoholic

the second petition concerns human rights in this year marking 
the 50th anniversary of the universal declaration of human 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas Canada is internationally recognized as a leader in 
promoting human rights around the world, the petitioners call on 
parliament to appeal to leaders around the world where human 
rights are not being protected and for Canada to seek to bring to 
justice those responsible for the violation of internationally 
recognized human rights.

an issue about which my constituents feel very gravely.

marriage as a voluntary union of a single male and a single 
female.  I am proud to present the petition on their behalf.

very pleased to present a petition on behalf of my constituents 
also dealing with marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are concerned about the broadening of the 
definition of marriage.  They are showing support for private

female.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 4 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-51, an act to amend the Criminal Code, the Controlled 
Drugs and Substances Act and the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act, be read the third time and passed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-51 that 
has some merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that there are sections in the bill which the 
government has addressed that should have been addressed many 
years ago.  I do not raise this point simply to bring out the 
fact that the changes the government finally got around to doing 
are overdue.  There is another point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of amendments were raised at committee.  Some of them 
were presented by the Reform Party of Canada. They were clearly 
thought out.  We had discussed them not only among our own 
colleagues and law enforcement people but among other members of 
parliament from other parties.  These amendments were not 
controversial and should have found very wide support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me discuss a couple of the amendments we wanted to bring 
forth.  The legislation dealt with such things as people who live 
off the avails of prostitution, specifically of minors or 
children. It includes maximum penalties.  It is an approach that 
says we need to get a little tougher on certain types of 
offenders in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party support that kind of approach.  We 
thought perhaps the government had overlooked that it was all 
well and good to have a maximum sentence and say that under 
circumstances the judge can sentence the person up to a certain 
amount of time, but what about a minimum sentence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see far too often in our courts and in society people walking 
away scot-free from offences that offend the sensibilities of 
Canadian citizens. 
It is a shame that this happens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This was our opportunity to do something about it.  The 
government in its wisdom saw fit to include maximum sentences. We 
go along with that.  We support them.  There should be some 
capping based on the severity of this crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also put in more parameters for judges.  Many people 
in my riding, and I suspect in the ridings of Liberals, 
Conservatives, NDP, Bloc and my colleagues, complain that judges 
seem to have far too much leeway in what they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The range of sentencing is astronomical.  In many cases this 
causes defence lawyers to go shopping for judges.  They know that 
certain judges are soft on certain types of crime and if they 
could get their client before a certain judge, even if the client 
is found guilty, the penalty would not be very severe and in many 
cases they would walk away.  We have heard some horrendous cases 
of people walking away completely scot-free from very serious 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to bring in a minimum sentence for people who live off 
prostitution of a minor.  We have sentences for dealing with 
those living off the avails of prostitution but this is a special 
section.  It is much more serious.  For adults who chose to enter 
a life of prostitution we can pass all kinds of judgments or we 
can ignore those judgments.  However, it is pretty serious when 
someone lives off the avails of prostitution of a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all well and good to have a maximum sentence but we have 
no minimum.  We wanted to bring in an amendment that would 
provide the minimum of a one year sentence for someone living off 
the avails of child prostitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked to many people including Liberals across the way 
and people involved in the legislation.  They agreed that it made 
a great deal of sense.  However, what happened when we brought 
the amendment before the committee and said we thought it was 
something that would make the bill better? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to support government legislation.  We are not 
here to oppose for the sake of opposing. We are here to point out 
any shortcomings, where perhaps the government has erred and not 
done as complete a job as it should have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general response from the Liberal members of the committee 
just before they defeated the amendment was that it was under 
study.  There are provisions in the bill that have been outdated 
decades ago.  The Liberals have had more than ample opportunity 
to fix these things and have not done so.   Why are they taking 
something as straightforward and basic and saying they have to 
study it more and cannot possibly pass it at this time, even 
though they have already spent all this time on it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message the Liberal government is sending out to people in 
society who live off the income from prostitution of a child is 
that they still have no minimum sentence.  They can walk away 
scot-free if they find a lenient judge, and we know they are out 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had another amendment to bring in.  Another clause of the 
bill deals with drugs, various crimes and sentencing provisions 
for people living off income from selling illicit drugs on the 
streets.  We know the kind of problems that creates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conditional release program allows prisoners to get out 
after serving only a small part of their sentence, one-sixth.  A 
tremendous number of Canadians watch parliament, look at the laws 
we create and bring into the House.  They wonder what on earth we 
have in mind when we say that a certain criminal act results in 
so many years in jail but if the prisoner is good he will be let 
out after serving only one-sixth of the sentence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone is sentenced to six years, the victims of the 
particular crime might say that is okay or that he or she should 
have had a longer sentence.  We have to be careful now that we 
include women.  They like equality, so we want to make sure that 
when we talk of crime that we include everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fine for six years, but now we are saying that they could 
be out in 12 months.  There is a caveat that says that certain 
people will not be eligible.  People who commit violent offences 
will not be eligible and will have to serve a whopping third of 
their sentence before they are considered for release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that in itself needs to be addressed.  Personally I do 
not think that anyone who commits a violent offence against 
someone else should be allowed out early at all.  They are 
sentenced for a number of years and they should serve those 
years.  That debate will go on at another time when we talk of 
serious offences like murder because Liberal legislation or the 
lack thereof allows convicted murderers and rapists, the Clifford 
Olsons and the Paul Bernardos of the country, after being 
sentenced to life in prison to put their victims through the 
trauma of a hearing after 15 years.  We went through that before 
and because the government failed to act we will have to go 
through it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another type of crime that by definition does not come 
under the violent offender category which we believe should be 
considered in this legislation.  I am referring to the people 
involved in the trafficking of drugs and the importation of 
illicit drugs into the country and the pain, suffering and 
expense to our justice system and our health care system.  People 
involved in importation and/or trafficking of illicit drugs 
should be included in the exclusion from the early release 
program after serving one-sixth of their sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is strongly supported by people who work in the criminal 
justice system and by the police officers who are the ones on the 
frontline dealing with these people and all the problems they 
create.  It is absolutely shocking that anyone would consider 
someone who is trafficking in narcotics and is causing problems 
in society should be released after serving only one-sixth of 
their sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the response of government members in this regard? They 
said there was some merit in what we were saying but that they 
had to study it.  That is how we got into the mess in terms of 
half the things that are already in the bill.  They said they had 
to study, to wait, to consider every ramification and to consider 
whether they would get any political brownie points.  If they 
bring it in at all, if they bring it in now or if they bring it 
in later, will it cause them any problems with voters or some 
special interest group? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what special interest group government 
members are afraid of in bringing in a sentence that cracks down 
on the traffickers and importers of illicit drugs, or even for 
that matter those who live off the avails of child prostitution. 
I would like to know what they are afraid, what they feel is the 
downside of bringing in something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many areas the government claims it is doing the right thing, 
but when they are held up to the cold light of day they just do 
not make a lot of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In various parts of the country, and in particular in my 
province of British Columbia, there is a criminal justice crisis 
right now.  The government states that it wants to make homes and 
streets safer.  I would like to know, especially arising out of 
the problems with the bill, why the government has cut back on 
funding for the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My province has a huge coastline. The RCMP has tied up all its 
coastal patrol boats at the dock. The bill talks about drugs, 
trafficking and the importing of drugs, yet the RCMP has had to 
tie up all its patrol boats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia is a big province as is the province of 
Ontario.  British Columbia is a very big, rugged province.  It is 
necessary for the RCMP to spend a lot of time patrolling, 
travelling and conducting surveillance from the air, but it has 
grounded its airplanes, except of course for the commissioner who 
can fly out for a party.  That is the exception that is allowed. 
Of course he is not really, in my opinion, part of the RCMP.  He 
is part of the government.  He is no longer the top cop of this 
country, he is the top bureaucrat associated with the RCMP.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding the government has made major cutbacks in funding 
for patrols for these various small communities.  In one small 
community there was a break-in at one of their public buildings, 
which was then vandalized.  It occurred and they reported it on 
Monday.  The RCMP got to it on Thursday.  That is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have another small town which has a breathalyser so they can 
apprehend people who would put other people in danger by drinking 
and driving.  The breathalyser is not functioning properly and 
there is no funding in the budget to fix it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the result of $8.5 million worth of cutbacks to the RCMP 
in my province of British Columbia.  This same government has 
brought in, is enforcing and is now trying to implement Bill 
C-68, which is the legislation to force law-abiding citizens to 
register their hunting rifles and their sporting shotguns used 
for trapping and skeeting and maybe some bird hunting.  The 
government said when it brought the legislation in that it was 
going to cost $89 million to implement.  It is up now to 
approximately $200 million by the time it will be fully 
implemented and that is assuming it does not have to do what the 
Canadian Police Association says it will have to do, which is to 
upgrade the national computer system at a cost of anything up to 
another $200 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice department has said it is going to cost $50 million 
or $60 million a year to maintain it once they get it running, if 
in fact they do.  It will cost $60 million a year so that I and 
other people who are shooting enthusiasts can trap and skeet. 
Does that make a lot of sense, particularly in the light of the 
problem we have in British Columbia where $8.5 million would 
truly bring justice and prevent crimes in our province, as well 
as in other parts of the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that it needs time to study whether or not 
there should be a minimum sentence for someone who lives off a 
child prostitute.  When I hear this and look at all the other 
things this government has done, I have a hard time believing 
that the government is serious with respect to getting tough on 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is getting tough on crime?  Is it forcing the law-abiding 
citizens of this country to registry a shotgun or a hunting 
rifle?  Or is it taking a small portion of that money and funding 
the RCMP so it can properly patrol the communities of this 
country and catch the traffickers and the importers of drugs that 
are referred to in this bill?  These are the same importers and 
traffickers for which this government, for some reason, is 
reluctant to take away the right of early release after serving 
only one-sixth of their sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting or implying anything, but I think there are 
going to be people in the country who are wondering why a Liberal 
government would be so reluctant to bring in a condition that 
says traffickers and importers of drugs cannot be a part of this 
early release program after serving only one-sixth of their 
sentence.  They are looking at this and saying that this is the 
same government which, in spite of the fact it is spending 
hundreds of millions of dollars on a useless firearms 
registration program, is cutting back $8.5 million in the RCMP in 
British Columbia.  The impact will be that they will be stopped 
from patrolling their coastline where a lot of the drugs come in. 
They will be stopped from flying their aircraft over our province 
to find people hiding out in different areas, and to do certain 
types of surveillance including border surveillance.  We have a 
long common border with the United States.  Drugs certainly come 
in from that area as well.  They are also smuggled into our 
country through other ways and then channelled into the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government says that it is tough on crime, I would 
like to know what kind of crime it is.  It is not prostitution. 
It certainly is not people who would live off the avails of child 
prostitution.  The government had an opportunity to make a small 
change that would have sent that message a lot better in this 
legislation, but it did not do it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not drug traffickers and importers of drugs because not 
only has the government refused to add them into that section of 
people exempted from this early release after serving one-sixth 
of their sentence, it has cut back on the RCMP where one of the 
biggest impacts will be on the fight against organized crime and, 
in particular, people who smuggle things into our country, the 
number one concern being illicit drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a member of this parliament.  It is very awkward sometimes 
when people ask me who I am, what I do and where I am from.  What 
can I say?  I am a member of parliament.  What is a member of 
parliament?  Do I belong to the government?  No, I am not a 
member of the government.  They are the government.  I do not 
want to be tied that way.  I am a member of Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition, which is sometimes a little difficult to explain.  Am 
I a government representative? No, I am not.  I am not even a 
Reform Party representative.  I am a representative of the 
constituents of my riding.  The Reform Party is the vehicle I 
use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those constituents need representation in this House is because 
this government does things that are purely against their 
interests.  It does it in terms of its cutbacks to the RCMP. 
This asinine firearms registration that the government says is 
getting tough on crime has nothing to do with crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents need representation because there are changes 
that should have been made in Bill C-51 which have not been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention a witness who was brought before the 
committee immediately preceding the clause by clause examination 
of the bill to bring it back to this House.  The witness was a 
representative of the Canadian Police Association, the 
organization that represents the frontline police officers of 
this country who certainly have a strong interest in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This association brought in a couple of recommendations for 
changes to this bill which were ignored out of hand.  They were 
ignored for what seems on the surface a plausible reason, because 
there was not sufficient time to study and consider the 
recommendations.  I thought they were very appropriate 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting is the scheduling.  If that is how the 
government is going to react to recommendations from the Canadian 
Police Association, then why did that committee, controlled by 
the government, choose to have those people appear in the 30 
minutes immediately preceding the time it was moving to 
consideration of this bill and amendments thereto? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think I can take this Liberal government seriously when 
it says it is getting tough on crime.  I do not think Canadians 
can take this government seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that all Canadians will take note of what could have been 
in this bill versus what is in it and make sure that when they 
talk to their member of parliament, be it Liberal or otherwise, 
they make it clear that they want this government to get tough on 
crime in a serious way, not in a phony or a two-faced sort of 
way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to talk for a minute about some of the 
things the member talked about with regard to cutbacks to the 
RCMP on the west coast.  This is a major ongoing concern and it 
is not going to go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now going into the winter months and these so-called 
temporary measures that have been enacted to try to make up for 
what the government is calling overspending are going to take us 
to at least April.  We are now in a circumstance, well described 
by my colleague, where the airplanes and helicopters are in the 
hangar and the boats are docked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, for example, we had members who would work a shift 
and then would be on call for eight hours for which they would 
receive one hour of overtime.  That was precious little 
compensation for being basically on tap for an additional eight 
hours.  That one hour of overtime is now gone and the members of 
the RCMP in our area are expected to carry on as if this is fine. 
In actual fact, none of this was created by them.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was all created by Ottawa and by not forwarding moneys 
through E division.  The reason we ended up with an $8 million 
so-called shortfall has everything to do with court costs and 
with extra things that happened.  For example, there was a 
multiple murder in my riding.  One case like that can put the 
taxman's budget well over.  We cannot plan for contingencies like 
that.  These are major investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is becoming more and more uncomfortable.  Basic 
policing is something that government should be providing.  That 
is a prime responsibility.  I am glad to see that the solicitor 
general is in the House to hear what I am saying, because this 
cannot carry on.  It is affecting overtime monitoring, our 
helicopters, our boats and our airplanes.  It is affecting 
capital spending.  It is affecting the future of the RCMP.  The 
training centre in Regina is now shut down.  It is affecting 
morale on an ongoing basis.  This is just not acceptable.  Anyone 
who has small communities in their riding knows that what used to 
be slim coverage is now skimpy or non-existent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have huge areas on the coast where the Criminal Code, drug 
interdiction and other things are not being enforced.  They 
cannot be enforced because there is nobody there.  That is my 
comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for my colleague relates to the fact that this is 
obviously an omnibus bill.  It takes in everything from gambling 
to homicide, child prostitution, conditional sentencing, 
organized crime, telemarketing fraud and so on.  This makes it 
very difficult.  One can support nine measures out of 10 and get 
oneself into a bit of knot on a piece of legislation like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the prime area of concern would be with conditional 
sentencing, at least from my perspective.  We still have in 
conditional sentencing a huge loophole.  It is being applied to 
violent offenders despite previous justice ministers telling us 
that would never happen.  We also have a much smaller loophole 
being closed by this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague to comment on the omnibus 
nature of this bill and also to elaborate on the RCMP funding 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
raising these points.  Certainly there is a great deal that 
should be said about many of these things and I welcome the 
opportunity to expand a bit on what I previously said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overtime situation, or lack thereof, for the RCMP is very 
important and very critical for two reasons.  First, it is what 
the RCMP relies on to get coverage.  As he pointed out, they 
receive one hour of overtime pay, but they in essence are on call 
for an eight hour period.  Even now that this has been taken away 
from them many members of the RCMP, out of a sense of duty and 
obligation to the people in their area whose safety they are 
responsible for, still put in a tremendous amount of extra time 
for which they are not paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is absolutely shameful.  The government wastes 
phenomenal amounts of money.  Members of the RCMP are not very 
highly paid, in part because of freezes not only in their pay, 
but even in the increments they get in terms of rewarding them 
for their growing experience, expertise and commitment to the 
job, and they have demonstrated that commitment.  The government 
has said “No, you cannot be compensated for that”.  Now it is 
saying “In order to do your job, if you have a sense of 
obligation, you are still going to have to go out on your own 
time”.  But the government will not pay them to stand by.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to that, this country right now according to Statistics 
Canada, has the lowest per capita law enforcement officer 
population that it has had in 26 years.  Never since 1972 have we 
had such a low number of law enforcement officers per capita. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this Liberal government respond to this shortage, a 
shortage which necessitates these officers covering an eight hour 
availability shift for one hour's pay?  And now that one hour's 
pay is being taken away from them and they are covering for 
nothing.  How does the government respond to that? It closes down 
the training centre in Regina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the lowest per capita coverage of law enforcement 
officers in 26 years, and this Liberal government responds to it 
by closing down the training centre and getting rid of the 
trainees.  No new people are coming on.  The government says it 
is a temporary measure. It is not a temporary measure and anybody 
who says it is a temporary measure is either a hypocrite or they 
think that everybody else in Canada are fools. The time has come 
to put the training expertise back together, to redevelop and 
update the course curriculum, to recruit, to qualify these people 
and to schedule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went through this in the air traffic control system.  The 
government was running it at the time.  In its wisdom the 
government decided to cut back on air traffic controllers because 
it thought there were too many.  The government arbitrarily, 
without doing proper studies, shut down the training system. It 
got rid of the instructors and shelved the training so that there 
would be no more updates.  What happened?  The government said 
“Gosh, we made a mistake.  We need more controllers, not 
fewer”.  There was an incredible lag, a 10-year lag, in trying 
to get back up the steam to bring people in, to train them, to 
give them the qualifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And now this government is making the same asinine mistake that 
was made by the government of the day when it cut back on the air 
traffic control system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a problem in this country. When the government says it 
is temporary, if we were to use semantics, there is a measure of 
truth to it. The trouble that we have today is temporary.  It is 
not going to stay like it is.  It is going to get worse because 
this government has no plan for real crime prevention.  It has no 
plan for making our homes and streets safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is bringing in a bill forcing law-abiding 
citizens to meet new expensive regulations at a cost of hundreds 
of millions of dollars.  It is cutting back on the RCMP in my 
province by an amount of $8.5 million, a pittance against the 
amount it is wasting on the useless firearm's registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to wonder.  I do not think for a moment that the 
government has any dark and sinister reasons for doing this.  I 
cannot help but wonder why it brings in legislation that allows 
the criminals to walk through loopholes while it cuts back on the 
police, the people who catch those same criminals.  The 
government should be ashamed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in today's debate on 
Bill C-51. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been previously stated, this is an omnibus bill which 
will amend the Criminal Code of Canada, the Controlled Drugs and 
Substances Act, as well as the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act. Among the highlights of this bill, we will see 
changes to the legislation with respect to homicide, criminal 
negligence, child prostitution, conditional sentences, 
telemarketing fraud, currency gaming and non-communication 
orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say at the outset that there are some positive aspects to 
this bill.  Some of these measures indeed have been long in 
coming.  It is refreshing to see that these changes will be 
enacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting to note on a priority level the way this 
bill was described by one of the justice department's own 
witnesses who appeared before the justice committee with respect 
to the enactment of this legislation.  It was described as 
housekeeping legislation. As far as priority goes, I would have 
to agree with that description. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were looking at this in terms of baseball analogies which 
have been prevalent in this chamber over the last number of 
weeks, I would describe Bill C-51 as an infield single. 
It is the bare minimum the government needed to do with respect 
to the criminal justice system.  It could have delivered much 
more and there was an opportunity to deliver much more.  Without 
getting into the specifics of that, I want to address some of the 
improvements that should and could be made to this legislation.

decided to table legislation with new innovative crime prevention 
technology, as it did with Bill C-3, it delivered a modest and 
potentially ineffective system. That is to say, it did not go far 
enough.  To use the Prime Minister's favourite sports analogy, 
the government is dribbling weak grounders back to the mound when 
it could be delivering real serious hits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week we saw the opposite of the minister's relations with 
respect to the provincial and territorial governments.  It is sad 
that the Minister of Justice does not heed the will of most of 
the Canadian provinces with respect to bringing in a new youth 
justice system.  Last December she delivered a speech in Montreal 
in which she promised the provincial and territorial ministers 
that she would be presenting a draft bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 13 the minister told the House that she would be 
introducing legislation with respect to the youth justice system 
this fall.  No bill has been seen as yet and there appears to be 
no bill forthcoming.  The minister broke her commitment to 
Canadians who are concerned with respect to flaws in the 
government's approach to youth justice.  She went back on her 
word to her counterparts, the provincial and territorial 
ministers.  We have no bill as yet to replace the Young Offenders 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Broken promises are not new to this government, in particular to 
the Minister of Justice and the solicitor general.  Their 
credibility is at such a low ebb with the law enforcement 
community that the former head of the Canadian Police Association 
said several months ago “Frankly we don't care what this 
government has to say any more”.  That is a shocking statement 
from someone in that position.  The gist of this is that there is 
not any real and meaningful legislation as is required to meet 
with the criminal reality Canadians are facing in the streets and 
in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have Bill C-51, which is the subject of this debate and I 
admit it is a good housekeeping initiative.  However, the reality 
is that the government has missed an opportunity to bring in real 
legislation that would address some of the outstanding problems. 
Instead it is putting housekeeping ahead of those major 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Colleagues on this side of the House have mentioned that Bill 
C-51 will amend the Criminal Code in regard to some of the 
situations that need fixing, in particular homicide, child 
prostitution and conditional sentencing.  It also amends the 
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in terms of dealing with 
sentencing and criminal liability for on duty law enforcement 
officers.  This bill will also amend the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act to exclude those convicted of organized 
crime offences for eligibility for accelerated parole review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was missed was the opportunity to enact in the Criminal 
Code stiffer penalties for those involved in organized crime 
activity.  It failed to include mandatory minimum sentences for 
those motivated by gang activity to embark upon a life of crime, 
crime that inevitably puts people's lives at risk through drug 
peddling, prostitution and the type of gang warfare we have seen 
in the streets of Montreal and which is spreading to other cities 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will remove a provision that in light of advances in 
forensic science and health care will also focus in on some of 
the technological advances that have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Criminal Code disallows the prosecution of 
individuals convicted of murder, manslaughter or other offences 
after a year and a day has passed.  That enactment has been made. 
I would embrace it as a positive measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there are situations that unfortunately could occur. A 
person whose life has been threatened due to injuries related to 
crime and is on a life support system or in critical condition 
may through their own will hold on until after a year and a day 
has passed. 
The perpetrator is then not held criminally accountable under the 
old system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation brings about an amendment to the 
Criminal Code that would allow for prosecution after a year and a 
day for crimes related to murder and manslaughter.  This is a 
positive change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment to the Criminal Code with respect to Bill C-51 
would be to simplify the prosecution of individuals who attempt 
to procure sexual services from a prostitute who they know is 
under the age of 18.  It would also allow police officers greater 
access to electronic surveillance and technology to investigate 
prostitution related issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To touch on some of the comments I have heard from the opposite 
side of the House, there is an opportunity here to perhaps put in 
place mandatory minimum sentences to act as a deterrent for those 
willing to embark on this type of a criminal career.  It is 
obvious to say that those who find themselves sadly involved in 
prostitution are often runaways.  Often they are young women from 
small communities who are brought into big cities often through 
very extreme kidnapping type situations.  Often there is a great 
deal of coercion, violence, drug addiction and blackmail used to 
get these children involved in this type of illicit trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also fair to say that Canadians are repulsed and revile 
this type of activity. Therefore we should have an opportunity in 
our Criminal Code to reflect that view which is held by an 
outstanding number of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues on the opposition benches also brought 
forward amendments that have been referred to, specifically to 
clause 8 which would address this particular situation of those 
who embark upon living off the avails of child prostitution. 
There was a suggestion that there would be a minimum sentence of 
one year and a maximum punishment of 14 years.  This certainly 
does give a broad range of sentencing. I might suggest that a 
hybrid type of sentencing option might be more appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do agree that the initiative taken by my colleague is a good 
one.  It would at the very least reflect the ability of a 
sentencing judge to hand down such a sentence that would send a 
severe message of deterrence, not losing sight of rehabilitation 
which is something that has to be kept in mind. At least it would 
broaden the sentencing options for the judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly with respect to this initiative as we have seen numerous 
times at the justice committee, the justice committee with the 
Liberal dominated majority simply voted it down without any great 
deal of discussion or consideration of this useful amendment.  It 
was dismissed out of hand. Other amendments were proposed as 
well. As we saw at the justice committee, numerous times without 
any great deal of discussion they were voted out of hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to break from the partisan discipline that we often see 
in this place and in the committees when it comes to issues such 
as this one which are so fundamental, issues that have such a 
broad ranging effect.  Criminal justice issues should not be a 
forum for politicians or anyone else to delve into partisan 
activity.  It is too important, too fundamental to the protection 
of Canadians, too important to help rebuild some of the 
communities that are under siege by organized crime and those who 
perhaps because of the economic system are willing to delve into 
criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that being said, we all have to take note of many of the 
initiatives in Bill C-51.  The government's decision to delve 
into the area of conditional sentencing came up very short.  This 
bill would permit the issuance of arrest warrants until a court 
hearing would be held with respect to breaches of conditional 
sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another component of Bill C-51 is that it would change the 
breach hearing limit of 30 days to permit the court to deal with 
offenders who cannot be found or brought to justice within the 
parameters of the current legislation. 
Another is stopping the clock on conditional sentences. That is 
to say, if an individual serving time in their community under 
conditional sentencing provisions is subsequently arrested and 
sentenced to do time on a subsequent criminal act, the 
conditional sentence would not run concurrently.  It would begin 
on the offender's release. I commend this as a positive change to 
the Criminal Code.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the reality is there could be and should be changes to 
the conditional sentencing provisions currently in place in the 
Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the expression has been clear on this side of the House 
that conditional sentencing provisions have been abused by 
Canadian judges.  They have been used to sentence criminals who 
are involved in activities for which the drafters of this 
legislation did not intend, specifically crimes of violence and 
crimes that have an element of sex or violence in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentences were never intended for those purposes and 
they surely do not reflect the need to protect society from those 
willing to embark on that type of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A conditional sentence can be viewed in no other way but one 
which is extremely light and in most circumstances meant to be 
used only in very special factual scenarios.  As well, 
conditional sentencing puts greater emphasis on those outside the 
traditional criminal justice system, mainly those involved either 
in policing services or in the administration of justice or 
prisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases emphasis is put on parole officers or social 
workers to have the discretion to view conditional sentences or 
see that conditions are being complied with.  These individuals 
are often faced with the discretion of do they breach the 
offender when they run amok of the sentencing conditions in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that for serious crime involving violence or sexual 
assault where the emphasis is on rehabilitation and protecting 
the victims, conditional sentences are inappropriate and not 
intended for that type of crime. Sadly the government has missed 
an opportunity in this omnibus bill to make those corrections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard that there are currently sentences pending before 
the courts where this discussion will take place.  The judges 
may, in their wisdom, decide that these type of sentences are not 
appropriate.  But as long as that discretion exists, and we have 
seen this happen so often, lawyers will make the argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lawyers will always try to push the limits and beyond when it 
comes to these types of sentencing provisions.  If it is there, 
the lawyers will ask for it.  That is the way the system works. 
It is something that should not come as any surprise to us.  Why 
not simply remove that type of discretion for certain codified 
offences? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to send a stronger message when it comes to violence. 
We need to simply say they are not eligible for that type of 
sentencing provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the more interesting aspects of Bill C-51 is that it 
makes amendments to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. 
These amendments would ensure that offenders with ties to 
criminal organizations or gangs no longer receive accelerated 
parole review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To echo my remarks with respect to conditional sentencing for 
violent crime, I suggest we have again missed an opportunity. 
When it comes to gang activity we could codify in the act in 
sentencing provisions that a crime motivated by gang activity or 
perpetrated by a person involved in a gang would receive an 
additional sentence or the sentence received would be served 
concurrently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is to say we would view this as an aggravating circumstance 
and we would codify that so it was a deterrent not only for the 
offender but for those who might decide to model themselves after 
people who are involved in the gang. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These gangs, as we have seen in the papers and consistently in 
the media, are expanding their width and breadth across the 
country.  We know they have firmly ensconced themselves in a 
number of big cities such as Toronto, Montreal and Calgary.  We 
are seeing these gangs become more and more prevalent and more 
involved in very serious and illicit crimes in smaller 
communities as well. 
If the Liberal government was willing to amend the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act before the statutory review process 
why was it not willing to make some significant changes?  There 
is in fact a review taking place.  We have been told time and 
time again that things will be coming in a timely fashion, that 
we will have to wait.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government in its new agenda of 17 months had not tabled a 
single piece of significant legislation to address some of the 
more serious crimes taking place in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully the non-partisan view that I spoke of earlier will 
prevail when the Corrections and Conditional Release Act review 
does take place at the justice committee level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat my challenge to the government, though, with respect to 
its true commitment to crime fighting.  As I mentioned earlier, 
the solicitor general specifically could be doing a lot more when 
it comes to violent crime and when it comes to organized crime. 
Nothing has undermined the solicitor general's performance record 
more than his inaction on this organized crime front which is 
supposedly one of the government's three strategic priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general has said quite often in the House and to 
the media that organized crime is big business and it is bad 
business.  Recognizing this and doing something about it are two 
different things.  Recognizing it, acknowledging it and saying 
publicly that he wants to do something about it, that is fine but 
the clock is running.  When it comes to these types of issues, 
when the clock is running people are getting hurt, killed and 
things are happening that the government has an opportunity and I 
suggest a responsibility to do something about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general has an opportunity to do just that through 
legislative initiatives and through resources. Resources of 
course are a problem that the government is wrestling with, its 
priorities.  Where does it spend the money?  Where does it cut 
the money?  Once more to echo comments from the opposition 
benches, the priorities and where the cuts seem to be taking 
place are extremely disturbing and questionable.  All Canadians I 
believe are embarked on that process of questioning why the 
government is making cuts in the areas where there appears to be 
the most need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the areas I would describe as being the most in need is 
that of frontline policing and the need of police officers to 
have the resources to do the job they have been tasked with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not just partisan bluster on my part.  That is the 
conclusion reached by the U.S. State Department when it was 
viewing areas in the world where organized crime was beginning to 
become a growth industry.  There was an international report 
tabled, “The International Narcotics Control Strategy”.  In 
that report the State Department singled out Canada as an easy 
target for drug related and other types of money laundering.  The 
same report also listed Canada in the same category as Colombia, 
Brazil and the Cayman Islands as an attractive location to hide 
illegal cash.  That same report also criticized Canada's lack of 
legislation to control cross-border money flow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious problem, so much so that York police 
Chief Julien Santino, head of the organized crime committee of 
the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, said: “Money 
laundering is an easy feat here in Canada. According to these 
reports the RCMP has estimated that the value of laundered money 
in Canada is between $3 billion and $10 billion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I express guarded support for Bill C-51 on behalf of the 
Conservative Party. We would have liked to have seen further 
amendments as are appropriate under an omnibus bill.  There is a 
common sense need for more stringent controls and more stringent 
areas for the government to look at in terms of sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be supporting this legislation and hoping for greater 
initiatives on the part of the solicitor general and the Minister 
of Justice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke about the parasites among us who live off the avails of 
child prostitution.  I think we can all agree that it is a very 
serious problem in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a large movement afoot in my province of British 
Columbia to have the age of sexual consent between a young person 
and an adult raised from 14 to 16 as one possible method of 
dealing with these issues, not only dealing with the people who 
live off the avails, the pimps, but also with the johns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the hon. member has any comments on that 
proposal. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member has 
a real strong and personal commitment to issues of justice and I 
commend him for his efforts in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer his question, I suggest that yes, that is a possible 
initiative that could be undertaken.  As he would know, there was 
a time in the Criminal Code when the age of consent was much 
higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to child prostitution, his apt description of 
parasites are those who would embark on making a living by 
enslaving young women and in some cases young men to trade sex 
for money, something the country has to be very concerned about. 
It is something our law enforcement community has certainly 
expressed its opinion on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely we can do more.  Having it enacted in the Criminal Code 
that the age of consent be raised to 16 would take away the 
ability of some of the pimps who target children before that age. 
Some of these children are as young as 11 and 12 years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is redundant to say we cannot do more to help these children. 
If putting tougher measures in the Criminal Code and broadening 
the description of who is classified as child would lead to 
greater prosecutions, a greater number of arrests and giving 
police the ability to charge someone who had sex with a child of 
15, it is certainly something I would be supportive of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making these types of legislative initiatives, making these 
changes, arms the police with the ability to do their jobs, make 
a greater number of arrests and to have greater discretion in the 
field which they are forced to exercise.  This is something we 
should be more supportive of not only in the House but in all 
parts of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak on issues of justice.  I do not think anything strikes a 
more resonant chord with Canadians than a justice system that 
works, that protects those who need protection and that correctly 
identifies and punishes those who need to have punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose a lot of people do not realize the different parts of 
this bill but I am going to talk about one that, as far as I 
know, no one has mentioned yet in the House.  It was drawn to my 
attention by a letter I received yesterday.  Because I am not a 
justice critic I was not aware of this.  I am much more 
interested in the justice of financial things these days since I 
am one of the finance critics for our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the topic I want to discuss is the transfer of money. 
As an aside, it is perhaps illustrative to know that included in 
this bill are provisions that it is not legal to copy Canadian 
money unless the size of the reproduction is either 50% larger 
than the original or at least 50% smaller or thereabouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being in the finance portfolio now, Canadians would probably 
best represent Canada's dollar by reducing it rather than 
expanding it because of its value on the international market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is against the law to reproduce Canadian money or to make 
facsimiles thereof or to transmit it by computer or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about another area proposed here, gambling. 
There are some amendments proposed that are hidden in with all 
the other amendments, many of which are very important and which 
my colleagues have already addressed in this reading, the 
previous reading of the bill and in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw attention to the fact that we are, by the amendments that 
are being put into this bill, big time drawn in to the wave of 
public ideas of gambling being an acceptable way of transferring 
money from one person to another. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we have this argument that surely people should have 
the choice.  If I choose to put a dollar on the table and let 
someone else take it, I should have that choice.  Indeed, I 
support that view.  If I see someone on the street who has not 
eaten yet today, I want to have the choice to say to that person 
“You come with me to the restaurant and we will eat together”. 
I should have the freedom to spend my hard earned money in 
whatever way I wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that as a society we are buying, in 
much too large a way, into the whole idea of lotteries.  This 
bill, among other things, expands legal gambling to include games 
of dice, which have not been included before.  We need to be 
aware of this as members of the House, and we need to be aware of 
this as members of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply contend that having our population spend hours huddled 
over gambling tables is a tremendous waste of human energy, 
effort and time.  We should start putting regulations into place 
to make that more difficult, not easier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill says that lotteries will no longer be illegal if they 
are conducted on international cruise ships within our 
boundaries.  That is incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a little history.  Probably about 30 years ago I met 
a friend.  He was not the kind of friend that I hang around with 
on Wednesday nights, but he was friend. He met me in the hall of 
a building and he looked both ways.  He looked to the left, he 
looked to the right and then he reached into his pocket and said 
“Do you want to buy a lottery ticket?” What he had was an Irish 
sweepstake ticket, which at that time was illegal.  Had he sold 
it to me and had I purchased it, then we could have both been 
sent to jail.  I am sure it is incredible for you to contemplate, 
Mr. Speaker, that I should have even considered doing something 
that would have sent me to jail.  As a matter of fact, I did not 
consider it.  I said “No, thank you.  I am not interested”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about the mathematical aspect of gambling.  When I 
was teaching math or statistics I used as an example one of 
Canada's favourite lottery games, Lotto 649.  I had the students 
compute the probabilities.  If a person spends $5 on every draw 
of Lotto 649, 104 times a year, twice a week, their mathematical 
expectation of winning the big prize would be once in about 
26,000 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics show that it is often poor people who engage in 
gambling because it is their only hope.  They are in despair 
because of all of the taxes the Minister of Finance loads on them 
or the tremendous burden of being unemployed, particularly young 
people who are unemployed.  A lot of people buy a lottery ticket, 
as one person said to me, because it is their one little glimmer 
of hope.  Their dollar is gone, but maybe it will give them the 
big break.  They might wait for 26,000 years, on average, if they 
spend $5 each time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess I would simply say that if that is not dishonest I do 
not really know how to describe it.  All of these schemes 
indicate that there is a reasonable expectation of winning. 
Otherwise people would not put their money down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, what we are talking about in this bill is gambling 
and lotteries on cruise ships.  There probably will not be too 
many poor people on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the reason I am bringing this up is because it is part 
of the justice system.  There are an awful lot of people who are 
living in despair who consider gambling as their chance, their 
hope, but what it does is clean them out entirely.  No matter 
what the gambling scheme is, it is designed to return less money 
than is put in.  It is just indefensible in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an amendment in Bill C-51 which says that if a person 
is on a cruise ship they can participate in a lottery scheme. 
Then there are these absurd conditions.  First of all, all of the 
people participating in this lottery must be on the ship.  In 
other words, they cannot participate in the lottery by phone from 
shore, by cellphone or whatever.  They must be on the ship.  The 
scheme cannot be linked in any way to a scheme that is not on the 
ship.  As well, the ship must be at least five nautical miles 
from a port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been cutting RCMP in the west.  We do not have money for 
it.  Now what are we going to do?  People are going to be hired, 
presumably by the federal government, to ensure, I suppose with a 
GPS, that these guys do not come within five nautical miles of a 
port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, they cannot board this ship at a Canadian port and 
go back to a Canadian port without having stopped, at least once, 
at a non-Canadian port.  If they do not meet that condition, then 
they cannot have this lottery on board.  They have to leave the 
country for a while.  I suppose that here again we are talking 
about the Minister of Finance who thinks it is great to take some 
money out of the country and not keep it all in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This law says that a cruise ship which both leaves a Canadian 
port and comes back to a Canadian port cannot have a lottery 
unless it also goes to a foreign port.  That is the height of 
absurdity in my humble and unbiased opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ship must be registered in Canada and its entire voyage is 
to be scheduled outside Canada.  I shake my head and wonder how 
the Dickens we are going to enforce this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose we will have to buy a cruise ticket on every one of 
these ships for one of our trusty RCMP people.  I am sure the 
solicitor general will be eager to do this with his resources. 
He will say that from now on all of those RCMP who should be 
fighting crime, robberies, rapes, murders, drug smuggling and all 
of these things will be put on a cruise ship so they can monitor 
this to make sure the law is being enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shake my head in wonderment at the government sometimes.  This 
bill is designed to improve the justice system in Canada and it 
has utter absurdities in it which are fundamentally wrong in 
terms of what we are trying to do for people.  Why should we be 
encouraging and permitting lotteries?  It is wrong.  This 
proposal is utterly and totally unenforceable, unless a whole 
bunch of money is put into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt in my mind that if we were to ask 100 
Canadians, 100 of them would say that is not where they want 
their money to be spent.  The system is supposed to be designed 
to protect them in terms of their justice system.

wanted to get on the record and I appreciate the opportunity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder whether the hon. member has had an opportunity 
to speak with some of the members of his caucus from British 
Columbia, whether he has read the bill or whether he has taken 
any advice on it.  The issue with respect to cruise ships is 
simply that cruise ships which are operating outside the country 
and which have gambling on board are simply asking for some 
assistance in order to carry on with that business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing about this is that it is the ports in the 
provinces of British Columbia and Quebec and the ports on the 
east coast that want this to happen.  They want those ships to 
continue to stop at their ports, rather than staying in 
international waters, avoiding them.  Effectively, he is 
attacking communities along the coast of British Columbia.  I 
find that intriguing for a member of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member, with his great wish to prevent people, who have 
a free will, from gambling, ever think about communities 
elsewhere?  Does he ever think, for instance, about the city of 
Windsor?  What is his problem with the city of Windsor 
introducing dice to their casino?  That will create between 400 
and 600 good, new, unionized jobs.  They will be organized by the 
Canadian Auto Workers.  The average income will be around $50,000 
a year.  Those jobs will feed families.  They will keep our 
community going.  Our community wants that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is his problem?  Is the Reform Party writing Windsor off 
too? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have indeed read the bill.  I 
have a copy of it in my hand.  I scanned it this morning.  I 
admitted at the beginning of my speech that I am not a justice 
critic.  I admitted at the beginning of my speech that I am not 
an expert in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am merely here to communicate what a constituent has asked me 
to communicate, that is, why are we wasting our time on this when 
we should be addressing the real issues of justice?  Why are we 
trying to promote and legalize more lottery spending, setting up 
a situation which will have the added costs of enforcement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned the jobs that will be created. I am 
not sure that a lottery job improves our standard of living one 
iota.  What does it produce in tangible terms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should look at real economic value.  Nothing is 
produced by exchanging money from one person to another without 
the transfer of a good or service.  There is no value attached to 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only weak argument they could make is that it brings money 
in from the Americans.  That is what I am sure is happening.  If 
they want to give Americans something tangible for spending their 
money in Canada, I would say that would be 100,000 times more 
valuable than saying “Come over here and simply throw your money 
on the table.  We will keep 85% of it”.  That is immoral.  I 
really do not think the government should promote that kind of 
lifestyle and justify it by saying “It is good for our 
economy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member wants to defend lotteries, gambling and putting 
people at risk that way, she is welcome to do so.  I also agree 
with freedom of choice.  If people choose to do this, fine.  But 
I do not think it should be promoted and sponsored by government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, without 
going into too much detail, I heard the member say that we should 
not be introducing laws which would require using our resources 
for their enforcement.  Is he suggesting that we should cancel 
all the laws that we have in place now governing, for example, 
hunting or driving licences?  All of that requires enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that we should not be trivializing the matter to 
the point where if something needs enforcement then we should not 
do it. 
Rather we should say there is a need in the community to take 
action on behalf of the community.  We should do what is right 
rather than what may or may not require more resources. What are 
my colleague thoughts in this regard?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government is the epitome 
of wanting to regulate everything.  When I was a kid, and that 
was a long time ago, we did not need drivers' licences. I was 
very young at that time.  It was around the time when the 
automobile was invented; that is an exaggeration.  It used to be 
that we did not need drivers' licences.  We did not need to 
license our vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the government found out that was a way of getting 
revenue. Now we have to buy drivers' licences and automobile 
licences every year.  We have come to accept that.  It is part of 
the money that is required to provide roads and to provide safety 
on the roads.  The enforcement of those rules and regulations is 
useful and helps us in terms of our personal safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What good is it to have rules that say they must be within five 
nautical miles of the port.  I bet most people do not even know 
what a nautical mile is.  Otherwise, if they comes to within 4.8 
nautical miles they must shut down their lottery schemes.  It is 
absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just talking about the absurdity of it and the fact that we 
will be wasting enforcement resources on it when there are people 
literally getting away with murder because we do not have the 
RCMP and the physical forces to to find those people and bring 
them to justice.  Those are the real issues of justice that we 
should be concentrating on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, not too long ago in the House we debated a bill which 
would restrict tobacco advertising.  The purpose of the bill was 
to discourage people from becoming involved in that habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my hon. colleague from Elk Island agree that there is a 
lot of false advertising in terms of gambling?  We only see 
pictures of someone winning a million dollars.  We only see what 
can be purchased, such as a dream home and so on.  The fact is 
that we do not see in the advertisements the results in the 
community of massive gambling.  They do not show poverty.   They 
do not show marriage break-ups.  They do not show what happens 
once a person becomes addicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we not illegally advertising the gambling industry by only 
showing the small percentage of people who win and not showing 
the despair that it brings to a community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is my point exactly. We 
are holding out a hope to many people who are desperate because 
of high taxation and the real difficulty of getting jobs. 
Statistics show that a large proportion of people who engage in 
gambling activities—not the ones on cruise ships who are clearly 
in a different financial class—are the average people across the 
country who buy lottery tickets and play video lottery terminals. 
We are telling those people that if they put in some money they 
will get more back.  That is the expectation and and it is false. 
It is an outright lie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be telling those people that there is an extremely 
high probability of losing every quarter they put into the 
machine and a very low probability of getting even their 
investment back.  It is just not there.  Yes, it is false 
advertising.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK63">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Diane Marleau (for the Minister of Indian and Northern 
Affairs)</B> moved that Bill C-49, an act providing for the 
ratification and the bringing into effect of the Framework 
Agreement on First Nation Land Management, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to discuss Bill C-49, an act to bring into effect a 
framework agreement on first nations land management.  This is a 
significant piece of legislation because, as its title suggests, 
it has the laudable goal of giving certain Indian bands across 
the country the right to manage their own reserve lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a long term goal of the Reform Party to ensure that 
Indians obtain authority to manage their own affairs.  However, 
the bill carries within it many profound implications for both 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians and is a Trojan horse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the debate progresses it will be seen that Bill C-49 in its 
present form will only serve to further widen the gap between 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians by extending special 
rights to a specific segment of Canada's population, solely on 
the basis of race.  It will also serve to continue the 
marginalization of Canadian women of aboriginal descent who live 
on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my intention to focus on many of the details within Bill 
C-49.  However I feel compelled to address first some broader 
issues and questions which the legislation raises.  Many of them 
may explain the perceived necessity of the bill and some of its 
shortcomings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks are in the context of one Canada, equality for and 
among all persons, a phrase taken from the blue book outlining 
the principles and policies of the Reform Party of Canada.  I am 
proud to represent a party which holds the view that no one 
should be discriminated against on the basis of race as Canada's 
aboriginals have been for far too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were recently honoured to have in our midst a great modern 
day hero, Mr. Nelson Mandela, President of the Republic South 
Africa.  What a tremendous privilege it was to hear him speak of 
his struggle toward freedom and equality for everyone in his 
country.  It strengthened my belief in the power of hope, truth 
and grace for our country at this time in its history.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be in the presence of a man who has endured so much hardship 
and suffered such loss, to know that he remained triumphant and 
resolute against the desire to give in to hate, anger, fear and 
bitterness throughout his struggle, has become for me an 
indelible memory.  I am sure I speak for all of us here today 
when I say this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I was struck by the apparent contradictions in 
the Prime Minister's introduction of President Mandela and his 
own sorry record in the matter of Canada's native population.  I 
can only regard them as either blind ignorance or outright 
hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister lauded President Mandela's fight against 
apartheid and Canada's efforts in joining this fight.  He praised 
the ideals of a constitution which recognizes no race and grants 
rights and freedoms to all citizens regardless of race, religion 
or language.  These comments were made against the backdrop of a 
government whose current and past policies in respect to 
aboriginal Canadians betray such words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's policy with respect to aboriginal Canadians has 
actually reinforced a system within the country which has 
contributed to inequity of opportunity and unequal protection 
under the law.  The practice of treating Indians unequally and 
apart from the mainstream of Canadian society has created the 
worst imaginable social and economic conditions for those who 
live on Canada's reserves.  This separation has been just as real 
and just as injurious to aboriginal Canadians as it was to South 
African blacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon the government today to reconsider seriously its 
course of policy with respect to aboriginal Canadians and the 
implications it has for all Canadians.  As I will show, 
legislation such as that which we see in Bill C-49, as well as 
the current convoluted environment in which land claim and treaty 
making processes are taking place, is misguided and is 
contributing to inequality and segregation on the basis of race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The past band-aid approaches of the government and those before 
it have failed to establish a legislative fiduciary 
responsibility by any level of government to aboriginal 
Canadians.  Instead, what we have seen in recent decades are 
governments attempting to make amends for the wrongs of past 
actions by creating legislation which changes the outward 
appearance of things but does not address the fundamental issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country desperately needs today a brand new relationship 
between aboriginal Canadians and the Government of Canada which 
recognizes treaty rights but stresses a commitment to equality, 
not inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I turn now to address the details of Bill C-49 I want to 
point out some of the weaknesses of the bill and what needs to 
change.  One of the primary assertions made by Canadian 
aboriginal peoples today concerns what they say is a special 
relationship to the land.  Given this claim, it follows that land 
management could be considered a critical first step toward 
achieving self-government and economic security.  This is a 
fundamental connection to bear in mind when considering the 
merits and weaknesses of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This much granted, while Bill C-49 in title sets out to give 
certain bands the right to manage their reserve lands, in 
function it amounts to a substantial power of self-government for 
each of the individual bands that have signed the framework 
agreement on land management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the government envisions this being accomplished in 
two primary ways: first, by making those sections of the Indian 
Act which relate to land management of no effect for those bands 
that are signatories to the agreement.  Of course this would end 
the delegated authority of the minister of Indian affairs over 
those sections of the Indian Act.  Second, in the vacuum created 
by making those sections of the Indian Act of no effect, the 
framework agreement would allow the band councils to create and 
enforce their own laws with respect to their lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to state clearly that the Reform Party fully supports 
expressions of aboriginal self-government which ensure that all 
members of their communities remain full and equal participants 
in Canadian society and which uphold the rule of Canadian law and 
the supremacy of the Constitution of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Reform is opposed to the creation of any act or first 
nations laws that create a level of governance not envisioned 
within the Constitution.  Yet this is precisely what Bill C-49 
does and is the Trojan horse I mentioned earlier.  It will extend 
powers of governance to the bands which are signatory to the 
framework agreement without any constitutional provisions for 
such powers having been put in place.  We all know that changing 
the Constitution is a process far more complex and time consuming 
than simply passing legislation because its effects are so wide 
ranging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation in its present form clearly states that in the 
event of a conflict between band laws and federal or provincial 
laws band law would prevail. 
In this sense the rule of Canadian law will not be upheld, which 
leads to special sovereign rights being granted to certain Indian 
bands.  There is no constitutional basis for this at this time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a process for dealing with this problem. Amend the 
Constitution.  This is difficult to do, and rightly so.  The 
entire purpose of the Constitution is to limit the arbitrary use 
and abuse of power by governments.  That this proposed 
legislation could lead to abuses of power is the subject of the 
next part of my speech and a major concern of the British 
Columbia Native Women's Society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British Columbia Native Women's Society has been raging a 
protracted battle with government to address inequalities and the 
break-up of families for the previous 15 years without success. 
Now the government wants to turn over land management to bands 
without first putting an end to the unequal status of reserve 
women.  The problem will never end for these people.  When bands 
can make laws governing themselves that do not recognize the 
rights of specific members of their bands which are accorded to 
them under the Constitution, government is abdicating its 
responsibilities.  Shame on a government like that, shame on this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we say that certain laws that apply to non-aboriginal 
Canadians no longer apply to aboriginal Canadians we are creating 
two classes of citizens, those who enjoy general rights together 
with special rights and privileges and those who enjoy only 
general rights with no special rights and privileges.  This 
raises an important point about the concept of self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of my colleagues have over the years lived in and 
worked closely with aboriginal communities.  As members of this 
House, many have been meeting extensively with grassroots 
aboriginal Canadians to address their concerns about the 
deplorable state of many of Canada's reserves.  It is tragic that 
many aboriginal Canadians, especially those on reserve, have been 
the victims of the current regime of inequality, prejudice and 
injustice that characterizes this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true this government is not overtly promoting inequality 
or injustice but it has never declared a policy to reinforce 
equality and justice.  We only ever hear the exact opposite.  We 
hear how the government is concerned about the well-being of 
aboriginal Canadians.  It informs us that it has a wide range of 
effective programs and services in place, that it is increasing 
funding to ensure the long term economic development and equality 
of life for individuals and communities.  But these are only 
superficial and empty words.  Something is terribly wrong with he 
government's silence on the problems facing rank and file 
Indians, its refusal to act and its utter refusal to admit the 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are that living conditions for the majority of 
aboriginals on reserves in Canada have for decades actually been 
at third world levels.  While this government boasts about 
Canada's standing among the G-7 countries and about our 
consistent top quality of life ranking by the United Nations, it 
refuses to address the harsh realities of life on reserve. The 
reality is that by using the same criteria used to show Canada is 
number one in quality in life, Canada's Indian reserves would 
rank 63rd on the same UN list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with this government?  Does it only see what it 
wants to see?  Does it only hear what it wants to hear?  Will 
this government stubbornly go on accepting a lie and refusing to 
admit these realities or will it move to change its present 
course of action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grassroots aboriginals are beginning to speak out strongly 
concerning the desperate need for change in the quality of life 
on reserves.  Many aboriginals on reserve have no way of life 
that they are proud of or happy about.  This should not be. These 
people have made it clear to us that on issues such as self-government 
they are simply not ready. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listen to what some of them have said.  “Most of us living on 
reserves today are living under dictatorships”, one middle aged 
woman said recently.  A man from another reserve asked “What is 
the government trying to do with its agenda of self-government, 
wipe out the Indian people?  In a different way it seems as 
though it is setting us up to wipe us out through 
self-government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the healing fund another aboriginal on reserve asked, 
“How can the minister of Indian affairs ever apologize for the 
abusers?  What has happened to us has been passed down through 
the generations.  Do you think money is going to heal us?  No 
way.  Only the Creator can do that.  The government talks about 
healing yet not one of us will see a penny of the $350 million 
for the healing.  It is going to go to drive the Indian industry. 
The chiefs, the government and their lawyers are the only ones 
who will benefit.  We must make sure that our rights and freedoms 
are protected.  I am determined to fight for the future of my 
children and my grandchildren.  We must stop this cycle of 
desperation”.

and non-natives with respect to the possession, occupation, 
ownership, enjoyment and use of land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be obvious, successful land management is perhaps the first 
most critical step toward self-determination and self-government. 
Reform supports this insofar as such movement creates a climate 
for first nations to achieve greater economic self-sufficiency 
and ultimately self-government as full and equal participants 
under Canadian law and the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law are at 
issue here.  The bill makes it very clear that in the event of a 
conflict between band laws and either federal or provincial laws, 
band law will prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What safeguards this is legislation put in place to protect 
individuals' fundamental rights and freedoms and to ensure they 
are above encroachment by band laws.  Essentially there are none 
and this is wrong.  It is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are washing their hands of responsibility to 
protect the weakest, most powerless members of the aboriginal 
communities by introducing this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears to be in direct conflict with section 15(1) of the 
charter of rights and freedoms: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the 
right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law without 
discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based 
on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or 
mental or physical disability. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members not find it incredible, as I do, that the government 
is proceeding with this legislation?  The government's complete 
abdication of responsibility by failing to uphold this section 
and indeed to defend the entire Constitution is unconscionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the primary role of government is to uphold the 
Constitution, but the legislation being contemplated here states 
in clause 37 the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between this Act 
and any other federal law, this Act prevails to the extent of the 
inconsistency or conflict. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What guarantee is there that individual rights or freedoms would 
be protected in Indian band laws?  Surely this House must act to 
ensure the supremacy of the Constitution and rule of federal and 
provincial laws are strongly affirmed as sufficient. This 
legislation is found to be flawed on these grounds alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to briefly address the fact that this legislation will 
make certain sections of the Indian Act non-applicable.  While 
this is not the first time the government has done this perhaps 
it is time for the government to undertake a serious review of 
the need for the Indian Act or at least as to whether 
comprehensive amendments to it should be introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many aboriginal Canadians the act has become an 
anachronistic burden and a vestige of colonial policies.  Many 
sections of the act have directly prevented many on reserve 
aboriginals from attaining personal wealth, property and 
financial independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not insignificant that many of these sections are the same 
ones that would be made non-applicable by this legislation.  It 
speaks to the many inadequacies of the Indian Act and the 
barriers which prevent individuals from attaining personal 
wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important issue which is the subject of another 
full speech for another day.  However, I wanted this issue to go 
on the record today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have been attempting to emphasize here is that this 
government's piecemeal approach to the elimination of the Indian 
Act is misguided.  If the government's intention is, and it 
appears as though it is, to remove the burden of the act in order 
to give all aboriginals the right to acquire personal wealth and 
property which all other Canadians enjoy, then why does it not 
declare its intentions and just do away with the Indian Act 
altogether?  That would certainly be a positive first step toward 
true equality of opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if the government's agenda is to slowly erode the 
Indian Act in order to give the Indian leadership more power at 
the expense of the powerless, even the right to sovereign 
self-government but without accountability, then the government 
should declare those intentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before the House is nothing more than a thinly 
disguised agenda to bring about self-government. But again, 
self-government is not the real problem.  The problem is what is 
not being addressed, the government's unwillingness to correct 
the core problems inherent in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The balance of power must change to favour the majority of 
aboriginals on reserve, not just the privileged few at the top. 
The problem is that all we hear is the minister repeating the 
mantra of commitment to partnering with aboriginals to bring 
about change. It sounds good.  But I wonder if the minister 
really knows what that means. 
Is she really confronted every day as she recently claimed with 
the problems that face the majority of aboriginals on most 
reserves?  Does she experience every day the third world levels 
of health and housing or the fact that many reserves experience 
virtually total unemployment?  Does she daily experience the 
effects of substance abuse and gambling addition?  I doubt it.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further I wonder if she is really aware of how all these things 
are linked to the tragically high rates of fetal alcohol syndrome 
and family breakdown on a daily basis.  If the minister were 
aware of these things we would see a drastic change in her 
condescending attitude toward questions on these subjects.  We 
would see a different kind of action and not just words.  When 
will the partnerships that the minister is so fond of mentioning 
include all aboriginals and not just those fortunate enough to be 
in leadership?  Is it not true that this partnership the minister 
talks about extends only to the privileged few?  Clearly this is 
the way things appear to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I would call extreme, extreme injustice.  This is 
what I call extreme inequity.  This is callous indifference to 
the needs and will of many grassroots aboriginals.  Many see 
individual land codes as necessary given the regional differences 
and needs of each band.  However, it should be noted that this 
fact actually strengthens the argument in favour upholding 
Canada's Constitution and law in the event of conflict between 
Indian band laws and federal and provincial laws which are 
designed to protect individual rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An additional complication is seen in the creation and enactment 
of a band land code.  Since each of these will be individually 
created and entered into by the bands and since the rule of 
Canadian law would not always apply, there is no guarantee that a 
national standard of rights will be met.  Furthermore, it will be 
difficult if not impossible to track cases of inequity and 
litigation across reserves since each reserve could have vastly 
different land codes and laws within those codes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be instructive for the House and particularly for 
members of the government to revisit their recent past.  I am 
referring to their 1969 white paper which was introduced by none 
other than the Right Hon. Prime Minister who was at that time 
minister of Indian affairs.  Listen to some of the ideas and 
words uttered at that time by the Liberal government.  As members 
listen I ask them to reflect on this government's near 
abandonment of those lofty ideals and also to where its departure 
from those ideals has led it in the last 30 years.  I urge 
members to reflect on whether its policy path has really led to 
greater equality, a stronger identity and strengthened unity 
between aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The white paper initiative was designed to “Lead to the full, 
free and non-discriminatory participation of Indian people in 
Canadian society”.  The white paper outlined several policy 
initiatives which I summarize to achieve that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the legislative and constitutional bases which set 
Indians apart from other Canadians must be removed. Second, all 
Canadians must recognize the unique contribution of Indian 
culture to Canadian life. On this point it is safe to say that 
the majority of Canadians would affirm this today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, government services to aboriginals should come through 
the same channels and from the same government agencies for all 
Canadians. The white paper actually recommended dismantling the 
department of Indian affairs within five years. This was to have 
been a key factor in establishing equality for aboriginals among 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, lawful obligations must be recognized. Fifth, those who 
are furthest behind must be helped the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The white paper went on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The separate legal status of Indians—have kept the Indian 
people apart from and behind other Canadians.  The Indian people 
have not been full citizens of the communities and provinces in 
which they live and have not enjoyed the equality and benefits 
that such participation offers.  The treatment resulting from 
their different status has been often worse, sometimes equal and 
occasionally better than that accorded to their fellow citizens. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has changed since then?  I submit that very little has 
changed.  I ask members to consider the input this government has 
given over the intervening years and what it has achieved in 
terms of equality of outcomes.  There has not been equality of 
opportunity because much of the money spent has not reached the 
majority, and as a result there has not been equality of 
outcomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is instructive and profitable to read even more of what the 
Liberal government of the day was saying at that time.  A review 
of this part of the Liberal's history is relevant to the debate 
today because this successor government has lost sight of a 
worthy vision that was short lived. 
Although the Liberals did a complete about face in implementing 
this policy some four years after introducing the white paper, it 
is important to remind them of where they stood.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government must recognize that in its departure from the 
white paper policy, the path it chose to go down has actually 
done less to serve and protect the equality rights of aboriginal 
Canadians. In a very real sense the government's policy decisions 
over the last 30 years were set on a very slippery slope and 
today more than ever this is abundantly clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is tragic that the government refuses to recognize that its 
policies rest on assumptions that have not delivered freedom from 
want and entry into the mainstream of Canada's economy by 
aboriginal Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The white paper even had the full support of then Prime Minister 
Pierre Trudeau.  At the time he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have set the Indians apart as a race.  We have set them apart 
in our laws.  We have set them apart in the ways our governments 
deal with them.  They are not citizens of the province as the 
rest of us are.  They are wards of the federal government—they 
have been set apart in the relations with the government and they 
have been set apart socially too—.We can go on treating the 
Indians as having special status.  We can go on adding bricks of 
discrimination around the ghetto in which they live and at the 
same time perhaps helping them to preserve certain cultural 
traits and certain ancestral rights—or we can say you are at a 
crossroads—the time is now to decide whether Indians will be a 
race set apart in Canada or whether they will be Canadians of 
full status. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that those words were spoken in 1969.  Today 
on the threshold of the 21st century, sadly aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal Canadians are still at the same crossroads.  Now 
almost 30 years and billions of dollars later we should not be in 
this place.  Significant progress could have been made and real 
changes should have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the majority of Canadians desire to see past wrongs 
made right for a sense of closure to be achieved.  There is a 
desire to move ahead with building a strong and united country. 
The Reform Party believes in the common sense and goodwill of the 
majority of Canadians to move forward and accomplish change. But 
we know that while the majority of aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
Canadians desire this change, they also realize that it is not 
more money and programs that will achieve this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not currently equality of opportunity, nor is there 
equality of outcome despite a history of spending.  A person 
spending just one day hearing testimony in the Standing Committee 
on Indian Affairs and Northern Development proves that.  Studying 
the human development index report on Canada's reserves will 
serve to reinforce this knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True equality can only be achieved when Canadians are united 
together in willing a change.  It must be all Canadians, 
non-aboriginal and aboriginal together willing equality.  One 
people, one vision and one goal:  one Canada, equality for and 
among all persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly governments do have a significant role to play in 
allowing for the will of the people to bring about this change. 
Making things right is never easy.  It can only occur when there 
is humility and generosity of spirit on both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this legislation the government is at another crossroads. 
It has another opportunity to choose the way of establishing true 
equality and justice.  I urge the government to rethink its 
current course of policy and the approaches needed to make 
Canada's aboriginal people truly equal with all other Canadians. 
This would be the right thing for the government to do.  But I 
wonder, does it have the moral fortitude to choose the right way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development needs 
to be significantly restructured.  Decades of DIAND's consistent 
mismanagement of aboriginal communities must end.  It is time for 
a fresh and revitalized relationship between governments and 
first nations that will allow them to regain confidence, 
self-reliance and greater economic independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have highlighted how DIAND's piecemeal approach to addressing 
problems among first nations has consistently failed.  First, by 
creating programs with no long term plan, it has created a 
convoluted landscape of programs and rights that benefit a few 
but which fail to reach and benefit the majority of grassroots 
aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until such time that the mandate of DIAND is clearly defined in 
a modern context and its goals realigned with the priority of 
ensuring that aboriginal Canadians are fully equal under the law 
and with equal opportunity, Canada's Indian population will 
continue to suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DIAND is like a canoe heading down a fast moving river but 
without a paddle.  That river can be likened to the Niagara, and 
we all know how a trip down that river would end up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great struggle for more than land right now and the 
stakes are high. 
The current general direction of modern day treaty negotiations 
as evidenced in the recent Nisga'a treaty are inconsistent with 
the Reform Party's principles and policies and are unacceptable 
to the Canadian public at large.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These treaties have not been negotiated in an open, public 
manner.  Third party interests and the public in general are 
being ignored throughout the process and then are expected to 
approve the package after the deals have been made and signed. 
Current self-government agreements negotiated under the treaty 
process go beyond any concept of a form of delegated 
self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is most incredible is that if anyone dares to question 
either the contents of the treaty or the process used to arrive 
at a final agreement, he is instantly labelled a racist and 
troublemaker by those driving the agenda.  There needs to be an 
openness and acceptance to public scrutiny of both process and 
analysis of substantive issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying that the Reform Party strongly 
desires to bring about closure to outstanding grievances so that 
aboriginals and non-aboriginals, Canadians all, can move forward 
as true equals and partners. It is our desire that Canadians move 
forward into the next millennium, not backward to the attitudes 
and prejudices of the past.  In order to do this, government 
needs to re-examine many fundamental assumptions it has been 
operating on for decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way to righting wrongs and having a fresh start is not 
through unfocused spending and the creation of special rights 
and privileges which serve only to degrade the rights of others. 
We cannot purchase equality nor buy an end to injustice.  If it 
were only that easy.  These things can only come about by a 
change of heart and spirit and this nation desperately needs 
renewal of spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inequality breeds injustice, suspicion and prejudice.  If this 
government continues on its present course, there will not be 
greater equality.  It will be diminished as will hope for the 
justice which so many aboriginals are crying out for today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal Canadians continue to experience an ever greater 
sense of dislocation and isolation from the rest of Canada and 
the sense of being fully Canadian.  I know this is clearly not 
what the majority of Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to point out to this House that Mr. Mandela 
referred to Canadians as a people.  Why can Canadians not refer 
to themselves as a people?  Why can they not do the same?  I 
believe that this Prime Minister and his government have at 
certain times had a vision of Canadians as a people united and 
equal. On June 6, 1994 in his address to commemorate the 50th 
anniversary of the D-Day invasion on Juno Beach in Normandy, 
France, the Prime Minister spoke these ringing phrases: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the beach behind us,<BR> 
Canadians gave their lives<BR> 
So the world would be a better place.<BR> 
In death they were neither anglophones nor francophones,<BR> 
not from the West or the East,<BR> 
not Christians or Jews,<BR> 
not aboriginal peoples or immigrants.<BR> 
They were Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not simply consecrate a foreign battlefield on which 
Canadians died with words like these.  If we who share this land 
can die together as Canadians, why can we not also live together 
as Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government must regain sight of this vision of Canada.  It 
must regain it with respect to this piece of legislation, to land 
claim and treaty negotiations, as well as with respect to its 
overall fiduciary responsibilities to aboriginal Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is impossible to move ahead while dwelling on the past.  A 
weak and halting apology has been extended.  Forgiveness, however 
grudgingly accepted, was given.  It is time now time for all 
Canadians to move on into the next century as one people, united 
in the principle of equality and strengthened by freedom and 
truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like to move:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am proud to continue the debate on second reading of Bill C-49, 
the first nations land management act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill gives us the opportunity to deliver on a vision that 
the government articulated in January when we responded to the 
Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.  This is a bill that puts 
into action the vision outlined in “Gathering Strength: Canada's 
Aboriginal Action Plan”.  We said that gathering strength was 
about addressing the needs of communities. We said it was about 
building a real partnership with aboriginal people. We said it 
was about working closely together with aboriginal peoples to 
define that relationship and shape a common vision of that 
relationship between us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us delivers on that vision.  It seeks to ratify 
the framework agreement of first nations land management signed 
by the first nations who have been working patiently, 
persistently and with tremendous commitment over the past seven 
years to establish this new land management regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement was negotiated government to government 
by the department and these first nations.  Provincial 
governments directly impacted by the framework agreement were 
consulted closely throughout the process.  The agreement will end 
the control imposed by the Indian Act on how these first nations 
manage their lands.  It is about putting the daily management of 
their own affairs into their own hands.  In other words, it is 
about empowerment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian Act is a complex piece of legislation and first 
nations feel very strongly about it.  The Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal Peoples recognizes that complexity in its own report. 
The Indian Act is paternalistic.  At the same time, it confers 
recognition that first nations have, contrary to what the hon. 
member was suggesting here earlier, a unique legal position in 
Canada which includes a special relationship with the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are always ways to get away from some of the more 
intrusive provisions of the Indian Act without changing that 
special relationship and that is part of the purpose of the bill 
before us.  It ratifies a framework agreement on first nations 
land management in which 14 first nations move out from those 
sections of the Indian Act dealing with land management.  The 
regime represented in this legislation would provide first 
nations with control over their land and indeed natural 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As outlined in this bill, first nations will develop a land code 
that will set the basic mechanisms for governance, laws that 
govern land, accountability and interest in lands and resources. 
Each first nation will enter into an individual agreement with 
Canada to determine a level of operational funding for land 
management and to set out the specifics of transition to the new 
regime.  Once this bill is passed and once the land code is in 
effect and the agreement in place, the land management provisions 
of the Indian Act will no longer apply to these communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations authority will apply on first nations land. First 
nations will control the issues of leases, licences and other 
interests in their lands. They will also have the commensurate 
and compatible authority to enforce their laws by creating 
offences punishable on summary conviction and a range of 
remedies. They will be able to establish enforcement procedures 
including the appointment of justices of the peace to deal with 
offences against first nations land laws.  First nations will 
retain and manage revenue money from the land transactions for 
which they will be accountable to their members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill withdraws the expropriation provisions in section 35 of 
the Indian Act. It ensures there will be no loss of first nations 
lands through sale or expropriation.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In negotiating the framework agreement, first nations have 
provided for a series of democratic accountability that will 
ensure that communities will have a vote before the land codes 
are implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time the agreement will also provide for the 
implementation of environmental regulations on their land.  These 
regulations will be harmonized with those in effect in the 
province in which the community is located. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these first nations the framework agreement ends a system 
where officials in my department have considerable involvement 
and authority in day to day land management issues.  It ends a 
system where ministerial approval must be sought even for routine 
transactions such as the issuance of licences and permits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian Act contains provisions regarding the purposes for 
which lands may be used.  It controls the rights of individual 
first nations peoples in possession of reserve lands and the 
surrender and designation of reserve lands.  It controls the 
management of reserves, surrendered and designated lands and 
other matters.  It gives the minister wide ranging discretion 
regarding the use of reserve lands and resources.  It gives the 
governor in council the right to grant a first nation powers to 
control and manage land in the reserve.  However, at the same 
time it may withdraw that right at any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The land management provisions of the Indian Act have caused 
delays for first nations that want to proceed with economic 
development projects in their communities.  Some have wanted, for 
example, to develop forest companies.  We are told that even 
today possibly up to 50 memorandums of understanding exist 
between first nations and mining companies to exploit these 
opportunities in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others have wanted to develop shopping centres but because of 
the red tape imposed by the Indian Act, first nations, the 
federal government and third parties, in other words business 
interests and private interests, have often been frustrated by 
these interminable delays.  Transactions that off reserve might 
take a matter of weeks can go on for months when they involve 
first nations land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, many opportunities are lost and communities are 
denied the chance to realize their hopes for economic prosperity 
and freedom within the boundaries of their own communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason why the minister needs to be involved in 
these day to day operations and in the management of these 
reserve lands.  Those decisions ought to be made at the local 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement in this legislation gives the community 
the option of taking control over the reserve lands and 
resources.  These first nations want to get on with creating jobs 
and economic growth in their communities without having to turn 
to the minister or my department for approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This regime places first nations in the position of managing 
their lands and resources to strengthen and sustain their 
communities.  This is what the framework agreement gives them the 
authority to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Indian Act, I realize there is a legislative 
gap concerning matrimonial property issues. Therefore to address 
this very important matter, on June 9 the minister announced the 
establishment of an independent fact finding process to 
investigate the issue of matrimonial property as it relates to 
reserve lands.  Letters of invitation have been sent to our 
partners to participate in the meeting where in partnership we 
could define the terms of reference and the time lines for the 
process.  We look forward to making a further announcement on 
this initiative in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that although the framework agreement applies 
to first nations that have signed it, other first nations are 
watching closely to see how effective the new regime will be in 
getting those communities out from under the paternalism of the 
Indian Act and creating positive opportunities in their 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions in this agreement and the legislation before us 
could well become a model for other agreements in the near 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the interest expressed by other first nations to 
participate in the new land management regime, a provision has 
been included to permit other first nations to be added to this 
bill through order in council.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, before the regime is open to other first nations we 
will review the language of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this House is aware, federal laws must apply equally in both 
common law and civil code in both official languages.  None of 
the 14 first nations are in the province of Quebec and therefore 
the civil code does not apply to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My department has agreed that the formal review will be 
undertaken during the 12 months and the revision to the 
legislation resulting from this review will be included in the 
harmonization act which my colleague the Minister of Justice will 
introduce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this will not take place until the provinces have been 
thoroughly and properly consulted and we have reviewed this 
regime within 12 months of its operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, it is important that first nations get on with 
the job of developing and ratifying their land codes and 
individual agreements with the government. It is important that 
first nations get on with the job of building their economies on 
the strength of the new land management regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of this legislation will be far reaching.  It will 
affect not only first nations communities but will also benefit 
the people, businesses and government that have sought to build a 
stronger relationship, a stronger partnership, with these first 
nation communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of all, this legislation will benefit the first nations 
themselves.  It will give them greater autonomy and control over 
land and revenue monies.  It will create new opportunities for 
economic development and strengthen the capacity and expertise in 
first nations communities across the country. It will help create 
a foundation of self-government and in this way it delivers on 
the commitments made in our aboriginal action plan “Gathering 
Strength”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a few words in appreciation for the first nations 
leaders, some of them in Ottawa this week, who have negotiated 
the framework agreement and seen it through. They have my deepest 
respect and admiration for their tenacity and determination. The 
first nations leaders had a goal and they did not waver in 
pursuing it.  The leaders led this process. This is a first 
nations initiative driven by leadership, vision and commitment to 
their own people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the House, particularly the Reform Party, to support this 
legislation which ratifies the framework agreement that makes the 
first nations vision a reality.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted 
to speak today to Bill C-49.  I am delighted because it is one we 
were no longer expecting.  We had been talking about this bill 
for a long time but nothing was happening. I was even told 
yesterday or the day before that there was only about a 50% 
chance that this bill would be debated on Friday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, imagine my surprise this morning at learning, with great 
delight, that Bill C-49 was on the Order Paper.  Naturally, my 
speech was ready.  Native peoples also told me there was some 
urgency in having this bill introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the parliamentary leaders who arranged to 
have this bill come up as early as today. 
This week, I met with native people, who made representations to 
me. I even invited them here in the lobby.  We are very happy to 
have the bill now before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the leaders who understood the urgency of the situation 
and who presented the bill finally, today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill follows directly from the framework agreement signed 
in February 1996.  What is original about it is that it applies 
to 14 native communities scattered across the country.  It is a 
fairly unique bill.  Bills usually apply to one nation or 
sometimes to a number of communities, but this one concerns 14 
communities across the country.  I have here a list of the 
communities, which are scattered through British Columbia, 
Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia, we have the first nations of Westbank, 
Musqueam, Squamish, Lheidli T'enneh and N'Quatqua. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Alberta, we only have the Siksika nation, but this is a great 
nation to which I will get back later on, because I had the 
privilege of meeting its members when I traveled to that region. 
I will elaborate a little more on the Siksika who is, in my 
opinion, one of Canada's great nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saskatchewan, we have the first nations of Muskoday and 
Cowessess. In Manitoba, we have the Opaskwayak Cree. In Ontario, 
we have the Nipissing, the Mississaugas of Scugog Island, the 
Chippewas of Georgina Island and the Chippewas of Mnjikaning. 
In New Brunswick, we have the first nation of Saint Mary's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 is an act on first nation land management which will 
allow first nations to establish their own land and natural 
resources management system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a part in the Indian Act that deals with land 
management. What is unusual about this bill is precisely the 
fact that the Indian Act will no longer apply to these lands, 
which will now come under the legislation before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some absurd things in the Indian Act, particularly 
the part dealing with land management. People had to obtain the 
federal government's approval to sell grain or to raise and sell 
cattle. As we know, the Indian Act is a century-old act and it is 
obsolete. Of course, it would be very difficult to scrap this 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eliminating the act leaves nothing in the way of a legal 
guarantee.  Aboriginal people are therefore stuck with an 
outmoded piece of legislation which affords them a minimum of 
protection.  But it is heart-warming to see bills like the one 
before us today come along, because whole sections of the Indian 
Act will no longer apply to these 14 nations in particular. 
This means one more step toward aboriginal self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian Act will, however, continue to apply in all other 
areas.  As I said, the minister will no longer have the 
discretionary power to say “No, you cannot sell wheat.  No, you 
cannot sell cattle.” Of course, the ministers have been far more 
attuned to what was going on in the communities in recent years. 
I do not think any minister would have been so heavy-handed as to 
forbid them to sell grain or cattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, however, that is the way the act is worded. 
The principle we are considering will enable aboriginal people 
to get out from under this outmoded part of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have a bill that gives more autonomy than the Indian 
Act, which means that certain specific chapters of that act no 
longer apply, consultation with the communities generally takes 
place.  According to the details we have at present, there was 
such consultation.  These nations are fully in favour of Bill 
C-49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the beginning, not only are they in agreement with 
the bill, but they are also urging us to see that it goes 
through quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the reaction of the Reform Party rather disappointing. 
This summer, I believe the chief of First Nations met with the 
leader of the Reform Party in an attempt to explain to him the 
need for a different attitude toward the aboriginal people.  For 
example, the Reform Party refers to the white paper from the 
time when the present Prime Minister was Minister of Indian 
Affairs, saying “what was wanted at that time was a Canada that 
was uniform from coast to coast”. That is not our philosophy. 
We in the Bloc Quebecois believe in the principle of founding 
peoples, the Quebec people and the peoples in the rest of 
Canada. 
The aboriginal people are being forgotten, when statements are 
made like “In such and such a year the Liberals introduced a 
white paper—this much is true—which made the aboriginal people 
full-fledged citizens”.  They tried to do this, however, by 
bringing them into Canadian society and destroying their 
culture, their language and their way of life.  By that very 
fact, there was no recognition that these nations were founding 
peoples, exactly the same, in my view, as the Quebec people and 
the people in the rest of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of approach is unfortunate and we are naturally taking 
the opportunity to state our opposition to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain problems with the bill, including the issue of 
what happens in cases of marriage breakdown.  Aboriginals will 
have to address the issue of division of property in cases of 
marriage breakdown.  Unfortunately, there is a sort of legal 
vacuum right now when a couple decides to separate.  Provincial 
laws do not apply on reserves and there is nothing in the Indian 
Act covering these cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore have certain questions about the provisions of the 
bill to which I will come back a bit later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is going to support the underlying principles 
of Bill C-49 because we see them as another step towards the 
economic development and in particular the autonomy of 
aboriginals.  We point out regularly in our speeches that 
aboriginals are in a situation of dependence, which has created 
all sorts of problems on the reserves and among the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginals are not found only on reserves.  There are just as 
many of them off reserves as on.  There are major housing 
problems, for instance, which drive people away from reserves. 
According to the statistics, almost 40% of status Indians no 
longer live on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bill that stresses greater autonomy and self-government will 
have the support of the Bloc Quebecois.  Autonomy can take 
several forms.  Self-government is often mentioned. 
Self-government is important but, unless it is accompanied by 
economic development, it leads nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why bills introduced in the House will often address 
both issues: self-government as well as land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw it in the case of the Yukon a few years ago, when people 
came to study the bill before the House, which dealt not only 
with self-government but also with land claims allowing them to 
achieve financial independence so they could finally break away 
from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the gist of the bill.  That is, it moves away from the 
Indian Act and introduces other notions on the management of 
their own lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>White people and native people see things differently.  When 
native people speak of lands, their idea is that the land 
belongs to everyone and exists to be shared. 
This is in fact what guided initial relations between native 
peoples and the new arrivals, the Europeans who arrived here in 
Canada.  The native peoples had no objection to letting the 
whites take certain lands, cultivate them and raise livestock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even now, on the reserves, land is held collectively, whereas we 
see things a bit differently.  The way we see it is that the 
land belongs to us.  When we buy land, we quickly have it 
surveyed and registered and have the deed signed.  A whole lot 
of planning goes into making it known that this tract of land is 
ours.  Sometimes we go so far as to fence it in.  Native people 
see it all very differently.  They see it more collectively, 
with the land belonging to everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have explained enough why this bill should be passed 
quickly, and the Bloc Quebecois will of course help to get it 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying earlier that, in democratic terms, I see no 
problem.  The 14 communities were consulted on this bill, and 
they agree on the need to act quickly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also told you I would get back to the issue of marriage 
breakdown. This is an important issue for aboriginal women. 
There is a history to this bill and to the issues concerning 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-75, introduced in 1997, did not include any provision on 
marriage breakdown. I will tell you later the story of some 
women and women's groups who went to court to challenge the fact 
that the bill did not include provisions to help settle the 
issue in case of marriage breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, Bill C-75 died on the <I>Order Paper</I> when the 
previous Parliament came to an end. 
However, the Bloc Quebecois decided, with the support of some 
parties in the House, to quickly bring back that legislation 
during this Parliament and to ensure its swift passage because, 
as I indicated earlier, of the urgent nature of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the court challenge and the quick reintroduction of the 
bill before the House, government officials and aboriginal 
representatives looked at provisions that could be included in 
the bill to achieve the objective of protecting aboriginal women 
in case of marriage breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read clause 17 of the bill, which is aimed at correcting 
this flaw in the initial bill. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>17. (1) A first nation shall, in accordance with the Framework 
Agreement and following the community consultation process 
provided for in its land code, establish general rules and 
procedures, in cases of breakdown of marriage, respecting the 
use, occupation and possession of first nation land and the 
division of interests in first nation land. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-75, which has now become Bill C-49, was amended to provide 
for a community consultation process to establish the land code 
that will include a mechanism in case of marriage breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, that procedure may not be comprehensive and it may 
not be the same everywhere, because the 14 first nations will 
ultimately have to prepare their own land code. 
I could add that there will be up to 12 months for incorporating 
rules concerning breakdown of marriage in the land code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to touch on the women's objections, to which I have 
already referred.  One of the ways women's groups reacted to the 
first reading of the bill last June was by writing to the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I>. These groups included the British Columbia Native 
Women's Society and the Native Women's Association of Canada, 
headed by my good friend Marilyn Buffalo.  Their reaction was 
“While we realize you have made an effort with clause 17 to 
include procedures in the event of marriage breakdown, what is 
there does not suit us in the least”.  They decided to file an 
injunction to get the courts to block the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case has not yet been heard.  The bill is currently under 
consideration. 
Although there has been no court decision, it seems to me that 
it would be hard for the women to block the proceedings of the 
House of Commons with a court order.  That is not part of our 
tradition, but we do need to realize that they have objections 
and that clause 17, which I have just read, needs to be 
tightened up considerably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised this human rights matter with the chair of the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission, Mrs. Falardeau-Ramsay, whom I had the 
pleasure of meeting—last year, I think it was—in a delegation to 
Geneva.  She indicated to me that she was a bit uncomfortable 
with the fact that aboriginal women were in a kind of legal 
vacuum at the moment.  In the event of marriage breakdown, they 
are forced to leave the reserve and to leave all their family 
heritage behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has family heritage legislation, called in fact la Loi du 
patrimoine familial, with provisions for marriage breakdown. 
As I was saying, this does not apply on the reserve, however. 
These women are, therefore, left in a legal vacuum and an effort 
absolutely must be made to correct this. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as I told women's groups, we cannot, as a matter of 
principle, in the case of a bill providing greater autonomy to 
first nations, oppose the legislation on the grounds that the 
provision dealing with them may not be supportive enough of 
their cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not block Bill C-49 on the grounds that its provisions 
are not specific enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister did react to the legal challenge. She decided to 
set up some commission to take a more comprehensive look at the 
issue and to avoid having women's groups block each of the bills 
on native issues when they are introduced in the House. The 
minister struck a committee to look at what happens when a 
marriage breaks down on a native reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing, the minister acknowledged the existence of a legal 
vacuum. Therefore, I ask her to act quickly regarding this 
issue. When we inquired about the progress made regarding that 
commission, we were told that the investigator had not even been 
appointed yet. I remember reading a press release—in July or 
August—in which the minister announced that this commission 
would be established. Now, several months later, that commission 
has not even begun its work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge the minister to speed up the process in this 
regard. 
Whenever a bill dealing with native issues is introduced in the 
House, there is a risk that it could be systematically opposed, 
because the basic issue was not settled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will, in parliamentary committee, take a 
close look at clause 17, which I read earlier and which deals 
with the breakdown of marriages. The approach is innovative, and 
concerns land management. The provisions of the Indian Act are 
being replaced because they are very restrictive. The government 
is now proposing a bill and a land code that will allow first 
nations not only to manage the resources on their lands, but 
also to decide how they wish to dispose of such lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, for example, I met representatives from one reserve 
who will have to renew their leases next March.  So members can 
just imagine, if the bill is not passed, what a hard time they 
will have renewing, because they will have to come before the 
House of Commons, the minister and cabinet to obtain permission 
to continue the leases.  The idea with this land code is that it 
will no longer be necessary to seek the minister's permission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another provision of the bill concerns expropriation.  This was 
and remains a hateful provision.  The law is antiquated.  It has 
existed for some 100 years.  Right now, a municipality, a 
province or the federal government can say “We want to 
expropriate part of the reserve”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before a major tribunal known as the specific native claims 
tribunal, which reports to the House of Commons and where most 
cases were heard, a municipality would decide at one point “We 
have finished cutting down the forest at this point, we would 
now like to encroach on the reserve.  We request permission to 
expropriate the reserve or part of it so we can continue our 
work”.  This sort of request was almost always automatically 
granted, resulting in great injustice and the fact that we had 
to go to court or before commissions in order to untangle these 
things and return to the native peoples the land that belonged 
to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this bill puts paid to injustice.  The minister of Indian 
affairs is now the only one who can and, if she does so, she 
will have to provide land or financial compensation with the 
approval of the reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is trying, clearly.  We can no longer allow 
municipalities or provinces for different, often valid, reasons 
to expropriate part of a reserve.  That period is over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also contains provisions for environmental assessment 
plans. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1245
<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to mention that, if ever a group was 
respectful of the environment, it is certainly aboriginals. 
However, when giving them responsibility for land management, 
care must be taken to harmonize environmental legislation. 
Naturally, we cannot allow standards on a reserve to be well 
below those in a neighbouring village subject to provincial 
laws.  The land code will resolve this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will also be a procedure for harmonizing environmental 
legislation, so that standards on the reserves and in the 
province will be largely the same. 
There is even provision for the provinces affected, because many 
are affected by the bill, to be involved in the planning of any 
subsidiary environmental agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the structure of the land management agreement, it was 
first proposed by chiefs in 1987.  There were several 
negotiations.  I would even go so far as to say that we are 
surprised that any agreement at all has been reached after 
eleven years.  It seems like a relatively long time.  Other 
bills introduced in the House have also been a long time coming; 
the Yukon bill, for instance, has taken 21 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations with aboriginals are still taking place today and 
have been for 30 years.  It has been an on-again, off-again 
process.  Ten years is quite a long time.  That is why it is 
important that today we give aboriginals what they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to point out the agreement is not a treaty and that 
it will not be protected under section 35.  This is a bill that 
leaves participation optional.  Right now, this means that 14 
first nations are covered in the bill and listed in the 
schedule, but other first nations will always be able to say 
that, having examined Bill C-49, they too would like to manage 
their lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several ways this could come about.  As I have said, 
it could be through self-government and land claims.  They could 
also say that they have lands and that they wish to take part in 
the process and manage their lands without relying on the 
provisions of the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken with first nations' representatives and they are 
not always aware of what is going on elsewhere, so they find 
this a highly practical approach, and to their liking.  Some 
first nations are in fact involved in exploring the possibility 
of adopting the same type of land management arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to speak of the 14 first nations 
involved, at this point.  I listed them quickly already, but I 
would now like to give a brief historical overview of each. 
They are the ground-breakers, the ones that decided to move ahead 
toward self-government.  I feel it is important to give the House 
a brief rundown on each of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there are the Siksika, of Alberta.  They are a very 
sizeable community in Alberta, with 2,795 members living on the 
reserve and another 1,635 living off the reserve. 
As I have already said, close to 40% of aboriginal people have 
left the reserve for one reason or another.  The reserves are 
getting over-crowded.  Aboriginal demographics are such that the 
population is growing twice as fast as the Canadian population 
as a whole, and so people are being systematically forced off 
the reserve.  This is what has happened with the Siksika. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their language is part of the Algonquian family of languages. 
Present-day Edmonton and Calgary are on their land.  They 
administer a number of programs.  Theirs is a beautiful area.  I 
had the pleasure of visiting this great people, and they took me 
to see a sacred mountain that is currently the object of a land 
claim, Castle Mountain, in Banff National Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation continues to be of concern to them. 
Incidentally, I would like the Siksikas listening today to know 
that their file is still with me, and we are still trying to 
settle the dispute. 
What they would like is for the part of Banff Park where the 
sacred mountain is located to be aboriginal territory.  I feel 
this would be in the best interests of both aboriginal people 
and whites.  This is a beautiful area, and having a sacred 
mountain on aboriginal land within it might be of great interest 
to the white population.

They want to share Banff National Park, which has moreover 
always been part of their land claim, and they want this 
mountain to be theirs.  I mention this in passing, because I 
felt it was important to raise this issue and wanted them to 
know it is not a dead issue.

southeast of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.  It covers 23,832 
acres. 
Here again, 411 members live on the reserve and 623 live off the 
reserve, which confirms the trend that 40% of aboriginal people 
live off the reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their economy is mainly agriculture-based, hence the importance 
of passing this bill so that they may lease or develop their 
lands and to make use of them without being constrained by the 
Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other first nation in Saskatchewan, the Cowessess, also 
makes its living from agriculture and tourism.  Its population 
totals 2,544, 411 on the reserve and 1,133 off the reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chippewas of Georgina Island are located in the county of 
York—Simcoe, north of Toronto.  Historically, these are the 
descendants of a larger band, the Chippewas of Lake Huron and 
Lake Simcoe.  In 1818, the Chippewas gave up a large parcel of 
their land south of Georgian Bay. 
In 1830, Sir John Colborne settled them on lands between 
Coldwater and Lake Couchiching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They subsequently divided into three separate bands.  One group 
went to Georgina Island around 1838, another went to Beausoleil 
Island in 1842 and the chief of the Yellowhead and his band went 
to Rama in 1838.  The reserve was confirmed with the Williams 
treaty of 1923. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although 81% of the population speaks English, most form part of 
the Algonquian family of languages, but few have kept their 
language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mississaugas of Scugog Island, like the Chippewa of Georgina 
Island, have been displaced a number of times.  This big reserve 
measures some 1,951,000 acres.  On two occasions they gave up 
part of their lands. Their reserve, like the others, was 
confirmed by the Williams treaty in 1923. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ojibways may be found in Ontario, in the great lakes region. 
I will shortly be speaking in a few aboriginal languages.  I 
have asked for the translation of a passage I particularly 
wanted to read.  A number of communities have sent remarks, 
which I will read, along with their translation.  I hope I will 
be forgiven if I have difficulty getting my tongue around some 
words, as some things are quite hard to pronounce.  However, I 
think that they will enjoy having an MP wishing them good luck 
in the House in their own language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to mention the Westbank first nation, because 
the chief, Robert Louie, is directing the operations concerning 
the bill before us.  I raised the problem of marriage breakup. 
It was about his first nation that the supreme court—in 1981, I 
think—gave its first decision in Derrickson.  Mrs. Derrickson 
is Robert Louie's mother-in-law. 
The supreme court was forced to acknowledge a legal void, that, 
in the case of a marriage breakup, provincial law did not apply 
and the Indian Act contained no provision to settle the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it important to talk to you about the Westbank first 
nation, because Mrs. Derrickson, who behind the Derrickson 
decision of 1981, comes from there.  This first nation is 
situated in the Okanagan valley.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This summer, I travelled to British Columbia.  Unfortunately, 
Mrs. Derrickson was ill and I was unable to visit Robert Louie, 
but there will be another time and I look forward to going back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that time is running out and that, since there are 14 
nations, it would take a while to give the history of each one, 
and I do not wish to go over my allotted time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to say, in various native languages, what our wishes 
for aboriginals are. Since I have eight minutes left, I think I 
can manage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have four translations to read.  Please bear with me as I try 
to get my tongue around them, because Ojibway, Cree, Salishan 
and another passage in Ojibway are involved. My pronunciation 
may not be completely perfect, but I did want to say a few words 
in these languages to wish aboriginals well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am about to say in these native languages can be 
summarized as follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is always supportive of aboriginals in their 
quest for greater autonomy. 
This bill furthers that quest and we wish the 14 communities 
involved the best of luck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sometimes make life difficult for the interpreters when I 
speak a native language.  I will now try to speak Cree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Cree</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be attempting to say the same in Salishan, which is used 
by the Squamish nation on the west coast; it was they who sent 
me the translation of my text. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Salishan</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took only a few seconds to read the passage aloud in French 
but, when we were sent the translations, we were told that there 
are many more figuratives in aboriginal languages.  That is why 
each translation takes a little longer to read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next comes Ojibway.  This covers the whole Great Lakes area in 
Ontario.  The Objibways sent me a translation of the same 
message.  Theirs reads as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Ojibway</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Mnaabmewziding” means “good luck”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one last message in Ojibway, but it is in a different 
dialect spoken by the Chippewas of Georgina Island. It was sent 
to me by Chief William McCue, to whom I send my best wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Ojibway</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will understand not only that the Bloc Quebecois 
supports the bill, but that it will try to ensure its quick 
passage, so that these people can be released as quickly as 
possible from the provisions of the Indian Act, and can achieve 
financial autonomy and self-government, and also deal with land 
claims. They will thus be able to live a life that will be far 
removed from the current dependency on the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of my party I am pleased to have the opportunity to 
address this act to implement the framework agreement on first 
nations land management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a long overdue step forward in the process of 
returning to first nations control of the land that is rightfully 
theirs.  It is also a major advancement to the eventual goal of 
first nations self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party has long supported first nations 
inherent right to self-government.  We have supported the First 
Nations through this century while successive Liberal and 
Conservative governments have pursued shameful and reprehensible 
policies of assimilation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official policy of assimilation may be a thing of the past 
but it cannot be denied that aboriginal people are still an 
oppressed minority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at any social indicator, whether it be income, life 
span, disease rates or suicide rates, aboriginal people make up 
the bottom rung in virtually every category.  These social 
problems are wounds that still have not been healed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a testament to the strength of the first nations cultures 
that they have survived and persevered through all these 
generations of oppression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this bill because it is a ground breaking step in 
giving first nations the rights they deserve and have so long 
been denied. Turning control of their lands over to first nations 
governments will go to a long way toward restoring 
self-sufficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would particularly like to extend my thanks and 
congratulations to the Opaskwayak Cree Nation, signatories to 
this framework agreement, and to Chief William Lathlin as well as 
former chief and now Grand Chief of MKO Francis Flett. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both these first nations leaders have been tireless in their 
efforts to improve the lives of their people both in the 
Opaskwayak Cree Nation and the whole of the MKO region of 
northern Manitoba. Their leadership in bringing the Opaskwayak 
Cree Nation into this agreement was important to its progression 
to this stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure members of this House will join me in congratulating 
Chief Lathlin as well as Grand Chief Flett and in wishing Grand 
Chief Flett all the best in his recovery from recent heart 
surgery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contributions of Chief Lathlin and Grand Chief Flett are 
particularly noteworthy in light of the efforts of the Reform 
Party and others with a right wing imperialistic agenda who have 
been trying to undermine the legitimacy of first nations 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like wolves in sheep's clothing, Reform cloaks its anti-first 
nations rhetoric in populist language.  But Reform's true 
intention toward the first nations is clear.  Reform's real 
intention is the assimilation of the first nations.  That is why 
Reform constantly tries to undermine first nations governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party and their right wing allies try to take extreme 
examples and try to paint all first nations governments with the 
same brush. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Lathlin and Grand Chief Flett are two of the many 
excellent first nations leaders who proved the Reform Party's 
generalizations about first nations governments to be dead wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a rare moment of fairness to the first nations by a 
government that has otherwise chosen to ignore them.  I want to 
make it clear that I support the bill for the contributions it 
makes toward the eventual goal of self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is an important outstanding issue that the bill 
before us today does not address.  The Dene people of northern 
Manitoba have a longstanding concern regarding their land 
entitlements in Nunavut. Long before Europeans set foot on this 
continent, the Dene hunted caribou on lands that will soon become 
part of Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, caribou herds migrate vast distances throughout 
the year.  Traditionally the Dene were a nomadic people and 
followed the caribou herds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the Canadian government's most abhorrent crimes against 
any first nation was when it forced the Dene into reserves back 
in the 1950s.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forcing a nomadic people into a settled, sedentary way of living 
is social engineering of the worst kind and represented one of 
the lowest points of Canada's shameful policy of assimilation 
toward first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social problems caused were staggering and, as I have said 
in this House before, still require compensation from the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides these tragic social consequences, another outcome was 
that the Dene people were divided.  Two bands, the Sayisi Dene 
First Nation and the Northlands First Nation ended up in Manitoba 
south of the 60th parallel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should not have to remind the House that caribou do not 
recognize provincial and territorial borders.  Even though these 
two Dene bands reside in Manitoba, their traditional hunting 
ground extends north to the 60th parallel into the territory soon 
to be known as Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill establishes a framework to transfer land management 
power to bands but what needs to be clarified and guaranteed is 
the Dene people's right to apply this framework in their 
traditional lands north of 60 as well as south.  I am looking 
forward to addressing this shortcoming when the bill goes to 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should not take my accolade and support for this 
bill to mean that I think its duty toward first nations people 
will be met with this one piece of legislation.  This is far from 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social problems facing many first nations continue to exceed 
anything experienced in the rest of Canada and each problem 
requires the government's immediate attention.  Housing 
conditions are third world standard in many communities, with no 
running water and inadequate sanitation.  Disease levels are 
significantly higher than in the rest of Canada, with HIV, 
diabetes and kidney disease particularly serious problems.  There 
is also a chronic shortage of qualified health care 
professionals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unemployment levels in many first nation communities are 
astronomical, exceeding 90% in some areas.  These issues need to 
be properly addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A report was recently released by MKO, the Manitoba ministry of 
family services and Indian and Northern Affairs Canada that 
looked into food and nutritional problems in isolated first 
nations communities.  This report paints a distressing picture. 
It states that the high cost of perishable food and the 
inadequacy of social assistance food allowance to cover the cost 
means that the availability of fresh nutritious food in remote 
communities is very poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact on health in these first nations is massive.  The 
report states that to cover the cost of nutritious food for a 
family of four will require a 35% increase in monthly social 
assistance food allowance.  Adequate nutrition is a basic 
necessity that the government must ensure is provided for every 
first nation person.  There is no reason why the conditions in 
first nations communities I have listed should exist in Canada. 
They are of third world standard and are totally unacceptable in 
a country of the relative wealth of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently sent a letter to the minister of Indian affairs 
requesting her to implement the recommendations of the MKO 
report.  Today I have not received a response and I cannot help 
but question, despite the advances in this bill, whether the 
Liberal government has any serious intention of meeting its 
responsibilities to the first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to respond to some of the comments I 
heard from previous speakers, certainly from the member of the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With his comments about everyone in Canada being one people, I 
cannot help but wonder how veterans felt when they came back from 
the war and had to give up their treaty rights and their right to 
be part of their own first nations.  The speeches by the 
governing authority given in residential schools in Regina 
commented on the fact that when these men came back from war they 
would want to be treated as equals and we just could not do that. 
No wonder we have the feelings we have in first nations today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns raised by the native women's group are valid and 
should be addressed to their satisfaction.  I also believe that 
had there not been interference by previous governments in Canada 
in the past the equality they are fighting for would have 
happened already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform's comments that the majority of aboriginal people do not 
want this process are just not valid.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition parties have questioned this government on its 
patronage appointments, its wasted dollars, its misplaced 
priorities and even the credibility and integrity of its 
solicitor general.   Would I suggest we throw away the right of 
Canadians to democracy and to elect their own representatives? 
Never.  I will put my faith in Canadians to see this government 
for what it is, a government shirking its responsibilities to 
Canada and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust the members of first nations are taking an active part 
in electing their leaders.  Turning land management powers over 
to first nations is an important step toward self-government.  I 
offer my support for this bill, but let us be clear that this is 
no substitute for tangible action to alleviate the horrific 
social conditions to which many first nations people are subject. 
There are still many wounds to be healed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened closely to the member's speech and I heard the passion 
in her voice.  I believe she believes that what she is saying is 
correct.  It is important that what we say in debate be recorded 
in a factual manner and that we not mislead the people watching 
this debate or other members of parliament.  Certain statements 
were made to Reform, its right wing agenda and its friends.  I am 
not sure who she was talking about.  She talked about there being 
a century of NDP support for the social agenda and for the first 
nations in Canada.  She may have her terms of reference a bit out 
of whack. Maybe she went back a little further than the party 
does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example of the real issue.  There was an 
emergency meeting last night with aboriginal affairs committee 
members of the Senate and the House concerning the tragic 
situation that has developed in British Columbia.  I am not here 
to stick up for the government or for the Reform Party. I 
attended that meeting last night as a member of the Progressive 
Conservative Party.  A Liberal member, a Bloc member and a Reform 
member were there but there were no NDP members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is going to tell the House that she supports first 
nations then let us see her at the committee meetings, at the 
drudgery and the work that there is no fun in, where there are no 
cameras and no glorious speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have no problem 
addressing the fact that one member may not have been at one 
meeting.  What is more important is an honest and true commitment 
to changing the position of the government toward aboriginal 
people.  I will stand behind my party's position and my own 
position.  I do not have to worry that the aboriginal people from 
my area and throughout Canada will question that.  We have seen 
the proof come out of New Democratic Party members as well as 
governments.  That does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member takes the right wing, imperialistic note to mean 
the Conservative Party, by all means he should go forth and take 
it.  Successive Conservative and Liberal governments have had 
opportunities over the years to change the situation but they 
never did.  It is time the government does that.  It has been a 
long time coming.  It has been happening because we have more New 
Democrats here to ensure that happens. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, some of the rhetoric I have heard from the member for 
Churchill is not worthy of an intelligent conversation.  Prior to 
the last parliament in this House there was not a single piece of 
aboriginal legislation that did not get all-party consent in this 
place.  Nobody ever challenged the status quo.  There are do 
gooders and people who do good.  I place myself in the latter 
category.  I challenge the status quo which has led us to the 
reserves having the worst statistics in the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Churchill has blinders on in terms of thinking 
we cannot challenge the status quo and fix what is wrong with 
many of the aboriginal communities in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is wrong to challenge the fact that we do not have 
accountability in many areas, if it is wrong to challenge that we 
do not have a democracy in full flower in many of those 
communities, if it is wrong to say that equality is not something 
to strive for, if it is wrong to be opposed to sexual and other 
abuse which is rampant in some of these communities, if it is 
wrong to think that we can fix fetal alcohol syndrome, I would 
apologize to the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are all worthy goals.  Members of my caucus and I are 
pursuing these things with vigour.  We are getting better results 
than the all party cloak of silence that resided in this place 
prior to our arriving in the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are challenging what is wrong and we are starting to see 
major fixes.  That is not to say that the signatories, the bands 
that are signatories to the legislation, fall into that category. 
In many respects I am quite sure they do not.  Some of them may 
not at all.  I do not want to be appearing to tarnish all as the 
same because they are not.  One of the reasons the legislation 
exists is that these are some of the more progressive, wealthier 
bands that have a lot of private property concepts and other 
things going for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many respects there are objectives in the legislation which I 
find admirable.  I have some problems with the legislation and I 
will talk about them later.  If the member wishes to comment on 
my comments, she is welcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, nobody is opposed to all 
the things the member mentioned.  There is not a first nation 
leader in the country who is not striving for the same things. 
The difference between the Reform Party and the New Democratic 
Party is that I will not tell first nations people what they have 
to do.  That has been the problem for too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If ever there is to be change within a community or a country, 
it needs to come from within.  That is the truest strong change. 
That has been how democratic governments have progressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sit here and complain.  I tried to indicate that when I 
commented on patronage.  We in Canada have had the good 
government we talk about for 131 years and we are still worrying 
about patronage and different things happening.  Does that mean 
that aboriginal people, first nations people, should not have the 
right to go through a process of their own self-government 
because one party suggests that it knows best, that it knows the 
way?  First nations people can make that decision and do it a 
heck of a lot better than we have done in the past. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
agree that 131 years have not brought anything close to equality 
of opportunity or equality of outcomes.  It is partly because 
governments did not listen to the people.  The B.C. Native 
Women's Society contacted us and said that we have to defeat this 
legislation.  That is not failing to listen to the little person 
like we were accused of doing.  That is taking very seriously the 
concerns of the person who will be affected by the legislation. 
The Reform Party is committed to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I resent any implication that we are not acting in the best 
interest of the people to be affected by the legislation.  I 
challenge members from all other parties to attend the grassroots 
aboriginal meetings being held throughout Canada to find out what 
the grassroots aboriginals are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I assure the member from 
the Reform Party that I have spoken to a number of grassroots 
first nations people.  I have some 26 first nations in my riding. 
I have family members, aunts, uncles and cousins, who are part of 
two of the first nations in Saskatchewan.  I have been there and 
I have spoken to people there. 
I know these first nations have worked hard to improve their 
communities.  I know that all other first nations will do the 
same.  I believe that with my heart and soul.  I know that is the 
right way to go for aboriginal people.

any democratic government has problems as it progresses over 
time.  The first nations people have the right to make that 
decision.  This is the best move for them.  They have discussed 
it in numerous communities.  They have talked about it with their 
people and want these changes so that they can continue on and 
become more self-sufficient.  That is what is needed for all 
first nations.  That is the true way to make change for first 
nations people.  They should be given the right to control their 
own interests.

rights is not really theirs or that it is not equality if they

to have that support.  As I indicated, I am sure they will make 
the changes that are needed because anybody who knows first 
nations women that have been involved over the years knows they 
are strong people who have worked hard to improve conditions in 
their communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to Bill C-49, an act providing for the 
ratification and the bringing into effect of the framework 
agreement on first nations land management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation has been almost 10 years in the making 
beginning in 1989 as the lands revenue and trust review.  That 
agreement encompassed a number of areas, land management being 
one of them.  While that agreement fell through, a number of 
first nations persevered with negotiations for land management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was formerly introduced as Bill C-75 on December 10, 
1996, but died on the order paper.  Bill C-49, while similar to 
the original bill, has some important amendments to address the 
concerns of native women.  I will discuss them in greater detail 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the 14 first nations that are signatories to the 
framework agreement.  They are Westbank, Musqueam, Lheidli 
T'enneh, N'Quatqua and Squamish, all from British Columbia; 
Siksika in Alberta; Muskoday and Cowessess in Saskatchewan; the 
Opaskwayak Cree from Manitoba; the Nipissing and the Mississaugas 
of Scugog Island, the Chippewas of Mnjikaning and the Chippewas 
from Georgina Island, all from Ontario; and the Saint Mary's in 
New Brunswick.  These first nations have worked hard to have this 
legislation reach this stage of the process and are anxious to 
see it become law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 allows the 13 first nations who signed the framework 
on February 12, 1996 and the Saint Mary's from New Brunswick who 
joined in May 1998 to assume control of land management and move 
out from under the provisions of the Indian Act.  This does not 
affect other first nations that are not signatories to the 
agreement.  Nor does it diminish the authority of the Indian Act 
for areas other than land management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is an incremental step toward self-government 
and should be a positive move for the affected bands as they have 
greater influence over economic development on their reserves. 
The framework agreement will allow the first nations the 
opportunity to manage their land and resources through the 
establishment of land codes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement may become a model for other such 
agreements on land management once the legislation passes and the 
first nations are given the opportunity to implement it. Thirty 
or forty first nations have already expressed an interest in the 
framework agreement.  I expect many more to do so as they are 
able to see the benefits of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware of the faults of the Indian Act.  As I 
mentioned, the legislation will allow first nations to move out 
from under the restrictions of the Indian Act and provide 
opportunities for first nations to manage their own land and 
resources.  This will be done through land codes that they will 
develop to meet their own requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first step for each of the first nations will be to develop 
that land code.  It will outline the rules necessary for land 
management, covering such things as what land is affected by the 
land code, rules for use and occupation of the land, revenue 
collection, amendments and a dispute resolution process among 
other things.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does this transfer authority from the federal 
government to the first nations, but through the land code it 
also encourages stronger community participation.  Land codes 
must be ratified by the communities and voted on by first nation 
people living both on and off reserve.  This is an onerous job 
but one that the first nations felt was very important and 
warranted the extra work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth mentioning that the land codes must be ratified by 
the community but not by the federal government.  Following 
ratification each reserve must enter into an individual transfer 
agreement with Canada.  The transfer agreement will include the 
development and operational funding to be paid by Canada to the 
first nation and the details on the transfer of administration. 
The community must ratify both the land code and the transfer 
agreement.  First nations will manage their land and resources 
under Bill C-49 including the associated revenues, except for oil 
and gas revenues which remain a federal responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only 14 first nations have signed the agreement, a very small 
percentage of the 633 first nations in Canada.  One of the 
reasons for this small number relates to land management under 
the Indian Act.  While it is possible under the Indian Act to 
request delegated authority from the federal government to manage 
lands, only 9 of the 633 first nations have done so. 
Dissatisfaction with the limitations of the delegated authority 
was the impetus behind the framework agreement and the 
legislation we are discussing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason for the relatively small number of signatories to 
the agreement is concern by a number of first nations that these 
agreements would be similar to the proposed amendments to the 
Indian Act that have met with resistance.  This agreement however 
is reserve specific, affecting only the bands listed in the 
agreement.  Furthermore the agreement is not a treaty and does 
not affect treaty or constitutional rights of aboriginal people. 
The reserves remain a federal responsibility under section 91(24) 
of the Constitution Act, 1867, and the lands continue to be 
protected from surrender of sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time these 14 first nations will have the 
opportunity to manage their own land and the legal status to 
govern their own land and resources.  The only difference from 
other land owners will be the inability to sell that property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the legislation is long overdue and 
eagerly awaited by the first nations that are anxious to begin 
implementation.  There are however some concerns regarding the 
legislation as outlined by the British Columbia Native Women's 
Society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I have had some difficulty contacting the British 
Columbia Native Women's Society, it is my understanding of its 
position that it feels the legislation transfers responsibility 
for equality on reserve, particularly for native women upon the 
breakdown of marriage, from the federal government to first 
nations.  It sees this as an abdication of federal power that 
demonstrates the government's lack of commitment to equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there is no minimum standard provided in the 
legislation for the division of property such as exists in 
provincial law upon the breakdown of marriage, which increases 
the possibility that inequality will not be dealt with in an 
acceptable manner perhaps by the first nations involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are legitimate concerns that stem from the flaws of the 
Indian Act that established and perpetuated an inferior position 
for women in the legislation.  The first nations that are 
signatories to this agreement listened to the concerns of the 
British Columbia Native Women's Society and drafted amendments to 
the framework agreement to address its reservations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments require the first nations to establish community 
process in their land codes regulating use, occupancy and 
possession of reserve land should a marriage breakdown occur.  At 
the same time it places the onus on the first nations and their 
respective members to adequately provide regulations for division 
of matrimonial property.  This ensures that the process meets the 
requirements of the first nations members and avoids the age old 
problem of having the federal government dictate to the first 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I feel it would have been useful and informative to have 
met with the British Columbia Native Women's Society to discuss 
its concerns, my request for meetings were not answered.  I look 
forward to hearing the society outline its position as we discuss 
the legislation in detail at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are concerns with the piece of legislation, the 
objective or the impetus of Bill C-49 to allow first nations to 
move closer to economic independence is long overdue. As the 
Nisga'a treaty in British Columbia demonstrates, first nations 
want the opportunity to govern their lands and people and are 
prepared to accept the challenges of doing so.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The positive effects of such legislation will be evident as more 
first nations take steps toward self-reliance and independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chiefs of the first nations with whom I have spoken have all 
expressed their support for this legislation and the 
opportunities it offers them and their respective first nations. 
As I have mentioned they are prepared to begin implementation of 
this bill once it completes the legislative process.  Currently 
three first nations have land codes prepared and five more are in 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to examining this legislation in committee. I 
welcome the opportunity to hear my colleagues' comments on this 
legislation, Bill C-49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summing up I would like to add a few points.  The hon. member 
from the Bloc mentioned a concept which many of us take for 
granted, that of fee simple land ownership.  I would dare to say 
that there are many people who sit within the halls of this 
parliament itself who do not understand the Indian Act. Certainly 
I am not pretending in any way, shape or form to be an expert on 
the Indian Act but I have read it and it is a terrible piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole concept of fee simple ownership that we take for 
granted is that one can actually own a piece of property.  For 
instance the first nations reserves in Nova Scotia may have a 
piece of woodland of a couple of hundred acres that they may want 
to cut timber on but they do not have the ability to that.  First 
they have to apply, they have to go on bended knee to the federal 
government to get permission to carry on work on property that 
they own but which is somehow being held in trust for them by the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about the whole concept of land ownership.  It is 
about not having to apply to someone else if they want to have a 
gravel pit on their property, if they want to build a road to 
access timber resources, if they want to utilize those timber 
resources for the economic benefit of the reserve, if they want 
to look at the mining potential for the property.  These are all 
things that private ownership takes for granted.  It does not 
even think about because it is a foreign concept to think about 
it any other way, but first nations do not have that ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some problems with the bill and issues it does not 
address.  However, it does address a very important point for 
economic renewal, the ability for first nations to have economic 
activity and bring themselves out from under the Indian Act and 
actually have some activity in Canada and take their place as 
equal citizens on the property which the rest of us take for 
granted. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a couple of comments and a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British Columbia Native Women's Society is looking for the 
same type of rights to protect them in the event of a marriage 
breakdown as is currently offered by the provinces.  They do not 
believe that protection is in place which is a serious concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of comparing land management to fee simple ownership 
would be a little closer to reality if the land was not closer to 
fee common which means that it is not held individually. 
Therefore for individuals to make these quick and easy decisions 
that the hon. member talks about, of course it is not possible to 
make those kinds of decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipalities must obtain permits to do just about anything or 
they must go to the people who live in the community.  They are 
governed by regulations established by senior levels of 
government.  To make their own regulations without submitting 
them anywhere else to see if they meet a basic standard for 
rights is not the way municipalities work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member support fee simple ownership since he seems to 
think it is the best way to handle these types of situations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's question.  It is a legitimate question.  I heard a 
couple of questions in there so I would like to answer everything 
the member spoke about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all the British Columbia Native Women's Society and the 
entrenchment of matrimonial rights under the legislation or under 
Indian affairs versus what is offered for protection under 
provincial legislation is a very important point.  It is one that 
is going to require a great deal more study. 
However, the division of property on the breakdown of a marriage 
can be met within the land codes which are all voted on in a 
democratic process and come before both on reserve and off 
reserve members of each individual first nation.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not say that this legislation was perfect but it is a step 
in the right direction.  Far too often in the history of this 
country we have looked at legislation, and all legislation is 
inherently flawed to some degree, but instead of moving forward 
and allowing 99% of the legislation to be good, we get hung up on 
1% of it. This is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nations are responsible themselves in their land codes 
to decide the division of property on the breakdown of a 
marriage.  I expect they will do that in a democratic process, 
although there may be some room for abuse of that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is fee common ownership.  That is a very good 
analogy.  I used fee simple because fee simple is what most of us 
understand.  The member is absolutely right about fee common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again a democratically elected chief and tribal council will 
decide what activity is going to be carried on.  The whole idea 
of common ownership for the greater good is not one that all of 
us are familiar with.  I am a private landowner and a sixth 
generation farmer.  The whole idea of ownership of property is 
something that is inherent to my culture and the way I was 
brought up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the idea of a common ownership of land is not 
completely foreign to us.  There is no reason why they still 
cannot have democratic representation through common land 
ownership with the chief and the tribal councils being 
democratically elected. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to talk about fee simple ownership.  It is 
a rather critical sticking point with a lot of discussion in 
terms of how things should be structured to make them better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Campbell River on Vancouver Island, the community I live in, 
the Campbell River Band has a unique circumstance.  When the 
agreement was signed by the band to put the four lane bypass 
through the reserve, a land transfer was effected.  The bottom 
line is the reserve now has reserve land and a big section of fee 
simple land.  The band had a business proposal that included all 
of the land.  After several years it is now one of the major 
developments.  It is a major shopping area in the community and 
serves the whole community. It is highly successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference to the band is that it has a much easier time 
administratively dealing with the fee simple land.  It does not 
have to go through the minister, through the Indian Act and all 
of the red tape and bureaucracy.  That is the upside.  The 
downside is that there are taxation ramifications. In actual fact 
what I have heard from some who are in that business is they can 
spend so much avoiding taxes that they end up not running a very 
good business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the test of time we may see demonstrated that despite the 
rap it has received from what is essentially a collectivist 
static encumbrance placed upon land ownership by the Indian Act, 
fee simple ownership may turn out to be the way to go in the long 
run.  Philosophically I agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would like to comment on what he thinks 
about what I just said. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again I think it is a 
pertinent point, the whole principle of fee simple ownership. 
However, it is not the case within this piece of legislation and 
it is protected within the legislation from reverting to fee 
simple ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not speak for first nations as they will speak for 
themselves, but first nations may find that is the direction in 
which they want to head.  They can incorporate that.  Once there 
is some economic activity and the chance for advancement, jobs 
and everything that comes with economic activity on reserves, 
that whole idea of land ownership may be a principle or idea that 
will be more fully embraced by first nations.  It may not. I am 
not trying to speak for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have a system of government which has worked for a great 
deal of time. Many of us have a great culture the same as the 
first nations do and a lot of history that has evolved over a 
period of time.  I would hesitate to say all Canadians will be 
governed in 100 years by the same governments and the same types 
of policies we have now because things change. Things may change 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not dealing with the future but with the present and the 
possibility that something that is closer to fee simple ownership 
or fee common ownership will enable first nations to utilize 
their land without having to go to the federal government every 
time they want to carry out any type of economic activity.  That 
is the situation now. Anything that takes us away from that 
situation is a good thing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to be speaking to Bill C-49, the first nations land management 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement that served as the impetus for this legislation 
allows the signatory first nations to opt out of the land 
management sections of the Indian Act and establish their own 
regime to manage their lands and resources. This is a form of 
self-government developed in full partnership with the first 
nations to promote self-management that will result in among 
other things improved economic development on reserves which the 
last speaker spent some time suggesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and its partners have worked to further improve 
this agreement to include another first nation, bringing the 
total to 14.  It has also been improved by now including the 
application of the Atomic Energy Act and the use, occupation, 
possession and division of interests in first nation land in the 
case of a marriage or marriage breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement is the result of a process that started in 1987 
when the Mulroney government was in power.  A previous version of 
the bill was introduced in the last parliament and passed second 
reading before the dissolution of parliament in April 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be the first to admit that past federal governments 
operated in a less than admirable fashion when it came to our 
First Nations.  However, as a member of the Standing Committee on 
Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, I have seen two 
ministers of Indian affairs who have been willing to work with 
the native communities to initiate policy at the behest of the 
first nations.  These ministers have ensured that Canada will no 
longer work in an aloof paternalistic fashion to push policy that 
is not wanted and that does not address the needs of our native 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples 
and the response of our Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development to that report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 is the result of native initiative.  Two governments 
over 11 years have worked in partnership with the first nations, 
the provinces and other interested third parties to provide 
change.  I congratulate all those involved for developing 
legislation that shows the value of partnership between our 
native communities and the federal Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 provides a positive model for the future transfer of 
land management to other first nations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of other first nations showing an interest in 
entering this agreement, a provision has been included to permit 
others to be added to this bill through an order in council. 
However, this will not take place until a review of this regime 
is completed within four years of operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The language of the bill has been reviewed in accordance with 
the government's bijuralism policy and the provinces have been 
consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provisions have also been included to address the concerns 
raised by native women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As background, in March 1997 the British Columbia Native Women's 
Society and two individual plaintiffs mentioned the framework 
agreement in a suit launched against the government in the 
federal court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plaintiffs claim that the federal government has failed to 
fulfill its fiduciary obligations to married Indian women with 
respect to the division of the matrimonial home upon the 
breakdown of a marriage.  While the suit is in regards to the 
Indian Act, the plaintiffs also claim that a process should be 
included in the framework agreement to address this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does address this matter by requiring a mandatory 
community consultation process for the development of rules and 
procedures applicable on the breakdown of a marriage in relation 
to the use, occupancy and possession of first nation land and the 
division of interests in that land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The positive benefits of this legislation are that it provides 
opportunities for the first nations to build experience and 
expertise, which will give them some empowerment.  It fosters the 
development of environmental protection regimes which will be 
harmonized with federal and provincial regimes and will be 
negotiated and approved by the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 
and the first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation allows first nations to generate revenue through 
economic development.  It ensures community decision making by 
requiring local approval of the land code which enhances 
accountability of chief and council to the membership.  It 
protects third party interests by continuing contracts, terms and 
conditions that are currently in place and provides a dispute 
resolution forum for any disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share with members comments made by the minister 
when Bill C-49 received first reading this past June.  The 
minister said “This initiative is a key sectoral component, 
developed in full partnership with these first nations.  These 
communities are leading the way in changes to land management by 
implementing a new land management regime and opting out of the 
Indian Act.  This legislation will provide control at the local 
level and eliminate the involvement of my department in the day 
to day land management decisions and activities of these first 
nations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we hear the word partnership from the minister.  It 
is a word that is very welcome in the lexicon utilized in 
relations between Canada and its first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having worked with the minister on a number of issues in Ottawa 
and in the riding, I know that she takes this partnership very 
seriously and this legislation is a fine example of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The First Nations involved—the Westbank, Musqueam, Lheidle 
T'enneh, N'Quatqua, Squamish, Siksika, Muskoday, Cowessess, 
Opaskwayak Cree, Nippising, Mississaugas of Scugog Island, 
Chippewas of Georgina Island, Chippewas of Mnjikaning and Saint 
Mary's—realize that this partnership does exist and will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might indicate that it is a far cry from the reaction to the 
suggestion some years ago from Prime Minister Trudeau that we 
scrap the Indian Act.  Some of us will remember that the chiefs 
reacted negatively.   The chiefs probably reacted negatively 
because they did not trust us and because they felt that by doing 
that they would lose their fiduciary right and any rights they 
had to inherent self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have come a long way from those days.  I know the 
previous minister of Indian affairs tried by simple omission to 
allow first nations to make some decisions on their own despite 
the Indian Act.

decision on those matters and left it up to the first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good to see, however, that this recognition, this respect 
and this provision of ownership and stewardship to the first 
nations finds a way around the fiduciary stranglehold of the 
Indian Act.

on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development in the near 
future.  At that time I will enjoy discussing this bill with each 
of the first nations involved and with other interested parties

stage of this important piece of legislation.

mentioned the inherent right to self-government as being one of 
the key goals and objectives that we are seeking, to ensure it is

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, some of us think it was a missed opportunity when 
the Charlottetown deal fell through because that would have 
promoted or guaranteed that inherent right.  I would like the 
member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue I would like the hon. member to comment 
on.  In recent months we have been hearing speaker after speaker 
from the Reform Party challenging, denouncing and condemning 
native leaders and communities, implying that there is 
widespread, rampant corruption, almost an irresponsibility in 
terms of handling financial matters, as if they are not capable 
or not ready to take control of their own destiny with true 
self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon hearing these things over the last few months, one cannot 
help but think of similar charges which were made about the 
leadership of the civil rights movement in the southern United 
States.  As those people started to get very close to the 
prospect of true social justice, critics in the southern United 
States, from groups like the Reform Party, felt that the easiest 
way to challenge this kind of evolution in terms of human rights 
and civil rights was to denounce the leadership, to take potshots 
at the leadership, to criticise them and to try to convince 
people that that group of people was not ready to take their 
first struggling steps toward true participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the member's comments on both of those 
things:  first, the failure of the Charlottetown deal, which 
might have taken some steps toward self-government for aboriginal 
people and, second, the obvious connection between other civil 
rights movements and the extreme right wing in those areas taking 
shots at the leadership of those movements to try to discredit 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the hon. member's 
comments.  I served on the yes committee in my riding for the 
Charlottetown accord.  I agree that probably for the first time 
Indian rights, self-government and so on were included in a 
constitutional type of document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there was an error made in that document, despite my 
support of it, and in my riding it passed by a narrow margin.  I 
think it said far too much and was very unclear.  Many people did 
not understand what it was getting at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember having some trouble explaining it and having trouble 
in my own mind.  One had to say that it really did not mean what 
it sounded like, so it had to mean this.  Yet we were not able to 
find out what in fact it did mean.  I share the member's concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to some of the Reform Party's agenda, its members 
have hammered unnecessarily and unfairly, saying that there has 
been a lack of accountability with respect to the moneys used on 
first nations reserves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nations are going to make the same mistakes and have 
the same problems running their governments with respect to taxes 
and money as many of our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sometimes forget that in every province there is an office 
which sends administrators and accountants to municipalities if 
they get into difficulty.  They take over the administration of 
affairs until matters are straightened out.  These things do not 
happen very often because we have been developing our system for 
a long time, but our native people have not had much time to 
develop their system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that on April 1, 1999, five months from now, 
we will have a new territory in which the language is going to be 
Inuktitut and where 50% or more of all of the employees for 
government services, including health services, social services 
and community services are going to be Inuit.  They are working 
very hard with our help now to train the people who are going to 
be needed for those public administration posts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not heretofore done enough of that with our aboriginal 
people, but we are doing more.  I think with practice, with 
responsibility, with recognition and a little less emphasis on 
some of the negatives we will see before too long some real 
results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have three

that reflects on this side of the House.  The NDP-Liberal love-in 
on this file seems to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the chiefs not trusting the government. 
I have news for the member.  In <I>The First Perspective</I>, a 
first nations magazine, a survey was done and in that survey 83% 
of the band members who responded said they did not trust their 
own chief and council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be interested in 
any factual information the member has on that issue.  I am aware 
that there are problems because individual members of native 
bands have come before the committee and told us about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On investigation, however, some of them proved to be not very 
well founded.  They also proved to be a matter of opinion, just 
as we have in many of our municipalities regarding whether the 
mayor did the right thing.

area.  In 1993 we founded the Waterloo Regional Community Safety

</I></B></P><P align=left>Crime hurts people and makes them feel unsafe.  It decreases 
quality of life and changes the face of our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence is conclusive.  The most effective way to prevent 
crime is to ensure healthier children, stronger families, better 
schools and more cohesive communities.

cost savings in the justice system and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate this government and the Waterloo region for their

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada injury is a major cause of death and hospitalization

psychological and social consequences of these injuries to

last week federal, provincial and territorial ministers

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that organized crime is a serious and growing 
problem in Canada, the ministers unanimously endorsed a joint

this problem.

builds on work already done to develop an effective strategy. The 
statement brings Canada one step closer to having a Canada-wide

alone. 
To win the fight we must work together, pool our resources and

<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Prime Minister actually told parliament that he 
pays employment insurance taxes. We are willing to give the Prime 
Minister the benefit of the doubt.  We do not think he was trying 
to mislead the House.  In fact, we just think he happens to be 
living in a fantasy world. He has imaginary homeless friends.  He 
thinks he is Mark McGwire and now he is pretending to pay taxes 
that he does not actually pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the real world, Canadian workers are paying $350 too much for 
employment insurance and it hurts. When will the Prime Minister 
come back to earth and let Canadians keep that $350? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is the leader of a government which 
since it has taken office has reduce EI premiums each and every 
single year. The member opposite belongs to a party that 
recommended throughout that period that there be no reductions in 
premiums, except that it would go to the deficit.  Then when they 
did admit to a reduction in premiums, they wanted them to go only 
to employers and not to employees. 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
just like George Bush's amazement at a grocery store scanner, the 
Prime Minister was amazed to discover that he does not pay EI 
taxes. Well we have news for him.  Twelve million Canadians do 
pay EI taxes and they are getting pretty sick of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the Prime Minister wake up and give Canadians a $350 
tax reduction?  It is their money.  They deserve it.  When is he 
going to let them keep it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, speaking of waking up and smelling the roses, the hon. 
member ought to take a look at what happened last year.  There 
was a $1.5 billion reduction in EI premiums. Each and every year 
since we have taken office we stopped them from going to $3.30. 
We froze them at $3.07.  Each and every year we brought them down 
against the opposition of the Reform. 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
finance minister is trying to ignore what we are saying here. 
Three hundred and fifty dollars might buy a couple of rounds of 
golf for the Prime Minister, but it will buy a lot of groceries 
for a lot of Canadians.  Now he might not feel it, but Canadians 
feel it right in their pocketbooks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is so out of touch with Canadians that he 
does not understand that $350 is a lot of money.  Is that the 
position of the finance minister and the Prime Minister?  Do they 
not understand that $350 is a lot of money to a lot of Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let us take a look at this record of the Prime Minister 
and of this government.  A $42 billion deficit eliminated.  The 
child tax benefit brought in and increased by $1.8 billion.  More 
money put into research and development.  More money put in to 
help poor and moderate income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Prime Minister has done over the course of the last 
five years is to effect a social and economic revolution that 
makes this country much the stronger for it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the fact of the matter is that this finance minister still 
collects $350 too much from every worker and $500 too much from 
every employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact yesterday when talking about the EI premiums, the Prime 
Minister stated “If I am not covered, that does not bother me”. 
He had to be told by the HRD minister that he does not pay into 
the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of Canadians pay into this fund and in fact overpay 
into this fund.  Why will the Prime Minister and the finance 
minister not do the right thing and simply give the money back to 
hard working Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, members of the opposition can repeat the same question 
time and time again.  It is not going to detract from the 
fundamental fact that this government has reduced those premiums 
each and every year and the Reform Party opposed it, that the 
government has reduced them for both employees and employers and 
the Reform Party would leave the employees out in the cold.

word misrepresent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  I withdraw that comment, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue to ask this question of the finance minister because 
we are not getting an answer.  In fact the Prime Minister, who 
probably has not checked his pay stub for over 30 years, might 
not think that $350 is a lot of money, but that will buy a lot of 
groceries for hard working Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister and the finance minister not simply 
do the right thing and give hard working Canadians their 
hard earned money back?  Why not? 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, is a direct quote from fresh start not in fact 
representative of the Reform Party's position, or are Canadians 
not entitled to rely on what the Reform Party says?  I guess we 
know the answer to that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's 1995 taxpayers budget is still on its web 
site.  The Reform Party recommends the establishment of a 
permanent reserve fund; until the budget is balanced, funds would 
be applied against the deficit.  It is still on the web site, or

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister surprised us again yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not even know he was not paying EI premiums.  He is not 
the only one either.  Several of his ministers were unaware of 
the fact as well.  The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the 
Minister of Revenue told me so in person yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that he has the facts, will the Minister of Finance finally 
understand why we have been telling him from the beginning that 
it is unfair and profoundly immoral to use the EI fund to give 
everyone a tax break when not everyone is contributing? 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have just said that, every year since the government took 
office, we have lowered EI premiums.  It is certainly our 
intention to lower them in future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understood correctly, the Leader of the Bloc Quebecois is 
saying that it is immoral to lower Canadians' taxes.  I am 
sorry, but that is what we want to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
profoundly immoral to dip into the pockets of unemployed workers 
and those with jobs in order to give a tax break to members here 
and to ministers— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> It is profoundly immoral to protect one's 
ships rather than unemployed workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> The government has been telling us for weeks 
and months that it is studying the matter, but what sort of 
study is it doing when ministers and the Prime Minister do not 
even know who is contributing to the plan and who is not?  What 
kind of study is this gang of incompetents doing? 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
we were able to lower taxes in the last budget, $7 billion over 
a period of three years, if we were able to remove 400,000 
Canadians from Canada's tax roll— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The Minister of Finance has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin:</B>  If we were able to lower taxes as we did in 
the last budget, and if we are going to be able to lower them in 
the next budget, it is because economic activity in our country 
is on the upswing; it is because there are more Canadians 
working; it is because there are more businesses growing; it is 
because the country is in good shape.  And all this is because 
of the good management of this government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the 
Prime Minister finally learned he does not contribute to EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He 
told us that, since he did not contribute, he was not covered 
and that it did not bother him.  Perhaps the Prime Minister is 
indeed not bothered by the fact that he does not contribute and 
is not covered.

<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would point out to the 
opposition here that the Prime Minister is not the only one not 
to pay EI premiums.  No elected official in Canada, no mayor, no 
city councillors, no Bloc Quebecois members, pay premiums, and I 
would point out to the opposition— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The Minister of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would also point out to 
the member for Roberval that 78% of workers are covered by the 
employment insurance system, contrary to what he is trying to 
insinuate once again in this House in order to upset the workers 
who are still covered by the system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know there 
are things that cannot be said here, but I would simply give the 
minister a warning.  For the last time, I ask him to stop 
repeating what he has just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clearly stated on page 47 of the study you commissioned— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I wish to remind the hon. member that remarks must 
always be addressed to the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, would you kindly advise the 
minister once and for all to read his own studies.  The figures 
provided on page 47 are wrong. 
<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 78% of workers who have lost 
their job or left it for a valid reason are covered by the 
Canada employment insurance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point the Bloc keeps trying to make is that people who have 
never contributed to the employment insurance system, young 
people who are newly arrived in the labour market and those who 
have left their jobs without a valid reason are not covered by 
the system.  These are the people they are talking about. 
Seventy-eight per cent of workers are covered; that is the real 
figure.

the Nova Scotia government made a deal to force its

under which the Nova Scotia government signed over control of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

work done on research into MMT and the health effects.  We made 
the results of that research available to other departments. 
Indeed, work continues to examine the health effects on humans, 
in particular children, with respect to MMT.  As that science is 
done, using research not only here in Canada but around the 
world, we will continue to make the results available to those 
who are making policy.

necessarily a problem of passport security per se.  The minister 
says this is the most secure passport in the world.

course, all that technology will be available for bid by Canadian 
companies and I hope that we will be in a position to start 
distributing it to Canadians next year.

<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order regarding a motion that was passed 
yesterday evening.  The motion adopted the 13th report of the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report had all-party agreement at the committee level and 
yesterday was adopted unanimously in the House.  The report 
recommended standing order changes regarding Private Members' 
Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker plays a very important role in this matter. You are 
the protector of the private member and the keeper of our rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my point of order I will argue that some of the 
recommendations in the report could clearly be implemented now 
and some may require the assistance of your clerks to draft 
standing order changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue that recommendations Nos. 3, 5, 7 and 8 should be 
implemented immediately.  These changes are very briefly as 
follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a division is taken on a private member's item, the calling 
of the vote will begin with the sponsor and will then proceed 
beginning with the back row on the sponsor side of the House and 
then the back row on the other side of the House.  This 
recommendation is intended to protect private members from being 
intimidated by the front benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is now a process in place whereby a law clerk and a 
parliamentary counsel of the House of Commons will be appointed 
to be responsible for the provision of legislative drafting 
services for members. 
That person or persons will be provided with sufficient staff.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Priority will now be given to the drafting of private members' 
bills and motions for members who have not previously had a bill 
drafted during that session of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendations Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 6 would require standing order 
changes.  I will comment briefly on these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An item outside the order of precedence that has been jointly 
seconded by 100 members will be placed at the bottom of the order 
of precedence.  If a bill or motion has merit, it will now move 
forward instead of being subjected to the lottery draw which is 
often frustrating and humiliating for the sponsor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is protection from the threat of prorogation.  A private 
member can now reintroduce a bill at this stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We are sort of getting into the debate and 
the explanation.  I would hope the hon. member would stay focused 
on the point we are discussing now rather than getting into the 
merits or whatever it is.  If the hon. member wants to point out 
something to the Chair I am more than willing to listen, but his 
point should be quite succinct. I would ask him to direct himself 
to that and maybe take another minute to wrap up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be brief.  Since 
the one I described is not a government initiative but a report 
drafted and adopted independently by members of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and subsequently adopted 
independently by the House, the onus to implement these rules 
changes is on Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last June the House asked the Clerk to draft new rules regarding 
changes to the supply process. When the House returned in 
September these rules were in place. There was no need for a 
second step since the request was clear and the House order was 
in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The circumstances today are identical.  We are coming up to a 
break week.  I would like to know if the rules recommended in the 
13th report that require standing order drafting could be in 
place by the time the House resumes on November 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like Mr. Speaker to confirm my observations as to 
which rules are now in place and do not need a standing order 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that when these rules are drafted, you solicit the 
support from private members and avoid the usual solicitation 
from the party leadership, particularly the cabinet.  The cabinet 
has absolutely no say in this matter of Private Members' 
Business. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try to be brief and 
address the point.  If I understood correctly, what the hon. 
member is trying to get at is that he has now recognized that the 
passage by rather surreptitious means yesterday afternoon of a 
report does not change the standing orders the way he initially 
thought it did and now he is asking the Speaker to change them 
unilaterally.  That is what I understand his point to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read the eight clauses of the committee and my reading tells 
me that six of them require an actual drafting of rule changes. 
The drafting presumably would have to be approved by the House 
afterwards because draft rule changes are not in six of the eight 
items that refer to particular changes. The other ones I 
recognize are matters which are under the purview of the Speaker 
or the administration of the House, but six of them have 
particularly to do with the rule changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member across sees fit to raise this issue with the 
Speaker, it is because he has recognized that this artificial way 
of getting this motion through yesterday did not change the rules 
the way he initially thought it did, otherwise he would not have 
to bring it up right now. 
Now he has asked if the Speaker or others will arrange to have 
actual words put in place in time for the House to come back.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if Your Honour, the clerk or anyone else around 
here wants to prepare draft rule changes, that is certainly their 
prerogative.  My submission to the Chair respectfully is that 
once those draft rule changes have been prepared by the Chair, 
assuming that the Chair would be so inclined, it would be up to 
the House to decide whether or not it likes those draft rule 
changes.  If it does, subsequently it would adopt those draft 
rule changes if and when it sees fit to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mere fact that the member has raised this today in the House 
does not change the rules of the House.  Heaven forbid if we ever 
get into a situation where one member of the Reform Party decides 
himself to change the rules for the rest of us around here, 
democracy would take a beating that day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to say a few words on this point of order 
in support of the Reform member's recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, this is a report that we as the House of Commons 
moved concurrence in last night, which we have the authority to 
do. Second, it is a report that was tabled from the procedure and 
House affairs committee of which I am a member and on which the 
Liberals have a majority membership.  It was approved by that 
particular committee and tabled in this very House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am puzzled as to why the hon. government House leader would 
make reference to “artificial means” or “surreptitious means” 
when it came to making this particular report something that is 
going to be substantive and that will convert into actual rule 
changes.  His definition of surreptitious means is that a motion 
was moved in the House last evening and the motion was given 
unanimous consent.  Every single member of parliament who was in 
the House last night gave unanimous consent to have this 
particular report embraced and adopted. If the government House 
leader calls that surreptitious, we have a huge problem in this 
country because it was a democratic decision.  It was nowhere 
near surreptitious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is surreptitious is when the government House leader stands 
in this House and attacks democracy like that from behind the 
cover of his cabinet post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My view is that the report was tabled by a committee dominated 
by Liberal MPs.  It was embraced by all MPs in that committee, of 
which the chief government whip is a member.  We are now asking 
to have all of these recommendations of the report made into 
standard operating procedures of the House of Commons effective 
as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would support the Reform Party's move on the basis of those 
particular points. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
certainly like to concur with what the member just said in the 
sense that what we are talking about here is some pretty basic 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a decision that has been made by this House.  It is 
definitely in the interest of private members and private members 
who are largely marginalized in this House by the rules.  Those 
rules were suggested to be changed by the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take great umbrage at the House leader making the implication 
that somehow what we are doing is wrong.  What the government is 
doing is wrong.  When a motion has been presented in the House, 
when concurrence has been moved, and then the government does not 
act at all on it is what is in violation of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I concur very, very heartily with what my NDP colleague has said 
and I certainly concur with the point of order.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
point of order concerns a couple of rulings today and I am 
looking for some consistency.  Before I am finished I will bring 
up a point from an earlier edition of debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word “misrepresent” was used twice today.  My colleague, 
the member for Dewdney—Alouette was required to withdraw the 
word “misrepresent” when it was used in his second question. In 
a later question the hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill was 
allowed to continue speaking when the word “misrepresent” was 
used in her second question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that in the <I>Debates</I> of October 
10, 1980, page 3591 the then Minister of National Health used the 
words “that she is misleading the House”.  The member for Yukon 
at the time raised the question and the Speaker ruled that this 
expression was allowed provided it was not qualified by the words 
“intentionally” or “deliberately”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be consistent if we applied that rule to the 
word “misrepresent” so that members of this House might know if 
that word is acceptable.  It is possible to misrepresent someone 
not even intentionally and I do not think it is necessarily 
unparliamentary to say so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for bringing 
that up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago we had the question of some words being used in 
a certain context.  As you know, many times here in the Chair 
when these words come up, sometimes they cause a disorder in the 
House and sometimes they do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a general rule there is no word which in and of itself is 
unparliamentary.  I should not have but I gave the explanation 
the last time how to use the word “liar” and then lo and behold 
it was brought in virtually the next day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this to say that it has to do not only with the word but it 
has to do with the tone and with the context and if there is any 
disorder caused in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you pointed out and rightly so my colleague, there are 
certain times when the word “misrepresent” can be unintentional 
and perhaps that is conveyed in the tone with which it is 
delivered.  At another time “misrepresent” could be taken that 
it is a very serious accusation.  That has always been left to 
the Speaker to decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot give you any greater direction other than to say that 
when a word is used, if I feel that it is unparliamentary in the 
sense that it is causing a disorder in the House and disruption, 
then usually I will interrupt.  Sometimes I will ask for a 
withdrawal.   Witness the word “hypocritical” today.  I should 
not even use those words in the sense that I know I am going to 
be faced with them probably next week. I would prefer that these 
words not be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand what are you to do?  You have to use words to 
express yourself, so I am left with deciding at that time in that 
usage is it unparliamentary or not.  I guess that is the best I 
can do to give you direction on that.  Good luck the next time 
that you use it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my point of order arises out of the hon. government 
House leader's recitation of the business.  On Tuesday the 
government House leader indicated that Bill S-13 would be a 
matter for discussion at the House leader's meeting.  That did in 
fact take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking now if the government House leader will confirm that 
it is not the government's intention to assume responsibility for 
the carriage of Bill S-13.  As well, is the government stating 
that it will not provide time for debate on this particular bill 
in this House? 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I take that as a question of 
clarification and I am going to permit it.  I am going to permit 
it because it had to do with a statement which was made by the 
government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think in these circumstances because there was a referral to 
Tuesday's business, if the hon. government House leader wishes to 
address himself to it, and I do not want to get into a debate and 
I do not want another question and answer, I am going to permit 
the government House leader to answer this question if he so 
wishes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all Bill S-13 is not a 
government bill so the government does not call it.  Precedence 
for private members' bills either from this House or the other 
place is derived by way of the subcommittee of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs charged with private 
members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are hardly in a position to debate this bill on the floor of 
the House.  It has not been introduced.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK232">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-49, an 
act providing for the ratification and the bringing into effect 
of the framework agreement on first nation land management, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee; and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there are some legitimate concerns about Bill C-49. It 
goes to the heart of some of the things that were being said 
prior to question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British Columbia Native Women's Society has complained quite 
bitterly about this legislation.  I want to quote a few of the 
things they have said in their letter. They are very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put this in context, B.C. native women have already been 
through an experiment promoted by the federal government in 1992 
and 1993.  A native justice pilot program was started on southern 
Vancouver Island. It came to a rapid, screeching halt after a lot 
of politically correct thought went into trying to create a 
system that would be sensitive to the native communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What ended up happening in that grandiose experiment was that 
people who committed grievous offences in aboriginal communities 
in that area, largely men, were found right back in the same 
community the day after their sentencing.  The old rules were 
thrown out, the justice system was thrown out, and a new system 
more sensitive to the needs of that community was put in place 
run by the very cronies of the people that were perpetrating the 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess who were the loudest complainants and the ones that got 
this travesty stopped?  It was the native women.  When we look at 
who is organizing, who tends to be out front in trying to correct 
the wrongs that are happening in great abundance on some of our 
reserves, who do we find at the forefront?  We find native women. 
They may not belong to a formal organization or they may be 
fighting to establish a formal organization.  Whatever the case 
may be, we had better listen because they have something to say 
and they have everything stacked against them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Human Rights Act is a basic and fundamental piece 
of legislation which we would assume covers all Canadians.  It 
does not.  It excludes any discrimination flowing from the Indian 
Act. That is a big problem.  It does not protect native women 
from many of the things they are complaining about.  They cannot 
win if they have everything stacked against them.   I will quote 
from the letter: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—women living on reserves lack the protections available to all 
other Canadian women when their marriages break down.  They 
cannot get an order for occupation or division of the matrimonial 
home—. The Indian Act provisions governing their situation were 
struck down by the courts in the early 80s and the federal 
government has done nothing to correct the inequality— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever we find inequality under the terms of the Indian Act we 
find that the Indian Act is dependent upon defining who is a 
status Indian.  In order to do that it goes through great 
gyrations.  When governments certify ethnic or racial status it 
can become very complicated.  It does not matter how hard 
government tries.  There will be inequality in the definition of 
status Indian.  I does not matter who designs the system.  It 
could never be designed not to lead to some form of inequality. 
It tends to be stacked against Indian women.  It is also stacked 
against others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has many permutations in how other legislation that affects 
aboriginals because the definition of status Indian is a basic 
building block.  It is an inappropriate way to do things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every piece of legislation over time has taken away sections of 
the Indian Act, including the most comprehensive and contemporary 
treaty in Canada, the Nisga'a agreement in northwestern British 
Columbia.  Only one part of the Indian Act is kept under that 
agreement.  We do not have to guess what part of the Indian Act 
it is.  They kept the part that defines who is an Indian because 
the whole thing will unravel if they do not have some form of 
definition.  It is an artificial definition.  The longer things 
go on and the more human nature exhibits itself, the more 
dysfunctional the whole arrangement will become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many things have been said today by members of other parties. 
There is always an attempt to pigeon hole and stereotype.  It 
very discouraging that people like to do that when talking to an 
issue that is potentially charged with racial overtones because 
we are talking about status Indians and the Indian Act. 
They love to stereotype and try to pigeon hole where one is 
coming from.   This is why I was greatly concerned about what the 
member for Churchill was saying earlier concerning what motivates 
members of the Reform Party in terms of some of this legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an unholy alliance which I describe as a love-in 
between the Liberals and the NDP on some aboriginal legislation. 
I remind members of the House that we are now in the second 
parliament of this administration and we have yet to see a piece 
of aboriginal legislation that originated with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the legislation we saw in the last parliament and what we 
are seeing in this parliament is legislation initiated in the 
days when Brian Mulroney and the Tories were in government.  All 
their initiatives are still being milked.  All their excesses are 
still coming out from the legislative boiler room, wherever it 
might be.  There are no original ideas.  There is no new 
direction.  It is apparent that is what is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the bill we are dealing with right now dates back a 
number of years.  I cannot locate all the details, but this 
legislation under different formats has been worked on for a 
number of years.  A lot of money flowed to participants who were 
developing a proposal that was turned into legislation.  It is a 
very expensive initiative.  It probably cost several millions of 
dollars.  It could be over $10 million.  It seems like that is 
always the case.  Very little is accomplished for an awful lot of 
money, and I have concerns about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that there is very enlightened band governance in 
Canada.  We could all name examples.  We recognize that the 
current policy framework of the department of Indian affairs is 
ineffective in allowing people to get rid of unenlightened 
governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we cannot get rid of the bad apples the barrel tends to get 
tainted.  That is what we are trying to change.  We want all 
accountability mechanisms to be put in place because that is what 
people deserve.  In actual fact we are finding out that is what 
people want.  It is only the established powers that tend to 
resist because the status quo serves them quite well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 purports to provide for the establishment of an 
alternative land management regime that gives first nations 
community control over the lands and resources within their 
reserves.  In other words, Bill C-49 was drafted to give 
aboriginal people more control over the lands they occupy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some very major concerns about the bill. 
The framework agreement on first nations land management will be 
ratified by Bill C-49.  It extends to band governance broader 
powers than those extended to municipal governments under the 
various provincial-municipal acts.  This is very troubling, 
especially from a local perspective.  After all, it is at the 
local level that lives are lived.  That is where things get done. 
That is where co-operation is developed.  That is where families 
grow.  That is where everything happens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has the potential to significantly impact relations 
between bands and local governments in a number of areas such as 
land use planning, environmental regulation and protection of 
third party interests.  Again the federal government is imposing 
its will in terms of creating legislation that will destruct 
local and provincial relationships without saying what it is 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of legislation is always wrapped up in a pretty 
package and the contents are allowed to seep out over time. There 
is no attempt to quantify what the consequences of the 
legislation may be even though the implications are vast and 
potentially far reaching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the union of B.C. municipalities and the lower 
mainland treaty advisory committee both expressed major concerns 
about the predecessor piece of legislation, Bill C-75, which was 
introduced in the dying days of the last parliament.  It died and 
has now been resurrected a year later.  To summarize their 
concerns, there was little or no consultation with the British 
Columbia government, local government and the public in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was my critic area in the last parliament.  The minister of 
Indian affairs, Indian lobbyists, backbench Liberal MPs and the 
minister's staff hounded the opposition House leader, the Reform 
House leader and me in the dying days of the last parliament 
prior to the election call.  Everyone knew the election call was 
coming on the last weekend of April 1997.  Everyone knew the June 
2, 1997 election would be called in April.  There was incredible 
pressure brought to bear on us to allow Bill C-75 to go through 
all three readings and obtain royal assent before parliament 
recessed due to the election call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We refused to be stampeded because of our concerns, as I have 
just explained, about the lack of consultation with anybody 
involved other than the aboriginal band leaderships set out in 
the agreement.  Despite this major and serious concern no 
substantive change has been made to Bill C-49 which evolved from 
Bill C-75 to ensure a smooth and harmonious relationship between 
local and band governments, which I also consider to be local 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department of Indian affairs works in mysterious ways.  I 
must admit that I have lost my grapevine having moved on to 
another portfolio.  What has happened with this legislation is 
typical of many other pieces of Liberal legislation.  The 
government gets stampeded by internal lobby groups.  The minister 
commits himself or herself to action.  Pressure flows from the 
minister's desk to staff and caucus.  They all try to infect the 
opposition with a sense of undue haste and urgency.  Then, if the 
legislation does not go through either in the dying days of a 
parliament before an election or prior to a recess, when we come 
back to the House, lo and behold the haste and urgency have 
dissipated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been more than a year since the election and we are just 
seeing this piece of legislation slowly winding its way through 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not like this piece of legislation because it fragments the 
statutory framework whereby we have about 630 bands across Canada 
administered under the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to take 14 bands out from under some of the 
provisions of the Indian Act.  However, far too much of the 
Indian Act will still apply to those 14 bands.  It is piecemeal, 
partial, non-satisfactory legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have is about the leaseholders on reserve 
lands.  The leaseholders have had, in some cases, multiple 
decades of holding their leases under agreements supervised by 
the department of Indian affairs.  Perhaps there has been an 
eroding federal presence, but certainly this is a tremendously 
significant departure from previous lease arrangements for 
homeowners, cottage owners, long term land leases and other 
situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are going to be faced with a whole new set of rules 
with attendant uncertainties.  Should they be unhappy with the 
new arrangements, should they consider that they have a 
legitimate beef, their concerns are not really addressed in this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no protection against one sided land quotes which may 
totally devalue the investments they have made in improvements. 
That could really be considered a form of expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we can argue that natural justice would say that 
compensation should occur if land quotes impact negatively on 
people, but there is no mechanism for this to happen in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is coming back to us again a year and a half later and 
not a thing has changed in terms of band, local or provincial 
protocol on environmental or land use issues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will just make the comment that aboriginals also helped to defeat 
the Charlottetown accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the community consultation review process and the 
impacts of that.  B.C. native women are concerned about what 
happened to the results of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who in this country would be satisfied with the community review 
process if their rights were at stake or if their land and 
property were at risk and a ruling was made that had no prior 
government oversight?  What if they were at the mercy of a local 
band and council and did not have a higher law to set limits on 
government?  What if there were no limits to the powers they 
could exercise in relationship to their property, to the place 
they bring up their children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, every system needs checks 
and balances in order to operate in the long term in an 
enlightened fashion.  We have seen the pendulum swing a long way 
toward there really being no effective checks and balances under 
the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department of Indian affairs became compromised by the fact 
that it was sitting on many things that were wrong.  It really 
did not want anyone to discover what all of those things were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department started a cover-up operation a long time ago.  It 
is a bureaucratic response to a problem.  It would happen in 
every organization where there are no checks and balances.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no other department with a mandate for activities on

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now developing some ad hoc mechanisms.  The First Nations 
Coalition for Accountability, for example, has now developed 
enough of a membership and enough credibility as a grassroots 
organization, through its networking and contacts with provincial 
government cabinets, the media and so on, that there are now 
times when they can identify a problem on a reserve.  They can 
then phone and tell them to fix the problem or heat will be 
brought to bear, and the problem gets fixed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I just want to help the hon. member a bit.  He is quite wrong to 
suggest that no consultations were held with respect to this 
bill, particularly in his home province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, there have been 12 meetings involving the B.C. 
municipalities, I think on four occasions.  There was an advisory 
group on three separate occasions.  Two to three letters were 
written to the province of British Columbia.  In fact there have 
been a number of letters exchanged with relevant stakeholder 
groups in British Columbia, as well as the 12 meetings with the 
union of B.C. municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member not aware of these consultations even in his 
home province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am aware of how the 
government pays lip service to consultation.  I am also aware of 
correspondence from a member of the treaty negotiation advisory 
committee and from the union of B.C. municipalities about the 
real level of consultation that actually occurred, and the 
absence of what they termed consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have discovered over the past five years that the Liberal 
definition of consultation and the stakeholder definition of 
consultation are often diametrically opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof is in the pudding because there has now been an 
additional year to carry on lots of further consultation, because 
of the great unhappiness and because it was admitted that there 
was a problem, and not one thing has changed in the legislation 
to address any of that.

Bill C-49 and to share my comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of this bill is to ratify and implement a framework 
agreement signed on February 12, 1996 by a group of first 
nations and the federal government.  This agreement concerns the 
management of first nations' lands and is intended to enable 
them to establish their own land code to manage the lands and 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement is necessary to permit the first nations that are 
party to the agreement to withdraw from the application of the 
sections of the Indian Act governing the management of lands.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations and governments all agree that the Indian Act 
gives the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
discretionary power.  It also gives public servants too much 
leeway, thus preventing aboriginals from exercising direct 
control over the management of the lands within their reserves. 
It is in order to rectify this situation that a bill to ratify 
the framework agreement was introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried to introduce legislation addressing this issue in the 
previous Parliament.  Bill C-75, as it was then called, was 
passed at second reading, but the process came to an abrupt end 
when Parliament was dissolved.  Last year, my party pushed to 
have this bill put back on the agenda. 
It was introduced in its new form as Bill C-49.  I am pleased 
that we are prepared to go ahead with second reading today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is vital that the signatories to the agreement be given the 
tools they need for their cultural and economic development. 
This bill recognizes the fundamental right of 14 first nations 
to manage their lands and their resources and constitutes 
another important element in their self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nations are also glad to have the opportunity to 
exercise greater control over the lands and resources within 
their respective reserves and say that these changes will enable 
them to react more rapidly to opportunities for stimulating 
their economy.  Control of the decision-making process will 
therefore enable them to improve management of reserves. 
In other words, we feel that Bill C-49 is essential and very 
consistent with the recommendations for self-government made by 
the royal commission on aboriginal peoples and self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, several native leaders have supported the bill and 
indicated that they are in favour of its speedy passage through 
the House.  Being of the same opinion and wanting to see first 
nations exempted from the sections of the Indian Act concerning 
land management, the Bloc Quebecois and myself therefore support 
Bill C-49 in principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second reading of this bill nonetheless provides me with an 
opportunity to address certain aspects that we feel pose 
problems.  We are worried about one aspect in particular, and it 
concerns protection of aboriginal women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally we support the principle of giving back to first 
nations control over the management of lands that until now have 
been under federal jurisdiction and governed by sections of the 
Indian Act. 
It is essential that first nations be able to manage the lands 
and natural resources within their reserves themselves.  The 
requirement for a community process to establish land codes is 
also an important and promising one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides that rules on use, possession and occupation 
of lands will be arrived at through a community consultation 
process.  In theory, all the members of a first nation living on 
or off reserve will be able to take part in the decision-making 
process through this community mechanism.  However, certain 
groups of aboriginal women are opposed to Bill C-49, saying that 
it would be disastrous for them.  Their fears have to do with 
the bill's wording with respect to the division of interests in 
cases of breakdown of marriage.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They say that the clauses on this issue do not protect them at 
all, that the framework agreement contains no provision on the 
division of property in the case of separation, apart from the 
community consultation process mentioned in clauses 6 and 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British Columbia Native Women's Society is lobbying 
vigorously to show the weaknesses of the bill in the area of the 
division of marriage property.  They criticize the government 
for not having done its homework in this matter, despite the 
gross injustices criticized more than 12 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They add that no effort has been made to resolve the problem 
even after the establishment of the charter of rights and 
freedoms to ensure equality for all. 
This is why last year they asked the federal court to issue an 
injunction against this framework agreement on land management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the bill comes from their own department, the 
minister of indian affairs and her officials also seem to think 
there may be an injustice.  In June, the minister appointed an 
investigator to examine the impact of marriage breakdown on 
property rights.  An independent inquiry is therefore set to 
study the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the government recognizes the existence of a 
legal void in the matter and the negative consequences it may 
have on the protection of women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government says it has changed the former C-75 so 
that the new C-49 requires a community process to manage the 
division following the breakdown of a marriage, which, in their 
view, resolves the problem. 
According to clause 6, a community process is one of the 
requirements associated with the adoption of the land code, 
which is to be defined collectively by each of the 14 first 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a closer examination of the matter reveals that, 
despite this clause, native women have no protection whatsoever.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  After question period 
this afternoon the hon. member for Surrey Central raised a point 
of order concerning the events of yesterday evening when, by 
unanimous consent, a motion for concurrence in the 13th report of 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs was 
presented and adopted in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, the report comprises eight recommendations 
on the way the House handles Private Members' Business. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for Surrey Central, the hon. government 
House leader, the hon. whip of the New Democratic Party and the 
member for Elk Island for their contributions. I am now prepared 
to explain how the Chair will proceed on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation No. 5 concerning how recorded divisions on 
Private Members' Business are taken will be implemented 
immediately since it is a matter of practice. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation 8 on the priority for drafting private members' 
bills will be implemented immediately, because this is an 
administrative matter.

these in the opinion of the Chair call for substantive amendments 
to the standing orders and require various technical

proposed amendments to the standing orders which would implement 
recommendations Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 and to submit that draft to 
the House leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as the House has pronounced itself on the specific text 
of new standing orders to give effect to the recommendations it 
adopted last night, the Chair will be governed accordingly.  In 
the meantime, however, because the Chair has no mandate to 
unilaterally change the text of the standing orders, the Chair 
will continue to be guided by the existent standing orders.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK241">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-49, an 
act providing for the ratification and bringing into effect of 
the Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee, and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had 
reached the point of discussing the rights of aboriginal women. 
I was saying that these were treated as secondary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main problem, of course, is not with the bill per se, but 
with the 1986 Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian courts have decided that provincial legislation would 
have no precedence where property on reserves was concerned, and 
that the Indian Act would govern everything.  Unfortunately, 
that legislation has nothing to say about matrimonial property 
when a marriage breaks down.  There is a serious problem, 
therefore, a legal vacuum, which places women's status in a 
precarious position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Family legislation in the various provinces does not apply on 
reserves.  In other words, aboriginal women find themselves in a 
precarious situation, one which does not allow them to aspire to 
the same protection as all other women in Canada, because 
provincial legislation governing property division does not 
apply on reserves, as the Indian Act takes precedence.  This is 
a source of considerable concern, in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is a will to look at the issue and to try to find 
ways to fill the legal vacuum, nothing has been done yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should look at the possibility of including a clause 
providing minimal protection to women under this agreement on 
first nation land management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clearly indicated that the standards and penalties 
relating to the environment that will be set or amended by the 
14 first nations must be at least as effective and as tough as 
those of the province in which the first nation lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should consider providing similar minimal protection to 
women, in case of marriage breakdown. Issues relating to 
marriage and marriage breakdown are always sensitive, since they 
directly relate to the cultural values and the structure of the 
societies concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same for basic environmental issues. The environment 
and natural resources are integral parts of native culture. 
Still, this should not prevent us from legislating to make sure 
that minimum standards are recognized, with the approval of all 
the parties concerned. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT74"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT74"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1610

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must find a way to ensure that the protection afforded native 
women in case of marriage breakdown is at least equivalent to 
that enjoyed by other Canadian women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not in favour of interfering and I believe that the 
community consultation process will give very positive results. 
However, should major disagreements occur, we must make sure 
that native women enjoy a minimum of protection, like other 
Canadian women. Along with the first nations, it would certainly 
be possible to find a way to legislate and provide some form of 
legal recourse for these women in case of injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, knowing how long it often takes to amend legislation 
such as the Indian Act, I am concerned about passing a bill that 
regulates land management without a more direct reference to the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important that we look at whether the legislation 
provides us with means of legally protecting aboriginal women, 
as required by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  And 
if it does not, a remedy should be introduced now, while we are 
at this stage of the proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A minimal guarantee of protection is required, in my view, so 
that aboriginal women, like all other Canadian women, can enjoy 
certain fundamental rights ensuring their well-being and the 
well-being of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the position of first nations on this issue 
be examined in committee and that possible ways of ensuring a 
minimum guarantee be studied further. 
It is not a question of interfering in first nations' efforts to 
achieve self-government. On the contrary, we are merely trying to 
raise the issue of the legal vacuum when it comes to the 
division of property and to give thought to the best way of 
protecting all citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If aboriginal women, represented by credible organizations like 
the British Columbia native women's association, are of the 
opinion that such an agreement is a threat to their well-being, 
we must at least take this into account and give the matter 
serious consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the different provisions in each province complicate 
the already very complex issue of division of property in cases 
of marriage breakdown, but precautions can nonetheless be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community process within the first nations that signed the 
agreement will certainly suffice, like their various decisions 
on the whole of the land code.  However, once again, in order to 
ensure minimum protection, solutions must be provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I say once again that the Bloc Quebecois will 
support Bill C-49.  I would however point out that we have 
questions on the possibility of making amendments to respond 
more directly to the problem of the division of marriage 
property, with priority given to the community process and to 
the decisions of the first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are avenues to be explored and we will explore them, my 
colleagues and I, in order to prepare for the meetings of the 
Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for York North for letting me speak 
for five minutes on this important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill goes to the heart of a very important issue that I know 
members from across party lines are very interested in, the fate 
of aboriginal people in the country today.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening today is a travesty.  It is a tragedy beyond 
proportions that most Canadians understand.  This past summer I 
was at a medical clinic in northern British Columbia.  I saw once 
again in the flesh, in the trenches, what is taking place.  There 
are children with infectious diseases that I have not seen since 
I worked in Africa.  People are suffering from enormously.  There 
are high rates of substance abuse and suicide attempts.  There 
are communities with rates of tuberculosis and diabetes three 
times higher than the non-aboriginal population.  The soles of 
communities are being torn out. Why is this so?  Why has this not 
changed despite billions of dollars being put in by successive 
governments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is that we non-aboriginal people have to engage in a 
paradigm shift in the way we treat aboriginal people. The Indian 
Act has created an institutionalized welfare state. We have 
segregated aboriginal people, have made them separate from the 
mainstream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result has been a marred system.  In some areas the money is 
not getting to the people. Grassroots aboriginal people are 
dislocated from their political masters.  Is is between the 
political and intellectual elites and between aboriginals and 
non-aboriginals on how we deal with aboriginal people.  We leave 
out the grassroots aboriginal people.  They are suffering in 
horrendous ways that can only be compared to third world 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the government, and my colleagues will agree, to stop 
the segregation. Stop the separate development.  The rights of 
aboriginal people to engage in their traditional activities is 
enshrined in the constitution, thankfully.  Let us invest in 
aboriginal people to help them help themselves. Only if they have 
the tools to help themselves, to gain employment, provide for 
themselves, their families and their communities will they get 
back that sense of self, that sense of pride they so desperately 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not entail separate development.  It does not entail a 
lands claim process.  The essence of bill says “You are 
aboriginal people.  You are different from non-aboriginal people. 
Therefore you are going to be treated differently”.  Grassroots 
aboriginal people do not want political emancipation that is 
different from anybody else. They merely want equality.  They 
merely want to be treated as equals and have the opportunities, 
benefits and responsibilities of non-aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is flawed.  The history of dealing with aboriginal 
people is flawed.  It is flawed in saying that aboriginal people 
are somehow different. They are removed and segregated away from 
mainstream Canada.  They have sustained and suffered under the 
yoke of non-aboriginal people putting their feet on them and 
segregating them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for allowing me to speak now because I 
have to catch a plane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I implore the government not to treat aboriginal people 
differently.  Give them the tools so they can help themselves. 
Aboriginal and non-aboriginal people can work together to develop 
a united forward looking country.  We can mutually respect each 
other and develop together for a more positive and beneficial 
future for all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the hon. member's intervention and I appreciate his 
role as a medical doctor and his good work in aboriginal 
communities.  Having worked in these communities, both he and I 
know of the tragic and difficult circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member wants to do a paradigm shift, if not to take it 
off the map.  Under this proposal in bringing all aboriginal 
people from their communities in the north and moving them to 
Vancouver, to Edmonton, to Winnipeg, to Toronto, surely to 
goodness the hon. member knows and would consult with other 
medical practitioners that there are many aboriginal people 
living off reserve in these cities. 
They are still in poverty.  Stripping away their constitutional 
and land rights I would suggest respectfully would be disastrous. 
It has been disastrous for 100 years.  This is bad public policy, 
it is a bad idea and it is a bad paradigm shift.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. parliamentary 
secretary were interested in giving back land rights, he would 
enable aboriginal people to have the same land rights as 
non-aboriginal people have, which he knows full well they do not. 
Rights are given to a collective in aboriginal groups.  They are 
not given to individuals.  That is part of the problem. The 
individual aboriginal person does not have the same rights as a 
non-aboriginal person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member is interested in this issue very deeply 
as we all are. I know he has experienced this himself.  If he 
really wants to do a favour to aboriginal people, he will take a 
message to the minister.  He will say to her that we must not 
segregate and separate aboriginal people. We must give aboriginal 
people the same rights and responsibilities as non-aboriginal 
people, which includes land rights and land ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people off reserve are sustaining horrendous 
circumstances.  They do not have the tools and abilities to fend 
for themselves.  Part of that lies in the lack of accountability 
which occurs as to where moneys are going in the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the parliamentary secretary wants to do another important 
job, he can take another message to the minister. Do forensic 
audits in those reserves where aboriginal people are looking for 
answers.  Billions of dollars are put into those reserves.  The 
money is not getting to where it is supposed to go.  It is being 
siphoned off somewhere, be it in the department or in the 
aboriginal leadership.  I suggest that he find out where that 
money is going.  If he does that, he will be providing an 
enormous service so those people can get the resources to be 
fully functional and to stand on their own two feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Mr. Speaker, is the hon. member 
suggesting that by definition all band finances have to be the 
question of a forensic audit?  Is the hon. member suggesting to 
the House and to the first nation people in Canada that because 
of the circumstances they suffer, for example that today raised 
in the House, the Shamattawa children sniffing gasoline and glue, 
that somehow this is traced back to a forensic audit?  Is 
bringing in SWAT teams of police the answer to this?  Basically 
we bring in the RCMP, investigate them, move them off reserve, 
strip away their rights under section 35 of the constitution, is 
this what the hon. Reform Party member is suggesting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just so I understand the protocol here, I understood the first 
question in question and comments was from the member who is now 
asking the second question. There were others who stood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  No, that is not the 
order.  The decision on debate in question and comments is the 
prerogative of the Chair. As long as there are members standing 
who do not represent the same political party as the person in 
debate, across the aisle will be given precedence, whether it is 
from one side or the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand what you just 
said.  However, if it is the same individual, does it still apply 
in that case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The answer is yes it 
does.  There is always preference, at least when I am in the 
chair, to go across the aisle in questions and comments so that 
we get real debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response, the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member brings up 
an important question.  I am glad he asked it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are aboriginal reserves that are run wonderfully and there 
are those which are not.  The reserves we are talking about today 
are the reserves that are not run well, reserves I might add 
where aboriginal people have asked for over 10 years as to where 
the money is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are millions of dollars put into some reserves that have 
very few people on them.  While the band leaders are living in 
opulence down in Vancouver, those people are living in squalor. 
Representatives of those people have asked the minister 
repeatedly, in fact they have begged the minister, for a hearing. 
They have begged her for answers.  What have they got?  All they 
have got is the cold shoulder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While that is happening, those people are living in third world 
conditions.  People are committing suicide.  They are getting 
diseases at rates far higher than anybody else. They are 
suffering from unemployment at levels that are unparalleled in 
this country. 
Those are the reserves the member and the minister should be 
looking at, not for our benefit nor the leadership and the 
aboriginal group's benefit but for the aboriginal people who are 
suffering from diabetes, tuberculosis, high rates of suicide and 
unemployment.  They have been suffering for so long.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resources are there.  The member knows full well that those 
resources are not getting to where they should be going. Find out 
where those resources are going and do these people a service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is quite an 
interesting debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member as a medical physician raises the very real 
concern about the rate of diabetes in aboriginal communities 
because they do not have the proper food.  Would the hon. member 
support the Minister of Health bringing forth measures through 
the Department of Health to help these people, to help these 
women and children, the families in these aboriginal communities 
deal with questions of diabetes? When these things come forward 
in the February budget, will he live up to his own words?  If he 
truly believes what he is saying today in this House, will he 
stand at budget time and support these measures, support Nisga'a 
and support Nunavut? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I remind my hon. friend 
and colleague from across the way that it was the Reform Party 
that put forth a private member's motion in May of this year 
which received unanimous support.  It concerned a national 
headstart program that we now see the government, to its credit, 
starting to adopt in aboriginal communities.  It is expanding 
that to aboriginal communities outside reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support those initiatives.  We support investing in these 
people in order for them to stand on their own two feet.  But we 
do not support the government merely tossing money at aboriginal 
groups without any accountability.  That does a huge disservice 
to the aboriginal people who ask why it is that the chief and 
council live in beautiful houses, have cars and skidoos while 
they do not have enough money to feed their children.  That is 
partly why they are living on Coca-Cola and macaroni. That is 
what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I beseech the minister and the parliamentary secretary, do not 
go on a fancy trip to meet with the aboriginal leadership. Go to 
the people on the ground.  Get rid of the entourage.  Meet with 
those people.  Go by yourself.  Do not go on an official visit. 
Find out what is going on.  Listen to what those people are 
saying because they will tell you that all is not well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solutions are not difficult.  Some of these solutions 
require that paradigm shift.  Give aboriginal people the tools to 
provide for themselves and they will do well.  Do it under the 
guise of equality for all so that aboriginals and non-aboriginals 
can work together as brothers and sisters to build a stronger 
country for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people, ensuring that their traditional rights and 
responsibilities are enshrined in the constitution, which they 
are, can teach us a lot about their culture. We will certainly 
benefit from that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to point out to the hon. member opposite that perhaps he has 
not actually read this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been honoured to have a very good association with a 
native community in my riding, the Chippewas of Georgina Island. 
They have been involved right from the beginning on this 
legislation, in spearheading this effort. The thing that 
convinced me this was good legislation was that Chief Bill McCue, 
who has shown tremendous leadership in this area, told me that he 
and the members of his community want to be treated exactly like 
every other Canadian.  They wanted to have control over their own 
economic destiny.  Perhaps the hon. member should read the 
legislation because that is what the legislation allows them to 
do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Two other communities, Chief Rennie Goose and the Mississaugas 
of Scugog Island First Nation in Ontario, and Chief Austin Bear 
and the Muskoday First Nation in Saskatchewan, have also voted 
overwhelmingly to assume control over their reserve lands and 
resources.  I congratulate them for their vision and 
determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 14 first nations that developed a framework agreement have 
the goal of assuming community control over their reserve lands 
and resources.  They signed a government to government agreement 
with Canada in February 1996 at a ceremony hosted by the Georgina 
Island First Nation.  I was deeply moved by the experience of 
attending this historic event in my constituency and witnessing 
the signature of the previous minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The responsibility of the 14 first nations under this framework 
agreement is to develop their own land management process and 
conduct their community votes to ratify the agreement.  Bill 
C-49, now before the House for second reading, represents 
Canada's responsibilities to ratify the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement and Bill C-49 are founded on the 
principle that first nations should develop their own laws in 
relation to their reserve lands and resources.  This is 
consistent with the principles proposed by the royal commission 
on aboriginal peoples with respect to self-reliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to bring to this House the words of a concerned 
citizen and a respected elder of the Chippewas of Georgina 
Island.  Charles Warren wrote to me about the effects this 
legislation will have on his community: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Land management includes development of business, farming and 
recreational entertainment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The saying “strike while the iron is hot” cannot apply to us. 
When opportunity knocks, it takes so long for others to make 
decisions for us that the iron is no longer hot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need business here to provide jobs for our people.  We need 
to be free to hire persons and companies who will act quickly and 
to our benefit.  Now we are told who to hire and have to wait for 
okays from Indian affairs constantly.  Those wheels turn slowly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Registration of leases takes six months to several years. 
Sometimes they are lost and have to be redone.  The money from 
such leases are tied up without gaining any interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need control of pollution, of our water and a recycling 
system.  We have a natural swamp area with rare species of birds, 
animals and plant life.  We need some of our people trained to 
safeguard this area.  We have many fruit trees which need to be 
cared for to be productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an excellent gravel pit which could provide for the 
needs of ourselves, plus earn income from outside our community. 
There is land that can provide golf courses, fish farms and clean 
factories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The native people of Georgina Island have all that is needed for 
their great future if they could have a free hand to develop it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charles Warren and his community need swift and speedy passage 
of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement and Bill C-49 establish principles for 
the exercise of self-government in the area of land management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These principles include full, democratic participation in 
fundamental decision making by all adult members of the 
community, both off reserve and on reserve; financial and 
political accountability to the membership; community dispute 
resolution mechanisms; equality of all members, both on and off 
reserve; and equality of female and male members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement and Bill C-49 are consistent with the 
approach to self-government advocated by a number of aboriginal 
groups appearing before the royal commission.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement and the bill provide the model proposed by these 
groups, that is community control over reserve lands and 
resources.  This approach is in accordance with traditional first 
nation practices and customs and reflects the communities' desire 
for economic self-sufficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote Chief Bill McCue on the importance of parliament's 
passing this bill promptly to facilitate transition from federal 
government control over reserve lands to first nations decision 
making: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the framework agreement is implemented by this legislation, 
our community will be able to make timely responses to future 
economic opportunities, beginning as early as April 1, 1999, 
which will generate employment and revenues for our people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These 14 first nations have faith and confidence in their 
ability to take the first step to controlling their own destiny. 
They have demonstrated this ability during the last decade as 
leaders in the area of land management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all parties to pass Bill C-49 as promptly as possible so 
that these 14 first nations can implement their own decision 
making processes for their reserve lands and resources. Other 
first nations undoubtedly will wish to pursue this same goal, 
control over their reserve lands and resources.

Georgina Island for the past five years.  I have many friends 
there.  I have great confidence in their ability to undertake

believe in social justice, who believe that people should have 
control over their own destinies, who believe that people should 
speak their voices and allow their voices to be heard will 
support this legislation.

where there are well dressed people and people with lots of money 
and influence in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there were grassroots aboriginals meeting in the basement 
of an airport hotel in Winnipeg last weekend, where were the 
Liberal members?  Where was the parliamentary secretary for the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal head start program is a good idea.  It made good 
television.  We had all the chiefs fly in to make their

are the children who need this program?  They are still sleeping 
on filthy mattresses in filthy basements of of houses that have 
been burned. Where were the Liberals when those people were 
telling their stories? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be delighted 
to tell the hon. member where I have been.  I have been in the 
community of the Chippewas of Georgina Island. When I talk about 
community I talk about people who live, work, get educated and 
play in that community.  These are the people who voted in their 
own referendum, something the Reform Party pushes at every 
opportunity it can.  These people voted in their own referendum 
overwhelmingly to support this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member denying the Chippewas of Georgina Island the 
right to have a say in their own economic future? Is he denying 
the right of these people to enter into a referendum to state 
very clearly what their position is?  That is not what I have 
heard the Reform Party purports to believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened time and time again to comments from the 
opposite side, the way they demean first nations of this country, 
the way they demean the aboriginal people of this country.

incredibly demeaning comments about my chief, Chief Bill McCue, 
who has shown tremendous leadership and vision working with his 
community on this issue.  He phoned me with great disgust and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as the hon. member is well aware, we have the Nisga'a 
treaty going on in my province of British Columbia right now. The 
provincial government is sending out its version of the facts and 
has been going into a lot of the schools.  I have been doing the 
same thing, except my version of the facts seems to be different 
for some strange reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go into the schools I like to draw analogies so that 
students have something specific to relate to. Students study 
history and one of the things they study is the old feudal system 
where the lord and a group of lords own the land, the resources 
and the revenue that comes in.  They allow the serfs to build on 
the lands, to occupy the lands and to harvest the lands, but they 
control the revenue produced as a result of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern is that each aboriginal individual should have the 
right to determine their own destiny.  Instead, they are being 
locked into an old-fashioned feudal system we grew out of 
centuries ago.  They are being locked into it by the style of 
negotiations taking place. There is no other explanation for what 
is happening.  That is the situation in these settlements as they 
take place.  Individuals do not have property rights.  They do 
not get their share of the financial resources transferred to 
them when these agreements are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member think this is a good system or does she 
think that it would be more appropriate for individual aboriginal 
people to be allowed their land and their financial settlements 
so they can determine their own destinies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, from part of what 
the member is saying it sounds as if he would be in agreement 
with this legislation.  This legislation puts control and 
decision making in the hands of aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chippewas of Georgina Island get a lot of their money from 
cottage leases.  That money goes to Indian affairs.  They then 
have to ask for their own money back.  This is an insane 
situation.  I hope the hon. member understands that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On his ridiculous claim about a feudal system, if the hon. 
member understood anything about history he would understand that 
native people have a system of resource allocation and use of the 
land which predates feudalism by thousands of years. It is a very 
sane system because the land is held in common with a common 
respect for the land and a common respect for the next seven 
generations that follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member continues these false myths about first nations 
people and about Inuit people. It is a shame that they are 
allowed to use these words in an honourable place like this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to enlighten the House on a bit of history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned the Chippewas.  The Chippewas of Sarnia 
have a different story to tell.  It might be a lesson for hon. 
members. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chippewa of Sarnia by way of warfare in defending the 
Canadian interests over American interests had a treaty and an 
alliance with the British government.  Under the War Measures Act 
they were allocated lands around the Sarnia region.  Because it 
was under the War Measures Act, the council of the day held the 
land in trust to a financial institution.  The financial 
institution in turn called on the collateral.  The collateral of 
the land was then owned by the bank and not by the first nation 
of Sarnia, the Chippewa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go to Sarnia we see the Chippewa of Sarnia have their 
reserve and right beside it there are petrochemical companies 
polluting their lands and their livelihood.  The land those 
petrochemical companies own was the land recalled by the 
financial institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure where 
the hon. member was going with his statement, but it is important 
that the House understand the very unique nature of the culture 
of first nations and other aboriginal groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members must understand we have commitments with these people 
that go back decades, that go back hundreds of years.  It is time 
the government lives up to those commitments.  The legislation is 
the first step in a long number of steps that have started and 
will continue to be made to live up to our commitments to 
aboriginal people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a great honour for me to speak to the topic of land 
management for first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use my first language for some of the terms because a lot 
of the issues are hard to interpret.  To continue with where I 
was leading with the Chippewa of Sarnia, it was the area of land 
rights.  Once a chief and council or an individual on first 
nations land has the right to own the land, that land is 
transferable and diminishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Cree we call it aski-kahna which means all the land was once 
first nations land.  All the land was aboriginal land. Aski-kahna 
means what is left of the treaty obligation.  It is like a 
corral.  Aboriginal people and their livelihoods have been 
corralled in these reserves.  That is why we see the sick society 
that exists in the cycle of no future among our communities.  The 
traditional lands beyond the reserves have to be considered.  I 
think the bill does not address that.  It only addresses the 
administration of lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Chippewa of Sarnia lost their land to the petrochemical 
companies, they lost it forever.  It is no longer Chippewa land 
because it was covered under the War Measures Act.  It is still 
under the Indian Act.  Until the first nations of the country 
come to terms with the existing treaties with the nation and the 
Indian Act which governs and administers the process, that 
process evolves and will come to light in a very short time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, of the 14 nations we have the Cree nations of 
Muskoday, Cowessess and Opaskwayak Cree from Manitoba.  I will 
use Cree to explain to them what my thoughts are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note:  Member spoke in Cree</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that as aboriginal people we have allowed people 
from all over the world to seek refuge, raise their children and 
have a joyful and fruitful future on this land.

call Canada also recognized the first nation sovereignty of 
aboriginal nationhood as in Cree nationhood, as in Dene 
nationhood, as in the Chippewa nationhood and the Inuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very crucial definition of the Metis comes into play.  The 
hon. member mentioned that aboriginal people were defined under 
the Constitution, but it does not go any further than that. There 
is a huge dilemma with that definition.  The term first nations 
does not cover every obligation with all people.  There are 
treaty, non-treaty, off reserve, on reserve treaty, status and 
non-status Indians.  There are Metis and Inuit.  All these 
different definitions used in English terminology do not mean 
anything to an aboriginal person.  It is all for administrative 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Cree</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the makings of the law.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Cree we have a name for the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Cree</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the legal rights of the land written on a piece of paper. 
This is the highest order of the country's definition of the law. 
The Constitution gives powers to the House of Commons and all the 
symbols of government in the province right down to the 
municipalities.  However there is a dilemma.  We have certain 
parties that would like first nations to be municipal 
governments.  That is a very major shift in our obligations 
between the treaties and the Indian Act in recognizing first 
nations as they really are.  Are they the third level of 
governance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we wanted to respect the rightful ways of entering this land, 
maybe the first nations and aboriginal people should be occupying 
the Senate and having the final assenting powers on all laws 
since they were the first occupiers of the land.  Then they would 
have a higher structure as we see with the Iroquois confederacy, 
a united nations.  There is no united nations among all 
aboriginal people that unites from coast to coast to coast. There 
is no higher level of accountability at their levels. Nothing has 
been designed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the stories of creation on Turtle Island there was a wish and 
a prophecy that the first nations would have eventually united as 
united nations.  Columbus came ashore and brought a whole 
different set of rules, governance and religions to this country 
as a colony and disrupted that process.  That shift in the 
country will have to evolve and create a reality between the 
aboriginal world view and our world view.  Those two will have to 
come into play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Cree</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the understanding, the wish and the prayer to see the 
future of our children grow.  When decisions are made here, they 
should not be made for the decisions of the day.  They should be 
made for our children's, children's, children's children, for the 
seventh generation.  Until then it is taken over for another 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Land opportunities have been mentioned.  Specific statements 
have been made. I am honoured to say that our party supports the 
act because land ownership stays with the first nations.  They 
are not allowed to sell the land.  If they start selling land 
people are dispossessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my neighbourhood there are communities that were never 
urbanized.  For example, the community of Losh is the largest 
Dene community in the country with 4,000 Dene people living 
there.  It was never that large before but they are amassed 
between the first nations boundaries and the municipal 
boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have no decision making on the traditional lands, the 
water, trees and mineral rights that exist beyond.  That is the 
economic cycle which needs to drive our purpose for the future. 
We have had land allocated to settlers who came from Europe and 
from all over the world and railroads were built to accommodate 
that. 
We have never accommodated the needs of aboriginals in terms of 
land, resources and livelihood.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing a sample of 14 nations to make administrative decisions 
concerning the management of their lands is a first step.  In a 
broader perspective there is a major challenge for the country to 
deal with all aboriginal people.  The act is supported by our 
party but it is a very small step since it applies only to 14 
first nations.  There is a bigger aboriginal population out there 
that wants to see a fruitful future for their children.  They 
would allow all people of the world to find refuge in the land 
they call home, but they have to be a part of the system.  The 
system of governance will have to evolve.  The system of 
administration is evolving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some talk about first nation chiefs and say that the chief and 
council have a fruitful way of life.  They travels, take jets to 
Ottawa and negotiate.  We should not knock them down.  They have 
adopted a first opportunity to administer Indian affairs regional 
departments.  Let us look at tribal councils.  We are finally 
seeing aboriginal people making decisions.  We should not knock 
them down.  We should give them a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few generations ago all we saw were Indian agents making these 
decisions.  Just because an aboriginal person is wearing a 
business suit and has a three figure salary because he is working 
in a corporate or a government institution, that person should 
not be knocked for striving to stand up for a piece of land and 
future endeavours and to be a role model for others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live on a huge piece of land but we have problems with 
housing.  Many northern communities have housing problems.  Why 
do they have housing problems when they live in the middle of the 
timber resource?  They do not have houses.  It is the economic 
cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Rupert's Land was created the Hudson's Bay Company claimed 
the land.  Hudson's Bay is still an economic, capitalistic 
process.  It does not share its capital with its people. Trappers 
still do not reap any benefits of the many furs they have 
provided to create the wealth of Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hudson's Bay Company should be pulled out of those 
communities and co-operative systems of trade and housing should 
be created.  There should be shared ownership based on a process 
like Habitat for Humanity where people build their own houses. 
They would be given a chance to roll up their sleeves and help 
their neighbours to build houses using the trees around them. 
They do not need to use plywood from B.C. for houses in northern 
Manitoba.  They can build housing with the timber that exists in 
northern Manitoba and northern Saskatchewan.  That would meet the 
housing needs of the immediate region.  We do not have to trade 
across the country for local building needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social, economic and governance needs are major issues that 
require a major debate.  In the meantime we have a land 
management bill that gives some opportunity for first nations 
people to decide on zoning, regional environmental protection, 
and the economic and leasing needs of the land.  It is an 
opportunity to address these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In further debates we might discuss the issue of allowing people 
who lease first nations' lands to have a mechanism to appeal some 
zoning decisions that impact them.  If agricultural land is to be 
used for industrial or recreational use, at least the person who 
is leasing the land might have a mechanism to appeal such a 
decision.  That will be designed later.  That concern has been 
raised by a number of people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal people in my riding, who are many, often come 
into my office expressing concerns with the direction that this 
government seems to be taking Indian affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I can remember back in 1993, after I was first 
elected to the House of Commons, meeting with an aboriginal 
woman, a lawyer, who represented a band that had expressed great 
concerns about this bill.  As a matter of fact, she expressed the 
idea then that this bill was nothing new, that in fact it was a 
leftover from the Mulroney government.  She had huge concerns 
about the amount of money the government was pouring into the 
process and what this bill was going to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impression that the government has been trying to leave all 
day, that this is part of the process of creating some kind of a 
new partnership with Indian people, is quite fraudulent and 
shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is well intended to bring into force a framework 
agreement on first nations land management to give first nations 
control over their land and the resources upon and under their 
land.  That goal is long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea that any income from aboriginal lands has to flow to 
Ottawa and then Indian people have to come to Ottawa begging for 
their money should be corrected.  Sometimes they find out many 
years later that their money has not in fact been held in trust, 
but has been squandered, spent and misused.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can correct that it will be an achievement.  However, I do 
not think this particular bill is the way to do it for several 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the issues of land management, this bill calls 
for the creation of what would essentially be a third level of 
government.  In order to create a third level of government, most 
Canadians would agree that it would require a Constitutional 
amendment and all that goes with that.  We cannot create another 
level of government and change the structure of government in 
Canada simply by bypassing the required process, as the 
government is trying to do here as well as in the Nisga'a land 
claim process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This partial and yet substantial form of self-government would 
apply to all first nations that have signed on to the framework 
agreement.  The framework agreement gives first nations the power 
to pass laws for the development, conservation, protection, 
management, use and possession of first nations land.  The 
agreement also gives first nations control over licenses, leases, 
property and other interests.  These self-governing powers are 
properly placed with aboriginal people, but the powers have been 
dangerously placed in the hands of a select few first nations 
leaders with no provision for accountability to the people they 
represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly concerned with clause 37.  I have heard a lot 
of others say they are concerned with the same clause.  This 
clause states that the framework agreement act will prevail in 
the event of any conflict between this act and any other federal 
law.  There is no constitutional basis for the creation of this 
third level of government, nor is there a basis for granting even 
partial powers such as these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Bill C-49 undermines the Constitution by giving first 
nations the power to create laws that would supersede federal 
laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that I am not opposed to native 
self-government.  I am simply opposed to giving sovereign 
jurisdiction over certain issues to such a level of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I recognize the need for effective 
self-government.  However, we believe that aboriginal 
self-government should be a delegated level of government, not 
one in which one segment of the Canadian population is given 
special rights or privileges.  When we say that certain laws 
apply to all non-aboriginal Canadians but no longer apply to 
aboriginal Canadians we are creating two classes of citizens. 
This division is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is over two weeks since Nelson Mandela visited and spoke in 
the House.  Already some members of the House are forgetting the 
important struggle which this remarkable man represents. 
President Mandela dedicated his life to breaking down barriers 
between different cultural groups in South Africa.  He pursued 
equality for all South Africans regardless of race or colour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creating these first nations reserves, nations within the 
nations of Canada, is no different in my mind than the creation 
of the homelands of South Africa.  The same kind of squalor, 
poverty, disease and abuse is taking place on the reserves in 
Canada that the black people of South Africa suffered for so many 
years until Nelson Mandela was able to break that system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this government not realize that by affording special 
privileges to one cultural group it is creating rather than 
eliminating such divisions?  Not only is it creating divisions, 
it is promoting an “us against them” mentality.  For years this 
mentality existed on the part of aboriginal people, and rightly 
so.  Poor treatment by our ancestors gave rise to animosity 
between aboriginal Canadians and non-aboriginal Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 131 years successive Liberal and Conservative governments 
instituted well-meaning programs, but programs that were 
disastrous for aboriginal people.  They have not given aboriginal 
people the same rights as the rest of Canadians enjoy, such as 
the right to own a home, to raise a family in reasonable 
conditions, to travel the country and to have a reasonable 
income.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those things are denied.  As my colleague from the NDP said, 
aboriginal people are being corralled in reserves where 
conditions are making it very difficult for them to leave and 
participate in mainstream society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now at a point in history where we have the opportunity 
to promote and ensure equality among all Canadians.  Instead, 
this government would rather perpetuate the animosity by 
affording special privileges to those first nations which are 
signatories to the framework agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is frustrating to non-aboriginal Canadians and 
also to most grassroots aboriginal Canadians who see a particular 
segment of Canadian society getting special privileges and 
constitutional rights beyond those afforded to the average 
citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of such an unconstitutional inequity is only one of 
my concerns.  I am also troubled by the fact that through this 
legislation major sections of the Indian Act will no longer 
apply.  My colleagues and I certainly support repealing the 
Indian Act, but not by this cherry picking method of taking the 
good and leaving the rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stanley Cuthland, an elder at the Saskatchewan Indian Federated 
College, says that the traditional customs regarding divorce laws 
are vague.  Therefore, by giving first nations' leaders control 
over property division and possession in the case of marriage 
breakdown, we are putting the well-being of native women and 
children in jeopardy.  That is certainly an issue that I heard 
raised by almost every member who spoke on this side of the 
House.  I also heard some feeble justification for it from the 
other side of the House that really would not provide much 
comfort to any Indian woman looking at this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no guarantee that the divorce laws, which the member 
opposite talked about the first nations creating, would respect 
the individual rights of the individuals they affect.  That is 
only one example of the problem that may arise from enacting this 
legislation.  There are all kinds of problems.  I guess the devil 
is in the detail and the development of the regulations that will 
be enacted on the reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that one of the biggest factors 
contributing to the cycles of dependency on reserves is the fact 
that reserve land and property is held in common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a lot of discussion about the traditional Indian way of 
holding property in common, but the Indian people who come into 
my office to talk to me about problems on the reserves do not see 
their aspirations any differently than I do.  They have a great 
desire to own their own home, or their own piece of property, or 
to make improvements to their home, when they can afford to, 
because it is theirs and they can pass it on to their children. 
They want exactly the same things the rest of us want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This idea that all Indian people still want to have this tribal 
custom of holding everything in common for the tribe is, in my 
opinion, an excuse for the aboriginal leadership to maintain 
control and the wealth of the reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Giving a select few native leaders control over those common 
properties provides an opportunity for those in power to take 
advantage of the others in the community.  I see it all the time. 
I cannot understand how members on the opposite side of the House 
can continue to turn a blind eye to the poverty and despair on so 
many reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite even spoke about how we should not be so 
critical of these incidents that we continue to bring up of abuse 
of power and mismanagement of money because these people somehow 
have to learn to manage their own affairs and they will be better 
for it.  That is idiocy.  As long as we allow a system of tyranny 
to continue on the reserves, with the grassroots people having no 
tools at their disposal to correct those things and make their 
leadership more democratic, more responsive and more transparent, 
that system will be perpetuated forever. 
It will never change.  The reserve natives will continue to live 
in substandard conditions while many of their chiefs and councils 
live in big houses and drive new cars and trucks.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has been on a reserve knows about these things and 
what takes place on the reserve after a band election when the 
chief and the entire administrative structure of the band change. 
People are evicted from their houses.  Relatives of the new 
chief move into the houses.  These things happen every day. 
People talk to me about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a lady visit my office who had a wonderful well paying job 
in social welfare on the reserve.  She enjoyed her job. She was 
well educated and she was good at her job.  She witnessed the 
abuse and corruption on her own reserve.  Money was being taken 
out of services for children and people on the reserve and being 
put into places where it should not have been. When she 
complained her life was threatened.  She was evicted from her 
house on the reserve and had to move off the reserve into town to 
preserve her life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stories go on.  I had a young man come into my office with a 
lot of documentation regarding mismanagement and corruption on 
his reserve.  I looked at the papers and realized he had a solid 
case.  I went with him to the RCMP and had it look at the 
evidence.  The RCMP said there was solid evidence that something 
was wrong.  The RCMP said it would begin a criminal 
investigation. The investigation went on for months until the 
RCMP phoned me and told me this young man turned up dead on the 
reserve and there was no sense in continuing any further with the 
investigation. I can go on and on.  There are endless stories 
such as these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leadership on these reserves seemingly enjoys the funds 
originating from the federal government but they are unevenly 
distributed among other people.  Indian people refer to this 
system as the Indian industry and how hideous it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an outrage to think this legislation would benefit most 
native people when it is only a select few native leaders 
controlling the show. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem on reserves needs to be fixed before native leaders 
are afforded any more power.  That is the message being sent to me 
all the time.  Otherwise we are only contributing to an already 
enormous economic and social problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time this government asked the grassroots natives, not 
just native leadership, what they want rather than giving full 
authority to the aboriginal leadership to impose whatever system 
it likes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many native constituents have walked through my office door to 
express their concerns over the secrecy and corruption on 
reserve.  I can assure members that not one of them has ever 
suggested affording their native leaders greater control over 
their lives.  Most natives feel the leaders already have too much 
power and the basic rights of the individual are being trampled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am frustrated by the government's automatic dismissal of 
anything offered by Reform members with regard to aboriginal 
issues.  While I recognize that our philosophies may not always 
agree with the government's, I am here to represent my 
constituents.  That is what I am attempting to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say a constituent has approached me with a concern, the 
frequent response from the members opposite is that was just one 
person, the majority support them.  Under most conditions they 
would quote one poll or another to support their position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is there are no polls reflecting the views of 
grassroots aboriginal people.  When it comes to native issues 
there is a secrecy and sensitivity that makes it difficult for 
grassroots natives to speak out about what they want or need. They 
feel threatened by the chief and councillors who already wield 
much control over their lives. If that control is increased, as 
it will be by this legislation, it will be even more difficult 
for those natives to speak out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot accept any legislation that supersedes federal laws of 
general application.  Amendments must be made to ensure that in 
the event of a conflict with constitutional and federal laws, 
constitutional and federal laws will reign supreme.

control over their lives, that is a commendable objective but she

feel sorry for the misdeeds and the wrongs that have been done to 
those people of native ancestry who joined the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to say that I fully extend my sympathy 
with them.  They volunteered.  They were not recruited. They 
fought.  Some of them gave their lives but they were never given 
full recognition for their services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this day, as far as I know, the Department of Veterans 
Affairs has never issued an apology for the way those fine young 
men were treated.  I have some of those veterans of the Indian 
ancestry within my constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout history we, meaning caucasians, committed many wrongs 
against the natives of this country. 
But one is so outstanding as we approach November 11. It really 
hurts me. Some of them were even denied the right that they were 
really people within the army.  They were denied such things as 
Veterans Lands Act rights. The Department of Veteran Affairs 
denied them the same rights for continuing education. I have 
talked to many of them.  I hope someday I will be able to correct 
that wrong whether through a motion or a private member's bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency we have Moose Mountain, part of the name of 
the constituency. I want to tell members about another terrible 
wrong we did to those people just before the turn of the century. 
We allowed white people, caucasians, to come in.  Yes, they gave 
a dollar for the land, but within a few years these same 
speculators sold the same land for $2.50 an acre.  They really 
destroyed a whole potential reserve at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time we have tried to correct, through the Indian 
lands entitlement act, a wrong that was done.  As a result of 
that, we have created two new Indian reserves out of what was 
forced into one reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say this to correct a wrong.  Every member in this 
party believes fundamentally, without question, that we want to 
see the treaties honoured.  It is a fallacy for the members 
opposite to say we do not want to see the treaties honoured.  We 
do. But what we do not want to see is a continuation of these 
piecemeal events as they relate to natives in Canada which will 
only perpetuate the myth that we have in Indian affairs at the 
present time.  We really are not taking any substantial measures 
with this bill to correct a problem in the societal system we 
have out there.   We simply prolong it.  This is what my 
colleagues and I agree on fundamentally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 13 months we are facing a brand new millennium.  It is time 
we got with it.  It is time that we took a look very seriously at 
the greatest social problem we have, honour the treaties and let 
us go into the new millennium, not with the same old rolling over 
of disputes but with something that looks new, is new and will 
respect the dignity of every man, woman and child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will not do that.  The Indian Act today does not do 
that.  I do not know how many times I have had people come to me 
and say “I want the same right that you have, Mr. MP.  I want to 
be able to go down to my office, just like you go to your town 
office, and look at a financial statement.  I want to see an 
audited financial statement”.  It is not only one call; this 
goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us to say that they are not ready for it, I say if they are 
not ready now, and I know the women and children are ready and 
most of the grassroots people are ready, this bill does not face 
that issue.  Until that issue is faced, we are going to continue 
with the big social problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from September 25 consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
for the opportunity to speak to the motion which calls upon the 
government to address the challenges facing many young Canadians 
as they seek to finance their post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, I commend the hon. member for her concern for the 
educational needs of young Canadians.  I assure her and other 
members of the House that the government is concerned about the 
issue of accessibility to post-secondary education and is working 
hard to address it.  We have made it a key priority from our 
first day in office since we know that having a good education 
and getting the right skills are key to the future of our youth 
and the economic well-being of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I disagree with a number of points in the hon. member's 
motion such as some of her premises which suggest that we have 
privatized the Canada students loans program and that we want to 
turn students over to bill collectors.  This is not true. Another 
premise is that we need to implement a whole new federal 
government student grant program presumably because nothing of 
any value is currently in place.  A third premise is that we need 
to establish accessibility as a new national standard for 
post-secondary education because once again the member seems to 
feel we are not doing enough in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless I agree with the underlying motive in the motion, 
namely the desire to ensure full access to post-secondary 
education for all students who qualify, no matter where they live 
or what their family circumstances.  I state unequivocally that 
this is also a priority of our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make sure we got things right we consulted with students, 
their families, our provincial partners and officials in 
post-secondary educational and training institutions to find out 
what challenges students face and how we can work with them to 
address the issues they face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things students told us was that they needed better 
access to financial assistance.  Families told us that they 
needed some help in saving for their children's education.  As a 
direct result of these consultations the last budget contained 13 
new measures aimed at improving access to post-secondary 
education for those students who might find it difficult to 
pursue this goal without financial assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures included, first, the millennium scholarship fund 
that will provide grants to 100,000 students annually based on 
their financial need and academic merit and, second, changes to 
the Canada student loans program that help students repay their 
loans.  For example, we included a 17% tax credit on the interest 
they are paying on their loans each year.  The borrower can also 
ask the lending institution to extend the loan repayment period 
for 15 years, which can lower monthly payments by nearly 25% at 
current rate. Third, there are Canada study grants to help those 
in need. Fourth, we are also encouraging families to save for 
their children's education by providing a Canada education saving 
grant of 20% on the first $2,000 of annual contributions made to 
a registered education savings plan for children up to age 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the last point, even if they set aside $30 per month each 
year, they will get a grant of 20% of the total contribution each 
year from the Government of Canada.  If they contribute the full 
$2,000 they can receive the maximum grant of $400.  This has 
already proven to be a very popular savings vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members are aware, some special students face special 
challenges in pursuing their education. 
For example, students with disabilities face multiple issues 
relating to access.

sure they get the assistance they need to enjoy equal access. 
Some of these involve financial considerations while others 
relate to long outmoded ways of thinking which emphasize 
disability rather than recognition of special ability.  For 
instance, students with permanent disabilities such as deafness, 
blindness or other physical or learning disabilities are eligible 
for a Canada study grant of up to $5,000 a year to cover 
exceptional education related costs that might result from the 
disability.  That amounts to an increase of $2,000 or a 67% 
increase in our support for these students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These funds may also be used to cover such exceptional expenses 
as the cost of a tutor, an interpreter, attendant care or any 
other special assistance required by students with disabilities 
to allow them to undertake or continue their studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that this is not just a one-shot effort but is part 
of an ongoing commitment by the government to assess the needs of 
students with disabilities in order to help them take their 
rightful place in post-secondary education and training.  There 
are also grants for high need part time students, students with 
dependants and women wishing to pursue certain doctoral studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows the government's ongoing commitment to ensuring the 
widest possible access to post-secondary education.  Contrary to 
what the motion claims, the Government of Canada has not 
privatized our system of student financial assistance.  Rather we 
are working in partnership with students, families, educational 
and financial institutions to make sure that every student with 
the qualifications, ability and desire can get the help they need 
to continue.  It shows that our loan and grant programs are 
opening up learning opportunities to the full spectrum of 
Canadian students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put a clearly defined action plan in place which is 
helping to improve the accessibility of post-secondary education 
for all students, no matter what their family circumstances or 
special needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of this the motion before us today, while well 
intentioned, is unnecessary and could actually harm the progress 
being made in helping students.  For this reason I intend to vote 
against it and I would urge other members to do likewise. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today in Private Members' Business we are debating a 
motion brought forward by my colleague from Vancouver East having 
to do with post-secondary education.  I would like to read the 
motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should reverse 
the privatization of Canada Student Loans, reject proposals for 
income contingent loan repayment, and should instead implement a 
federal student grant program and establish accessibility as a 
new national standard for post-secondary education. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the motion.  My colleague believes and urges 
support for a move to replace the necessity for student loans 
with outright grants to students which would not be repayable and 
to ensure that any student who wishes to pursue post-secondary 
education would be given the means to do so.  I believe that is a 
correct understanding and I see my colleague agreeing with that 
summary of her proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is an extremely valuable one to discuss.  Clearly 
there is an increasing feeling on the part of young people in the 
country that the cost of education is becoming greater, more and 
more of a burden.  There are some who believe that the cost is 
becoming prohibitive in people pursuing an education who 
otherwise would wish to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that premise is true it certainly would need to be addressed 
very clearly.  In a country such as Canada with a small 
population base our niche in the world economy clearly is one of 
technological and innovative expertise. 
We do not have the sheer horsepower that other countries have, 
but we certainly can have the brain power and the technological 
power that an above average education system can provide.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Solid education is a key to a dynamic Canada in the context of 
the global economy and to good jobs and secure jobs for the 
workforce.  That is very important because working people are the 
ones who contribute to the social security measures that we have 
in place, as well as to their own well-being and the well-being 
of their families, and to future prosperity and quality of life 
in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all parties acknowledge the key role that post-secondary 
education plays in Canadian society.  We need to have high 
quality in this area with highly qualified instruction, with good 
facilities and top notch research equipment and programs, and 
with the money needed to pay the expenses of education, tuition, 
room and board, and books.  We need to ensure that capable 
people, those with ability and academic interests, are not barred 
from pursuing that line of endeavour.  There is very little to 
argue with in the proposal that students should have the means to 
pursue these opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate has centred around what is a reasonable means of 
contribution to the funding of the education of students. 
Education is expensive in terms not only of the time and talent 
of the people involved but also in terms of dollars.  There is a 
legitimate debate about who should bear the costs of that 
educational activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the student pay any of the costs at all?  I think my 
colleague is suggesting the costs should be borne entirely by 
others in society and then in due course the student would gain 
the expertise to contribute toward the education of others later 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I would pose to her—and perhaps she can address it 
as she wraps up the debate—is one of fairness.  Students 
receiving an education clearly have an enhanced tool in their 
hand to earn and to provide a life for themselves and their 
family.  Would it be fair to expect other people to bear all that 
cost although a great deal of the benefit will accrue to the 
student?  It is not simply a matter of society benefiting 
although clearly society will, but also there is a personal 
benefit on the part of the student. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question comes to mind.  Is there a human dimension that 
makes people value and put more individual effort into something 
in which they or their families have a personal investment as 
opposed to having no personal stake in the educational endeavour 
in question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a question of working people, many of whom have 
not had either the skill or the inclination to pursue academic 
studies, working at fairly low paying jobs at $7 or $8 an hour 
but having to pay substantial taxes to fund the cost of education 
of other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some fairness issues I would like to see addressed by 
the member which suggest to me that outright grants to any and 
all people who want to pursue post-secondary education may not be 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that students at the present time are required to 
pay about a quarter of the actual cost of their education.  This 
is up from about 14% in the early 1980s.  It is a little lower 
than 18% which was the cost in the 1970s. 
The question we need to ask ourselves is whether it is fair to 
ask students and their families to fund a quarter of the cost of 
their post-secondary education themselves rather than those costs 
being totally borne by other working Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that family incomes have risen 
substantially since 1970.  Therefore, the burden of 
post-secondary education is not as great as it was 20 or 30 years 
ago.  There is the serious issue of student debt and the 
availability of loans to pay the educational costs, but then the 
burden is on the student afterward.  My Reform colleague who 
spoke before on this issue talked about some of the proposals we 
have put out into public debate to address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing to notice is that students are hampered by this 
government in other ways.  They have to pay EI premiums if they 
earn over $2,000 a year, even though they do not qualify for 
benefits.  Students earning over $3,500 a year have to pay CPP 
premiums.  Students earning just under $7,000 a year, which is 
certainly not enough to live on nor to go to school on, are 
subject to personal income tax.  There is an anomaly here. 
Students are barely able to pay the freight even though they only 
pay 25% of the true costs of education, but their disposable 
income is being taken by government in payroll and other taxes. 
That is something to address as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarship fund, often talked about as the big 
assister of students, in reality will help less than 10% of 
students and they will be chosen by a board appointed by the 
government. That is not going to be of great excitement to most 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the issues we need to talk about in this debate.  I 
commend the member for bringing forward this serious issue.  I 
hope that she will respond to some of the concerns and balancing 
considerations which I have raised.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
address the motion of the hon. member for Vancouver East. This 
motion deals with a very important issue, that is access to 
post-secondary education. I will read the motion before 
explaining the Bloc Quebecois' position. Motion M-132 reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
reverse the privatisation of Canada Student Loans, reject 
proposals for income contingent loan repayment, and should 
instead implement a federal student grant program and establish 
accessibility as a new national standard for post-secondary 
education. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say from the outset that we oppose this motion because it 
is clearly based on a centralizing will, in an area that comes 
under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces under the 
Canadian Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not of course opposed to investments in education, but it 
is not the federal government's role to get involved in this 
area. Indeed, beyond the Constitution itself, we have always 
defended Quebec's education system, which clearly differs from 
those that exist elsewhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec model has been successful, and it is to protect it 
from a centralizing federal program that, this morning, I tabled 
a bill to make changes to the millennium scholarship foundation. 
If that bill is passed, it will allow Quebec, and the other 
Canadian provinces interested, to opt out of the foundation's 
activities, with full financial compensation. 
It would be 
possible for a province to opt out, provided there already 
exists in that province a program aimed at providing financial 
assistance to students in order to promote equity in access to 
post-secondary education.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not read the bill in detail here, but I will invite 
anyone in the rest of Canada who would like to see national 
education standards to do so, for it is a faithful reflection of 
the consensus in Quebec.  That consensus will manifest itself 
each time the federal government tries to interfere in education 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a clear understanding of the difference between Quebec and 
the Canadian provinces, I need to provide a brief description of 
how we have tried to guarantee equality of opportunity for 
access to post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec already has a program for providing financial assistance 
to students.  This would enable it to meet the conditions for 
withdrawal with full compensation, as defined in the bill I have 
made public this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This comprehensive system was not created yesterday.  After the 
Quiet Revolution, the Government of Quebec created a loan and 
bursary program aimed at promoting equal opportunity.  It is the 
only government in Canada to have developed such a system, and 
to offer student assistance based on need, not merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Year after year, the Government of Quebec assumes approximately 
80% of the costs of this program. 
The rest, a marginal amount, comes from the federal program 
Quebec opted out of in 1964 with full compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to assume that Mr. Pearson, the Canadian Prime Minister 
of the time, reached such a good understanding with Mr. Lesage, 
the Premier of Quebec, because he had read the Canadian 
Constitution, which provides clearly that education comes under 
Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduced a bill this morning to remedy the problem created 
by the Liberal government.  By insisting on setting up this 
millennium scholarship fund the Prime Minister precipitated a 
dispute with the National Assembly in a field where the 
separation of powers is very clear.  Because of this, it managed 
to turn all—and I stress that—parties in the National Assembly 
against its proposal. All parties in the National Assembly, 
including the Liberal Party of Quebec, are opposed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He succeeded in uniting all the stakeholders in education in 
Quebec in opposition to him.  Whether we are talking about 
university rectors, professors or students, the world of 
education opposed with a single voice the meddling by the 
federal government in the field of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, I must reject today's motion, which would 
engender the same problems as the millennium fund scholarships 
and apply uniformly across Canada—in Quebec and in the rest of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the risk of repeating myself, I reiterate that the people in 
education in Quebec want to retain the ability to fashion their 
own future according to the choices made by Quebec society.  My 
action this morning is intended to fight this same sort of 
meddling by the federal government.  It aims to have Quebec's 
consensus on the matter respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This consensus is not surprising.  Where education is concerned, 
Quebec has its own developmental tools.  It has had promising 
results as far as accessibility is concerned.  Tuition fees in 
Quebec are twice as low as in the rest of Canada.  The average 
student debt load is estimated to be $11,000 per student, 
compared to more than $25,000 in the rest of Canada.  We in 
Quebec can boast as well of having the highest proportion of 
university undergraduates in terms of our population.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we know how to manage education.  We do not need 
new national standards or a new campaign to increase the federal 
government's profile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is too little money available for education to take any of 
it for artificial country-wide standards, or to buy the Prime 
Minister publicity, which is the main purpose of the millennium 
scholarship foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at recent federal initiatives in education and 
assistance to youth, it is obvious that raising the Liberal 
government's profile is more important than students' real 
needs.  That is particularly clear in the case of the millennium 
scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is prepared to totally duplicate a government 
structure that is already working perfectly well.  The motion is 
aimed in exactly the same direction as the millennium 
scholarship foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Government of Quebec has already accredited all 
educational institutions within its borders.  It has already put 
into place a system which selects students based on need and not 
on merit, systems for auditing records and distributing 
assistance, an appeal process, and so on.  This structure has 
been in place in Quebec for a long time now, and works very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill urges the federal government to transfer financial 
assistance directly to Quebec's students through Quebec's 
existing system, consistent with the wishes of the elected 
representatives of the National Assembly.  It is a system that 
is based not only on the needs and on the societal choices of 
the PQ government, but that reflects the wishes of all parties 
in the National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to point out that the money in the millennium 
scholarships fund properly belongs to Quebec and to the 
provinces who wish to opt out of the program.  The money the 
federal government is putting into the foundation comes from 
cuts to transfer payments intended for Quebec and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec alone, federal government payments to the education 
sector have been cut by $500 million annually. 
It is not surprising that Canadian provinces and Quebec are 
demanding that the federal government resume transfer payments 
before creating any new programs.  Nor is it surprising that 
Quebec's education sector is condemning the government for 
giving $75 million in millennium scholarships with one hand, 
while removing an amount six times greater from the education 
budget with the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not addressed the issue of privatization of student 
loans, or of proposals for income contingent loan repayment. 
The reason is very simple: these measures do not apply to Quebec 
which, as I explained, has designed its own system of financial 
aid for students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge all those interested in 
education to study this system, which has nothing to do with 
privatization or income contingent loan repayment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to stand today to speak to the motion by my colleague 
from Vancouver East which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
reverse the privatization of Canada Student Loans, reject 
proposals for income contingent loan repayment, and should 
instead implement a federal student grant program and establish 
accessibility as a new national standard for post-secondary 
education. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to dedicate what I have to say today to three young 
women.  One of them, who worked for me last term, is one of the 
many students in this country who are bowled over by crushing 
student debt.  Another young woman had to declare bankruptcy 
because of the size of her student debt.  The main crime of both 
of these women was that they chose to get a post-secondary 
education. The third young woman is 20 years old and is 
absolutely terrified about even entering the game because of the 
situation she now sees facing so many other people. These are the 
people I am thinking about when I talk about this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has called itself the government of 
youth.  At the same time it is engaging in a deplorable strategy 
of gutting funding for post-secondary education and privatizing 
Canada's student loans and forcing more and more students into 
severe debt. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion attempts to rectify this injustice.  It also 
attempts to highlight the Liberal hypocrisy and make the link 
explicit between the drive to privatize post-secondary education 
and the increased hopelessness of students graduating into 
unemployment and even poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also should be made clear that, as the government retreats 
from its commitment to post-secondary education, the banks are 
moving in.  More and more students are forced to borrow more 
money directly from banks in order to fund their education. 
Banks are not publicly accountable and have an interest in profit 
maximization, not in education and student well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a strategy on the part of the Liberals to erode public 
funding for post-secondary education to the point where it is 
completely within the private sector domain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this motion the New Democrats are pressuring the Liberals 
to recognize the extent of the student debt crisis.  We want the 
government to listen to what the students are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am interested in the comments from my colleague opposite about 
disabled students, and I would like to speak a bit about what is 
facing disabled students in this equation right now.  Disabled 
students are still not at all facing a level playing field when 
it comes to post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have enormously handicapped students or just mobility 
handicapped students who have to work around attendant care 
schedules.  They really are handicapped by the schedules of 
others.  What we need here and now is really a user friendly home 
care program that will meet the needs of students as they try to 
make it to classes at different hours of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my city we need more than two accessible taxis for students 
who have to find their way to universities.  We have students who 
are dependent on wheelchairs and find themselves not able to get 
to school because their wheelchairs are in disrepair.  They are 
in fact having to spearhead their own fundraising for new 
wheelchairs.  It would be really unfair at this point to say that 
there is a level playing field for these students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also a lot of hidden costs for disabled students, 
things like audio tapes and batteries and hundreds of ways that 
students have to pick up hidden costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deaf students in Ontario have recently found their grants turned 
into loans.  The cost of interpretation for a deaf and hard of 
hearing student is quite frankly astounding.  It can reach up to 
$60,000 per student. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not leave the impression that students with disabilities 
are feeling confident as they enter the slings and arrows of 
outrageous higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put forward some facts about post-secondary education. 
According to Human Resources Development Canada, 45% of new jobs 
by 2000 will require post-secondary education.  That means for 
many young people attending university or college there is simply 
no option if they want to find work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this and despite saying they are committed to youth, 
Liberals continue to throw barriers in the way of young people 
struggling to develop the skills and talents necessary to get 
ahead in a cut throat global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1995 the federal Liberals have cut $1.5 billion from 
federal funding for post-secondary education.  Since 1980 Liberal 
and Conservative governments have cut federal funding from $6.40 
for each dollar of students to less than $3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuition fees in Canada have reached a national average of $3,100 
which surpasses the average tuition rate at publicly funded 
universities in the U.S.  Bankruptcy rates for students trying to 
pay off loans are at a record level, having increased by 700% 
since 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently we have 130,000 students in default.  The number of 
bankrupt graduates is estimated at 37,000.  There is a legacy.  I 
really cannot get that out of my mind.  I guess the first thing 
this motion urges, which I think is central, is that the 
government should reverse the privatization of Canada student 
loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the Liberals gave financial institutions broader 
responsibility in the area of student financial assistance. 
Before that time, even though student loans were accessed through 
banks, they were fully guaranteed by government.  Since then the 
federal government has ceased to guarantee student loans.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead it pays a 5% risk premium on all loans to participant 
lenders. It was the government's subtle way of saying that 
students are not to be trusted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget the government announced another giant step 
toward privatization.  Buried deep within the budget legislation 
currently in committee is a clause which gives banks more power 
to refuse student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clause allows cabinet, outside the scrutiny of the House, 
to determine which students do not deserve access to loans. The 
implications to that are staggering.  Who is to say which 
guidelines cabinet will set?  Will single mothers hoping to 
access loans be turned away because they missed their credit card 
payments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this the first step toward giving banks total control over 
eligibility guidelines?  How far are we from banks being able to 
determine which areas of study have a better return than others? 
For example, how profitable is it to get an education in the 
arts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also concerned that privatizing student loans gives banks 
even more power on campus.  CEOs and chairs of Canada's biggest 
banks already sit on boards of governors of many of Canada's 
universities and colleges. Privatizing student loans furthers 
their influence in shaping the direction of post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does business want in?  It is simple.  It wants control. 
Consider this statement by one time CEO of the Royal Bank Allan 
Taylor: “It is in business' best interest to get involved with 
funding for universities, but also with a direct involvement in 
setting courses, setting the curricula, so that it will get the 
kind of student it wants”. Big business has taken note.  Across 
the country campuses are becoming a favourite stomping ground for 
big business elite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion urges that the government should reject proposals 
for income contingent repayments. It urges the government instead 
to implement a federal student grant program and establish 
accessibility as a new national standard for post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats are not about to let the federal government forget 
about the student debt crisis.  Instead of creating a scholarship 
program which duplicates existing programs and does nothing to 
help students in need, we have called on the federal government 
to take steps that will reduce student debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These include the end of privatization of Canada student loans 
and restoring this year's cut to education of $550 million. 
Following the suggestion of the British Columbia provincial 
government, work with the provinces to introduce a nationwide 
tuition freeze as the first step toward the elimination of 
tuition fees. Implement a national grant program to assist first 
and second year students and assist them to ensure students are 
provided with accurate information and are informed of their 
rights.

young people from low and middle income families do not have to 
mortgage their futures and their families to attend university or

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to speak for seven minutes 
on the motion before the House moved by the hon. member for 
Vancouver East regarding the Canada student loans program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confused by the wording of the privatizing of Canada 
student loans. In my riding I receive calls from students on 
numerous occasions with questions or comments about the Canada 
student loans program.  I am not quite sure what the member means 
about privatizing the Canada student loans program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording of this motion really seems to be calling for action 
by the Government of Canada to assist in the financing of 
post-secondary education for Canadian young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the motion ignores is that the Government of Canada has 
undertaken extensive consultations with all stakeholders with an 
interest in this subject, including the provinces and the 
territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has implemented many of the recommendations of 
the report of the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities.  We have 
already taken measures to ensure Canadians have access to 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his February 1998 budget speech the finance minister said: 
“Canadians do not need to be told that student debt has become a 
major problem.  Students know it.  Their families worry about it. 
Graduates must deal with it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 the average student debtload of a graduate completing 
four years of post-secondary education was $13,000.  It is now 
almost double that, $25,000. 
In 1990 less than 8% of borrowers had debts larger than $15,000. 
Now nearly 40% do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of the Canadian opportunities strategy, the 
February budget proposed various improvements that reflect our 
approach regarding financial assistance to students, the new 
situation of today's students and current economic and 
demographic changes. The new measures are designed to help those 
most in need in the current economic context. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budgetary measures include tax relief for interest on all 
student loans, interest relief for more graduates, extended 
repayment periods for those who need them, extended interest 
relief periods for those who remain in financial difficulty and 
reductions in loan principal for those who still face financial 
difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time all students get tax relief for interest 
payments on their student loans.  Each claimant will be allowed a 
17% federal tax credit on the interest portion of payments of 
federal and provincial student loans.  The income threshold for 
interest relief has been raised by 9%.  This means a person can 
now earn more and still be eligible for interest relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interest relief plan is designed so that the Government of 
Canada pays the interest on the loan for students facing 
financial difficulty in repaying their loans.  Beginning next 
year partial interest relief will be available further up the 
income scale for graduates facing financial difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For borrowers who have exhausted 30 months of interest relief 
they can now ask their lending institutions to extend the loan 
repayment to 15 years.  At current rates of interest this could 
lower monthly payments by close to 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now debt reduction can be provided for some graduates who still 
remain in financial difficulty after exhausting free interest 
relief measures.  In these cases the loan principal may be 
reduced if annual payments exceed 15% of the borrower's income. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other initiatives taken under the Canadian opportunities 
strategy also seek to improve Canadians' knowledge and skills to 
prepare them for a knowledge-based society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the millennium scholarships will facilitate access to 
post-secondary education for over 100,000 students every year. 
These scholarships will be offered to both full time and part 
time students. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Canada student grants of up to $3,000 a year will help 
more than 25,000 students with children or other dependants. 
These are grants, not loans, and they do not have to be repaid. 
Students with a permanent disability such as deafness, blindness 
or other physical or learning disability may be eligible for a 
Canada student grant of up $5,000 a year to cover exceptional 
education related costs.  This is a $2,000 increase from what was 
provided in the previous special opportunity grant for students 
with disabilities.  Part time students with demonstrated 
financial need may qualify for a grant of up to $1,200. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, certain female doctoral students pursuing full time 
studies may qualify for a Canada study grant of up to $3,000 a 
year.  This will help to increase the participation of women in 
certain fields of study.  Engineering and applied sciences, 
agriculture and biological sciences, mathematics and physics, 
arts and social sciences are examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taken together the measures I have described account for some 
$230 million of new expenditures by the Government of Canada on 
post-secondary financial assistance to Canada's students. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a remarkable commitment to promote the well-being of our 
students and to help them complete their education, at a time 
when higher levels of knowledge and skills are becoming 
necessary to allow us to remain competitive in the global 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, overall, the federal government's initiatives will meet 
a large number of the requests made in the motion before us 
today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In consultation with other players in the field of 
post-secondary education and the students themselves, the 
Government of Canada has devised a system that promotes 
accessibility for all Canadians.  It is a system that works for 
today's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, while we can all appreciate the concern of the 
hon. member for Vancouver East for Canada's students, the actions 
already taken by the Government of Canada render the motion 
redundant.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the mover of the motion 
I would like to seek the consent of the House to briefly sum up 
for just two minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Vancouver East has requested the unanimous consent of the House 
to extend the time available for two minutes to sum up.  Is there 
unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would first of all like to thank members of the House who 
contributed to the debate on this motion.  I would like to just 
briefly summarize why this motion was brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from government members today that there are 
opportunities for students in Canada and that things are getting 
better.  But I would just like to say that the purpose of this 
motion is to draw attention unfortunately to the stark reality 
that things in Canada for students are getting worse, not better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Student debt has risen dramatically from $13,000 to $25,000. 
Unfortunately an increasing trend of privatization and control by 
the banks of the Canada student loans program means that more and 
more students are falling into debt and are unable to cope with 
increasing tuition fees primarily because of what we have seen as 
the retreat of public funding by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that something like $1.5 billion has been lost from 
post-secondary education. The reality is that across Canada there 
are so many different standards in terms of different provinces. 
I would agree with my colleague from the Bloc that the situation 
in Quebec has been much better.  The situation in B.C. is that we 
have had a tuition freeze for three years in a row.  But 
elsewhere in Canada the situation is very, very grave for 
students because of the retreat of public funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage members of the House to defend public 
education and to say to the government that we do need a national 
grants program.  We do need accessibility as a national standard. 
It is something that we need to work out with the provinces so 
we do not have this patchwork across the country and where more 
and more students are graduating into poverty and more and more 
students cannot afford to go to post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the members of the House to support this motion in the 
spirit of standing behind our educational system and defending 
the rights of students in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Pursuant to the order made 
earlier today, the motion is deemed to have been put and a 
recorded division deemed demanded and deferred until Tuesday, 
November 17, 1998, at the end of the time provided for 
government orders.

at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
