	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have a notice of a question of privilege from 
the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands. I am going to 
allow the question of privilege because yesterday, in reviewing 
the blues and what was said, I found that perhaps I acted a little 
hastily in cutting off the member. I am going to allow some 
additional information to be put on the record.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday I was seeking to make the point that a 
publication of the House, admittedly in conjunction with the 
National Archives of Canada, contained a substantial error in 
that it failed to mention in the list of constituencies for Canada's 
first Prime Minister the fact that he was the member for 
Kingston.
<P>
	I raise this point in some seriousness. I know it was treated 
with a bit of merriment yesterday afternoon. This particular 
Prime Minister was identified closely with the Kingston 
community. He represented Kingston in either the legislature or 
in this House from 1844 until 1891, with the exception of a 
nine-year break between 1878 and 1887 when he represented 
other constituencies in this House.
<P>
	He was substantially raised in Kingston. He practised law in 
Kingston from the age of 19 in the 1830s until 1873. For over 40 
years he practised law in Kingston. As I have indicated, he 
represented that community for a very long time and made a 
very substantial contribution there. He was buried in Kingston 
and there are countless statues and monuments to him in 
Kingston.
<P>
	To have Kingston omitted from the list of his constituencies is 
really a shocking omission. With the greatest respect, of all the 
Prime Ministers in the book he probably had a closer connection 
with his community and is known to have had that connection 
with his community of Kingston than all the other prime 
ministers had with their communities.
<P>
	My point is that this book ought to be repaired and replaced. It 
is frankly misleading, particularly to students who I am sure are 
going to be the principal users of this book. I see that it has a 
foreword with Your Honour's name on it, it does not have a 
signature, and another by the national archivist.
<P>
	From the point of view of accuracy, I think it would be very 
wise to have the book reprinted. It is an excellent book and a fine 
publication. It is wrong in this particular. It is a serious enough 
error that it ought to be corrected.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I do take the hon. member's intervention 
seriously.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	My name is associated and therefore the House's name is 
associated with this publication. That is the reason I permitted 
the extra information to come on to the record. I will review 
everything that has been said and, if necessary, I will get back to 
the House with a decision on this matter.
<P>
	Also I would like to take a few minutes of the time of the 
House. In reviewing the blues yesterday and in fairness to all 
members I want to make a couple of points clear with regard to 
unparliamentary language.
<P>
	Something may be unparliamentary in our language today and 
it may be parliamentary tomorrow. All that to say that no one 
word in and of itself is always unparliamentary. It is rather the 
context in which the word is used, the tone in which the word or 
words are delivered and if there is disorder in the House.
<P>
	If any one of these things occurs, it is incumbent upon the 
Chair to interpret what is going on in the House. To say that your 
Speaker is going to at all times make decisions that are 
acceptable to all members of Parliament would be hoping for the 
impossible.
<P>
	The Chair should have the latitude and will take the latitude to 
ensure that if a word is used in its tone, in its meaning, in 
perhaps the disorder it causes in the House then the Chair will 
intervene at that point. He or she may rule a word 
unparliamentary.
<P>
	I want it clear to all members of the House that even the word 
liar is not always unparliamentary. It will depend in the context 
in which it is used. However, if one member calls another 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8788"> 8788 </A></B>
<P>
member a liar, that is clearly unparliamentary, and I wanted that 
to be understood.
<P>
	To the interveners yesterday, the hon. member from Winnipeg 
who rose to make the point, the hon. member for Kingston and 
the Islands who made an intervention and the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminister who all contributed to the 
discussion on a point of order, I have taken all your suggestions 
into account. I want you to have a general feeling of what the 
Chair and the person in the chair will be looking for when it 
comes to unparliamentary language.
<P>
	I hope that this is acceptable to the House and that it will give 
general directions with regard to the words we are to use in our 
debates and also in question period. I thank you for your 
indulgence.

<P>
	Pursuant to the order of reference of Tuesday, June 21, 1994, 
your committee has considered Bill C-37, an act to amend the

	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
the honour to place before the House today, in both official 
languages, the 10th report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance entitled ``Confronting Canada's Deficit Crisis: 
Building Our Next Budget Through Consultation''.
<P>
	Briefly the report is the result of an unprecedented seven 
weeks of intensive consultations and study involving members 
from all three parties. I take this occasion to thank members of 
the committee from all three parties who brought such diligence 
to this undertaking.
<P>
	I also thank all those who have worked with us. Far too often 
they have not been recognized for what they have done. I talk not 
only of the many witnesses who appeared before us, often on 
very short notice, but particularly members of the Library of 
Parliament who worked with us, especially the clerks to our 
committee, Christine Trauttmansdorff and our chief clerk, 
Martine Bresson, and all the people of their staff who have been 
working 24 hours a day over the last week in order that we could 
meet this deadline.
<P>
	We have been extremely well served as parliamentarians by 
these very devoted public servants.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, like my colleague, the chair of the finance committee, I 
wish to thank the staff, and especially the office of the clerk, for 
the excellent job they did when the committee was preparing its 
report and during the committee's public hearings.
<P>
	Remember that the Official Opposition tabled a dissenting 
opinion as an appendix to the report of the Liberal majority. 
Why a dissenting opinion? First of all, because the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Official Opposition, is convinced that the 
measures supported in the Liberal majority's report do not 
reflect the vision and the views of Canadians expressed at the 
public hearings.
<P>
	Second, there is the prospect of an increase in taxes across the 
board for all Canadian taxpayers. We cannot support this 
proposal and we are particularly wary of the statement that the 
increase will be only temporary.
<P>
	Third, the Liberal majority's report announces a series of tax 
increases or at least the prospect of tax increases which will 
again affect a middle class already taxed to the hilt since 1984.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8789"> 8789 </A></B>
<P>
	Fourth, the report, and this is our main grievance, launches 
another attack on social programs by proposing cuts in addition 
to those already announced in the last budget.
<P>
	Fifth, the report ignores the fact that more jobs can also mean 
more tax revenue and, in the end, an improvement in the state of 
Canada's public finances. For all the reasons I just mentioned, 
readers will see the Official Opposition's dissenting opinion 
appended to the report.

protect and take care of human life and human dignity; that 
physicians should not be working to end lives but to save them.
<P>

honourable House to keep mining in Canada.
<P>
	Canada's mining industry is the mainstay of employment in 
over 150 communities across Canada, an important contributor 
to Canada's gross domestic product and total exports and a 
cornerstone of our economic future.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call on Parliament to take action that 
will grow employment in this sector, promote exploration, 
rebuild Canada's mineral reserves, sustain mining communities 
and keep mining in Canada.
<P>
	I concur with this petition.

petition signed by residents of the community of Westlock in my 
constituency of Athabasca.
<P>
	The petitioners request that Parliament amend the Divorce 
Act to include a provision similar to article 611 of the Quebec 
Civil Code which states: ``In no case may a father or mother 
without serious cause place obstacles between the child and 
grandparents. Failing agreement between the parties, the 
modalities of the relations are settled by the court''.
<P>
	They further ask for an amendment to the Divorce Act that 
would give a grandparent who is granted access to a child the 
right to make inquiries and to be given information on the 
health, education and welfare of the child.
<P>
	I present this petition and support the petitioners.

Responsible Firearms Coalition of B.C. which prays and 
requests that Parliament refuse to accept the anti-firearms 
proposals of the Minister of Justice and insists that he bring

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ) </B>moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House enjoin the government to recognize the legitimacy of the 
democratic process initiated by the Government of Quebec in order to allow 
Quebecers to chart their own political and constitutional future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, there will be a referendum on 
sovereignty in Quebec. That referendum will be preceded by a 
broad democratic consultation throughout Quebec.
<P>
	Federalists, both in Quebec City and in Ottawa, refuse to take 
part in that consultation process. But before we discuss the 
reasons why federalists refuse to participate in that debate, we 
must put that process into perspective, explain its nature and 
verify its legitimacy, since federalists are questioning its 
legitimacy.
<P>
	First of all, let us make it clear that federalists, headed by the 
present Prime Minister, are in a very bad position to talk about 
legitimacy, respect for democracy and clarity. Remember that 
the present Prime Minister was responsible for patriating the 
Constitution in 1982. Remember also that there was absolutely 
no consultation when the Constitution was patriated. There was 
no referendum. The Quebec National Assembly was against that 
patriation. The opposition leader in Quebec city and Liberal 
Party leader, Daniel Johnson, denounced that patriation.
<P>
	Just recently, during the election campaign in Quebec, it was 
again the present Prime Minister, with the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke, who was responsible for the demise of the Meech 
Lake Accord, through the Charest report, and with the help of 
Clyde Wells, from Newfoundland, and the help of the present 
member for Churchill, in Manitoba, who is sitting in this House 
today.
<P>
	Quebecers do not need any advice on democracy from the 
current Prime Minister because the process proposed by the 
Government of Quebec is entirely legitimate, clear and 
democratic.
<P>
	In fact, that process derives directly from the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission, which we should not forget. 
This commission said there were two options: renewed 
federalism and sovereignty. However, a referendum was held in 
Quebec as well as in all other parts of Canada on renewed 
federalism Charlottetown style. The Charlottetown Accord was 
rejected by Quebec-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8791"> 8791 </A></B>
<P>
ers because it was not enough for Quebec and by the rest of 
Canada because it was too much for Quebec. So only one option 
remains: sovereignty.
<P>
	That is the rationale behind the Bélanger-Campeau report, 
which was signed by Robert Bourassa, Daniel Johnson and all 
the members on that commission, except the current Minister of 
Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec must act upon the 
Bélanger-Campeau report. The question is how. With the 
proposed consultation process. I have difficulty understanding 
why the federal government is opposed to such a consultation 
process since that is all we have been doing here for over a year.
<P>
	The Committee on Human Resources Development is holding 
consultations everywhere in Canada, the finance committee just 
did the same; the Minister of Justice consults left and right 
without proposing anything concrete to this House. All these 
consultations are being held without a clear plan, without a bill. 
They consult for the sake of consulting. On the contrary, the 
Government of Quebec's initiative is based on a bill, a draft bill 
which is clear and specific and proposes a plan. To me, this is 
democracy, this is consultation.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	Federalists tell us that there is only one option, a plan for 
sovereignty. What an amazing discovery, Mr. Speaker. As a 
matter of fact, it is a plan for sovereignty because a 
pro-sovereignty government was elected in Quebec in 
September. What is surprising about a government proposing a 
plan to achieve its option? The opposite would have been 
surprising.
<P>
	As I recall, Meech and Charlottetown were federalist 
projects. We were not scandalized, we knew that federalists 
would propose a federalist option to us. It seems logical to me, 
although the Charlottetown proposal was not all that clear. 
When the referendum campaign was launched, we did not have 
the text. There is no need to recall the incredible series of events 
before we could obtain those texts; in fact sovereignists 
themselves had to publish the Charlottetown Accord. This time, 
the texts are there and clear.
<P>
	You will recall that sovereignists took part in the debate, first 
on Meech from 1987 to 1990 and then on Charlottetown in 1992. 
This was not our option but we played our part as elected 
representatives. Every day in the House, we present our views 
on bills we are against even though we know from the start that 
they will be passed. The government has the majority. We are in 
the minority, the Official Opposition, but nevertheless we 
express our disagreement, we try to convince people that the 
bills do not meet the needs of the population as a whole. This is 
the essence of democracy. We do not take part in debates only 
when we agree or when we are sure to win. Otherwise 
democracy would have no meaning. The democratic way is to 
take part in a debate where the majority expresses its views and 
so does the minority who also has rights and must express its 
opinion.
<P>
	They also tell us that there is no parity. But, Mr. Speaker, was 
there parity in Bélanger-Campeau? There was no parity in that 
commission, neither among elected representatives, who were 
mainly federalists because at that time there was a federalist 
government in Quebec, nor among non-elected people. You 
only have to look at the results of the votes that took place at the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission. The federalists won. Of 
course, we already knew it would be the case but we used it as an 
educational campaign. We were not afraid of expressing our 
ideas.
<P>
	Was there parity in Meech and Charlottetown? And let us not 
forget all those committees on Charlottetown: the Spicer 
Commission, the Beaudoin-Edwards and Beaudoin-Dobbie 
committees, where there was no parity. Members of the Bloc 
were not even invited.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You did not even exist back then.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Yes, we existed. We were here at the time of 
Spicer, Beaudoin and company, but we were not invited.
<P>
	At the Charlottetown conference held after Meech, after 
having stated that he would never be one of eleven, Mr. Bourassa 
found himself one of seventeen. Is this the idea of federalist 
parity, one of eleven, or one of seventeen? How high will it go? 
Is this the parity we are being proposed?
<P>
	Sovereignists nevertheless took part in the debate on the 
Meech Lake Accord. In Quebec, from 1987 to 1990, the PQ, 
which was the Official Opposition, took part in this debate, in 
the Bélanger-Campeau Commission and in the Charlottetown 
exercise, always as a minority. Were we, from the Bloc 
Quebecois, given parity in this House? We were eight out of 295 
to oppose Charlottetown. We were sitting right by the curtain, in 
what they called ``the lobotomy corner''. It would seem that 
only those without any brains could see the truth. We debated 
Charlottetown. We took part in the debate. There was only one 
option in this: renewed federalism, which is now called flexible 
federalism. Why not federalism in search of itself while we are 
at it?
<P>
	This is the option they give us. But we had another point of 
view. Need I recall the results of Charlottetown? We were eight 
out of 295, but it was rejected in Quebec and rejected in Canada, 
which proves that democracy must prevail over parity. The 
majority rules, and commissions follow this pattern. Beyond the 
numbers there are the ideas, and they succeed if they are good. 
But then, you need to have ideas.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	The bill is entirely consistent with the law governing 
referenda in Quebec. Those who argue the contrary should at 
least be honest enough and serious enough to read that law on 
referenda 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8792"> 8792 </A></B>
<P>
in Quebec before spreading falsehoods. It would improve the 
level of the debate. Need we restate that the legislation will not 
come into force before it is approved in a referendum?
<P>
	Finally, Quebecers will be called upon to debate the bill 
before it is put to a vote in the National Assembly. Elected 
representatives, before they vote, will have to take into 
consideration the opinion of the people. Now, I am addressing 
the Reform Party which has been talking about direct democracy 
for a year in this House. Granted, what the Government of 
Quebec is doing is not direct democracy, but it is a very 
interesting consultation process. Yes, we are going to consult 
Quebecers in all regions before studying the bill in committee, 
in Quebec City. The bill cannot come into force before a 
referendum, and even then, another year will pass before 
sovereignty really takes effect.
<P>
	It appears to me that this process is very close to democracy. I 
must say that I do not understand why anyone would be opposed 
to this process, unless they are afraid to present their ideas to the 
people.
<P>
	The process is clear, open and democratic. The decision 
belongs to Quebecers and nobody else. This is called the right to 
self-determination, in this case the self-determination of the 
Quebec nation, a right, need we remind you, recognized by the 
Conservative Party at its Toronto convention in August 1991, a 
right recognized by the New Democratic Party as early as the 
1960s, and a right recognized especially by the present Prime 
Minister, who mentioned it in his autobiography. By 
participating in the 1980 referendum, he recognized in practice 
the right of Quebecers to decide their own future.
<P>
	In this regard, I commend the hon. members for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine and for Mount Royal for 
acknowledging yesterday that the decision would have to be 
made in Quebec by Quebecers. It is much to their credit that they 
set themselves apart from the rest of the Liberal caucus.
<P>
	Indeed, the decision must be made by Quebecers, in Quebec, 
under the direction of the National Assembly and in accordance 
with the law governing referenda in Quebec. On this point, the 
PQ and the QLP, Jacques Parizeau and Daniel Johnson, agree 
totally. The process is clear.
<P>
	Why then turn it down? Because federalists have no other 
option to offer. They cannot even agree among themselves. The 
former Premier of Quebec, now Leader of the Opposition, 
Daniel Johnson tells us that status quo is unacceptable. ``I will 
never accept the 1982 Constitution''. However, the present 
Prime Minister considers this Constitution the high point of his 
career. These people will find themselves under the same 
umbrella. That is the rub.
<P>
	As far as the so-called third option presented by the member 
for Sherbrooke is concerned, well, he would rather not talk 
about it. That is the rub. They refuse to have a debate. They 
refuse to crisscross Quebec and have a debate with the citizens 
of each region. That is the rub.
<P>
	What is the government proposing? To understand what the 
Government of Quebec is proposing, we must go back to the 
Charlottetown Accord. At that time, every party in this House, 
the Conservatives, the NDP, the Liberals, the Bloc Quebecois, as 
well as the PQ and the Liberals in Quebec agreed on one thing: 
the political structures in Canada and Quebec are inadequate in 
view of today's economic challenges. Everybody agreed on that 
point. That is the reason why Charlottetown came about. 
Charlottetown was voted down for the reasons we know: Quebec 
thought it was not enough, the rest of Canada believed it was too 
much.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	But the structures have not changed since. Canada is no more 
prepared than Quebec to face the challenges of the modern 
economy, no more prepared than they both were in 1992. 
Nothing has changed, yet Canada has to change and so does 
Quebec.
<P>
	That is what Quebec's proposal is about. We suggest having 
two sovereign countries, sharing a common economic space, as 
all modern countries do, with full participation in international 
organizations. This brings to mind GATT and NAFTA. On this 
subject, let me remind you that had it not been for Quebec, there 
would have been no free trade agreement, because the rest of 
Canada was against free trade with the United States. It is 
Quebec that, to a certain extent, imposed free trade on Canada as 
a whole in 1988.
<P>
	This proposal shows respect for Quebec's English-speaking 
minorities, much more respect than French-speaking minorities 
are shown across Canada. Before coming and telling us about 
the dangers of sovereignty, Bob Rae should look after having 
washrooms installed in Kingston high schools. That is the 
primary duty of any good government. This proposal recognizes 
the rights of aboriginal nations. Quebec was the first province to 
do so, as early as 1985, and this draft bill goes much further than 
any existing Canadian legislation, but we will come back to this 
later.
<P>
	Some say there will be no common economic space. Does this 
mean that there is no room for negotiation? That is what Bob Rae 
told us, and  he is facing an election in the near future. Did he 
think about the 100,000 jobs in Ontario that depend on the 
Quebec market? Did he think about the $1.8 billion surplus 
Ontario businesses make in their commercial transactions with 
Quebec? Is he going to tell them: ``Forget about it, my friends. It 
is gone, a dead loss''? I doubt it. Did he think about the Auto 
Pact? Will Bob Rae go to Oshawa during his election campaign 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8793"> 8793 </A></B>
<P>
and tell the auto workers: ``There will be no common economic 
space. We will not negotiate with Quebec. We will no longer be 
selling  them cars. Let them make their own or buy from 
Michigan. My friends, we are choosing unemployment out of 
patriotism''?
<P>
	Bob Rae can go ahead and tell them that. We will see what 
comes of it. He will probably not be around to discuss the issue. 
But we will see where the debate will lead. I am told that he will 
not be there. I agree with you for once. At any rate, this is where 
we stand. We want a dispassionate debate and we urge the 
government to support this process. The hon. members of this 
House who are from Quebec in particular are invited to express 
their views, put forward objections, demonstrate in what way 
our option is dangerous. That is what they have to do: to discuss 
the implications.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec and the sovereignists have never 
been afraid to discuss. Never, ever have they been afraid of the 
democratic process. And I will close on this. I hope, with respect 
to federalism, both in Quebec City and in Ottawa, that this 
government will now show us that it can and will take on the 
challenge of democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member and I think he said that one reason 
he is for separation is that the Meech Lake and Charlottetown 
accords failed. I wonder what the position of the Parti Quebecois 
and the PQ government was on these two accords.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I recalled Meech and 
Charlottetown because they are actual facts which show that this 
system cannot be reformed. The PQ government was against 
Meech and against Charlottetown, clearly. It said so and we 
attended many committee hearings and took part in these 
debates both here and in Quebec City to explain our stand. We 
were not afraid of it. Besides, we were right and we won. But we 
were against those accords. It shows one thing, that we won 
against all the federalists put together. I think that the member of 
the Reform Party voted with the eight members of the Bloc 
Quebecois then, so maybe we were nine.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	There were 286 members convinced and captivated by the 
Charlottetown Accord. We saw the results. This shows the 
impotence, not because people cannot change things but because 
these things cannot be changed. There are two realities. Quebec 
is not better or worse than the rest of Canada, it is simply 
different, just as Canada is different from the United States. If I 
asked all hon. members whether Canada should be a sovereign 
country separate from the United States, they would say yes. 
Does this mean that they have contempt for the United States 
because Canada wants to stay sovereign? No, certainly not.
<P>
	Neither do we have contempt for Canada. We want to become 
sovereign for ourselves and have better ties with our Canadian 
and American friends and all countries in the world.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I am sure that my reply will come as no surprise to 
the opposition member. It is no.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> And let me immediately assure the member that 
nothing will convince my government to recognize the 
legitimacy of the process initiated by the PQ government.
<P>
	The member will agree that many of us have serious problems 
with the process announced by the PQ government. Let me begin 
with the leader of the Official Opposition in Quebec City, who 
aptly labelled it a ``misuse of democracy''. And for good reason. 
The Quebec government is asking its citizens to help draw up a 
constitution for a separate Quebec before they have even had 
their say on the issue of separation.
<P>
	I understand why the Premier of Quebec is taking this route. If 
he asked his fellow citizens the real question, in fact the only 
legitimate question, ``do you want to separate from Canada, yes 
or no?''the answer would be no. From where he sits, the best 
approach is to use cunning, and if in the process he flouts 
democratic principles, so what.
<P>
	As stated by the member from Sherbrooke, the Premier of 
Quebec knows his French well. According to the <I>Petit Robert</I>, 
being cunning means acting slyly to deceive someone for the 
purpose of doing him harm.
<P>
	The Quebec media have been no kinder in their assessment of 
the PQ strategy. An editorial in <I>Le Soleil</I> was headlined ``The 
anesthetization of a people'' and spoke of the ``misuse of our 
parliamentary institutions and the misappropriation of public 
funds for partisan purposes''.
<P>
	According to <I>La Presse</I>, ``what is unacceptable is that this bill 
will be passed by the National Assembly before being put to the 
people via a referendum. Things are being done in the wrong 
order''. The journalist concluded that we are witnessing a 
``mockery of democracy''.
<P>
	In today's <I>Le Journal de Montréal</I>, Michel Auger pointed out: 
``Although the majority of Quebecers still wonder why they 
should become independent, their government says the only 
thing left to decide is how it should be done''. He went on to say: 
``In fact, it is quite clear that according to their terms of 
reference, these commissions would be able to consider one 
option only: the one chosen by the government''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8794"> 8794 </A></B>
<P>
	And in concluding: ``Before asking Quebecers to draft the 
declaration of sovereignty, the government should consider 
those who have yet to be convinced of the need for 
sovereignty''.
<P>
	And again in today's <I>Le Soleil</I>, Gilbert Lavoie commented: 
``Although the strategy may seem clever to those who devised it, 
its weakness is that it underestimates the political savvy of 
Quebecers which has been borne out on several occasions''. He 
went on to say: ``The government's initiative will disappoint 
Quebecers, because the Pequistes have preferred strategy over 
substance''. And in concluding: ``The trap is so obvious that one 
would have to be very myopic indeed not to see it''.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Even in Le Devoir, under the headline ``The stratagem is too 
obvious'', Pierre O'Neill started his article by pointing out that: 
``Through academic eyes, the consultation process started by 
Premier Parizeau is viewed with some scepticism. Political 
scientist Vincent Lemieux feels that the Pequiste initiative lacks 
legitimacy. `I think the stratagem is too obvious', commented 
the Laval University professor yesterday, the man to whom 
Jean-François Lisée, political adviser to the Premier, referred in 
1993 as the Galileo of Quebec politics''.
<P>
	In Wednesday's <I>La Presse</I>, Alain Dubuc comments: ``This 
pretence of democracy is disturbing. It excludes, for all 
practical purposes, those who are opposed to sovereignty and 
turns these commissions into clubs for friends of the PQ, which 
may attract the attention of the media for a while, at public 
expense, and maintain temporary the illusion of almost 
unanimous support for the yes side. This whole strategy, which 
the Premier himself referred to as cunning, has its own 
limitations. Manipulation can backfire. Referendums, both here 
and elsewhere, have shown that if there is anything citizens 
cannot abide, it is manipulation by politicians''.
<P>
	Michel David, also in Wednesday's <I>Le Soleil</I>, pointed out: 
``When Mr. Parizeau used the word stratagem two weeks ago, 
Daniel Johnson immediately concluded it was a scam to fool 
Quebecers''. Mr. David went on to say: ``In fact, they pulled a 
fast one: members of the Premier's staff confided yesterday that 
the text of the draft bill on sovereignty had been ready since last 
March. Within the PQ, members had been polled on each 
section. Each individual section was supported by the majority. 
In other words, Mr. Parizeau knew well before the election 
campaign what question he would ask, once he was elected, but 
he said nothing to the voters. Why, if the case is as clear as he 
says it is? What about the relationship of trust?''
<P>
	I could go on for several minutes, quoting people from coast 
to coast. No one is being taken in by the Quebec Premier's 
chicanery. Not the media, not the other provincial premiers, not 
those of us here in Ottawa, not the Quebec Liberal Party and, 
unfortunately, to the great  dismay of our friends opposite, not 
the citizens of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Serré:</B> Quebecers are not crazy.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> But it would be more useful to ask ourselves why 
Quebec's separatist government is so intent on using trickery. 
The answer is simple. If it played fair and square, if it ``put 
everything on the table'', as the Quebec premier has said time 
and time again, if it went to the people and asked them to decide 
once and for all, I am convinced that the great majority of 
Quebecers would opt for Canada.
<P>
	And this is understandable. Canada is one of the greatest, if 
not the greatest, countries in the world. Do not take my word for 
it, just ask the United Nations. I know that certain words are 
taboo for separatists. Federalism is one. But sooner or later, the 
connection will have to be made between this political structure 
and the quality of life we enjoy. For is it pure chance that the 
four oldest federations in the world-the United States, 
Switzerland, Australia and Canada-are also among the world's 
richest countries?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> And the USSR?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> Are we taking about democracy or 
not?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> I think, rather, that federalism is better suited 
than almost any other political structure to the modern 
challenges facing societies today.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	We all know that the dual phenomenon of market 
globalization and the economic revolution shaking the world's 
industrialized countries requires of each country that it develop 
to the maximum its potential and its wealth-the things that 
make it distinct-but also that it be able to act effectively on the 
international scene, and that is what Canada has done.
<P>
	We rank seventh among the world's industrialized countries 
and we enjoy the highest standard of living. Over the past 30 
years, we have had the second highest economic growth rate 
among G-7 countries, behind Japan; among OECD countries, 
we rank seventh.
<P>
	Over the past 30 years, we have had the highest rate of job 
creation among OECD countries and the highest increase in 
employment per capita. Canada's continued exceptional 
performance is related to the maintenance and increase of the 
federal system's effective operations. Federalism permits a 
central government that efficiently manages activities of 
international scope-trade, stock markets, environmental 
protection, international communications.
<P>
	Not only does this sound international management benefit 
the members of Confederation, but, within the federal system, 
economies of scale can also be achieved in implementing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8795"> 8795 </A></B>
<P>
national programs and infrastructure that the constituent 
members alone could not offer their  citizens. Just think of the 
postal service and the armed forces.
<P>
	I know that my colleagues on the other side of the house do not 
share this point of view. For them, Confederation is a dead end, 
and they want out. But the people of Canada and Quebec 
instinctively know that, in the new world order, influence on the 
international scene is important. This influence is directly 
linked to whether or not you play a role in international forums. 
You have to be where decisions are made and standards are set. 
Canada is not a superpower, but it is the world's eighth largest 
exporter and importer. We are thus doubly entitled to 
membership in the Group of Seven. No province or regional 
group could aspire to membership in this forum. I repeat, Mr. 
Speaker: None. But together, as part of Confederation, they are 
all members.
<P>
	Nothing will be said about these benefits of federalism in the 
consultation that the Government of Quebec wishes to 
undertake with its friends. Likewise, nothing will be said about 
the fact that, within Canada, Quebec is part of a Pacific Rim 
country.
<P>
	To quote the Prime Minister of Canada, ``membership has its 
privileges''. When you consider the dazzling growth of Asian 
economies, which are very appropriately called the dragons of 
the East, it is understandable that the separatists do not dare to 
mention this. The only way they could do so would be to ask 
Quebecers if they want to give up another benefit of Canada.
<P>
	It is true that the separatist ministers have already waived 
these benefits in their surrealistic description of Canada. The 
Quebec Minister for Restructuring has thus 
neglected-intentionally or unintentionally-to include the 
equalization payments that Canada makes to Quebec: $3.7 
billion in 1993 and  about $3.92 billion in 1994-95.
<P>
	Quebecers' attachment to Canada is not just a matter of 
benefits and dollars and cents. The people of Quebec built this 
country. They shaped it and continue to do so. This country is 
French to the depths of its heart and soul. From sea to sea, 
French Canadians know that they can deal with their federal 
government in their own language.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Bilingualism is enshrined in this country's very Constitution, 
which can be amended only with the consent of all legislative 
assemblies. This, in effect, gives Quebec's National Assembly a 
veto. In the same way, the Canadian Constitution guarantees 
Quebec three of the nine judgeships on the Supreme Court. No 
other province has such guarantees. When you consider the 
increasing impact of this court's decisions, you realize that the 
soul of Quebec will continue to influence and define Canada as a 
country for a long time to come.
<P>
	I confess that listening to the current Premier of Quebec 
makes me smile sometimes. Not often, but sometimes.
<P>
	I could not help noting how he went about demonstrating 
Quebec's know-how in his speeches to the Chamber of 
Commerce of Montreal and the Canadian Club in Toronto, and 
even his address this week. No one has ever doubted this 
know-how. But when I hear him mention Céline Dion, Denys 
Arcand, the Cirque du Soleil, Bombardier, Lavalin and a host of 
others, I cannot help telling myself that all of them have 
succeeded within Canada, some of them with direct or indirect 
assistance from the federal government.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, the ancestors of the people of 
Quebec were among the first Europeans to set foot on Canadian 
soil. They built this country with their daring, ingenuity and 
courage, and not even a premier will hoodwink them into 
throwing in the towel and pulling out of Canada. The men and 
women of Quebec received this country as their heritage and 
want to pass it on to their children.
<P>
	The motion before the House is contrary to Canada's 
historical roots. It would have us, the people of Quebec, forget 
our origins and our ancestors, and disregard 127 years of shared 
history which have resulted in raising us to the rank of one of the 
best countries in the world.
<P>
	I will thus vote against this motion out of respect for history, 
and out of duty to my children and to democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
some comments to make in response to the speech by the hon. 
member opposite.
<P>
	He harshly criticized the Quebec government's draft bill, 
which he has a right to do. However, his very federalist and quite 
ordinary speech, except for the first part in which he used the 
word ``astuce'' in French, only referred to the status quo, 
something which we have been hearing here in this House for 
some 20 years and which Quebecers are sick and tired of 
listening to.
<P>
	We looked up the definition of the word ``astuce'', because it 
may be the only interesting point that you raised at the beginning 
of your speech. Forgive me, Mr. Speaker, I should address my 
comments to you.
<P>
	The word ``astuce''in old French means this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ability to deceive others in order to harm them or get something out of them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I agree. Rather than the old French definition, the hon. 
member opposite should use the modern-day definition, which 
is ``ingeniousness and inventiveness''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8796"> 8796 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Deshaies:</B> Mr. Speaker, the opposite of astute is crude 
and unintelligent.
<P>
	I would like us to use current terminology to describe 
Quebecers as ingenious and inventive.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	As the hon. member opposite pointed out, Quebecers have 
shown inventiveness through companies like Bombardier, 
artists like Céline Dion, etc. Yes, Quebec wants to chart its 
future, and Quebec's draft bill is a way to do this.
<P>
	To return to the old definition of ``astuce'', the federal 
government may not be in a position to teach Quebec anything. 
In 1982, when the Constitution was patriated unilaterally, the 
federal government deceived René Lévesque during the night of 
the long knives. Was it a federalist scam? We should really talk 
about it.
<P>
	One fact cannot be denied. Quebec citizens sent a 54-member 
majority to the House of Commons, and they knew about our 
allegiance. My hon. colleague would surely like to tell me that 
all those who voted for the Bloc Quebecois may not have been 
sovereignists, sovereignists and separatists.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Serré:</B> Separatists.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Deshaies: </B>Sovereignists or separatists, whatever. If you 
want to use the old terminology, that is your choice.
<P>
	Sorry, Mr. Speaker, I am getting carried away.
<P>
	The people who voted for the Bloc Quebecois were also fed up 
with the current federal system, because of mismanagement by 
the central government. According to a poll, 66 per cent of 
Quebecers reject the status quo or the current federal system. 
The hon. members opposite might reply that federal Liberals 
offer flexible federalism. Allow me to question this flexibility, 
when Quebec and several other provinces are still waiting for 
this flexibility, promised in every election, after 10 years under 
Tory governments and the 10 years before that under the 
Trudeau government and others.
<P>
	What is important to me and to all the people in the riding of 
Abitibi, who ask me when they will receive information on the 
sovereignty plan, is that the draft bill is a way to receive this 
information. People want to know more about the grounds on 
which their decision will be based.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member opposite: What about 
the need to address Quebecers' needs, to give them information, 
and not just federalist rhetoric? Why should they stay in the 
federalist system, why?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, the hon. member 
opposite questions the use of words. I thought that I had read 
enough editorials written by contemporary French Canadians 
from Quebec. They are experts in using the pen and the 
dictionary. They were not caught up in words. They saw the ruse 
behind the lack of democracy and called it secretive and a show 
of democracy. Public opinion in Quebec is clearly that Mr. 
Parizeau's proposal  is not democratic; whether it is called 
sneaky, a sham or secretive, it is still unacceptable.
<P>
	Second, speaking of federalism and flexible federalism, our 
country has evolved over 127 years with relatively few changes 
to the Constitution, but with tremendous changes affecting the 
jurisdiction of the provinces and the federal government and 
with continuous adjustments to a changing economic, political 
and social environment. We can continue to evolve within the 
present Constitution and we do continue to evolve, making very 
considerable changes that affect jurisdiction, the way the 
country is governed and our social programs, provided that we 
know how to act as partners.
<P>
	That is true federalism. History shows us that it has worked 
and provided solutions and given Canada the highest standard of 
living in the world.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	This did not happen by accident or despite the federal system, 
on the contrary. The reason Canada, including Quebec, is one of 
the best countries in the world, maybe the best, is its federal 
structure, which year after year has proven to be good for 
Canadians, good for Quebecers and adaptable to change. It will 
help us adjust to the economic, political and social changes now 
going on in the outside world.
<P>
	Third, although there are 54 Bloc Quebecois members in this 
House, let us not forget that we, Liberals, form a government 
which is perceived across the country as an efficient and honest 
government. This is evidenced by the fact that, for the last three 
months, public support in the polls has been maintained at an 
all-time high of 63 per cent for any government in the 54 years 
that such polls have been conducted.
<P>
	In Quebec, while our leader enjoyed relatively low support, 
somewhere around 20 per cent, during the election campaign, 
that support has climbed up to 47 per cent in recent weeks, the 
same as for Lucien Bouchard. This means that Quebecers 
themselves have a favourable opinion of the way the federal 
government is working on their behalf.
<P>
	As for mandate, it is clear that Mr. Parizeau, and he said so 
himself dozens of times during the election campaign, was not 
elected with a mandate to achieve sovereignty: He was elected 
to provide a new government and, really, to create jobs, just like 
us. The fact that Mr. Parizeau's party received 44 per cent of the 
popular vote is tantamount to a rejection of sovereignty. It is 
totally undemocratic to table a draft bill which takes for granted 
that sovereignty has already been accepted as a goal by 
Quebecers, since the facts show that the contrary is true.
<P>
	By introducing its draft bill, the Parizeau government is 
trying to fool Quebecers; it is using a ploy which is both a scam 
and an undemocratic measure. This is a view shared by us, by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8797"> 8797 </A></B>
<P>
our government and by the majority of Quebecers and Quebec 
editorialists. I am convinced that when the time comes for 
Quebecers to choose between  separation and flexible 
federalism, they will opt for the latter.
<P>
	In conclusion, the motion tabled by the opposition clearly 
does not respect the democratic spirit of Canadians, including 
Quebecers, and it must be rejected.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There are approximately 60 seconds left in the 
debate, or 30 seconds for each side. The hon. member for 
Chambly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, can the 
hon. minister explain in what respect the Charlottetown process 
was more democratic that the one proposed by the Quebec 
government? In the Charlottetown process, I remember that we 
were even asked to vote on unwritten agreements, and, in the 
third round of the 1992 referendum, when the government 
realized that the house was on fire, they had to hurriedly write up 
the infamous Charlottetown accord, where they asked 
Canadians, and Quebecers in particular, to vote on something 
which did not even exist in concrete terms.
<P>
	We kept hearing: ``Trust us, because we know, we feel, and we 
tell you what is right'', but nothing was written up. In what 
respect was that process more democratic than the present one? I 
would appreciate an answer from the minister.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion before the House 
attempts to determine, rather it states the Bloc Quebecois's 
position on democracry, based on what Mr. Parizeau did. In fact, 
what he did is clearly undemocratic because his bill takes for 
granted an answer to a question which was never asked, and 
because this regional commission procedure is really a joke, as 
it recreates fifteen yes committees. That is the unanimous view 
of Quebecers and that is clearly why these are undemocratic 
proposals.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to address the Bloc motion that the House enjoin 
the government to recognize the legitimacy of the democratic 
process initiated by the Government of Quebec in order to allow 
Quebecers to chart their own political and constitutional future.
<P>
	The motion raises two essential questions which I would like 
to deal with one at a time. The first question is: What is the 
so-called democratic process initiated by the Quebec 
government? According to the draft bill tabled by Mr. Parizeau 
in the Quebec assembly, the process consists of the following.
<P>
	First, the publication of a draft bill, a bill which is clearly 
illegal in terms of the Canadian Constitution, followed by 
additional steps designed to legitimate this illegal act;
<P>
	Second, a period of information and participation for the 
purposes of approving this illegal bill and drafting a declaration 
of sovereignty which will form part of its preamble;
<P>
	Third, discussion of this illegal bill respecting the 
sovereignty of Quebec and its passage by the National 
Assembly; and
<P>
	Fourth, approval of this illegal act by the population in a 
referendum.
<P>
	In other words, what we have here is a process designed to 
attempt to give democratic legitimacy to an illegal act of the 
Quebec assembly. So far we note that the federal government 
has been extremely reluctant to point out the illegality of what is 
proposed. I was hoping the minister might do that today. I am 
convinced that if some other province such as the province of 
Alberta were today to table an act in its legislature completely 
out of its own jurisdiction such as, say, alternative gun control 
legislation and attempted to legitimize it by a process such as 
this, it would not take the federal government 30 seconds to 
make clear the illegality and unacceptability of what was being 
proposed.
<P>
	I suggest that even within Quebec if a portion of that 
community, say the Mohawk Nation through its elected council, 
were to table such a bill and attempt to legitimize it by such a 
process, the Quebec government would be the first to declare 
such an act and such a process illegal and illegitimate.
<P>
	The second question is the bigger question: What are the 
generally accepted tests of democratic legitimacy and how does 
the so-called democratic process initiated by the Quebec 
government stand up to those tests? The first test is the rule of 
law.
<P>
	In free countries democratic legitimacy refers to the general 
acceptability of a process in the political community. A process 
is considered legitimate if it is supported by the constitution of a 
political community, in other words whether or not it conforms 
to the rule of law. In Canada this means that all proceedings 
relating to constitutional change, even an attempted secession, 
must take place within the rules established by the Constitution 
of Canada. That means that constitutional change of any kind 
should take place by the means of a formal amendment to the 
Canadian Constitution. Acts which are clearly unconstitutional 
are also clearly illegitimate.
<P>
	In this case, virtually every clause of the act respecting the 
sovereignty of Quebec is clearly unconstitutional, notably the 
declaration of sovereignty in section 1, the undefined rules of 
constitution making in section 3, the territorial provisions in 
section 4, the citizenship rules in section 5, the treaty rights 
assumed in section 7, the alliance rights assumed in section 8, 
the assumption of  the ability to overrule federal laws by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8798"> 8798 </A></B>
<P>
provincial assembly claimed in section 10, the removal of the 
authority of the Supreme Court of Canada in section 12, and the 
assumption of the right to make appointments to federal bodies 
in section 13.
<P>
	Each of these sections is therefore illegitimate, as is the act as 
a whole.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	If the Government of Quebec wishes to proceed with 
constitutional changes, including one as drastic as secession, 
there is a way to do so. That is through a formal amendment to 
the Canadian Constitution. The Government of Quebec has not 
chosen that route. Both the route it has chosen and the process it 
employs do not meet the test of the rule of law.
<P>
	The second test is direct questions on real options. To be 
legitimate direct democracy must ask direct questions. The 
question posed in the act respecting the sovereignty of Quebec is 
indirect and misleading. It does not ask the straight simple 
question: Should Quebec secede from Canada, yes or no? 
Instead it asks: Are you in favour of the act passed by the 
National Assembly declaring the sovereignty of Quebec? The 
key provisions of the act however do not go into force until after 
the referendum is approved.
<P>
	Section 16 of the act states that section 2, to negotiate an 
economic association with Canada, section 3, to write a 
constitution for Quebec, and section 15, to negotiate a division 
of the assets and debts of Canada, do not go into effect until after 
it is too late for the voters to change their minds. This is clearly 
illegitimate from the standpoint of direct democracy. It is even 
illegitimate compared to Levesque's 1980 question which 
promised to provide a completed package which would then be 
submitted to voters for their further approval at a second 
referendum.
<P>
	The draft act itself which is at the heart of the process is also 
filled with misconceptions and misrepresentations. There is the 
misconception that an economic association with Canada will 
automatically be attained and agreed to by Canada. There is the 
assumption that Quebec will retain the boundaries it has within 
the Canadian Confederation at the time the act comes into force. 
There is the assumption of dual citizenship which is entirely 
beyond the capacity of even a sovereign Quebec to grant and the 
assumption that Quebec shall assume the obligations and enjoy 
the rights arising out of treaties to which Canada is a part. All of 
these are misconceptions and misrepresentations which cannot 
be legitimately promised by any Quebec government, sovereign 
or not.
<P>
	The draft bill is a hollow shell with the content to be provided 
only after the shell has been approved by the public. To use a 
more down to earth metaphor, the draft bill is a blank cheque 
which the Government of Quebec seeks to induce the Quebec 
electorate to sign.
<P>
	For a process that claims to be democratic, to be legitimate it 
must also provide opportunity for all the options which might 
potentially gain majority support, including those that are 
repugnant to the proponents and managers of the process to be 
considered. Yet clearly all options for reform within federalism 
are precluded under the act respecting the sovereignty of 
Quebec. Only within the constitution of a sovereign Quebec will 
reforms be considered so everybody, including those who 
oppose secession, are forced to participate in the process of 
writing a declaration of independence even if they are not in 
favour of independence.
<P>
	The referendum process itself, including the Quebec 
referendum law, does not provide for adequate consideration of 
all the options. In particular Quebecers will only be presented 
with a choice between status quo federalism and sovereignty. 
The principal alternative option, namely a complete rebuilding 
of the federal system from the bottom up, is not assured even a 
fair hearing let alone consideration.
<P>
	The third test is of democratic legitimacy, inclusiveness and 
non-coercion. Democracy must be inclusive allowing all who 
are affected to vote, but the interests of the people in the rest of 
Canada in whether or not their country will be torn asunder are 
not even acknowledged. What is legitimate about declaring 
arbitrarily that democratic self-determination is the exclusive 
right of the people of Quebec constituted as a single arbitrarily 
defined collectivity?
<P>
	The process defined in the draft bill in no way shape or form 
acknowledges that the people of Canada also have a right to 
choose their national future. Nor does it deal adequately with the 
democratic rights of the people of any region of Quebec, many 
of whom might choose to secede from Quebec and remain a part 
of Canada.
<P>
	In addition to all this, the process proposed by the draft bill is 
essentially coercive. As I said, all options for reform within 
federalism are precluded under the act respecting the 
sovereignty of Quebec. Only within the constitution of a 
sovereign Quebec will reforms be considered.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	Even groups that have no interest in broader constitutional 
questions will be forced to participate in the process of 
developing an act of secession for fear that if they do not their 
interests will be left out of the Quebec constitution. As each new 
group joins in, all those who are left out will feel increasing 
pressure to join in, thus driving the process toward the 
inevitable conclusion of separation. This is not democratic 
consent at all but forced consent which is a charade of 
democracy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8799"> 8799 </A></B>
<P>
	All the polls to date indicate that a majority of Quebecers 
do not want to secede from Canada if given a clear choice on 
that question. The separatist Government of Quebec obviously 
does not accept that opinion. It has put together a process 
designed not to give fair and legitimate recognition to majority 
opinion but to create majority support for a minority opinion.
<P>
	In conclusion, the bottom line is that the process as proposed 
by the Quebec government and supported by the Bloc does not 
meet the great tests of democratic legitimacy. It is not in 
accordance with the rule of law. It does not ask direct questions 
on real options. It is not inclusive and it is coercive.
<P>
	Obviously therefore the process should be rejected by all 
democrats in Canada whether in Quebec or outside it and 
regardless of their constitutional opinions and preferences. 
Obviously the House should defeat the motion.
<P>
	The proposed bill and processes are also extremely revealing 
with respect to the character of the current Government of 
Quebec. All democratic governments, including the 
Government of Quebec, should be held accountable to respect 
the rule of law and the basic criteria of free democratic 
processes. If a government does not respect those processes and 
uses illegitimate processes to induce its own population to 
support illegal acts, how can any member of that society be 
assured that such a government will not do the same thing again 
at some future date, disregarding both the rule of law again and 
using illegitimate processes again, this time to manipulate its 
own people against their will?
<P>
	The federal government as the government with 
responsibility for the peace, order, good government and 
economic well-being of all Canadians has a responsibility to 
make clear the illegality and illegitimacy of what the 
Government of Quebec proposes. The federal government has a 
responsibility as a bare minimum to refute the misconceptions 
concerning economic association, sovereignty association and 
dual citizenship which are at the heart of the Quebec 
government's bill and process. We assume that the federal 
government will be discharging these responsibilities in the 
course of this debate and in the days ahead.
<P>
	The federal cabinet ministers make frequent reference to 
wanting to avoid playing Parizeau's game, but Parizeau's game 
is to take initiatives, including illegal initiatives, and assume 
that the federal government will do nothing but fume and 
sputter. It is time for the federal government to stop playing 
Parizeau's game and begin discharging its responsibilities for 
preserving the peace, order, good government and economic 
well-being of Canada and all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first of all, I want to emphasize the following point: federalists 
seem to have been caught unawares and to be panic-stricken. 
They use everything, every false  statement they can think of, to 
try to show that the process initiated by Quebecers does not meet 
their standards.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party started by saying that he thinks 
that the Quebec government's draft bill is illegal. I am sure that 
the Premier of Quebec had everything checked out before 
initiating this process. In fact, we are confident that the bill is in 
accordance with Quebec's Referendum Act.
<P>
	Second, federalists have been talking all morning about 
democracy. This has me very puzzled. Federalists are now 
trying everything to convince Quebecers, especially federalists, 
not to take part in this process. If democracy is being abused, it 
is by the federalists who are trying very hard to ensure that 
Quebec federalists do not take part in this democratic 
experience.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	If we were dealing with an extremely complex draft bill, 
comprised of hundreds of clauses that the average citizen would 
have a hard time understanding, they might have good reasons to 
be concerned. But the draft bill is made up of just 16 very 
straightforward clauses that only set out the definition of 
sovereignty that is generally accepted in Quebec. So, this 
definition does not take anyone by surprise, except the 
federalists who still think that they can convince Quebecers by 
making empty speeches on the beauty and the sheer size of 
Canada.
<P>
	For the last 50 years, Quebecers have been trying slowly but 
surely to show that they do not feel at ease within the Canadian 
federation. They have been expressing their feelings in a very 
special and original way, by creating brand new political parties 
that can be found nowhere else but in Quebec. Here are a few of 
those parties: the Action libérale nationale, the Union nationale, 
the Bloc populaire, the Rassemblement pour l'indépendance 
nationale, the Rassemblement national, the Parti Quebecois and 
the Bloc Quebecois. Why have Quebecers felt, for the last 50 
years, the need to have their own tools to promote Quebec's 
interests? Obviously because the big parties, the Liberals and 
the Conservatives, federalists by definition, have never been 
able to get in touch with the soul of Quebec. So do not talk to us 
about democracy!
<P>
	Federalists also seem to have forgotten some important 
historical events. I would like to remind them that 14 countries 
were present at the Madrid Conference in 1880. In 1920, 47 
countries were represented at the very first general assembly of 
the League of Nations. In 1945, representatives of 50 countries 
witnessed the signing of the Charter of the United Nations, in 
San Francisco. In 1990, there were 175 countries and it is 
estimated that in 5 or 10 years, the number of countries will 
reach 200. This goes to show that nations have understood that 
sovereignty helps to correct inequities. By becoming sovereign, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8800"> 8800 </A></B>
<P>
smaller nations reach the same level as bigger countries. This is 
essentially what Quebec wants.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to put a question to the leader of 
the Reform Party: Does he think that the people of Quebec are a 
nation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Madam Speaker, the short answer to the latter 
question is that I believe Quebecers are a distinct people. I do 
not believe that automatically conveys a right to establish an 
independent state by illegal means. I will answer some of the 
other points the member raised in the order he raised them.
<P>
	We do not shy away from the legitimate use of the democratic 
process to settle the most profound questions, including the 
question of secession. We believe those processes should be in 
accordance with the rule of law, they should ask real questions 
about the real issue and they should present all the options.
<P>
	The option we are most concerned about in Quebec that is not 
being considered, and maybe we are having difficulty 
communicating it to our Bloc friends, is that there is a legitimate 
third option. It is not the hon. member for Sherbrooke's third 
option.
<P>
	All across the country there are people who want to rebuild 
federalism from the bottom up in a much more profound way. 
Meech Lake and Charlottetown were top down. That is what was 
wrong with them and that is why we rejected them.
<P>
	All across the country there are people who want to rebuild 
the federal system from the bottom up. We believe that the 
process which has been suggested here and the process which 
has been followed in Quebec for the last 30 years have not given 
that option a legitimate opportunity for expression, nor does the 
process outlined in this act.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	There are two more points arising from the member's 
comments. He suggested that sovereignty is a legitimate and 
principal means of dealing with inequality. I question him. Does 
the member actually believe that the way to deal, for example, 
with inequalities within Quebec is that if someone feels unequal 
the way to cope with that is to declare themselves sovereign and 
independent from the framework in which they feel the 
inequality?
<P>
	That principle can be preached here in defence of Quebec's 
attempts to secede. I doubt very much whether any of the 
members would agree to it if it was put forward by someone in 
Quebec as an argument for addressing their inequality and 
seceding from Quebec.
<P>
	My last point is on the question of legality. I would challenge 
the Bloc members to table in the House a legal opinion from any 
respected constitutional authority saying that the bill that has 
been tabled in the Quebec legislature is within the legislative 
competence of the province of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, my comments are not necessarily for the 
Reform Party or the Liberal Party. My comments are aimed 
specifically at all Canadian federalists.
<P>
	We are being accused of proposing an undemocratic process 
to Quebecers. Contrary to what we are used to on the Canadian 
political scene, this is an exciting project in democracy, since 
not only will Quebecers not have something forced on them by 
elected representatives in their ivory tower but they are all 
invited by Mr. Parizeau to take part in the process. And this is 
what democracy is all about.
<P>
	So it is totally wrong to pretend that the process initiated by 
the Parti Quebecois is undemocratic. On the contrary, the 
proposed process could not be more democratic, since all 
Quebecers, federalists, liberals or conservatives or whatever 
will be able to get involved. This project is 100 per cent 
democratic, since all Quebecers will have their say.
<P>
	I see that my time is running out. I will come back to this later 
today because I absolutely want to give further insights into the 
federal government's sharp dealings with Quebec in the last 40 
years or so.
<P>
	In response to my question, I would like the leader of the 
Reform Party to tell us what democracy is to him. Is it a decision 
made by a prime minister or is it a decision coming from the 
grass roots?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Madam Speaker, I thought I made myself clear 
as to what I consider democracy to be. The heart of it is the 
consent of the governed and democratic processes have to meet 
certain basic fundamental tests no matter where we talk about 
democracy in the world.
<P>
	Those tests are as follows. They must conform to the rule of 
law. Second, they must ask real questions about the real issue, 
not indirect questions. Third, they must present all options and 
allow equal opportunity for all options. Fourth, the processes 
must result in getting the consent of the governed.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, before beginning my speech, I would like to 
advise you that from now on, members of the Official 
Opposition will make 10-minute speeches.
<P>
	When I hear the big guns of federalism call undemocratic the 
process to consult the people announced by the Premier of 
Quebec, Jacques Parizeau, on December 6, when he presented 
the draft bill on Quebec sovereignty, I seriously worry about the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8801"> 8801 </A></B>
<P>
political maturity of the federal Liberals and the Official 
Opposition in the Quebec National Assembly.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	I have the rather startling impression of being in front of a 
class of teenagers who refuse to grow up. Let me explain. Any 
psychologist can tell you that magical thinking is one 
characteristic of adolescence. A classical example is a teen-age 
girl who knows the facts of life but is convinced that she cannot 
become pregnant because that happens only to others. I am sure 
that all hon. members could put a face or a name to the young 
girl in my example. Everybody knows perfectly well that 
magical thinking cannot prevent the oldest reproductive 
technique in the world from working efficiently. The number of 
unwanted pregnancies among teenagers proves it beyond 
question.
<P>
	No, Madam Speaker, magical thinking does not make it so, no 
matter what the Deputy Prime Minister and the premiers of 
Ontario and New Brunswick, all long-time allies of Quebec, 
may think. The announced process is highly democratic.
<P>
	It is unreasonable to claim that the draft bill presented by Mr. 
Parizeau is unfounded, undemocratic or a fraud or that the 
Quebec government is trying to win the referendum by 
deceiving people, because those incisive comments and others 
like them will never be powerful enough filters to make 
something democratic, undemocratic.
<P>
	The hon. member for Sherbrooke used <I>Le Petit Robert</I> to give 
us a definition of the word ``astuce''. Everybody was impressed 
by his ``cleverness''. Since he is an experienced and I might 
even say a clever politician, I thought I could do the same thing 
and look up the word ``democracy'' in the dictionary. Here is 
what I found:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Political doctrine according to which sovereignty must belong to the people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My world goes beyond the dictionary. Patrick Watson, a 
renowned journalist who was even chairman of the CBC, wrote: 
``Democracy consists of verbal exchanges. It favours discussion 
over force, deliberations over mood swings, good reasons over 
powerful weapons, consensus over conflict, peace over war, 
co-operation over competition''.
<P>
	It seems that supporters of the status quo or, if you prefer, 
supporters of ``flexible'' federalism, have chosen force, mood 
swings, powerful weapons, conflict, war and competition. What 
is sad for democracy is to see that democratically elected men 
and women have rejected discussion, deliberations, good 
reasons, consensus, peace and co-operation.
<P>
	The draft bill on Quebec's sovereignty contains 17 clauses. 
Clause 10 stipulates that existing federal laws that apply in 
Quebec shall remain in force until amended or repealed by the 
National Assembly. Is it undemocratic to ask the approval of 
Quebecers to have, in a sovereign Quebec, laws that meet their 
needs?
<P>
	Is it undemocratic to ask them if they are sick and tired of all 
these endless jurisdictional quarrels over health, education, 
income security programs, manpower training and social 
security? The process that the Government of Quebec has 
launched is very democratic. In the end, the people's sanction 
will replace the royal sanction. This process is certainly as 
democratic as the federal government's consultation process on 
social reform.
<P>
	The objective pursued by this government of cutting social 
programs at the expense of the unemployed, welfare recipients, 
women and students in order to contain a huge deficit, is simply 
not acceptable to the people of Quebec. The debate proposed by 
the Quebec government will give them an opportunity to say so 
once again.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Instead of creating jobs, the federal government chooses to 
cut left and right. The federal government is unable to make the 
proper diagnosis; it does not deserve the confidence of the 
people of Quebec since it is unable to administer the appropriate 
medicine.
<P>
	In the area of education, the federal government is innovating 
by proposing to reduce the federal contribution to 
post-secondary educational institutions, and by way of 
compensation it is encouraging our young people to go into debt. 
There is no question of giving Quebec full jurisdiction for 
occupational training despite the clearly established 
labour-management consensus on that. Since the federal 
government runs the unemployment insurance program, it 
makes the decisions on manpower training programs. Never 
mind the inefficiency, the red tape and the waste of taxpayers' 
money!
<P>
	The proposed social security reform, especially as regards  
the Canada assistance plan and child tax benefits, is equally 
unacceptable for Quebec because it maintains, indeed even 
increases, federal encroachment on Quebec's areas of 
jurisdiction. Quebec will never accept being subject to national 
standards-not today, no more than yesterday and certainly not 
tomorrow.
<P>
	Is it unreasonable to ask the people of Quebec whether they 
believe that the Quebec government is able to take on all the 
responsibilities in these areas of jurisdiction and to make its 
own laws in these areas?
<P>
	It would be unreasonable and undemocratic not to listen to 
what the people of Quebec have to say on that subject. Clause 10 
of the draft bill on Quebec sovereignty will give them an 
opportunity to express themselves democratically.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8802"> 8802 </A></B>
<P>
	Clause 11 clarifies a particularly sensitive point. Many of us 
remember the horror stories told to our senior citizens by the 
federalist werewolves in 1980, that if they voted yes they would 
lose their pensions.
<P>
	Today, nobody would buy these statements made in bad faith. 
Since bad faith is hard to eradicate, the government wisely saw 
fit to specify as follows: ``Pensions and supplements payable to 
the elderly shall continue to be paid by the Government 
according to the same terms and conditions''.
<P>
	I am almost tempted to say that I would not be surprised if 
Quebecers considered that clause useless, because in 1994 fear 
is completely out of the picture. Democracy also means being 
free from fear.
<P>
	Quebec is a distinct society, and for a long time democracy in 
Quebec has been just as healthy as it is in any other jurisdiction. 
Quebecers know it, and they are rightly proud of it.
<P>
	I will conclude by quoting Patrick Watson: ``Through 
referendums, citizens do much more than choose their 
representatives; they govern themselves. But, if the referendum 
process does not include a civic education program or public 
education meetings, rich and influential people will use it to 
manipulate voters''.
<P>
	The process outlined in the draft bill on Quebec sovereignty 
puts the issues on the table and lets all citizens discuss them. I 
regret that federalists in Quebec will not participate, but I am 
sure Quebecers will get a better understanding of what 
democracy means, because their sensible, thoughtful and 
enthusiastic participation will prevent ``rich and influential 
people'' from manipulating voters, because the process set out 
by the Quebec government will let them govern directly.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened very carefully to the speeches 
made up to now. As far as I can see, there is not much 
consistency in the speeches made by members of the Bloc today.
<P>
	Earlier this morning, we heard a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois inform us that it is because of Quebec that NAFTA 
was signed. However, we all know very well, and it is quite clear 
for me as a member from New Brunswick, that the government 
of Quebec has been reluctant in recent decades to liberalize 
trade between the Canadian provinces.
<P>
	How can they say, on the one hand, that they support free trade 
with the United States and Mexico and, on the other hand, that 
they are extremely reluctant to liberalize interprovincial trade?
<P>
	The member said earlier that Quebecers will have a clear and 
definite choice. In the process which has started, where is this 
clear and definite choice? There is none because the working 
paper presents only one option to Quebecers. Where is the 
overall plan Mr. Parizeau promised the people of Quebec? 
Where is this overall  plan? Maybe we will keep the Canadian 
dollar. Maybe we will have Canadian passports. This plan is full 
of maybes. It is not with such proposals that Quebecers can 
make an enlightened choice. We cannot make an enlightened 
choice on the basis on uncertainties.
<P>
	This is duplicity. I remember reading, and I read a lot, all the 
history books about Quebec when Quebecers stood up and 
opposed the dark age of Duplessis. I am also convinced that they 
will say no to the undemocratic dark age of Parizeau.
<P>
	My question is as follows: Since the suggested process 
accepts only the separatist position, how will it inform the 
supporters of independence of the risks which will threaten them 
for generations? I am not asking this question and making these 
comments in a partisan way. I am making them because of the 
strong roots I have in Quebec and because I am concerned about 
the present and future well-being of Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to thank the 
government member for her comments. I must admit I did not 
understand when she said right out that Bloc members' 
statements were inconsistent.
<P>
	I failed to understand because in fact there were two speeches 
and some comments. Obviously no one will support the 
undemocratic philosophy advocated by our political opponents. 
Why not admit that NAFTA came about largely because of all 
the efforts made by Quebecers? I am thinking here particularly 
about the present Quebec Minister of International Affairs, 
Bernard Landry, who insisted so much on the necessity of free 
trade for Canada and of course for Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	In response to the question raised by my hon. colleague who is 
wondering how in God's name we will make Quebecers aware of 
all the incredible risks that lie ahead for them, I say this: The 
best way to inform Quebecers about these so-called risks-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order, please. I would 
ask the hon. member to be brief.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> May I go on? Thank you, Madam 
Speaker.
<P>
	How can Quebecers be informed about these so-called risks if 
people will not sit at a table and take part in the consultations 
which will be held by the provincial government? The debate is 
open.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today, as a member of the Bloc Quebecois and as a member of 
Parliament representing Quebec, I am proud to answer the call 
of the Premier of Quebec.
<P>
	The Premier of Quebec has asked us to mobilize our 
resources, organize consultation meetings and prepare for the 
Quebec of the future. Today, I would like to focus on two 
specific points in order to deal with the questions that people are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8803"> 8803 </A></B>
<P>
asking, including the questions asked by the hon. member of the 
Liberal Party who spoke just now.
<P>
	What does the draft bill have to say about currency and the 
apportionment of debt or, as it says in the bill, apportionment of 
property and debts? I will start with the first item: currency. 
What criteria will be applied to determine the currency to be 
used in a sovereign Quebec?
<P>
	Sovereignists were part of the Bélanger-Campeau 
Commission, although it was organized by a party in power that, 
as we have seen throughout, was clearly of the federalist 
persuasion. The commission did a number of studies, and the 
two points I want to discuss with you, currency and 
apportionment of property and debts, were examined in-depth 
by the Bélanger-Campeau Commission, a commission that 
enjoyed considerable recognition and credibility in Quebec and 
was accepted by the entire population.
<P>
	This commission listed the criteria to be considered, and I 
will mention the five principal criteria: economic 
interdependence, minimizing uncertainty, maintaining the same 
economic space, the stability of a dollar that is broader based, 
and trade with other countries that do not use the same currency. 
All these criteria lead us to conclude that it would be better for 
Quebec and Canada if we used Canadian currency in Quebec.
<P>
	The hon. member who pointed out that the bill was not clear 
may wish to listen to section 6, which refers to currency. The 
draft bill says: ``The legal currency of Quebec shall continue to 
be the Canadian dollar''.
<P>
	A large number of Quebec's exports go to Canada. Many 
businesses in Quebec and Ontario or elsewhere in Canada, in 
New Brunswick and the west, that export their products would 
be better off if we had the same dollar, which would simplify 
transactions and avoid the additional cost of using a different 
currency. This would prevent much of the uncertainty that 
would otherwise be caused by Canada's currency being more 
narrowly based and the use of a new currency in Quebec.
<P>
	Therefore both parties would benefit from having the same 
currency. It would greatly facilitate negotiations on the sharing 
of assets and the debt if the debt were calculated in the same 
currency. Therefore a monetary union is clearly desirable.
<P>
	However, the Quebec Premier said that he wishes to hear the 
opinion of Quebecers on that matter. Being from a border area I 
hope and I am convinced that people in my riding and  region 
will express their views on the currency they wish to use in a 
sovereign Quebec. Many of them will certainly prefer to keep 
the Canadian currency.
<P>
	I can see my federalist friends jotting things down and 
preparing to say: ``What guarantee do you have that you will be 
able to keep the Canadian currency?'' Nothing prevents Quebec 
from doing so. I can hardly imagine the Prime Minister asking 
the Bank of Canada to print on bank notes: ``This note is legal 
tender everywhere in the world except in Quebec''. How would 
that look? How would it be interpreted? How would he  explain 
to businesses that from now on it will cost more to do business? 
Because for many people doing business in Quebec is profitable. 
They do not do it for charitable reasons but because it is 
profitable. How will he explain to Canadian businesses who 
export to Quebec that he is adding to their costs on a mere 
political whim?
<P>
	Madam Speaker, it cannot go that way, good sense will 
prevail.
<P>
	That would considerably alleviate uncertainty while 
facilitating agreements between Quebec and Canada in areas 
where they share common interests. Instead of looking for 
differences, we would be looking for common points.
<P>
	If there is uncertainty, it is not about the decision that 
Quebecers will make. If there is any uncertainty, it is in the way 
Canadians will react to the answer Quebecers will give through a 
democratic process. The uncertainty lies in the response 
Canadians would give if Quebecers chose to become masters of 
their own destiny.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	I also want to say a few words about how the assets and 
liabilities would be shared. I will not mention the legal aspects 
of the issue, which would clearly favour Quebec; things are very 
clear concerning assets, much less so concerning financial 
commitments to creditors. In any case, out of respect and 
concern for commitments made in the past, the draft bill states: 
``The Government may conclude, with the Government of 
Canada, any agreement relating to the apportionment of the 
property and debts of Canada, and to any matter susceptible of 
facilitating the application of this Act''.
<P>
	Out of respect for commitments made in the past, Quebec can 
and must agree with Canada on the apportionment of assets and 
liabilities. Many people mention the apportionment of the debt, 
but there are also properties on Quebec territory. These will 
become the property of the Quebec government. Quebec's share 
of the assets and debts will have to be established. Again in this 
case, the findings of Bélanger-Campeau will be used as a basis 
for negotiations, even as a very firm negotiating position since 
this is a serious study.
<P>
	I remind you that we already pay for the national debt. Some 
people ask how we are going to pay for that debt, as if Quebecers 
did not already pay their share of that debt! Each year, we pay 
$30 billion in taxes to help finance programs and pay  interest on 
the debt and the government continues to borrow on our behalf. 
Now, Quebec would only be responsible for a share of the debt 
and the interest that is still to be defined, which is normal. I will 
come back to this. But we already pay for that. People realize 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8804"> 8804 </A></B>
<P>
this will not be an additional burden. On the contrary, Quebecers 
might have to pay less, as we will explain to them.
<P>
	Using a method based on an evaluation of the assets found in 
Quebec-and there are various methods to calculate our 
share-the Bélanger-Campeau Commission came to the 
conclusion that our share of the debt was 18.5 per cent of the 
total.
<P>
	Since our share of the Canadian economy, of the gross 
domestic product, is a little over 23 per cent, this means that our 
share of the debt would be even lower than before in relation to 
the GDP. This is an interesting factor for Quebecers. Moreover, 
Quebec would have total control over its fiscal policy. We would 
be able to invest in the more productive sectors, stop receiving 
welfare and focus on the more productive sectors. This is a very 
interesting aspect for Quebec's future.
<P>
	In closing, Madam Speaker, I would like to remind you briefly 
of the events that led us to the decision the Premier of Quebec 
made today.
<P>
	Let us look only at the last four years. On June 22, 1990, the 
Meech Lake Accord failed. On June 20, 1991, the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission was established to examine the 
possibility and consequences of Quebec's sovereignty. On 
October 26, 1992, the Charlottetown Accord was rejected. On 
October 25, 1993, 54 sovereignists were elected to the 
Parliament of Canada. On September 12, 1994, 77 members of a 
sovereignist party were elected to form the government of 
Quebec. On December 7, the Premier of Quebec tabled a draft 
bill asking the people to define what would be in the preamble to 
Quebec's Constitution, to define their commitment to Quebec, 
to define the values they cherish right now and the values they 
want for the future. This draft bill asks the people to help in 
shaping the Quebec of tomorrow.
<P>
	As a young Quebecer, I must tell you that participating in 
shaping of the Quebec of the future is the finest challenge that 
my generation has been issued, and it is with pride and 
dedication that the members of the Bloc Quebecois will accept 
this challenge. Our answer to the Premier of Quebec is: Bravo! 
At last we see the light at the end of the tunnel. We support your 
process and we will build the Quebec of tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased with what the Bloc member who just spoke said 
about economic integration in particular, because of what it 
means for the people of Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	I represent an Ontario riding. We Ontarians realize that our 
future and our economy are closely tied to Quebec. Quebec is 
our best market, our number one economic partner. So, it is only 
normal that the party opposite talk about the connection between 
Ontario and Quebec, about the close economic ties that will 
always exist between us.
<P>
	The question is: how will we plan our future together? We see 
it as part of a federal system. You are considering keeping the 
Canadian dollar as legal currency. I ask you: what is the point of 
continuing to use the Canadian currency in an independent 
Quebec? If that is what you want, so be it. At present, in this 
House, you have a Prime Minister from Quebec and the Minister 
of Finance, also from Quebec, ensuring that you have some 
control over this currency. If tomorrow, from an Ontario point of 
view, you will have an independent Quebec, why are you 
planning to keep the Canadian currency? It may be a good idea, 
but then, it must made quite clear to the people of Quebec that 
the rest of Canada will insist on controlling its own currency, 
while Quebec, if an arrangement is negotiated, will hold only 25 
per cent of the voting power under a possible arrangement on a 
common currency.
<P>
	Today, you have some control over this currency. Tomorrow, 
you will only have an interest, with the rest of Canada, with the 
others, and yours will be a minority interest. So, when you say 
that what you do in Quebec will be determined democratically, 
bear in mind that whatever you do affects the rights and interests 
of other Canadians who, like me as an Ontarian, have respect for 
Quebecers and have this to say to them: ``Yes to democracy. Yes, 
Quebecers have the right to decide their future democratically, 
as long as this is done with full knowledge of what is at stake''.
<P>
	Let us not lose sight of the facts amid this pile of hypotheses, 
hypotheses that are not at all correct and that you have selected. 
If you are really democratic, include us in the process, so that 
the people of Quebec can see, so that they have a chance to see 
whether these hypotheses are realistic or not. That is the 
problem with your process. That is why your process is not 
democratic.
<P>
	I will conclude with a word on an entirely different matter, 
which nontheless is related to the democratic process. In 
Ontario, we have a strong French-speaking minority which has 
been campaigning for many years for its survival. Bear in mind 
also, in your democracy, when you make your choices, what will 
become of the French language in Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, I will respond to some of the 
points raised by the hon. member, whom I wish to thank because 
he seems to be interested in participating in the consultations 
and to have a constructive point of view. I urge him to 
participate in the consultations. He should put pressure on the 
members of his party and express his fears about the currency so 
that we can arrive at an even wiser decision.
<P>
	It would be interesting if he got involved in a great democratic 
process instead of boycotting it. Just a short word on the 
French-speaking minority in Ontario. I hope that, as an Ontario 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8805"> 8805 </A></B>
<P>
resident, he will continue to press his provincial government to 
treat its francophone minority the same way we will treat the 
anglophone minority in Quebec.
<P>
	However, he said something that was inaccurate. Although 
the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are from 
Quebec, they do not control monetary policy, as we have seen in 
the past. Remember when Toronto faced inflation and an 
overheated economy? What happened? They implemented an 
inflation-fighting policy that hurt all of Canada.
<P>
	Very briefly, if he believes that we will have no more 
influence on monetary policy, let me tell him that whether we 
print our own currency or use another one, selling off all our 
Canadian dollars on the market would cause a major decline in 
the value of the Canadian dollar.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Sorry, but the hon. 
member's time is up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in the debate on the opposition motion and 
indicate why I cannot support the motion.
<P>
	I cannot do so because I believe that together we are a great 
nation, a strong, vibrant and wealthy nation that is inclusive, a 
nation and a society that knows how to accommodate French and 
English, native peoples and cultures from the four corners of the 
world.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	Quebec within Canada has accomplished an extraordinary 
amount. To quote Mr. Parizeau:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
``-what our people has accomplished in 30 years is 
remarkable.''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To go further into the speech he gave on December 6, he 
talked as the minister did earlier about the accomplishments of 
Quebec, a society which lacked a ministry of education that now 
has a technology so advanced that it exports the majority of it, a 
society which did not have a business culture, which:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
``-has produced internationally renowned industrial and 
financial giants. A society which was said to be without a history 
and without a literature now has its own films, singers, dancers, 
writers who travel the world.''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is an extraordinary accomplishment. In his speech of 
December 6 Mr. Parizeau said that the preamble to the 
declaration would be a declaration:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
``-like the American Declaration of Independence of which we 
still hear echoes more than 200 years after it was written.''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Exactly. I had a chance to look at the Declaration of 
Independence of the United States following Mr. Parizeau's 
comments. I read from that declaration:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the 
political bonds which have connected them one with another, and to assume among the 
Powers  of  the earth, the separate and equal station to which the  Laws of  Nature and of 
Nature's  God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they 
should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What are the causes? The Declaration of Independence goes 
on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not 
be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath 
shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than 
to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Declaration of Independence has the advantage of listing 
the causes for separation and for breaking the bonds, indicating 
why there was respect for the opinions of mankind. The causes 
are listed:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated 
injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of 
absolute Tyranny over these States.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Canada has not been tyrannous and with due respect to the 
official opposition it has not said it is. The Declaration of 
Independence declared that the facts should be submitted to a 
candid world and we ask for these facts. What were their facts? 
The King of Britain, and I quote:
<P>
-has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and 
necessary for the public good.
<P>
	In Canada despite the power of the federal government to 
have disallowance of legislation of the provincial legislatures, it 
has not been used in the case of Quebec in recent times. Indeed it 
has not been used over the last half century.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing 
importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be 
obtained-He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with 
manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	No legislature in Canada has been dissolved.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, 
and distant from the depository of their Public Records for the sole purpose of 
fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There may be a point there. I think you will agree, Madam 
Speaker, that whatever the complications and burdens that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8806"> 8806 </A></B>
<P>
members suffer, it is not so unusual and uncomfortable that it 
represents a great burden. It goes on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He has  kept  among  us,  in  times  of  peace,  Standing  Armies with  the  Consent  of our   legislature.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We have heard recently from the official opposition that 
rather than complaining about standing armies within the 
province of Quebec, we hear the request that existing 
institutions which represent the Canadian military be sustained 
in that province. It goes on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We heard earlier today the official opposition speak about the 
importance of the free trade agreement with the United States, 
indeed taking some credit as a province, not as a party 
obviously, for having that particular agreement sustained in the 
Parliament of Canada. Far from cutting off trade, we have 
increased the possibility for Quebec, not only through the free 
trade agreement, but also through the WTO, recently approved. 
It goes on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That has not been done.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Or:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and 
altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Canada is not tyranny. Separation would be weakness. If we 
would be weak and not just as a country, the weakened soul as a 
society, separation would enfeeble all of us.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Out of alliances come strength. Out of separation comes 
disintegration. Out of inclusiveness comes tolerance. The 
success of our history to date is proof that it is not necessary to 
break up a country to satisfy our mutual aspirations.
<P>
	Since this is our national Parliament, I assume that all of us 
here have the best interests of the country at heart. I sometimes 
forget that the agenda of the official opposition is not in the best 
interests of the whole country but rather the separation, the 
dissolution of the country.
<P>
	Where else in the world would a country and a political 
system be sufficiently flexible to tolerate an official opposition 
whose only goal is the breakup of the country? That is not 
tyranny.
<P>
	Only in Canada, you say? Absolutely, and that is true. The 
presence of the official opposition of the Bloc Quebecois in 
Parliament speaks louder than any words. It is a living 
expression of Canada's deeply rooted and unshakeable 
commitment to democracy. Our political system respects the 
wishes of Quebecers and  demonstrates that our system can 
accommodate the expression of the views represented by the 
official opposition which we hear daily in this assembly. If the 
opposition truly had the interest of the constituents at heart it 
would use its presence in Parliament to take every opportunity 
to strengthen not to diminish the gains acquired over the 
generations.
<P>
	Approached constructively this Parliament could be used to 
further the interests of Quebec. Instead of taking this 
opportunity to secure Quebec's place in Canada, the official 
opposition too often undermines Quebec's strong place in 
Canada as a full partner in the country.
<P>
	As the official opposition the Bloc has a responsibility to 
assist in the governance of the country. Its obligation not just to 
Quebec but to the rest of the country is to work constructively to 
build a greater and even stronger nation.
<P>
	As the opposition the Bloc has a legitimate role to play in 
ensuring that the government does not overlook the interests of 
anyone. It could keep a watchful eye on the interests of Quebec 
and at the same time help build something larger. It could ensure 
that as the country goes from strength to strength, Quebec is 
along enjoying the benefits too.
<P>
	We heard earlier today comments about the status quo but 
surely in Canada, in Quebec, everywhere in the world there can 
be no status quo today, as the member for Rosedale indicated a 
few moments ago.
<P>
	Status quo is to stop growing. To stop growing is to stagnate. 
There can be no status quo in the modern world. Since its 
inception Canada has been a nation that has changed. We are 
changing today. We are changing in the life of this Parliament. 
For example an historic breakthrough occurred when the first 
ministers of this country agreed on a process to begin the 
elimination of internal trade barriers, an agreement that was of 
great importance and will be built upon and is supported I 
believe by members opposite.
<P>
	We did not need, it must be said, a constitutional amendment 
to do this. When common sense and our own self interest told us 
that it no longer made any sense whatever to be part of the 
largest free trade bloc in the world and still maintain internal 
barriers which are an obstacle to prosperity, we found a way out. 
In the same spirit we will find a solution to other problems. For 
example the two territories and eight of the provinces have 
signed action plans with the federal government to reduce 
overlap and duplication in a host of areas.
<P>
	Yesterday the minister of Indian affairs signed a milestone 
agreement with the native peoples of Manitoba opening the way 
to full self-government. This is the product of negotiations and 
a willingness to come to an agreement. It was not necessary to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8807"> 8807 </A></B>
<P>
rewrite the Constitution and this is not preservation of the status 
quo.
<P>
	What we are offering Quebecers and Canadians is not the 
status quo. We are offering a country in evolution that is gearing 
itself to prosper in the next century. In that next century we 
expect and we hope that Canada with Quebec will play an even 
more prominent role. It is obvious to everyone that current 
political, economic and technological developments around the 
world are leading to an era of globalism where individual nation 
states play a lesser role. The previous speaker for the Bloc paid 
attention to that very concern.
<P>
	Countries which are not integrally tied into a larger alliance 
are going to be bypassed. This is not the time to set up borders. It 
is the time to bring down borders.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	The Europeans, for example, have come to realize that the 
nationalist balkanization of the continent will not be sustainable 
in the future. They are moving inexorably toward the creation of 
a European federation. They have a long way to go but the 
development of the federation is now in sight. Last evening I 
heard a Frenchman and a German speaking to each other, talking 
about the common cause co-operation which they have built. I 
thought to myself, what an extraordinary accomplishment this 
is, for two nations that have literally killed millions of each 
other's citizens in the twentieth century, within living memory 
of many French and Germans. But they have accomplished a lot 
and that is what they emphasized to each other.
<P>
	They still have a long way to go but the development of the 
federation will take place and is taking place. Canada, we must 
remind ourselves, is light years ahead of the Europeans on this 
count; it is one of the oldest and most successful federations in 
the world.
<P>
	In conclusion, the adventure we have had together in building 
the country is the best guarantee we have that once again, 
together, we can continue to build a country for ourselves and 
for our children that is envied in all the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the hon. member's speech. I must 
tell him that, contrary to what he said, the Official Opposition is 
playing its role of watchdog regarding the government's 
activities and the legislation tabled in this House.
<P>
	So far, that is for a year now, the Bloc Quebecois has done all 
that was necessary to provide the government with the necessary 
tools to stimulate employment, but the government did nothing. 
I think that we do play our role very effectively.
<P>
	Also, after 35 years of constitutional failures, do you not 
believe that the time has come for Quebec to get the powers it 
needs to control its destiny? This is what Mr. Parizeau is inviting 
us to do with his bill. He is inviting all Quebecers, including 
people in my riding of Chicoutimi and in my region of 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, young and old, regardless of their 
political affiliation, to participate in this debate, which is as 
important for the rest of Canada as it is for Quebec.
<P>
	I must recognize that the hon. member was the only one this 
morning, from the government side, who did not question the 
legality of the proposed draft bill, and he deserves credit for 
that.
<P>
	The member referred to the federation of European countries. 
I should point out that these countries are also sovereign 
nations. Quebec simply wants to have the powers it needs to 
become the country Quebecers want.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member. Some Liberal MPs 
from Quebec said that the federal government should abstain 
from holding its own referendum in Quebec.
<P>
	The hon. member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
told us that, in his opinion, this was a Quebec referendum and 
that it was up to Quebecers to decide their constitutional future 
within the federation.
<P>
	Does the hon. member agree with these two views?
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. English:</B> Madam Speaker, several points and several 
questions have been raised. I will try to respond briefly to them.
<P>
	In talking about the role of the official opposition, I did not 
comment precisely on what was being done in this Parliament. I 
was encouraging the members to work together with all parties 
to strengthen the Canadian nation. There are many opportunities 
to do so; in committees, in Parliament and in the legislation that 
is brought forward. By working together we could face the many 
challenges we all admit this country is facing. The role the hon. 
member suggested of monitoring or supervising the process that 
occurs here I think is a limitation on the possibility of what a 
parliamentarian can do.
<P>
	The hon. member and his colleagues would do well to 
consider the greater possibilities that reside in this Chamber, 
possibilities that can lead to a strengthening of the interests of 
all Canadians and Quebecers as well.
<P>
	The constitutional failures of the last 30 years were discussed 
by the hon. member and he asked were these not sufficient proof 
of the need to consider separation. In Mr. Parizeau's declaration 
of December 6 he opened with comments about what had been 
achieved apart from the Constitution.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8808"> 8808 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to talk about what Quebec and Canada have 
achieved apart from the Constitution but in terms of what 
Quebec has achieved according to Mr. Parizeau. He said:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	``Together, we have made the past 30 years a unique period in 
our history.''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is extremely important in the view of the premier of 
Quebec. In the 1960s a vigorous cultural life was built in the 
province and a modern state was built. In the 1970s the 
democratization of education of the society occurred. In the 
1980s:
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	``-in spite of a severe recession, we attained economic 
power-''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	He goes on to talk about the widening of Quebec's presence 
within the world.
<P>
	Rather than focus on the limitations and the failures, 
following on the words of the prime minister of Quebec, one 
could look at the accomplishments of our country which are 
truly magnificent. They look to the future. They look to the 
importance of co-operation and they also point to the necessity 
of keeping the country together.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I recognize the hon. 
member for Terrebonne. You have about two minutes left to 
make some comments and ask a question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Madam Speaker, how much time do I have 
left?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Two minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am very pleased to have a few moments to elaborate on the 
comments made by my colleague from the government party.
<P>
	I also want to thank my party for letting me speak on what I 
see as a fundamental issue and I want to remind my colleagues 
that this issue is the one and only reason all of us, in the Bloc 
Quebecois, have entered public life.
<P>
	So, today's debate is extremely significant, even though the 
time at our disposal is limited. In the little time I have, I want to 
invite the people in my riding of Terrebonne, the people in the 
Lanaudière region, to take part in the consultation process. 
Contrary to what we were told earlier, the people in favour of our 
project are invited to participate in order to examine in depth our 
position and to show their support. Those who are against are 
also invited.
<P>
	Finally, I want to ask my colleague a question related to what 
his leader said in 1990, during a brunch where 800 Liberals were 
gathered. His leader said that the Liberal Party of Canada would 
propose a new social contract and a major constitutional reform. 
He made that statement on October 28, 1990. Where do things 
stand now?
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. English:</B> Madam Speaker, the situation that exists in 
Canada is not one where we are satisfied with the status quo. We 
are changing the country. We have social security reform. We 
have a major budget coming forward. We have programs in the 
area of foreign affairs. We have programs in many areas that will 
affect very much the way the country is organized and the way it 
functions.
<P>
	We are not committed to a federalism that is static. We have a 
flexible federalism. That is the kind of country we intend to 
work with.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is with great pleasure and pride that I rise today to speak on the 
motion presented by my colleague for Laurier-Sainte-Marie: 
That this House enjoin the government to recognize the 
legitimacy of the democratic process initiated by the 
Government of Quebec in order to allow Quebecers to chart 
their own political and constitutional future.
<P>
	On September 12, 1994, in Quebec we finally did elect a 
separatist government which clearly puts its option on the table 
and asks all Quebecers to take part in a huge democratic 
operation. This is totally new! It is a clear, simple and open 
process where nothing is hidden. Liberals from the provincial 
and the federal levels have claimed that they will not take part in 
this process, which they consider illegitimate.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and his friends protest and try to 
minimize this process initiated by the Quebec government and 
its impact. Federalists try to ridicule and trivialize the process. 
This is too bad, since they thus demonstrate a lack of respect for 
the duly elected Quebec government.
<P>
	Their reaction appears normal to us and was rather 
predictable. For once, they are not the ones to set the agenda and 
the final result of this vast democratic operation will not be a 
new kind of federalism but rather sovereignty for Quebec, the 
creation of a new country.
<P>
	I really wonder what federalists expected of a sovereignist 
government. Did they think that the Parti Quebecois would ask 
Quebecers if they would like to have renewed federalism or, as 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs recently put it, 
flexible federalism? Come on! Be serious and show some 
respect for the Quebec government! I am sure that once you will 
be over the shock, you will want to sit down with us and  express 
your point 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8809"> 8809 </A></B>
<P>
of view. Mr. Parizeau has extended an invitation to you and it 
would be in your interest to accept it. Besides, I see today that, 
thanks to our motion, you have already entered the debate and 
this is a good sign.
<P>
	I would like now to touch on a sector that Quebec's 
sovereignty will help simplify and make more efficient and 
effective, that is, job training. For years there has been a 
consensus in Quebec that job training has to be under exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction. Employers, unions, workers as well as 
social and economic groups all agree: Quebec must have all 
powers for manpower training. Everybody agrees that federal 
programs and budgets must be repatriated in order to develop a 
consistent and intelligent manpower training policy.
<P>
	For years the federal government has turned a deaf ear to 
Quebec's request in this respect. It systematically refuses to 
give Quebec what it is asking for. It hides behind national 
objectives and its responsibility for unemployment insurance to 
intervene in an area under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	This intrusion by the federal government has created two 
manpower networks in Quebec. A vast number of federal 
programs overlap and duplicate provincial programs. According 
to André Bourbeau, a former Quebec minister, this situation 
wastes some $275 million a year of taxpayers' money in Quebec 
alone.
<P>
	In 1991, in a policy statement on manpower development, this 
former Quebec Minister of Manpower, a Liberal and a 
federalist, said: ``For many years Quebec has claimed control 
over policy instruments that influence the job market. This 
means that the Government of Quebec and its economic partners 
are demanding that laws, budgets, institutions, programs and 
services related to manpower and to the job market be under one 
authority. Quebecers with an interest in the job market 
recognize almost unanimously that manpower policies must be 
developed by those who are closest to the various areas of the 
job market.'' What has the federal government done to respond 
to these rational demands from Quebec? Nothing! It has rejected 
them out of hand.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Quebec's workers and employers are suffering as 
a result of this situation. Indeed, the double system is 
cumbersome, slow and complex. Workers and employers do not 
need that. They need the exact opposite. They need training that 
is effective, fast and convenient.
<P>
	An employer or a new company looking for workers cannot 
afford to wait around for years until these people are trained. As 
soon as companies announce their requirements, the training 
system must be able to provide a quick response. This kind of 
efficient and quick response is particularly important, 
considering the new technologies being used. And the same 
applies to  workers. They must be given the means to acquire 
training without being penalized.
<P>
	Recently, I was given an example of this lack of flexibility in 
the training system by one of my constituents. This person 
wanted to take an 18-month course in office automation. The 
Canada Employment Centre told her she could not do that 
because the federal government had only approved 12-month 
courses. Many workers who want to get off unemployment or 
welfare are faced with this kind of situation which makes no 
sense at all.
<P>
	In Quebec, we want to make the system more flexible, and we 
want to make it smarter. Today, we cannot do that. The federal 
presence prevents us from making these crucial improvements 
in the system. Today, the federal presence is paralysing the 
entire system. In 1993, Canada ranked twenty-second and last, 
and I repeat, twenty-second and last among developed countries 
because of its very poor level of in-house training. This figure is 
not often mentioned by these people across the way. It is a little 
embarrassing, I suppose.
<P>
	Let us consider briefly why people no longer know where to 
turn. The federal government is interfering in this area with 27 
programs in addition to Quebec's 25. The federal government 
interferes by maintaining 100 Canada Employment Centres, 
although Quebec has put in place la Société québécoise de 
développement de la main-d'oeuvre. The mandate of the SQDM 
was originally to establish genuine one-stop counters in all 
regions in Quebec.
<P>
	I am referring to genuine one-stop counters for Quebec, not a 
façade like we saw in the Canada-Saskatchewan agreement 
which, in fact, subordinates the province's jurisdiction to the 
federal authority. In other words, the kind of one-stop counter 
that even Daniel Johnson, Quebec's Liberal leader, criticized 
and rejected.
<P>
	Today, the SQDM acts more like a manager of federal 
funding, without any real say over how it is spent. The lack of 
co-ordination between the two networks means that the 
unemployed are not getting the kind of service they need. In an 
internal memo, the federal government revealed that, in the 
spring of 1993, close to 25,000 unemployed workers, although 
they had been referred to a training program, could not be 
accommodated.
<P>
	Quebec sovereignty will make it possible to clean up the sorry 
mess the federal government put us in. The federal lack of 
willingness to give Quebec what we have been demanding for 
years in this respect, worse yet, its increasing encroachment on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8810"> 8810 </A></B>
<P>
our turf is the last straw which will make people vote yes, very 
soon.
<P>
	Then, we will be able to put in place the system we have been 
yearning for for so long, an intelligent system which will 
efficiently meet the needs of the labour market. Bye bye, dirty 
old federal machine which has not had an oil change in years.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	To conclude, I invite all the people in Laurentides, in my area, 
my riding, to participate in the regional committees which will 
hold hearings in February. For the first time, Quebecers will 
have the chance to say clearly and freely what kind of society 
they want and whether or not they want a sovereign Quebec. 
Individuals and groups of all allegiance, join us to have a 
democratic look at the sovereignist option. Express your point 
of view, voice your fears, suggest improvements; the 
committees which will crisscross Quebec will welcome you and 
want to hear from you.
<P>
	At the end of the day, Quebecers will decide if they want their 
own country, a country which will reflect their aspirations, a 
country in which they will be fulfilled.
<P>
	The process the Government of Quebec is offering us is 
unique. It is democratic, it will make it possible for each and 
everyone to be heard.
<P>
	I will never stop fighting to establish the country of Quebec. I 
will do so with strength and vigour, because my most fervent 
wish is to hand down to my children a country called Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to make a couple of comments on the member's 
dissertation.
<P>
	I am very concerned about my fellow Canadians in Quebec. I 
am concerned when I look at their financial situation in Canada 
today. The government of that province does not seem to want to 
address the real problems facing the people of Quebec. I look at 
a province that has the highest per capita deficit on a provincial 
basis of all the provinces in Canada: $9,400 for every man, 
woman and child in the province of Quebec, a debt which is 40 
per cent financed not only outside the borders of Quebec but 
outside the borders of Canada.
<P>
	These people in the international trading environment are 
looking very closely at Quebec, at the debate that is going on 
here today. As the province of Quebec goes out to refinance its 
debt on the international marketplace it is going to find fewer 
and fewer people interested in investing in that province. I am 
very concerned that the average person in the province of 
Quebec is going to start watching their lifestyle and their 
standard of living decline.
<P>
	I note also that the last election in the province of Quebec was 
basically on the matter of bring us good government. I am 
concerned with the premier of that province who was a finance 
minister during a period in time of Quebec's history that drove 
up the deficit higher than any other administration: 285 per cent 
during his administration of that system.
<P>
	I simply want to ask: What is going on here, what is 
happening? The day after separation no new day, there will be no 
change. The reality is that we are talking about transferring 
powers from Ottawa to Quebec City. I do not know how that 
helps people in Chicoutimi.
<P>
	The reality is that people want control of their own destinies. 
Our government has been spending a lot of time discussing 
social policy review and other areas that affect federal 
legislation and it is going to the people, it is talking to the people 
in the streets on how they want to control those aspects of their 
lives. Creating new embassies all around the world is a 
duplication of expenditure and a cost to the people of Quebec.
<P>
	My colleague often talks about Canada as a hypothetical 
country. To me the state of Quebec is an illusion. People will not 
be any better off; they will be worse off.
<P>
	We have some common things, the people of Quebec and the 
people of the rest of Canada, common things that unite us. One 
of the major ones is our proximity to the United States and the 
economic power that country wields on this side of North 
America.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	I think it has always been in our best interest, as a united 
country and as a united people, to be part of a culture which is 
both French and English.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague how she thinks things are 
going to be so magically different.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Madam Speaker, the scare campaigns do not 
scare Quebecers any more. We have been subjected to them for 
over 30 years, but they do not work anymore. Quebec has all the 
tools necessary to take charge of its affairs. For years it has 
asked for the powers needed to assume responsibility and 
develop.
<P>
	At the present time, business is expanding as never before and 
faster than in any other province. Quebec is very active on the 
various markets. When it takes on all the powers of an 
independent country, I am sure it will develop very fast on all 
markets: the Quebec market, the Canadian market, the 
international market, as well as the American market. I am not 
worried about that.
<P>
	Once we take back our powers, the $275 million wasted 
annually on manpower training, as I mentioned, will be invested 
in training for us, training for our people, for the development of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8811"> 8811 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec. I do not fear any kind of collapse the day after the 
referendum is won, nothing like that will happen. On the 
contrary, a new  country will be born and we will move ahead 
economically.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, as you may have guessed, I proudly welcome 
this opportunity to take part in today's debate and to join my 
colleagues in deploring the fact that federal members who 
represent Quebec here in Ottawa have refused to take part in 
what is probably the most legitimate democratic process ever 
initiated by the National Assembly.
<P>
	Quebec is a democracy. Quebec has one of the oldest 
parliament in the world, and the entire history of Quebec's 
nationalism is entwined with the history of democracy. Earlier, I 
was appalled to hear the hon. member for Hull, who is 
responsible for the federal government's referendum strategy, 
trying to discredit the initiative tabled by Mr. Parizeau's 
government a few days ago.
<P>
	One thing is clear. History tells us that very few nations have 
had a chance to write their own constitution. Consider George 
Washington, Jefferson, Madison and all the great thinkers who 
helped to draft constitutional texts, and who did so because they 
were members of the elite. They did it because they were 
members of the educated class.
<P>
	What we are saying is that in our quest for sovereignty, we 
want to have the broadest possible democratic base. This is an 
opportunity for all Quebecers, regardless of their social class, 
political allegiance or personal wealth, to come forward and say 
what kind of constitution they want and what kind of society 
they want to live in. Because that is what a constitution is all 
about. A constitution says what we are and what we want to be.
<P>
	By giving all Quebecers a chance to take part in this 
democratic process, the Premier is saying to the National 
Assembly, to Ottawa and to the world: We see sovereignty as 
part of a quest for democracy. We cannot plan our future, we 
cannot make this wonderful plan for sovereignty a fact without 
the participation of all Quebecers.
<P>
	As many journalists and opinion-makers have pointed out, 
the situation we have today is different from the situation in 
1980. There is no federalist leader with any credibility, and we 
can hardly expect the present Prime Minister to be able to 
inspire the federal troops.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	In a democracy, the best way to fight against something is to 
propose something better. There is no other way. Therefore, the 
best way to oppose sovereignty in 1994 is to show that 
federalism can be attractive. If the Quebec federalists, whether 
the hon. member for Saint-Léonard, the hon. member for 
Saint-Henri-Westmount or any other member from Quebec, 
believe in their option, they will come forward and address the 
16 regional commissions in order to tell us why, in 1994, 
Quebecers should stick to federalism.  They will be welcome to 
defend their option. But the truth is that federalism does not get 
anyone carried away.
<P>
	When the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, with his big 
ego, suggests that we talk about flexible federalism, we all know 
that flexible federalism depends on the deficit. But right now, 
that deficit is so high that the Minister of Finance cannot even 
watch himself spend. That is the situation. That is why 
federalists cannot come and sit at a table in good faith and 
propose a plan for renewed federalism.
<P>
	We spoke earlier about the economic accomplishments of 
Quebec, but what makes it special also stems from its deep 
respect for every component of democracy. I want to draw your 
attention to the fact that the draft bill tabled before us says 
something crucial, something all members representing English 
Canada should keep in mind. Section 3 of this draft bill says that 
we will draft a constitution which will include a charter of 
human rights and that-and I will quote section 3-``The 
constitution shall include a charter of human rights and 
freedoms. It shall guarantee the English-speaking community 
that its identity and institutions will be preserved. It shall also 
recognize the right of Aboriginal nations to self-government on 
lands over which they have full ownership.''
<P>
	The scope of a section such as this is not well understood. We 
are saying to the English-speaking people, at the beginning of 
this debate: Your community is essential to our future. It is with 
the 900,000 anglophones in Quebec today that we want to think 
about the future, and we are telling them: In our sovereignist 
project, we will give you all the place that is rightfully yours.
<P>
	This is not new because you will recall that, as early as 1967, 
René Lévesque distanced himself from a segment of the 
nationalist movement that did not want to recognize the right of 
the English-speaking community to public schools funded by 
the government.
<P>
	We are saying, at the beginning of this debate, to the 
English-speaking community as well as the aboriginal people, 
who are our two most important minorities: Not only will you 
have a place in a sovereign Quebec, not only will we recognize 
all the rights that are yours today, but we also want you to take 
part in this democratic process that is taking place.
<P>
	In this regard, I think that Quebec is probably a better 
example of democracy than Ottawa. As for the eleven 
Aboriginal nations who live on the territory of Quebec and form 
a community of almost 55,000 people, let us not forget that René 
Lévesque, that great democrat-and I must say that very few 
members opposite have the courage to quote from the 
Referendum Act, a tool he left us to consult people-and his 
government, back in 1985, allowed the eleven Aboriginal 
nations to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8812"> 8812 </A></B>
<P>
recognized all together for what they were. We want these rights 
to be entrenched in the next constitution of Quebec.
<P>
	Remember that Quebec has experienced that constitution. 
There is a misunderstanding about the revolutionary nature of 
what is happening. We are about to recognize the right of our 
two major minorities to participate in the development of the 
constitution, while throughout our history, we were forced, as 
Quebecers, to accept a constitution about which we had never 
been consulted. It is absolutely outrageous to hear Quebecers 
and Canadians being told that the process is rather undemocratic 
because the people will be consulted.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	From the Treaty of Paris to the Union Act and up until 1867, 
Quebecers were never consulted. We want to make up for that, 
we want as much people as possible to participate in the 
movement towards democracy that is getting under way. We 
repeat today, as Premier Parizeau said, that in the next 
constitution, we are going to recognize the right to 
self-government of Aboriginal nations, who were in fact the 
first people to occupy this territory. Such recognition shall be 
exercised in a manner consistent with the territorial integrity of 
Quebec. We say to aboriginal peoples that they will have the 
right-and this right will be entrenched if they so wish-to their 
traditions, their cultures, their lands and their language. We say 
to the English-speaking community that we want them to have a 
public school system, from preschool to university, which is 
giving them full participation in Quebec life.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to say that if federalists still have 
beliefs, if federalists still believe in intellectual integrity, their 
place is before the 16 regional commissions which will travel 
throughout Quebec, because if their option is good enough to 
convince Quebecers, as they argue, they have to put themselves 
through this consultation test. It is not by refusing to take part in 
a democratic process that these people will be able to revitalize 
an option that is stalling but still has the right to exist.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to make a few comments 
and then ask the hon. member some questions.
<P>
	First, I would like to make a correction. When my hon. 
colleague refers to English Canada, he refers at the same time to 
the protection of minorities in Quebec. I am a francophone 
member of Parliament and a Canadian and I come from New 
Brunswick which is not part of English Canada or French 
Canada, but of Canada.
<P>
	The hon. members across the floor emphasize the importance 
of being honest and open and say it is all a matter of choice, but I 
could show you here that the first page of the draft bill is 
entitled: An Act respecting the sovereignty of Quebec. They do 
not even have the courage of their convictions. Once again, they 
talk about sovereignty when in fact, the objective is the 
separation of Quebec. We are asked to get involved in what is 
proposed on the first page of the draft bill.
<P>
	Allow me to turn to the second page. This draft bill sets out 
the political objective. As a member from the Bloc pointed out a 
moment ago: Come on, we have elected a PQ government in 
Quebec. I hope you were not expecting us to offer a clear choice 
between federalism or separation to the people of Quebec. This 
is what she said and it is obviously what they have in mind here.
<P>
	They say that this bill suggests that Quebec will become a 
sovereign country democratically. How can they talk about 
democracy when they have already made up their minds about 
all the issues to be debated, how they are going to proceed, how 
to use the currency, share the assets and divide the debt? This is 
not a clear choice. They are not showing the people of Quebec 
what the real situation is now and what it could be tomorrow. We 
are invited, in my case as a so-called member for English 
Canada, a federalist-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Not you.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> Are you not inviting me?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> No, you are not invited.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> You are not inviting me. 
Therefore, you do not want Quebecers to know exactly what 
they are getting into. Thank you very much for not inviting me to 
participate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> You have nothing to do with that!
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> You are going to have to decide at 
some point. You will have to!
<P>
	I wish to stress that the document I read, the document before 
me, calls for the participation of the people, presumably only 
those of the same political stripe, since I was just told that I do 
not have the right to take part because I am a federalist. Yet, Mr. 
Parizeau says I do have the right.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You do not know how to read!
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> Madam Speaker, it is obvious-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> She does not know how to read!
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> -that this document is 
undemocratic and does not lead to a debate on the options. It is 
indeed a dictatorship in disguise.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, when Quebecers stood up, they 
rejected the Duplessis regime, they said no to dictatorship. I am 
convinced that Quebecers will make a sound decision when 
asked a clear-cut question, not one like this, which is only 
propaganda.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8813"> 8813 </A></B>
<P>
	I wish to tell the members of the Bloc that, even if they do 
not want me in Quebec, Madam Speaker, my roots are in 
Quebec, Quebec is part of Canada, and I will go there whenever 
I please. Therefore, I think we should stop here because the 
members of the Bloc are just showing their fellow citizens that 
they no longer want anyone else. They want to remain isolated. 
Something I regret.	
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> I have a question, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, but time is 
up and I really cannot extend it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker. It was up 
to you to monitor the member's speaking time. You know very 
well that the process we are in-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Enough of that!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> I am not talking to you, I am talking to the 
Chair. It was up to you to monitor the speaking time-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order, please! I am 
giving the hon. member 30 seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano: </B>On a point of order, Madam Speaker. The 
10-minute period is for questions and comments. The hon. 
member chose to comment, therefore there was no question. You 
cannot change the rules every time a member complains.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. government 
member is absolutely right. The time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker. You 
recognized the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. You 
do not have to take orders from a government member. I think 
that the-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker. I respect 
your decision not to continue debate. As you are independent, I 
hope you are not going to let your decision be influenced by the 
hon. member for Saint-Léonard, who would have been better 
advised-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu): </B>Resuming debate. The 
hon. Secretary of State has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise in this debate to speak 
against the motion introduced by the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker. I want to 
be heard.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I was under the 
impression that you had understood that there was no time left. 
Following comments from both sides of the House I came to a 
decision. My decision is clear. The Secretary of State has the 
floor. The issue is closed. The Secretary of State has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> One moment, please. 
Order! I will not accept threats from anyone.
<P>
	Resuming debate, the Secretary of State.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, as I was saying, I rise to 
speak against the motion of the member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie. The Bloc Quebecois members are 
trying to use the same tactics as their colleagues from the Parti 
Quebecois; it is quite normal, both parties are separatist.
<P>
	Both are trying to make Quebecers believe that the process 
they are putting forward is clever. Being clever and sly has 
nothing to do with democracy. Democracy does not resort to 
clever tricks. When I read the motion by the Bloc Quebecois, I 
was reminded of Mr. Parizeau's own comments boasting that he 
had found a clever way to convince Quebecers of the validity of 
the separatist ideology.
<P>
	In turn, the Bloc members are resorting to Mr. Parizeau's 
clever trick. They are trying to make us believe that the process 
he started is democratic. When I read the motion, I came to the 
conclusion that this House cannot, in a million years, endorse 
such a trick. This House must not support a process which does 
not lead to the real question. This House must not support a 
motion which is trying to hijack Quebec's established and 
legitimate consultation process. This House, this bastion of 
democracy, must defeat the motion by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	It is also obvious that the process advocated by the Parti 
Quebecois and its mirror image, the Bloc Quebecois, was 
conceived to deliberately disguise the real debate, to lead 
Quebecers away from the real question, from the debate on the 
question the Parti Quebecois itself put forward on many 
occasions. This question, the real one, the one the Parti 
Quebecois had committed itself to put to a vote, was to clearly 
ask Quebecers whether or not they wanted to separate from 
Canada.
<P>
	However, the Parti Quebecois, and by default, the Bloc 
Quebecois, preferred to skip this step. According to Mr. 
Parizeau, the people of Quebec should not be asked if they want 
to separate from Canada. They must not be asked to vote on a 
clear and simple question as part of the process set in motion 
under the referendum act. No, that would be too democratic and 
not shrewd enough.
<P>
	Mr. Parizeau decided instead to force the people of Quebec to 
take part in a process, the outcome of which is already known, 
one that offers only one option and they are required to make a 
profession of faith for separation in order to take part in this 
process. Let us not delude ourselves. Parizeau has no intention 
of letting Quebecers who do not think like him influence his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8814"> 8814 </A></B>
<P>
process and its outcome. He has clearly stated that it would be 
difficult  to change his mind about certain aspects of his draft 
bill. How are we to believe that the process will be democratic 
then?
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	How could a federalist who does not share the separatist ideal 
feel free to express her concerns to a commission mandated to 
consider the basis of a sovereign Quebec, separated from 
Canada? She will not even be given the opportunity to question 
separation or discuss the issue. She is invited to share with Mr. 
Parizeau her views on the choice of a currency, her citizenship, 
and the future of Quebec apart from Canada.
<P>
	Where will federalist Quebecers find a forum where they can 
exercise their right to speak and put across their fundamental 
opposition to separation? They will quite simply have no forum, 
because the Parti Quebecois just does not want to hear what they 
have to say.
<P>
	As we say in French, the PQ has no use for anyone who does 
not share its opinion. The Parti Quebecois has already decided 
the future of Quebecers. The PQ and Bloc members are the only 
ones who know what is good for the people of Quebec. They 
have charted their future without even consulting them.
<P>
	In the interest of the people of Quebec, the Parti Quebecois 
will take Quebec out of Canada. Too bad for Quebecers who 
believe in federalism and object to separation. Too bad for you, 
if you wanted to express your concerns and fears about, or 
rejection of the separatist option. Just do not be afraid.
<P>
	The Parti Quebecois is telling these people that there is 
nothing to be afraid of, since it has all been decided: economic 
association, currency, legislation and so on. All they have to do 
is vote on a bill that has already been passed by the Pequiste 
majority. They do not even have to worry about the desirability 
of separation because, as far as they are concerned, it is a done 
deal.
<P>
	The Parti Quebecois says that it is the only option, that there is 
nothing else. Such is the democratic process PQ style. 
Everything has already been decided in advance. It is as though 
your neighbour Gilles woke you up on Saturday morning to tell 
you: ``You are moving. The decision has already been made. You 
have no choice. If you want, however, we can discuss the size of 
the moving van you will need''.
<P>
	No one could describe this as an open approach allowing all 
viewpoints to be heard. You could not even object to your 
moving; it would be a done deal.
<P>
	Like your neighbour Gilles, the opposition member is asking 
us to say: ``No problem. Even though I have always been against 
moving, it does not matter. I will move. Let us now discuss the 
size of the van''.
<P>
	Such is the democratic logic of the motion they are asking us 
to adopt. Not only is the process rigged but there is an additional 
obstacle. Federalists are not allowed equal representation on the 
commissions advocated by PQ members. They are not given 
access to the same resources and do not have as much time to 
speak as the separatists. The process advocated by the PQ goes 
against the very spirit of the Referendum Act.
<P>
	René Lévesque, who was a proud believer in fairness and 
parity, would be ashamed. Those who define themselves as his 
heirs are now subverting the basic principles underlying 
Quebec's tradition of consulting its people. How can they ask us 
today to ratify a process that flies in the face of democratic 
principles?
<P>
	The PQ process is forcing people to conclude that separation 
is inevitable, that Quebecers no longer have a choice. I am 
denouncing this bluff by the Quebec government, just as I reject 
the motion tabled by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Nowhere is it said or written that Quebecers must separate 
from Canada, and that to fully realize their future, they must 
create a new country. Quebecers already have a country, a 
country that they built, that belongs to them, that reflects their 
culture, their language, their achievements, a country where 
they are free to grow without constraints. This country is 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Quebecers were directly involved in building and developing 
this country. They did more than preside over its birth. They are 
responsible for it and contribute to its growth. They are essential 
members of this country.
<P>
	The opposition's motion asks us to presume that Quebecers 
want to break their ties with their country, to reject a country 
that they built and which belongs to them, without asking them 
whether or not they want to take that road.
<P>
	In all conscience, I cannot support this motion. I cannot vote 
for a motion which is contrary to the spirit of a citizen's most 
basic right in this country, namely the right to free expression of 
his opinion.
<P>
	I call on all members of this House to vote against this motion, 
to vote no to the trickery which subverts the democratic process, 
to vote no to the ruse which hides the real debate. That is why we 
must defeat this motion, out of respect for democracy.
<P>
	The proof of all that I just said is in the press release from the 
Premier of Quebec when he tabled his draft bill. I would like to 
quote the third paragraph of this press release from the Premier 
who tabled a draft bill on Quebec sovereignty this week. Here is 
what it says, in the third paragraph: ``A vast process of 
information and participation will get under way to give all 
Quebecers an opportunity to take part directly in the discussion 
which is beginning. The people can comment on the plan, 
discuss it and propose improvements-'' Madam Speaker,  it 
says ``propose improvements'', not propose changes, only 
improve it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8815"> 8815 </A></B>
<P>
	Again I quote from the same press release from the Premier of 
Quebec, this time the fourth paragraph: ``Through this process, 
Quebecers will also be asked to draft a Declaration of 
Sovereignty''.
<P>
	Nothing is said about asking people whether they agree that 
Quebec should separate from Canada. We are presented with a 
plan. The Government of Quebec and the Bloc Quebecois think 
that Quebecers agree on separation. However, according to 
opinion polls, the majority, at least 60 per cent, are against 
separation. Although the government was elected on the 
promise of being a good government and holding a referendum 
on separation later, it is proposing a bill as if it had received a 
mandate to trigger this mechanism leading to separation. It is 
quite clear.
<P>
	When we say that not only Liberal members in Quebec City 
and Ottawa do not want to participate, even important groups in 
Quebec that took part in the Bélanger-Campeau Commission, 
which my colleagues opposite in the Bloc Quebecois have 
mentioned repeatedly this morning, like the farmers' union, the 
president of the Quebec City Chamber of Commerce, the 
president of the employers' council and the president of the 
Quebec manufacturers' association said that they would not 
participate in this process because it is undemocratic. They 
would have taken part if it had been something like the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission, but not in a process like this. 
We are not the only ones. We do not want to participate. We 
participate fully in Quebec life. We want to take part in a debate 
where people can express themselves and make points for 
Canadian federalism and for separation. Once Quebecers have 
made their decision, then their government can table draft 
legislation like this and tell them: You have voted for separation. 
Here is how we will proceed.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	What is Mr. Parizeau doing right now? He is skipping the 
basic step, because he has already initiated the process, without 
even securing a mandate to separate. The answer is no, a 
categorical no, and we will fight the process all the way to prove 
it. That answer is certainly the one Quebecers will give Mr. 
Parizeau, and here in the House, we say no to the Bloc members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate this opportunity to thank the hon. member for 
Saint-Léonard for participating in the current debate taking 
place in Quebec, this in spite of his views. He is acting like a true 
politician, as well as a solid and honest man, and I commend him 
for that.
<P>
	However, I find that the hon. member is too easily outraged. I 
guess customs change with the times. Government members 
have been using the word democracy all day.
<P>
	But remember the unilateral patriation of the Constitution. 
That was not the work of angels. It was done in 1982, by the 
Liberals opposite. Back then, they were proud of their 
democracy. The current Prime Minister, who is from Quebec, 
was the one behind that dirty job on Quebecers. What happened? 
It is very simple. They did not try to shaft Quebec. With his 
typical smile, which has become his trademark, he said: But we 
still got them, did we not? Just like a kid who did something bad.
<P>
	The Liberals were not scandalized back in 1981. I remember 
Mr. Lévesque saying to these people, the day after the night of 
the long knives, that their rejoicing at Quebec's expense would 
end some day. Indeed, that rejoicing just might end very soon.
<P>
	We mentioned the patriation of the Constitution. It goes 
without saying that this was not Canadian federalism's finest 
hour. René Lévesque was not impressed; he was no more 
impressed than the hon. member for Saint-Léonard is now when 
he talks about being forced to move.
<P>
	At the Bélanger-Campeau Commission, the Bloquistes and 
the separatists did not have the upper hand. Yet, you were not 
upset by the undemocratic structure of that commission. You 
remained very quiet. Who took part in the 1982 coup, the 
unilateral patriation? At the time, you had relegated democracy 
to some dark place where the sun does not shine.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, such a figure of speech is not 
unparliamentary.
<P>
	Quebecers, including the hon. member for Saint-Léonard, are 
invited to a sort of summit. They are asked to give their views on 
the issue. Anything can be amended in this draft bill, which 
contains 17 clauses.
<P>
	The preamble will be decided by Quebecers. I do not 
remember being consulted on the preamble of the Constitution 
and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in 1982. 
Democracy works only if you agree with the Liberal Party. Then 
it is democracy at play and the Liberals can have anything done 
to Quebec, usually by a Quebecer, because it does not look quite 
as bad. In fact, we know who their hatchet man is; he is not here 
today, but we know who he is.
<P>
	It is now up to Quebecers to speak up and even draft the 
preamble of this historic draft bill.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Maybe he did not realize it, but the hon. member for 
Saint-Léonard just scored a point for the federalists. I 
congratulate him on it, but I wish he would not say that the 
process is undemocratic. I think the members on the other side 
of the House should be the last ones to talk about democracy.
<P>
	Look what they did to democracy in the famous Bill C-22 on 
Pearson Airport; look what they do to democracy in Bill C-62 
which was introduced so innocuously and which the government 
will use to give  away huge chunks of federal operations to its 
friends, probably the same people who were involved in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8816"> 8816 </A></B>
<P>
Pearson Airport deal. Since the government can no longer 
subsidize its friends, it gives away chunks of government 
operations. Democracy? I say to the hon. member for 
Saint-Léonard that this has nothing to do with democracy.
<P>
	I want to know something. You know that democracy also 
includes the right not to get involved. Some communities may 
decide not to take my advice, not to get involved, and not to 
contribute to the process. If they choose not to take part, it will 
not make me cry. I will respect their right, because it is their 
most basic right not to get involved.
<P>
	But I still want to stress that they are welcome to participate in 
this debate, if they live in Quebec, of course. I hope that 
members opposite will have the magnanimity to respect their 
cultural communities, especially French-speaking communities 
outside Quebec, which will not be included in the debate either.
<P>
	To conclude, I just want to say that I am deeply offended to 
hear our process being called undemocratic, especially by some 
of the big names in the Liberal Party who were here in 1982.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, this morning, the hon. 
member mentioned all the amendments proposed to the 
Constitution in the last 30 years. He spoke of the patriation of 
the Constitution, the Bélanger-Campeau Commission, etc., but 
not even once did I hear the hon. members of the Bloc speak of 
the 1980 referendum. There was a referendum in 1980 on the 
issue of sovereignty and people-
<P>
	Sorry. It seems someone did talk about it. Well done! 
Unfortunately, I was out of the House at the time.
<P>
	In 1980, Quebec's sovereignty-association with Canada was 
proposed and the people said no. Now, we are in favour of this 
type of consultation. We say to the Quebec government: Ask the 
question! If the answer is yes, go on with the process you have 
started this week! What is undemocratic and what you refuse to 
acknowledge is that you have skipped the most important step.
<P>
	There was an election in Quebec and this issue was raised 
during the election campaign. As you will remember, your 
leader corrected Mr. Parizeau on this, during the big meeting 
held in Joliette. He was speaking of the Parti Quebecois's 
strategy because nothing was being done. He would not 
introduce a bill in the National Assembly without holding a 
referendum first. And now he tables a draft bill in the National 
Assembly and once this bill has been voted on, there will be a 
referendum.
<P>
	No, that cannot be. First, they must get a mandate from the 
people. They must ask Quebecers if they want to secede or not. 
Can you honestly answer this question today? Do Quebecers 
really want to secede or not? Do you have the mandate? That is 
the question. We do not think you have that mandate.
<P>
	Ask the question and if the answer is yes in the referendum, 
you may then initiate-and I use the word on advisedly-the 
process announced this week by the Quebec government.

Terrebonne has 30 seconds for questions or comments.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I would have a question to ask the hon. member on the subject of 
democracy. I would like to know if he can comment on this quote 
from page 181 of the book <I>Straight from the Heart</I>: ``The voice 
of Chief Justice Bora Laskin wasn't the only thing that wasn't 
clear; the majority judgment itself seemed rather ambiguous. It 
stated that the unilateral action of the federal government was 
legal but offensive to the traditional convention of getting 
provincial consent for constitutional amendments.'' Did my 
hon. colleague participate in that action?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member has 
just 15 seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, I think that the hon. member 
is confusing apples and oranges.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>No, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> It is simple. Why do you not have the courage 
to ask the question? Ask the question!
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
want to inform the House that members of the government will 
divide their speaking time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am rising today to speak to the following Bloc motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House enjoin the government to recognize the legitimacy of the 
democratic process initiated by the Government of Quebec in order to allow 
Quebecers to chart their own political and constitutional future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In so doing, let me be clear that I will be opposing the motion 
as I believe will be every member of the Reform Party. The 
motion is truly a test of our commitment to federalism in the 
most fundamental sense.
<P>
	The motion talks about a democratic process. Is this a 
democratic process? The hon. member for Calgary Southwest, 
the leader of the Reform Party, has spoken on this point earlier. I 
will repeat some of his points but let me be emphatic in saying it 
is essential to say those things.
<P>
	We are talking about a referendum. That is democratic. 
Before a referendum the bill proclaiming sovereignty or laying 
out sovereignty will be passed. It will be passed by a 
government elected by a separatist minority. It will be 
developed in stages which predefine a separatist outcome in a 
process completely dominated by separatists and restricted by 
separatist 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8817"> 8817 </A></B>
<P>
options. The  question to be asked will be lengthy. It concerns a 
whole bill. It will contain ambiguities and outright falsehoods.
<P>
	The PQ government running this process has a very clear 
interpretation of the results. A yes counts; it is binding. As the 
leader of the Reform Party said, it is binding on those large 
unresolved items in the question. A no does not count. A no 
means we will just try again-some democracy.
<P>
	The key of legitimacy is whether something is legal. This 
assumes that only the Quebec assembly, for this particular bill 
we are discussing, has sole jurisdictions in areas where it clearly 
does not. Articles 1, 10 and 13 reserve all powers now part of the 
Canadian state that require the consent of this Parliament to 
change and in many cases provincial legislatures strictly to the 
Government of Quebec.
<P>
	Article 4 would allow the province to alter boundaries. It says 
it is not altering boundaries but it is a significant alteration to 
declare interprovincial boundaries to be international 
boundaries. Under our constitutional law that is a significant 
alteration.
<P>
	Article 5 would authorize the Government of Quebec to pass 
laws regarding the use of Canadian citizenship.
<P>
	Articles 7, 8 and 9 authorize the ascension of Quebec to 
Canadian interests and Canadian treaties, which are not just the 
business of this Parliament but also of our treaty partners, our 
internationally recognized fellow nations.
<P>
	Article 11 authorizes the Government of Quebec to pay 
pension plans which are clearly under the jurisdiction of this 
Parliament and the Constitution, in some cases constitutional 
amendments that have been arrived at unanimously.
<P>
	Article 12 would strip the Supreme Court of Canada and all 
other Canadian courts of their judicial authority to hear cases 
related to law. Article 16 would bypass all the legal amending 
procedures of the Constitution of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When I talk about legitimacy, I must say that, in my life, 
legitimacy has two parts: a political project and a political 
relationship. The first element is the democratic process, which 
is mentioned in today's motion. It is not a true democratic 
process, but there will be a vote, and the result of a vote cannot 
be ignored. I think this is important.
<P>
	It will be a historic vote, and I hope it will be the beginning of 
an irreversible process if the result is yes or, more likely, no.
<P>
	Legitimacy is made up of two other elements which are not 
mentioned in this motion. First, the interests of others in the 
political project or relationship. Their economic, fiscal, 
political, constitutional, social and international interests, as 
well as their preferences. This does not only apply outside 
Quebec. There are also the interests of foreign countries, of the 
Parliament of Canada, of other provinces and even those of hard 
core federalists in Quebec, in short, anyone who has the right to 
stay in Canada.
<P>
	Second, and perhaps more important, there are the rights 
established by existing political and legal relationships, such as 
the treaties, laws, constitutions and powers of other 
governments here in Canada and in other countries. Our words 
should not be misinterpreted. It is not merely a wish, it is more 
than that. It is the duty of the Parliament of Canada, of the 
members of this House, whether they represent the Reform 
Party or another federalist party, to protect the interests and the 
legal rights of Canadians. Rights that are recognized by the 
international community, legal and necessary rights that all 
Canadians enjoy, in Quebec as in all other provinces.
<P>
	The legitimacy of a unilateral process like the one proposed 
by the Parti Quebecois in Quebec cannot be recognized. I am not 
a Quebecer nor do I pretend to be one, but if I were, I would be 
proud to be a Quebecer, proud of my history, of my language and 
of my society, just as I am proud to be an Albertan. It is a choice I 
have made, not only as my province of residence, but also as a 
way of life, a vision.
<P>
	I can understand Quebec's nationalistic policy which, like all 
nationalistic policies, has to lead to independence. I can 
understand this feeling, but I cannot share it.
<P>
	We have to recognize that, in today's world, nationalism has 
its obligations just as it has its dreams. No group, no continent, 
no country, nobody can ignore the legitimate interests of others, 
but that is what the Parti Quebecois and its allies from the Bloc 
want to do.
<P>
	This is nothing to be proud of. I think it is a shame and I 
sincerely hope for the benefit of Canada that the vast majority of 
Quebecers will recognize the irresponsible and dangerous 
nature of the unilateral process proposed by the government of 
Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened very intently to the member's dissertation. I am 
surprised in some real ways that the Reform Party has in a sense 
fallen into the trap of discussing a hypothetical case of the 
separation of the province of Quebec. What I do believe we 
should be doing is not being part of that program. What I would 
like to ask the member concerns some real issues that do occur 
and exist today in the province of Quebec.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8818"> 8818 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Quebec has a massive per capita debt, a provincially 
formulated debt of over $9,400 for every man, woman and child 
in that province. Quebec's deficit is financed 40 per cent outside 
not only its borders but also the borders of Canada. Could the 
member reflect on what this debate is going to do and what it is 
going to cost the people of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
say a couple of things relative to that.
<P>
	First, obviously this debate and the economic uncertainty that 
all this will cause will probably lead to no change whatsoever 
and is already costing us a great deal. It will cost Quebecers in 
terms of their bonds which already have a tremendous risk 
premium on the international market as well as the bonds of 
Canada which are affected indirectly. All of this uncertainty has 
cost us.
<P>
	We know the cost it has caused Quebec over the past 
generation. When I was a boy, and it was not that long ago, 
Montreal was the major city in Canada. Today that is not true; it 
is Toronto. A lot of that is thanks to these developments that 
have occurred in the province of Quebec and this particular 
separatist debate.
<P>
	I should be clear that in no way excuses the lack of action on 
the fiscal situation at the federal level. That is just as serious for 
Quebecers and for other Canadians and has also impacted 
negatively on the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	Second, the member says that we are raising hypothetical 
scenarios. My speech and the speech of the leader of the Reform 
Party today were not on the hypothetical issues of separation, 
but on the real issue of the separatist process that is now under 
way in Quebec and which is the subject of this motion.
<P>
	One cannot ignore the sentiments that exist in Quebec or 
ignore the process that is actually under way. That process is 
extremely dangerous and misleading. It affects the vital 
interests of this Parliament that is the responsibility of not only 
all members here but our responsibility to Canadians. We should 
be defending those interests much more than we are doing and 
defending the legal rights of the people we represent to not see 
this kind of a process go ahead without our participation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first of all, I would like to know, even though we cannot put a 
question to the previous speaker rather than to the hon. member 
for Calgary West, first, what is the national debt per capita, and 
second, what percentage of that debt is in foreign hands? He will 
surely have an opportunity to answer those questions when he 
speaks next.
<P>
	Instead, I will direct my question to the hon. member for 
Calgary West, whom I congratulate for his French and for his 
relatively good understanding of the position of Quebec up till 
now. For my part, I do understand his position. He speaks 
clearly.
<P>
	However, when the Liberal members or the Reform members 
talk about the legitimacy of the process initiated, I would tell 
you that in a democratic system, everyone can legitimately 
consult everyone else and have his say. Our draft bill will only 
be accepted once a referendum, where everybody in Quebec will 
have the opportunity to vote for or against it, has been held.
<P>
	As far as legitimacy is concerned, I would like to remind my 
hon. colleague of a few processes that we have witnessed in this 
House and that were not exactly models of legitimacy. When the 
current Prime Minister of Canada was Minister of Justice and 
was taking an active part in the unilateral patriation of the 
Constitution, he said, and I quote from <I>Le Droit</I> of November 2, 
1981: ``The intent of my government is to move ahead with the 
patriation of the Constitution; and even if there is no agreement 
with the provinces, we will do it''. Even without an agreement 
with the provinces: talk about a model of democracy!
<P>
	Moreover, I recall that the Supreme Court had ruled that, all in 
all, this was legal but unconstitutional. So, I would like to ask 
the hon. member for Calgary West what he really thinks about it. 
Does he really believe it is undemocratic, in a so-called 
democratic system, to consult people about a social vision? I 
remind him that the majority of the members from Quebec in the 
House of Commons are sovereignists and the majority of 
members in the Quebec National Assembly are sovereignists, 
and people know it.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, my answer is 
that we have to consult the people of Quebec, federalists as well 
as sovereignists, and people from outside Quebec too, I think. 
But we must have a real consultation process where the result is 
not predetermined and where all the available options are 
discussed. That is not the case in this process.
<P>
	I would also like to talk about the repatriation of the 
Constitution in 1981. Someone said today that that process was 
undemocratic. Clearly, we do not have enough democracy in 
Canada today. Every day, Reformers call for direct democracy 
mechanisms. It is a necessity. However, under the law, the 
Supreme Court decided that patriation was legitimate. This 
question was put to the Supreme Court. Obviously, it would not 
have been legal or constitutional to decide to ignore all the 
provinces. But, in effect, a strong majority of provinces and 
their legislatures supported that constitutional amendment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8819"> 8819 </A></B>
<P>
	A government here, dominated by Quebec and the Prime 
Minister from Quebec decided to adopt that Constitution. 
Indeed, Quebec did not have a veto then, and still does not have 
one. And why not? We know why. It is because Mr. Lévesque, 
before the decision, had renounced his veto in an accord signed 
with the other provinces. This explains the process by which 
the Constitution was adopted in 1981.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to make a comment. The reason we have a consultation 
process is that we want to avoid being blamed for not consulting. 
Had we asked Quebecers whether they want sovereignty without 
telling them what it means, we would have been blamed because 
we had presented an option without spelling out its meaning. In 
order to avoid being blamed, and rightly so, for such action, the 
Quebec government decided to explain its proposal, and to give 
the people an opportunity to amend it. Once people know what 
they are voting for, they will decide through a democratic 
referendum whether they are ready to take one last step and say 
yes to Quebec sovereignty, with full knowledge of the facts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, on this issue, I 
am in full agreement with the Prime Minister and my leader. The 
question that should be asked of Quebecers is this: ``Do you 
want Quebec to separate from Canada?'' There are two aspects 
to that question. The first one is the desire to separate. But a 
desire is just that, a desire. All details would have to be 
negotiated afterwards. You cannot table a bill setting forth these 
details in the National Assembly, because it is outside its 
constitutional jurisdiction. The second aspect is separation. We 
know why the P.Q. government prefers the word sovereignty. 
We have seen the polls. To Quebecers, sovereignty appears less 
dangerous, less clearly defined. That is why that word is used 
instead of the real one.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I begin by saying how extremely disappointed 
I am with my friends in the Parti Quebecois government in 
Quebec and their Bloc Quebec allies here in Ottawa. I say 
friends because while I disagree with their main political option, 
I have always respected them as reasonable and honest men and 
women.
<P>
	I expected the Parti Quebecois government would proceed 
with the referendum on independence but certainly not in this 
undemocratic manner. Both the proposal that was announced in 
the Quebec National Assembly the other day and the process are 
contrary to the democratic principles usually followed not only 
in Quebec and in Canada but throughout the western world.
<P>
	The process and the proposition are undemocratic on four 
grounds. First, the law is being tabled and passed first and then 
the consultation comes afterward. In other words they are 
putting the cart before the horse. That is  certainly not what is 
usually done. It is not what we did in this Parliament when 
amending the law on the goods and services tax. We 
commissioned a committee which held wide ranging hearings, 
travelled the country and collected views. Now the government 
is preparing a law.
<P>
	We are doing the same thing with the reform of our social 
security laws. We did the same thing with respect to defence and 
external affairs. Very important changes are being made to our 
policies and our laws but first we consult and bring in the law 
afterward.
<P>
	Second, the Parti Quebecois government did not get a 
mandate from the electorate of Quebec in the last election to put 
forward such a law. It only got approximately 44 per cent of the 
vote and many of those who voted for the Parti Quebecois voted 
for them in order to have a change of government.
<P>
	There are two principal parties in Quebec: the provincial 
Liberal Party and the Parti Quebecois. Many people were 
dissatisfied with the Liberal Party and voted for the Parti 
Quebecois for a better way of governing. That was the slogan 
that was on the signs: ``For a better way of governing'', to deal 
with economic and social problems.
<P>
	Even among the 44 per cent that did vote for the Parti 
Quebecois many voted for a better way of government and not 
for the law that was tabled in the National Assembly the other 
day. It is true that during the election campaign Mr. Parizeau 
spoke about a referendum but he certainly did not speak of a 
referendum that would be preceded by a unilateral declaration of 
independence.
<P>
	Third, in discussing the non-democratic nature of these 
proposals, the regional commissions that the Quebec 
government intends to set up are loaded in favour of the law and 
the principles behind the law. The premier of Quebec has invited 
MNAs from the Quebec National Assembly and members of 
Parliament to participate in the commissions. Added to those 
commissions will be other members who will be appointed by 
the Government of Quebec and favourable to its position. The 
chairs of those regional commissions will be persons who will 
not be elected members of Parliament or MNAs but, and I am 
referring to the words of Mr. Parizeau: ``will be people who will 
be able to build consensus'' toward the proposal that he tabled in 
the assembly.
<P>
	In other words the goal of the chair or those regional 
commissions will be to build consensus toward the principle of a 
unilaterally independent state of Quebec.
<P>
	The dice are loaded with respect to those regional 
commissions. They are undemocratic. That is why many groups, 
not just political parties, will not participate in the regional 
commissions. Their goal is simply to improve on, to build on, 
what has already been tabled in the Quebec National Assembly 
as a draft bill.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8820"> 8820 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	Fourth, the process is dishonest and misleading because it 
pretends to keep the best of both Canada and Quebec. It is a bit 
like the sovereignty association question in the last referendum 
in the early 1980s. For example, the draft bill provides for 
economic union with Canada, for keeping Canadian citizenship, 
for keeping the Canadian dollar, for maintaining Quebec's 
position in NAFTA and in NATO, for maintaining Canadian 
pensions and for maintaining the same territory which Quebec 
now has, but which it did not have at the time of Confederation.
<P>
	It is a sort of having one's cake and eating it too, getting out of 
Canada but remaining in Canada. On those grounds as well the 
process is undemocratic, confusing and misleading for the 
ordinary voter and the ordinary citizen of Quebec.
<P>
	The opening clause of the draft constitution states that 
Quebec is a sovereign country. That is a universal declaration of 
independence in the sense that it refers to an entire country. It is 
misleading for the people of Quebec because all provinces are 
now sovereign in provincial areas of jurisdiction. It was decided 
by the Privy Council many years ago that all provinces were 
sovereign in their areas of jurisdiction just as the federal 
government is sovereign in its area of jurisdiction.
<P>
	I want to say a few words about the legality of this process. 
There is no provision in either the Constitution of 1867 or the 
Constitution of 1982 for any province to secede unilaterally. No 
province has that right legally. They no more have that right than 
would the federal government have the right to expel 
unilaterally a province from Canada.
<P>
	Can one imagine if we passed a law in this Parliament and 
confirmed by the Senate to throw Quebec out or Prince Edward 
Island or British Columbia out, without going through the 
process of our amending formula. It would be considered 
outrageous if we even attempted to do that. Even if the federal 
government should try to do it with the support of a few other 
provinces it is unacceptable.
<P>
	It is unacceptable that any province should leave unilaterally 
without the agreement of the other provinces because we have 
come to share so much together. If it requires an amendment of 
the Constitution to transfer a number of powers from the federal 
government to a provincial government-let us say to transfer 
manpower training or pensions or unemployment insurance or 
other things-then certainly it requires amendments to transfer 
all of the powers.
<P>
	There are various views on this, but I would say at the very 
most for a province to secede it would require the amending 
formula which states that you need seven out of ten provinces, 
representing 50 per cent of the population in order to make such 
an extreme amendment to the Constitution. But at the very least, 
it would  require the consent of the province in question and of 
the federal Parliament.
<P>
	Some people would say that we should not talk about the 
legalities of secession, we should talk about the politics of it. 
Even politically and morally, the present government of Quebec 
has no political or moral mandate to introduce and pass the type 
of law which they tabled in the National Assembly the other day. 
They got only a little over 44 per cent of the vote and even then 
all those who voted for them did not support that option.
<P>
	I understand my time is up. I had much more to say on this 
subject. However, we should reject this motion before the House 
today. We should certainly reject the bill that is in the Quebec 
National Assembly at the present time.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I would recommend again to my friends, whom I respect, that 
they go back to the drawing boards and come up with something 
that is more suitable, in accordance with our democratic process 
and then we can all decide it in a proper way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak in 
this debate. In fact, I would urge all my constituents in 
Québec-Est, the riding I represent, to take part in the 
consultation process initiated by the Government of Quebec 
which, I would like to point out to the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, is an entirely democratic process.
<P>
	I think we can say that never in Quebec's history has there 
been a more democratic and more open process to consult 
Quebecers to find out what they really want. I must say I do not 
appreciate the use of the word ``immoral'' by the hon. member 
for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce in referring to the process initiated 
by the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>He should talk about the War Measures Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand: </B>To imply that this is immoral is an insult to 
the intelligence of the members of this House.
<P>
	What is immoral about wanting to consult and wanting to 
know what Quebecers want, what is wanted by people who have 
been deceived and whose rights have been violated for over a 
century? How can the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce 
say that this process has no legitimacy or is unlawful, when this 
Parliament has for years violated its own Constitution? It has 
shown no respect for its own Constitution or for the rights of the 
provinces.
<P>
	The trouble with Canada was that the federal government 
failed to respect the rights of the provinces. If at the federal level 
in Ottawa, we had at least respected our own Constitution, 
perhaps we would not have the problems we have today, and I 
am referring to this failure to respect the rights of the provinces 
and the  rights of francophones outside Quebec. Did anyone 
mention this? Can anyone in this House say that their rights have 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8821"> 8821 </A></B>
<P>
not been violated by this Constitution? What about the lack of 
political will on the part of the federal Liberals, which has been 
going on for some time, to make Canada's provinces abide by 
the Constitution?
<P>
	What I find particularly galling is that the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, who is a member from Quebec, did not 
say a single word in French in his speech. Is it too much to 
expect of a member of Parliament for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce to 
speak French when dealing with a matter of such importance, 
and I am referring to the sovereignty of Quebec?
<P>
	I also want to say it is unrealistic to consider a third option, as 
the Reform Party did earlier, it is unrealistic to consider a third 
option when we realize that since 1980, every possible avenue 
has been explored to find an alternative to sovereignty and all 
attempts in this respect have been unsuccessful.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, I believe that you have about a 
minute left. You may continue after Question Period, if you 
wish.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will have an opportunity to 
respond to that question?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Yes, you will have an opportunity to respond to 
the question after question period. As it is now two o'clock, 
pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to 
statements by members pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last week I had the pleasure of joining the hon. Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration at a special citizenship and 
reaffirmation ceremony presided over by Dr. John Brooks, a 
member of the Order of Canada.
<P>
	I congratulate the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration, the Queen Victoria Public School Children's 
Choir and all the volunteers for putting on such a splendid, 
well-organized event.
<P>
	As I was congratulating the new citizens, one individual 
thanked me for coming and whispered to me: ``God bless 
Canada and please do whatever you can to keep it together''.
<P>
	I was deeply moved by his words. As the son of an immigrant I 
would like today to echo his words in this honourable House. 
God bless Canada. I would also like to assure this new Canadian

Quebec sovereignty issue is again at the centre of debate.
<P>
	In the 1980 referendum campaign, Prime Minister Trudeau

federalism. We know the rest: exclusion of Quebec from the 
Canadian Constitution, failure of Meech Lake, failure of 
Charlottetown.
<P>
	This time, federalist leaders promise a ``flexible federalism'', 
at the same time we learn that the federal government refuses to 
pay $282 million in transfer payments owed to the Quebec 
Treasury.
<P>
	The rest of Canada no longer wants to hear about the 
legitimate demands of Quebec. As for Quebecers, they have had 
enough of the status quo. The positions are clear. Why the false 
pretences? Quebecers will soon have to choose between 
sovereignty and fossilized federalism. We are confident of the 
outcome.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute an industry which has risen 
from the ashes to become a world leader. I refer to the 
Okanagan's flourishing wine industry. Today any respectable

Wines, Sumac Ridge, Lang Vinyards, Wild Goose Vinyards and 
Gehringer Brothers. All have won an impressive collection of 
international medals for their wines. Many of these wines have 
been judged the best in the world at competitions such as the 
Intervin International in New York and the International Wine 
and Spirit Competition held in London, England.
<P>
	In the south Okanagan estate wineries floundered with 
government subsidies but have flourished without government 
subsidies and government interference. Free enterprise and 
competition nurtures excellence. There is an important lesson in

<P>
	In the Quinte area Jack was a longstanding public figure with 
a tremendous record of success. Following his retirement as 
member of Parliament for Prince Edward-Hastings he 
continued to work tirelessly on some of his favourite community 
oriented projects and was always a strong voice representing the 
interests of a region.

<P>
	Canadians have told this justice minister many times that a

<P>
	Currently of the $5 billion collected as federal fuel tax only 
about 10 per cent of the revenue is invested in the Canadian 
highway system. This is simply not enough. More than a third of 
the 24,000 kilometre national highway system in Canada does 
not meet minimum standards. Ensuring that the national 
highway system meets the standards established by the Minister 
of Transport would result in the creation of 200,000 direct 
construction jobs as well as a number of secondary benefits for 
those industries which rely on the road system like tourism and 
transportation.
<P>

	Not only will there be economic advantages, I believe the 
revitalization of our transportation infrastructure will also 
result in reduced highway fatalities, loss and damage to

operating costs not only in my riding but in ridings across the

yesterday, in the same disarray as the speakers for the federalist

<P>
<HR>

<P>
the Prime Minister tried to minimize the consultation process 
announced by the Government of Quebec and at the same time 
confirmed that he did not intend to participate in it. He also 
mentioned the  possibility of the federal government holding a 
Canada-wide referendum on Quebec's constitutional future.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Does he admit that 
holding a Canada-wide referendum on Quebec's constitutional 
future means denying Quebecers the right to decide their own 
future for themselves?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we want only one thing: a referendum as soon as 
possible in Quebec, under Quebec's Referendum Act, where 
they will not play tricks but be honest with the people and ask 
Quebecers whether or not they want to separate from Canada.
<P>
	If they do that, we will solve the problem quickly and no 
longer hear about it. I hope that instead of the unnecessary 
complications which the Bloc members are now raising, we will 
take the question seriously and stop talking about the 
Constitution and separation and all work together on creating 
jobs and economic growth, which is what Quebecers want above 
all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
does the Prime Minister reconcile what his Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs said about the possibility of flexible 
federalism with his own statement refusing any constitutional 
reform?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not very complicated. Right now, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development is making a fundamental 
reform in Canada without changing the Constitution. That is 
what we want: fundamental reforms.
<P>
	Enough time has been wasted consulting people for years. We 
wasted seven years discussing constitutional changes and ended 
up with exactly the same situation and the federal system we 
have today. It was wonderful to see Mr. Parizeau say in his 
statement how we have advanced in Canada. He was talking 
about the progress Quebec made within the Canadian federation. 
Why change that? If we could do so well, we will continue to do 
even better by remaining in the best country in the world, 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
everyone will have understood what the Prime Minister means 
by flexible federalism: the provinces bend and the federal 
government invades their jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister be indignant and get all hot under 
the collar about the $2 million which Quebec will spend on 
consulting its citizens when his own government is getting ready 
to spend $35 million on tourism advertising to promote his 
beautiful Canada, $7 million more for promoting Canadian 
unity and $6 million more for the Privy Council and its federal 
strategy on the referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what is absolutely outrageous in the Parti Quebecois's 
proposal now is that they want to create 15 ``yes'' committees 
financed by the state. They proposed having 15 committee 
members, of whom 13 would be appointed by the party in power 
and two by the opposition parties. Since they are not confident in 
their cause, they want the PQ campaign to promote their cause in 
their ridings to be paid for by the taxpayers of Quebec.
<P>
	We will go to Quebec and make speeches and it will not be 
paid for by the taxpayers of Canada. We will tell Quebecers that 
we do not want trickery; we want the truth, a clear, short, 
unambiguous question: Do you, in Quebec, want to separate 
from Canada, yes or no? It is as simple as that.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after wasting one year in the fight against the deficit, 
the Liberals now propose, in a report to the Minister of Finance, 
to increase the tax burden of all taxpayers by imposing a 
temporary surtax which could bring in over one billion dollars, 
to be used to reduce the deficit. By the way, the last temporary 
tax was the income tax of 1914, which has now been in effect for 
80 years.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister pledge to reject the proposal made by 
his members to impose a surtax which would be in direct 
contradiction with his own election promise not to increase the 
tax burden of Canadians during the first two years of his 
mandate?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the committee travelled across the country. It then 
made recommendations to the Minister of Finance who will 
review them. When the minister tables his budget in February, 
we will see which of these recommendations he intends to 
follow. The remarkable thing about the Bloc members who sat 
on that committee is that they could not make a single specific 
recommendation. They shied away from their responsibility to 
make decisions and recommendations. They speak eloquently, 
but they do not have the courage to take a clear stand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, not only does the Minister of Finance not read his 
letters before signing them, but the Prime Minister does not read 
the documents tabled by the Official Opposition. If he did, he 
would know that we made ten specific proposals to implement 
real streamlining and saving measures to improve the 
government's finances. I am not talking about measures which 
would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8826"> 8826 </A></B>
<P>
hurt the unemployed and the poor, but about real saving and 
streamlining initiatives.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister, or his government, consider 
imposing such a surtax on Canadians who honestly pay their 
taxes, when this government has yet to act, or even show the 
political will to recover over $6 billion dollars in unpaid taxes 
from the wealthiest Canadians? Is this his definition of justice? 
Is this his definition of fairness?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

GDP by the end of the third year of our mandate and we will do 
it.

program. It is well documented, it will be met and it will be

Speaker, the federal government's reaction to Premier 
Parizeau's draft bill on Quebec sovereignty has been unfocused 
and even confusing.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is quoted as saying his strategy is to win 
the referendum battle but he does not say which referendum, 
having dismissed Mr. Parizeau's referendum plan. The 
government seems very reluctant to comment on the illegality or 
legality of what is proposed or to point out specific flaws in the 
Parizeau plan.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	Section 5 of the draft sovereignty bill states Quebec 
citizenship may be held concurrently with citizenship of Canada 
or any other country.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister accept this position, yes or no? If he 
does not, why does he not say so?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition has not listened to me a lot 
over the years. I have always said that they cannot impose a 
situation unilaterally. Citizenship of Canada will be determined 
by the Parliament of Canada not by the Parliament of Quebec.
<P>
	Mr. Parizeau's proposition is funny. He wants to keep all the 
good things that Canada has provided for Quebec. Quebec 
should stay in Canada. That is my answer. I am from Quebec and 
whenever I travel around Canada I am comfortable in every part 
of the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the Prime Minister's answer. We had 
trouble getting that type of answer yesterday and the day before.
<P>
	The Quebec government has also stated that in the event of a 
vote for sovereignty in the upcoming referendum, an economic 
association with Canada would be maintained. Again, the 
statement is completely presumptuous, without regard for the 
position which the government and the people of Canada might 
take on such an association.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister concur with the position that an 
automatic economic association between Canada and a separate 
Quebec should be assumed? If he does not, why does he not say 
so?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not a big problem. It is evident that the people and 
the Government of Canada will decide. For example, the PQ 
wants to keep the Canadian currency. Monetary policies will be 
decided by this Parliament and it will have absolutely no voice. 
Nobody will be able to get up here and ask the Minister of 
Finance what is right or wrong with the monetary policies of 
Canada.
<P>
	Of course certain countries have used the currency of other 
countries. Not long ago I discussed that with some French 
African countries that depend on the franc. When Paris decided 
to lower the value of the franc used in Africa, it had nothing to 
say, it just paid the price.
<P>

``Do you want to separate, yes or no?''. To play games like that

Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party caucus and indeed all Canadians 
welcome the good news of the release of the 55 Canadian 
hostages held by the Bosnian Serbs. Yesterday the French 
foreign minister called for a withdrawal of its peacekeepers in 
Bosnia. This only makes public the growing realization that this 
is a political, not a military problem and that peacekeepers 
cannot do their job in the current environment.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Now that Canadians 
have been released, will the government align with France's 
position and use this opportunity to withdraw our troops?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like to pay tribute to the soldiers who 
acted with calm and courage. They know they are involved in an 
extremely important mission which is to help the poor civilians 
who are trapped in this terrible situation by providing them with 
food, medication and so on.
<P>
	I was at a discussion in Budapest. The situation is very bad. 
The President of Bosnia was pleading with me to try to keep our 
troops there because they are considered the best. Canada has no 
political interest in the area. I said to him that our interest was 
not political, that our interest was in peace and to help the 
civilian population.
<P>
	We have a mandate until the month of February. In January 
cabinet will review that. I would like to point out that we had 
debates in this House of Commons. Members of the House were 
consulted and the great majority were in agreement that we 
should be there to help the civilian population. We will review 
the situation in January. Of course not only Canada has troops 
there. There are others and we have to consult them too.
<P>
	I have to say again that we are all very proud of the way the 
Canadian soldiers behaved. I was delighted to hear the President 
of Bosnia tell me that the Canadians are the best there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in reaction to the French government's call for a

said: ``Probably they want to reassure their own people''. Those 
are the Prime Minister's words.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister: Does this government wish to 
reassure Canadians now that the hostages are free by moving to 
withdraw our troops?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said that it is very important for everyone to plan to 
make sure that if there is a situation, for example the lifting of 
the embargo, we said we were to go. If there were to be some 
other disastrous situation we have to have a plan ready to make 
sure our troops can be evacuated. We have been working on that 
for many months.
<P>
	We have been in contact too with NATO and the UN to make 
sure the plans are ready if evacuation is needed. I hope it will not 
be needed, but it is very good to do the planning now in case we

<P>
	The MIL Davie shipyard, the only other bidder for an 
important Hibernia contract, has clearly been wronged by the 
Hibernia consortium's decision to award the contract to Saint 
John Shipbuilding without a call for tenders. The 
Canada-Newfoundland Board, the Minister of Natural

Hibernia consortium has itself ignored the Prime Minister's

yesterday. The people who had been awarded the first contract 
lost it for productivity reasons.
<P>
	I think the company should not have acted in this way. I have 
said it clearly, but since we own only 8.5 per cent of the

ACOA will be involved in providing venture capital to

to everyone that taxpayers' dollars will be spent foolishly 
through a political body?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was anticipating

release he made the ridiculous suggestion that a linkage may 
exist between a third party contribution to Liberal election 
campaigns and the receipt of ACOA assistance. I want to say to 
the hon. member that is patently false. I hope he will do the 
honourable thing and apologize to the minister of fisheries and 
myself when he joins his feet in a moment.
<P>
	With regard to the question he has asked, the Atlantic venture 
capital fund we are proposing is to be done in co-operation with 
provincial governments as well as the private sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
am I supposed to join my feet now?
<P>
	I do not think this government gets it. In 1992-93 alone 
ACOA wrote off over $50 million in bad debts. When will these 
Liberals learn that governments know very little if nothing 
about running business? Does the minister know the difference 
between a grant and a loan that is not repaid at taxpayers' 
expense? If these loans are all going to be repaid, why not let 
FBDB or the banks fill the role? Why do we need two 
government agencies to provide the exercise?

anticipating an apology because of the assertions that the hon.

<P>
	The House should be aware that the reference to the minister 
of fisheries and myself is patently false. The House should know 
that when the chief of staff of the office of the leader of the

contributor not one, not two, but $8,000 from Clearwater Fine 
Foods. That particular company received financial assistance 
from ACOA both before and after the election.

customs brokerage 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8830"> 8830 </A></B>
<P>
firms. They will require surety bonds of up to $10 million for the 
goods they clear through customs.
<P>
	Given the very negative impact of that decision on the 
existence of small customs brokers, does the Minister of 
National Revenue intend to answer their demands in the near 
future?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the problem relating to the failure of these 
customs agents to which the hon. member referred is a serious 
one because the moneys they take in which are due to the 
Government of Canada is lost in many cases when the 
companies go bankrupt.
<P>
	In addition, there are some major problems with respect to the 
amount of capitalization that some of these companies have. 
This means that assets are very few and slight even though the 
individual who may own the company may have other assets of 
considerable worth.
<P>
	We have therefore instituted, in co-operation with the 
Association of Customs Brokers, a new scheme to provide 
adequate insurance for those who might be faced with financial 
difficulties. This scheme has been accepted by the association 
and accepted by the department. I believe it is a beneficial 
scheme to make sure that the problems that arise, in particular 
for the customers of customs brokers, will not reoccur in the 
future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister knows very well that members of that association, 
including the large American companies, have the right to one 
vote for each office they operate in different districts. 
Therefore, the process is totally undemocratic.
<P>
	Does the Minister of National Revenue recognize that if the 
proposed regulations were to be implemented in their present 
form, it could force several small independent customs brokers 
out of business and that would mean several thousand jobs lost 
for Canadians?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue,

respect to insurance provisions it is always possible that some 
people will be in such financial position that they will be unable 
to obtain insurance, whether through their association or outside 
it. That is a possibility.
<P>
	However, I would assure the hon. member that the system put 
in place was developed by the customs brokers. We are 
attempting to assist so that there will be some self-regulation 
and self-policing in the customs brokerage industry. Therefore 
the risks to the public of Canada and in particular the risks to the

	My supplemental is for the Minister of Natural Resources. 
During this four-year nightmare for the Curtis' Petro-Canada 
has treated the family like criminals. When the spill occurred in 
1990, Petro-Canada was a crown corporation and is now a 
company in which the government owns over 70 per cent of the 
shares.
<P>
	Does the minister condone the bullying manner of 
Petro-Canada and will she intervene on the Curtis' behalf to 
ensure Petro-Canada is financially responsible for the 
additional medical treatment and care required for the Curtis' 
daughter?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not condone bullying, if that is what 
happened in this case. I do not know whether that is the case, but 
I assure the hon. member that I will take this matter under 
advisement. I will investigate it and report back to him and this 
House.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister who tomorrow 
will be attending the Latin American summit in Miami.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister if he will assure the House 
that at the summit he will raise two specific issues. First, will he 
raise the issue of the exclusion of Cuba from the summit and the 
continued illegal and immoral blockade by the United States of 
that country.
<P>
	Second, given the very critical situation is Chiapas, Mexico 
will the Prime Minister urge at the summit an open dialogue and 
a peaceful, negotiated, non-military settlement in Chiapas?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on the question of Mexico we have already mentioned 
many times to the authorities there that we want them to 
negotiate a settlement with the people of that province. I am 
informed that the dialogue is going better than it was some 
months ago. But I will press the issue with the newly elected 
president if I have the occasion.
<P>
	As far as Mr. Castro and Cuba not being present are 
concerned, we would have had no problem seeing him there. It 
was decided that he was not to be invited and I was not the one 
inviting people to that summit.

	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of 
immigration.
<P>
	The minister of immigration recently announced that it was 
the intention of the minister to increase the number of business 
class immigrants coming from India.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	My concern is that according to a story in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, 
this increase will come from around Bombay and will not 
include areas such as Punjab. This situation is of grave concern 
to the many constituents in my riding of Indian descent. What is 
the basis for the new business immigration strategy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to the 
immigration plan that this government tabled on November 1, 
two key operative measures describe our business immigration: 
first, to promote it aggressively in a balanced way across the 
globe; second, to diversify. Seventy-five per cent of all business 
immigration comes from Asia and we think that is good, 
evidenced by the recent trip by the Prime Minister and a 
Canadian delegation.
<P>
	However, we would also like to diversify in other areas of the 
world that would like to take advantage of the business 
immigration program. We identified such examples as western 
Europe, eastern Europe and the Middle East.
<P>
	With respect to India, we all know that the majority of 
immigrants are coming from the Punjab through the New Delhi 
office. Other countries of the world are also in southern India.
<P>
	It is not a question of simply excluding individuals, it is also 
being present in southern Indian where I think the recent trip of 
the minister of trade showed that Canada could reap some 
tremendous economic benefits and also continue to have the 
programs through New Delhi servicing Indians who wish to 
make Canada their home.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to reply to the member for Québec-Est 
who questioned my remarks just before Question Period.
<P>
	The hon. member said that he and the Quebecois people were 
insulted by my remarks which attacked the Parizeau proposals 
as undemocratic.
<P>
	I want to make it very clear that I made no attack on the people 
of Quebec, whom I respect. My remarks were directed at the 
Government of Quebec and the Bloc Quebecois. Neither the 
Parti Quebecois nor the Bloc Quebecois is one and the same as 
the people of Quebec, although sometimes those members 
believe they are.
<P>
	I said that the Parizeau proposals were not democratic 
because first, they were putting the law on independence before 
the National Assembly first and they were going to consult and 
have the referendum afterward. Second, they had no mandate 
from the electorate because they only received 44 per cent of the 
vote.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	Third, their regional commissions were structured to favour 
the independence option and were not neutral. Fourth, the 
proposals were fuzzed, unclear and misleading.
<P>
	As to my use of French in this House, when I speak in 
Parliament I usually use my mother tongue which is English, 
which is my right.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When I talk with my constituents, I use their language, 
whether French or English, and that is my right also.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order! We were of 
the opinion that the hon. member had a minute left when he was 
interrupted for question period. At that time, the Bloc Quebecois 
member had the floor and the Chair said he would let him finish 
and allow an answer from the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. But you went directly to the answer, 
without giving the minute to our party.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The clerk will correct 
me if I am wrong, but I had understood that there was one minute 
left for the answer of the government member. I will give the 
minute left to the hon. member for Québec-Est.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to go back to what I 
said earlier about the statement made by the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce because I find it insulting for all 
members of this House when he says the Quebec referendum 
was unethical.
<P>
	How can he, who was a member of the Trudeau cabinet, say 
that a process such as this one was unethical? In 1980, Mr. 
Trudeau came to the Paul Sauvé Arena and promised Quebecers 
he would amend the Constitution. Then he deceived Quebec by 
limiting its powers and creating the problems we have now.
<P>
	Not only that, and I will conclude with this, the hon. member 
was also part of the Trudeau cabinet in 1970 when-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Madam Speaker, not only was I not in the 
Trudeau cabinet at that time, but I voted against the Constitution 
of 1982.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am sure that many Canadians watching the events of the past two 
days must be experiencing a deep and visceral reaction as the 
new Government of Quebec and its separatist allies in this 
Chamber finally launched their desperate push to realize their 
dreams and tear Quebec out of Canada.
<P>
	Some Canadians must be feeling a sense of concern and 
anxiety about the future of a country we cherish. Some 
Canadians must be feeling a sense of dismay, of déjà vu. Are we 
ever going to put these issues behind us or are we condemned to 
regular flare-ups of a national unity crisis like a bad toothache?
<P>
	Some must be feeling deep frustration, a sense of wanting to 
get involved, to have a say, to make a difference. The frustration 
comes from seeing the separatist politicians trying to hijack a 
great and successful country. The frustration comes from having 
to hear the kind of nonsense spouted by the separatists, nonsense 
about how simple and easy separation would be, nonsense about 
how Canada does not work and especially nonsense about how 
Canadians in other provinces feel about Quebec.
<P>
	The separatists are already presenting us with a wide array of 
distortions. Their rhetoric will get louder and louder and more 
and more extreme as they draw closer to their day of reckoning. 
They will be trying to tell Quebecers there is no place for them in 
Canada, no recognition, no accommodation. They will be telling 
Quebecers other Canadians want them to leave or no longer care 
one way or the other.
<P>
	They will ignore the nearly 1 million francophone Canadians 
who live outside the boundaries of Quebec, whom they intend to 
cast overboard, to sink or swim.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8834"> 8834 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	They will be telling Quebecers our partnership has reached a 
stage of irreconcilable differences, that it is time to divvy up the 
assets and to get on with our separate lives. They will be telling 
Quebecers it would be a painless breakup, while telling the rest 
of Canada that we cannot get along anymore, but by the way, we 
will still need the use of your dollar and open access to your 
markets.
<P>
	It is hard to know how to react, to laugh at the absurdity and 
the contradictions of the separatist project, to cry at the tragedy 
of so much talent, time and energy being wasted chasing a 
totally unnecessary leap into the unknown, or to get angry at the 
dishonesty and the contempt that permeate the separatist 
arguments.
<P>
	There is so much that is absurd, the prospect of soldiers in the 
new Quebec army lining up to be paid in Canadian dollars, the 
idea that Quebec needs independence to choose its own 
immigrants side by side with promises by the PQ of unrestricted 
mobility of labour with the rest of Canada.
<P>
	It is strange to hear the lamenting about how there is no room 
for Quebec in Canada when we can look around this city and see 
Quebecers occupying the highest offices this country has to 
offer. It is strange to hear Mr. Parizeau vaunt the 
accomplishments of Quebec at every opportunity, waxing 
eloquent and quite rightly so about the social, economic and 
cultural progress Quebec has made these past 30 years.
<P>
	He does not even blush and acknowledge that all of that 
progress took place inside Canada. It came through hard work 
and partnership between Quebecers and other Canadians and 
through partnership between two levels of government. It is 
strange to hear the separatists denounce the rigidities of a 
system that gave Quebec so many tools and the French language 
and culture a secure home.
<P>
	There is much that would be saddening if the separatists ever 
had their way, the dismembering and discarding of a model of 
governance that points the way to the world of the future. The 
future does not belong to microstates, it belongs to partnerships 
of communities sharing their sovereignty to pursue a better life 
for their citizens.
<P>
	It is sad to see the separatists' headlong race back into the 
past. There is much to provoke anger. The separatists will 
denigrate and belittle accomplishments of Canada. They will 
play fast and loose with the truth. They will show contempt for 
anyone who does not share their vision or their zeal.
<P>
	To laugh, to cry, to get angry, I urge my fellow Canadians not 
to give in to an emotional reaction, to realize what is going on 
here. This is the beginning of an increasingly desperate and 
panicky assault by the separatist movement. They have one shot 
at making the case to break up Canada. They know deep down 
they carry an enormous burden of proof and it is starting to  
rattle their nerves. As they get more and more rattled, they are 
desperately trying to put their opponents on the defensive and it 
is not going to work.
<P>
	There is an overwhelming consensus that it is time for 
Quebecers to make a decision. In 1995 we will come to a fork in 
the road and we will take one path or the other. It is that simple. 
The stark clarity makes some people uncomfortable. That is 
understandable, but there is no longer any use denying that the 
fork in the road is here in front of us.
<P>
	I share in the consensus that the time has come for a decision, 
but I want that decision to last and to be accepted gracefully by 
the separatists. For the decision to stick it must be seen by 
Quebecers and by Canadians in every other province as a clear 
result on a clear question after a fair and full debate. It should 
come at the end of the process used twice before, the Quebec 
referendum law. That is what the Parti Quebecois promised in 
order to get elected, albeit by the narrowest of margins. That is 
what it is morally and politically obliged to deliver now.
<P>
	The resolution is misleading because it ignores the reality that 
Quebec's future is Canada's future, that after two centuries of 
partnership, of building a political, social and economic union 
together, Canadians in other parts of the federation would be 
indifferent or unaffected by a decision by one-quarter of its 
members to leave.
<P>
	Other Canadians have a right to talk with Quebecers about 
that decision, about the options they have. We want Quebec to 
stay. We want to get back to what all of us Canadians do best, 
working out practical solutions to real problems, innovating and 
adapting, bending and compromising, adjusting and changing. 
We have always found the ways to live together, to work 
together, to build together. We have found ways to acknowledge 
and indeed to cherish our differences and at the same time 
realize how much we share. We have had a successful federation 
in this country for 127 years. We have woven together an 
economic union, a sharing social community and a democratic 
political union so well that too many of us have forgotten what 
we have to lose.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Why federalism? It is disarmingly simple. Federations allow 
communities to come together under peaceful and democratic 
political structures to share the benefit of social and economic 
co-operation while retaining the very high degree of local 
control over issues that matter most to local communities. It is a 
simple idea like most great ideas. It is an idea that has worked in 
societies that are on the surface relatively uniform, societies 
like Germany, Australia, and the United States.
<P>
	It is a particularly important idea in societies where 
communities based on language, religion or ethnicity live side 
by side, societies like Switzerland, India and, yes, Canada. It is a 
great idea but it is constantly under attack. All over the world 
there are politicians who promote difference, who offer people 
false hope 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8835"> 8835 </A></B>
<P>
that their lives  would suddenly improve if walls went up with 
other communities.
<P>
	Some of them sit in this Chamber. Federalism gives local 
communities the scope to exercise control over many aspects of 
their lives, especially in matters close to the cultural vitality and 
the social development of the community.
<P>
	Federalism enables communities to co-operate with their 
neighbours and to work together in pursuit of common goals. 
Federalism is a way to pool resources, talent and energy in 
pursuit of these goals. Federalism provides a framework of 
peace, order and security and allows communities and 
individuals to live side by side.
<P>
	Federalism creates a common identity and a purpose that can 
transcend differences without replacing local identities and 
local communities. Federalism provides the structures of an 
economic union but places them under the control of a 
democratic legislature. Federalism provides the basis for a 
sharing community, for a redistribution of wealth from richer to 
poorer regions and from richer to poorer citizens.
<P>
	Federalism allows minority groups to exercise democratic 
control over their communities and to tailor laws and 
government services to meet their own needs and preferences 
while at the same time exercising a powerful voice in the 
legislature and executive that serves the community as a whole.
<P>
	It is true that some of these benefits can be realized by 
partnership between small and independent nation states. 
Around the world there are military alliances, trade agreements, 
various forms of co-operation and mutual assistance but a 
closer look shows there is a common striving in many parts of 
the world to move beyond security pacts and free trade.
<P>
	The extra element to the sharing community and democratic 
control over matters of common interest are the bonds that are 
the most difficult to forge and the most vulnerable to being cut. 
A successful federation is a whole that is much stronger than the 
sum of its parts.
<P>
	It involves at least two or maybe three strong levels of 
government and a natural tension between them. It involves 
disagreements and compromises. Running a federal system of 
government is a noisy, sometimes messy, affair. Sometimes it is 
frustrating, especially to those who seek quick fixes and bold 
dramatic gestures.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry. The hon. 
member's time is up.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the debate that is taking place here today is 
historic and I expected a higher level of debate from the other 
side. I see that our colleagues opposite consistently select for 
their statements examples and quotes that support their position, 
while omitting examples and quotes that are unfavourable to it.
<P>
	For example, this morning, the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs went through newspapers from coast to coast, he said to 
show how editorial writers were all against the sovereignist 
solution that we are advocating. Except that one article in <I>Le 
Devoir</I>, which is also somewhere between those two coasts, as 
far as I know, and on the front page, which is hard to forget-
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. The hon. member 
must respond to the comments of the member for Edmonton 
East.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> I am getting there, Madam Speaker, but since 
we are discussing generalities, it all takes time.
<P>
	The hon. member gave a general defence of the federal option, 
and my answer was that the general arguments we have heard 
lack consistency. May I proceed, Madam Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> So I think that should interest the hon. member. 
In Ottawa, according to Jean Dion's article, the first salvos that 
were fired stressed the undemocratic nature of the Parizeau 
plan. It is all very convenient, now that the government is 
headed by Jean Chrétien, a man who does not want to talk about 
the Constitution, so that the federal government can no longer 
argue, at it did in 1980, the case for renewed federalism to 
accommodate that unruly province. This deals with the 
objections we just heard.
<P>
	Next, in a reference to prosperous federations, they say: 
Switzerland is prosperous, but the USSR was not. Brazil is not. 
Russia is not. These are federations, which proves that a federal 
system is no guarantee of prosperity.
<P>
	Third, who or what determines the quality of our lives, 
Madam Speaker? People, Canadians and Quebecers, not the 
federal system, determine our standard of living. I am told this 
country has the highest standard of living in the world, Madam 
Speaker. When you cut a cake in two, are the two halves smaller 
than they were before? Not as far as I know.
<P>
	For instance, Norway and Sweden were one country until 
1904-05, when Sweden accepted Norway's separation. Did 
Norway and Sweden become impoverished after they were 
separated? They are among the most prosperous countries 
mentioned.
<P>
	What about the G-7? They say we will not be part of the G-7. 
Well, we could not care less, because you do not have to be big to 
be prosperous. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, with a 
popula-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8836"> 8836 </A></B>
<P>
tion of 300,000, has an unemployment rate of 2 per cent. We 
would not mind that.
<P>
	That being said, I remain convinced that sovereignty is the 
best choice for Quebec's future, and I invite the people of 
Blainville-Deux-Montagnes to take an active part in the 
debate that starts today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bethel:</B> Madam Speaker, there are several aspects that I 
would like to respond to. I want to make it absolutely clear that 
we are not defending federalism. The record of federalism in 
this country is clear to all Canadians.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about the quality of people. I think 
that is where federalism's greatest gift lies. It does not matter in 
this country which province we live in, which city, which 
community, which neighbourhood. This country cares for all of 
its people.
<P>
	We have provided education, social programs and economic 
prosperity through good times and bad times. We do not 
determine that on where we live. It is available to all citizens. 
Those who live in the inner city of Montreal are feeling the same 
pain as those who live in Edmonton East inner city 
neighbourhood. Federalism can deal with that in a fair and 
equitable manner.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am particularly pleased to debate this motion on the 
legitimacy of the consultation process on Quebec sovereignty, 
released this week by the Right Hon. Premier of Quebec, Mr. 
Jacques Parizeau.
<P>
	Mr. Parizeau is known for his honesty, his candour and his 
humanity. He has a reputation for saying what he is doing, and 
exactly what he says. He is proving it this week, intelligently, 
skilfully and competently.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	We are proud of Mr. Parizeau. We can only be proud of our 
Premier and glad to be associated with such an exciting process, 
a highly democratic process.
<P>
	I have been an avid observer of the political scene from a very 
early age, but especially so since 1987. I followed with interest 
what led us to the Meech Lake Accord. This accord was the last 
attempt of our fellow Quebecers who still believed, then, that 
Quebec had a place within the Canadian Confederation.
<P>
	It was also the last attempt to make up for the affront 
perpetrated by the present Prime Minister of Canada and his 
team, in 1981, during the night of the long knives, which led to 
the unilateral patriation of the Constitution. That was, to use 
some now famous words, the last attempt to make Canada 
whole, to have federalist Quebecers sign the Canadian 
Constitution with honour and enthusiasm.
<P>
	I lived through the second phase, the one which led to the 
failure of Meech. I observed it closely, but with much sadness, 
especially when the report of the special committee studying the 
proposed companion resolution to the Meech Lake Accord, 
better know as the Charest Report, was published.
<P>
	The Charest report, named after the member for Sherbrooke, 
reduced to next to nothing what was already considered as the 
bare minimum, the entrance door allowing Quebec to try, one 
last time, to take its place within the Canadian federation, a 
springboard for Quebec to get all the powers, all the tools it 
needed in the areas of social programs, the economy and also 
culture.
<P>
	The tabling of this report burying the Meech Lake Accord 
sadly put an end, an emotional one for most of my fellow 
citizens who still believed in that country, to a saga which had 
started with the ``beau risque'' as a hopeful initiative.
<P>
	Quebecers remember this report tabled by the present member 
for Sherbrooke who was then minister responsible for the 
committee which really killed the Meech Lake Accord.
<P>
	Those were days of sadness, emotion, and grief for me, but I 
was proud of what happened after. I was very proud to see MPs 
from Quebec, seven of them at the time, who were eventually 
joined by an eighth one, the member for Saint-Hubert, resign 
because they disagreed with the government foiling the final 
attempt, putting an end to the ``beau risque''. They took a stand 
and I take this opportunity to salute them.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> They took a stand and all Quebecers were proud 
of them. They stood up against this attempt by Canadian 
federalists to enslave a whole people, my people. I repeat, the 
member for Sherbrooke was there among them, and the present 
Prime Minister was in the hallways with his walkman, and often 
with a walkie talkie, to give instructions, in order to block the 
approval of any distinctive status, or to put an end to any attempt 
to give a distinctive status to Quebec.
<P>
	Among the eight who stood firm, who fought to the end for the 
interests of Quebecers and also to preserve their dignity and 
pride, there was the present Leader of the Opposition, our leader 
and friend-my best friend. I want to extend my affectionate 
greetings to him and his wife, Audrey, and his two children, 
Alexandre and Simon. He is the reason why, at the time, I was 
moved very positively by what was happening, because the 
Quebec people had just acquired a great leader. Quebec had just 
acquired a new leader, who was standing firm with six of his 
colleagues, and later on with a seventh one. We are proud of that.

<P>
	After that, Madam Speaker, as you will recall, there was a lot 
of constitutional turbulence and commotion. Remember the 
Beaudoin-Dobbie report, the Beaudoin-Edwards report, the 
Spicer commission and Charlottetown. These documents were 
supposed to fulfill the aspirations of Quebecers, after they were 
betrayed by the rejection of the Meech Lake Accord.
<P>
	We took part in all these debates. We are sovereignists, but we 
took part in all these debates. Why are Quebec federalists, the 
Leader of the Opposition in the Quebec legislature, including 
federal members from Quebec, Liberals and others, refusing to 
discuss ideas, to discuss federalism, while we took part in all 
federalist debates which led to the adoption of those reports 
aimed at one thing only. They were a smoke screen used to make 
Quebecers believe that a reform, even the slightest reform, was 
possible so they could have their place, a real place which they 
would be proud and honoured and willing to occupy.
<P>
	Why do federalists refuse a process which is eminently 
democratic, open, allowing for the exchange of ideas, like the 
one announced by the Premier of Quebec? Why? Because they 
are afraid. They are afraid of their ideas because it is impossible 
to defend a rigid status quo that prevents the normal economic, 
social and cultural progress of the people of Quebec. During 
Question Period, I heard the Prime Minister say that it is within 
Canada that Quebecers have developed. Acutally, we have done 
so despite Canada.
<P>
	Remember all the efforts and energy we have had to spend 
since 1964, the days of Jean Lesage, in order to patriate powers 
that we considered essential to our development. Madam 
Speaker, look at what we have been doing in the last seven years 
in particular. We have done nothing but that, try to develop, try 
to develop employment, to stimulate our economic growth with 
powers which are presently in federal hands and which Quebec 
is being denied. Is that what you call harmonious development 
within the federal system?
<P>
	No. If Quebecers have become what they are today, if their 
businesses are so dynamic and their workers so skilled, it is 
because at one point in time we decided to take charge of our 
own affairs despite all opposition and despite the federal system 
that tried to paralyse us, to keep us down and even to use force to 
prevent us from developing our collective wealth.
<P>
	Remember Bill S-31. There was the Bélanger-Campeau 
Commission. We also participated in the Bélanger-Campeau 
Commission. And if I have one reason, as an economist, to be 
proud of the work accomplished there, it is for one particular 
aspect of it: it put an end to all the economic bugbears and 
showed us that Canada's threat, not to allow Quebec goods and 
services into Canada, was empty.
<P>
	With Ontario alone, the net balance of trade between Ontario 
and Quebec is over $3 billion; that is, Ontario sells Quebec $3 
billion more of goods and services than Quebec sells Ontario. 
Would Ontario close its border? Bélanger-Campeau stifled this 
kind of nonsense. It also put an end to scare tactics like saying 
Quebec would lose its milk production.
<P>
	When even the president of the UPA contradicts the current 
Leader of the Opposition in Quebec, who said ``You will lose 
your quotas, and your share of milk production'', that is 
something. So, I would urge you and every citizen, regardless of 
ethnic origin, language and political affiliation, to take part in 
this democratic process. I am sending out a special invitation to 
the English-speaking community. I would have a short 
paragraph to read them, if I may Madam Speaker, in their 
language.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Anglophones and francophones of Quebec are still 
democrats and it is as democrats that I invite you today, most 
sincerely, to take this friendly hand we are extending to you, to 
help solve the question of importance to you and to join with us 
in building together the kind of country that we want to live in. 
Do not forget the future of Quebec is yours. The future and 
prosperity of Quebec is also in your hands. I am asking you not 
to remain on the sideline of your evolution and participate in the 
process proposed by the prime minister of Quebec''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I also send out a special invitation to the people of my riding 
of Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot to participate in this eminently 
democratic process, as well as all interested organizations and 
individuals throughout Montérégie.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have been listening with interest to this play 
that the Bloc Quebecois has been performing for us since this 
morning. The problem is that I still do not know whether it is a 
tragedy or a comedy. It may be a tragicomedy.
<P>
	The draft bill proposed by the separatists is a monumental 
deception. The Bloc Quebecois should be ashamed of 
associating with this undemocratic process.
<P>
	I always felt that the leader of the Bloc Quebecois was a great 
democrat and I am convinced that, from his hospital bed, he 
must be upset by the PQ flouting the democratic process in 
Quebec. He must also realize that the PQ has just made a 
strategic mistake that will cost the separatists dearly. This bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8838"> 8838 </A></B>
<P>
insults Quebecers' intelligence. It is a bomb that will explode in 
the separatists' faces.
<P>
	I have more confidence in Quebecers' integrity and 
intelligence. I am convinced that they will detect Mr. Parizeau's 
deception through the smoke screen he has put up. This process 
reminds me a little of a somewhat unscrupulous insurance agent 
who showed up at our house. He told me that I certainly needed 
insurance and that he would sell me term or permanent 
insurance. I asked him who had told him that I needed his 
insurance and I threw him out the door.
<P>
	The leader of the PQ shows the same attitude by telling 
Quebecers in his patronizing manner: ``I know what is good for 
you. You want independence, you want separation. Now, do you 
want separation with or without the Canadian dollar? With or 
without Canadian citizenship?''
<P>
	I think that Quebecers will say no, not only to the PQ's and the 
BQ's separatist option, but also to the separatists' deception and 
manipulation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, I have three comments to 
make following the hon. member's intervention. First, I want to 
ask him to show a little more respect for my leader and to 
remember that he has been involved in the referendum strategy 
for the last three months. Consequently, my leader certainly 
supports and endorses the process unveiled by Mr. Parizeau.
<P>
	I also want to tell the hon. member-who was almost 
slanderous when he alluded to the honesty and integrity of 
sovereignists-that we were not afraid, as I said earlier, to 
participate in the debate proposed to us by the federalists. Is it 
because, unlike maybe 1980 or shortly before, the federalists are 
running out of arguments to convince us to stay in Canada are 
thus unable to publicly debate this issue?
<P>
	We are offering you a forum: Why not use it to discuss the 
issue, instead of hiding behind your desk and making comments 
which are almost disrespectful, if not downright slanderous? I 
also ask the hon. member to be careful when denigrating Quebec 
as well as the wishes of a whole nation. My colleague, the hon. 
member for Témiscamingue, told me that you both represent 
neighbouring ridings and that yours benefits immensely from 
that proximity. Indeed, many people living on the Quebec side 
cross the border into Ontario, to shop in the member's riding. 
Again, the hon. member should be careful when making 
comments.
<P>
	We have common interests, as evidenced by this activity 
between the two ridings. So, let us be careful. We must respect 
the will of people, and we must also respect an eminently 
democratic process. All Quebec federalists should participate in 
the consultation process.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	If they do not want to move, then they should tell us, because 
the house is falling down. However, these federalists should 
come up with arguments to support their views. But do come to 
sit and talk. We are open, and we are very cool, calm and 
collected.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
very honoured and proud to take part in today's debate on the 
motion put forward by the Official Opposition. As you know, 
this motion deals with the draft bill on Quebec's sovereignty 
which was introduced  by the Quebec Premier on Tuesday.
<P>
	How exciting it is to discuss the draft bill that was introduced 
by the Quebec government and that sets forth a clear and 
responsible process which will let Quebecers from every walk of 
life take part in the debate on this plan for Quebec's 
constitutional future. To my knowledge, this is a unique process. 
I do not know that many countries in the world where the people 
are asked to express their opinion on a draft bill. This openness 
may be another distinct characteristic of Quebec.
<P>
	The Quebec government wants the people of Quebec to 
express their views on the significant issues related to 
sovereignty. Discussions on significant issues related to the 
sovereignty proposal will be held in every Quebec region. 
During these consultations, Quebecers will have the opportunity 
to say what they expect from a sovereign Quebec.
<P>
	Another issue will be raised in the debate on the draft bill. I 
am talking about Quebec citizenship. I would like to say a few 
words on this. The draft bill sets conditions for becoming a 
citizen of sovereign Quebec. If you examine clause 5 which 
deals specifically with this issue, you will see how generously 
all Quebec citizens will be treated.
<P>
	It is refreshing to see that a sovereign Quebec would not use 
the same approach as the Canadian government with regard to 
citizenship. Quebec is showing openness and generosity by 
saying that it will give Quebec citizenship to all Canadian 
citizens domiciled in Quebec, without any restrictions. That is 
much different from the position of the present government 
which refuses to do the same thing, as indicated in the report 
published last spring by the Standing Committee on Citizenship 
and Immigration. The committee recommended that the new 
Citizenship Act stipulate that a Canadian citizen who 
voluntarily or officially acquires citizenship of another country, 
other than by marriage or in other circumstances such as 
adoption, shall cease to be a Canadian citizen.
<P>
	In contrast, the draft bill on sovereignty stipulates that, and I 
quote: ``Quebec citizenship may be held concurrently with 
citizenship of Canada or of any other country.'' Quebec would 
not be the first country to adopt such a policy. France, Great 
Britain, the United States, Italy and Switzerland, just to name a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8839"> 8839 </A></B>
<P>
few, are among the countries whose residents can have dual 
citizenship.
<P>
	Canada and Quebec have always been known as generous and 
welcoming states. As a matter of fact, Canada has recognized 
and accepted the principle of dual citizenship for a long time. 
Why this change by the federal government? Why should a 
Canadian citizen lose his or her citizenship if he or she acquires 
citizenship in another country? This restrictive policy has to be 
denounced. By any chance would that policy be meant to deny 
Quebecers the right to keep their Canadian citizenship if they so 
wish? Madam Speaker, this is a federalist ploy.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	The draft bill also proposes that once Quebecers have voted in 
favour of sovereignty, any citizen residing in Quebec will 
automatically be considered a Quebec citizen. It is nice to see 
there will be no distinction between Quebecers of many 
generations and those recently arrived. For instance, the new 
citizen coming from Africa or Asia will have the same rights as 
all old-stock Quebecers. Quebec has always been free from 
prejudice against new citizens from foreign countries.
<P>
	I would like to quote a Quebec poet, novelist and essayist, a 
resident of Laval East, Fernand Ouellet. I would also like to take 
this opportunity to congratulate him on the Ludger Duvernay 
award he received in November. Mr. Ouellet said: ``My 
ancestors came from Paris, Champagne, Normandy, Poitou, 
Brittany and the Basque country. Very early, they were exposed 
to people of various ethnic groups and showed their willingness 
to live with others. A Norman from Bayeux would naturally 
marry a Basque girl from Bayonne or a Breton from Quimper. 
That is how our nation was born.''
<P>
	Quebec is a land of immigrants. Our roots are French, 
Anglo-Saxon, Irish, Italian, Greek, Latin American and 
American. Our traditions, our customs and our art were always 
influenced by the input of immigrants who enhanced the cultural 
heritage of Quebec.
<P>
	In future, this openness will remain and even increase. 
Quebecers are people who reside in Quebec and who like to live 
there. Quebec citizenship will include all those who live within 
Quebec's borders and who wish to take part in its development.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, please, I would like to continue without all 
the silliness and insulting remarks.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order, please. I would 
ask the hon. member to continue.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien: </B>Madam Speaker, the draft bill adds that when 
the Quebec people have voted for Quebec sovereignty, every 
person who was born in Quebec or who was born outside Quebec 
and whose father or mother held Quebec citizenship will 
automatically be a Quebec citizen. These provisions are totally 
in keeping with what is done in many countries, including 
Canada.
<P>
	Finally, the section of the draft bill also proposes, and I quote: 
``Quebec citizenship may also be acquired in the manner 
determined by the National Assembly.'' As in all sovereign and 
normal countries, newcomers will acquire Quebec citizenship 
under a legal framework, with regulations, and Quebec 
citizenship law will be applied according to clearly defined 
administrative procedures.
<P>
	The federal government recently decided to close up, to 
become more suspicious and to see plots everywhere and 
systematic attempts at abuse coming from other countries. 
Quebec is opting for a much more positive approach to 
newcomers who want to live in Quebec. Quebec wants to join 
other nations at a time when challenges in trade, openness and 
globalization await us.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say that this draft bill proposes a 
thoughtful and analytical approach in which all Quebecers are 
invited to participate. I hope that the people of Laval East, 
whatever their political affiliation and their ethnic origin, and 
all groups and organizations from our area will come and 
participate in a highly democratic process to define the future of 
Quebec. The sharing of ideas and the opportunity to express 
them is what democracy is all about.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to what my colleague from Laval 
East had to say. I cannot help thinking that ever since I was 
elected to this House, the members opposite have been 
criticizing us and telling us that the status quo is unacceptable. 
With the draft bill that is proposed, I wonder what choices Mr. 
Parizeau, the members of the Bloc Quebecois and the members 
of the Parti Quebecois really have to offer Quebecers. We are 
being offered the same Canadian passport. We are being offered 
the same Canadian dollar. We are being offered the same 
international treaties. As well, they say in the draft bill that they 
want to be a member of the most important organizations in the 
world such as the UN, GATT and NAFTA. Quebec and 
Quebecers already have those privileges. What more do they 
want?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> To become masters of our own 
destiny!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> To become masters of their own destiny? 
They already have control over their own tax system and their 
own legislative system. They have full control over education, 
language, culture and immigration. They have all that within 
Canada.
<P>
	To meet the requirements of the Referendum Act, which is the 
authority on which all referendums and plebiscites are held in 
Quebec, it is clear that there have to be two parties: a yes and a 
no side. Is that democracy? The so-called democracy that we are 
being offered in that draft bill? Where are the two parties? 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8840"> 8840 </A></B>
<P>
Clause 1 provides that Quebec is already a sovereign country. 
What other choice is there for those who do not want Quebec to 
be sovereign? Where is the consultation process? Do they really 
want to know what other people think? I wonder  where 
democracy stands when 13 members of the 15 commissions 
proposed are separatists and only two of them are federalists. Is 
that democracy?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> That is Parizeau-style democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Quebecers are offered an alternative. They 
should have the courage to ask the question correctly instead of 
writing 18 sections and after that asking the real question that is 
required by the Referendum Act, yes or no. They should find it 
in themselves to ask the relevant question: Do you want to 
separate from the most wonderful country of the world, yes or 
no? But do they have that kind of courage?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien: </B>Madam Speaker, at times I have the sneaky 
suspicion that Liberal members have not read the bill.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They cannot read.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> It takes only five minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien:</B> They must have skipped some parts. This draft 
bill says that there will be a period of information and 
participation during which the bill can be improved. What does 
that mean? It means that we can listen to opinions, we can 
entertain proposals for amendment, and that is precisely what 
we expect from the Liberals. But they do not want to. They are 
stuck on the status quo.
<P>
	How can they come and talk to us when they are mired in the 
status quo. They skip stages too. Improvements will be made, 
maybe even changes. Everyone is invited to take part. There will 
be a debate in the National Assembly and then this bill will be 
approved by the people in a referendum.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	They forget that. They forget to acknowledge that there will 
be a referendum on this draft bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, but the hon. 
member's time has run out. I recognize the hon. whip of the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to take part in the debate this 
afternoon. Since this morning, I have been listening to the 
comments of the members opposite. What are they asking us? 
They want the House to enjoin the government to recognize the 
legitimacy of the so-called democratic process initiated by the 
Government of Quebec to allow Quebecers to choose the 
political and constitutional future of Quebec.
<P>
	We should ask ourselves, if this is the wish of the Bloc 
Quebecois, why was that motion not introduced in the Quebec 
National Assembly in order to ask the National Assembly to do 
precisely what that motion proposes, because what has been 
introduced in the National Assembly is certainly not, in my 
opinion, democratic and most of all it will not allow Quebecers 
to choose their political and constitutional future.
<P>
	The proposal introduced in the National Assembly is a sham 
and the members opposite know it. Why is it a sham? Because 
everything has been structured and organized in such a way that 
almost all participants are supporters of separation, excuse me, 
sovereignty as the members opposite would say, because they 
are afraid to use the real word and they do not have the courage 
and the conviction to say what we all know.
<P>
	But we intend to tell the truth to Canadians, those who live in 
Quebec and the others, about what Quebecers are being told by 
the Parti Quebecois or by the minor league of the Parti 
Quebecois in Ottawa, the farm team, the Bloc Quebecois here in 
town. The members of the farm team and those of the Parti 
Quebecois want us to believe that they are the real defenders of 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is certainly not you!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, someone just said: ``It is 
certainly not you''. I was born in Quebec, I am Franco-Ontarian 
by adoption and I am proud to say that as a Quebecer, which I 
am, I can represent a riding in Ontario, in the Parliament of this 
country, because it is my right as it is the right of every Quebecer 
to be a candidate from coast to coast and to represent Canadians.
<P>
	Members opposite want to deprive me of that right, they want 
to deprive Quebecers of that right and we should not forget that. 
Members opposite claim to defend not only the rights of 
Quebecers but those of francophones outside Quebec.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, let me read an excerpt from the November 
1993 issue of <I>The Hill Times</I>. In this article, the member for 
Quebec was interviewed, and she said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Bilingualism is only an issue in Quebec'', said Ms. Gagnon. 
``People in Manitoba and Ontario don't really worry about 
speaking French, they just speak English. I don't expect to 
convince them to understand our position but I think we have to 
develop a sense of mutual respect.''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My colleagues, the members for Nickel Belt, 
Cochrane-Superior, Timiskaming-French River and 
elsewhere, are well aware that Bloc members converted 
recently, perhaps after the member for Québec-Est, a 
Franco-Ontarian living in Quebec, spoke to his colleague, as I 
am a Quebecer living in French Ontario.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8841"> 8841 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The sort of thing we see today, where a French-speaking 
Ontarian can represent a riding in Quebec City and a Quebecer 
like me represents a riding in Ontario, really reflects what 
Canada is all about. And I am proud to belong to this great 
country.
<P>
	Members opposite are telling us: ``We want a separate 
country''-sorry-``a sovereign country''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Separate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> All right, separate. It is true, after all. But with 
all this, they want a Canadian passport. A big cheer for the 
Canadian passport. They want the Canadian currency. A big 
cheer for the Canadian currency. They want all the other 
benefits. They want to be part of the trade agreements negotiated 
by Canada on behalf of us all. A big cheer for our trade 
agreements that we managed to negotiate so well. Do you know 
the best way to keep all these benefits? It is to stay within 
Canada. It is as simple as that.
<P>
	Of course, life could be better in this country, but compared to 
what? Residents of other countries of the world would do 
anything to be able to come here to Canada. Why? Because they 
know it is the best country in the world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Everyone knows that, including the members across the way. 
They know the truth. They know what it is like.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today, they do not have the courage to put the real question to 
the people in their province. They know that, in the last 
provincial election, separatists only got about 0.5 per cent more 
votes than the opposition, although quite a few federalists voted 
for them. What does it mean? It means that close to two thirds of 
Quebecers are against separation; at least 60 per cent of them are 
against what is called sovereignty because the people across the 
way do not have the courage to call a spade a spade. We know all 
this, so do Quebecers.
<P>
	Why is it that all the Quebec organizations which voiced their 
opinion in the last few days condemned the initiative taken by 
the head of the Quebec government? Why did so many of them 
condemn it? One of my colleagues is going to list many of these 
groups. They condemn it because they know that these 
consultations are a sham. They know that the consultation 
process is pure make-believe and that the results are 
predetermined.
<P>
	Let us look at the draft bill. It states that Quebec is a sovereign 
country.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The members opposite can beat their own 
drum. By doing so and by gazing at their own navel, as they are 
doing today, they might end up believing that Quebecers agree 
with their statements. This is not the case. No matter how hard 
they beat their own drum, it will not make their wish come true.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Members across the way say that the monetary policy of 
Quebec should be dictated in another country and they say this 
in the name of sovereignty. How does one become sovereign by 
having another country dictate one's monetary policy? That is 
what they are advocating.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	They are advocating the use of the Canadian currency in a 
foreign country. What the members opposite want is to deprive 
Quebecers of the opportunity to have, in this House of 
Commons, a finance minister coming from their own province 
and who could influence the monetary policy; they want to make 
sure that the Prime Minister of Canada does not come from 
Quebec to head this country's policy, a policy they will have to 
adhere to under their phony draft bill.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	What the members opposite are doing is shooting themselves 
in the foot, as the member for Nickel Belt so elegantly put it. 
That is the real truth. Quebecers will not be fooled. I am the 
thirteenth generation of Boudrias born in Quebec. Thirteenth! 
Out of all my ancestors and descendants, my son is the first 
Boudria to be born in Ontario, the fourteenth generation in 
Canada.
<P>
	However, Quebec and the rest of Canada are his country just 
as Quebec and the rest of Canada are my country. This is our 
country and it will remain just that!
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
read the motion today asking this House to recognize the 
legitimacy of the democratic process initiated by the 
government of Quebec. I have listened to speeches by the Bloc 
Quebecois members trying to tell us what they intend to do and 
ignoring whether or not it is legitimate. I have listened to the 
members of the government who are telling us how good 
federalism is while avoiding the issue of whether or not what the 
Bloc intends to do is legal and legitimate.
<P>
	The way I see the process is that they intend to introduce a bill 
in the legislature of the province of Quebec that is going to 
trample all over federal responsibilities. They are going to 
debate a bill in the legislature of the province of Quebec that is 
outside their jurisdiction. They are going to vote on a bill that 
they have no mandate to vote on. Then they want to dress it all up 
with some false legitimacy measures by holding a referendum.
<P>
	It is presumptuous in the extreme for them to think that this 
bill would be endorsed by the rest of the people in Canada. For 
them to think that by declaring that these are the conditions the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8842"> 8842 </A></B>
<P>
rest of Canada would in any way support, and I think the process 
is a fraud, I think is illegal, illegitimate and immoral.
<P>
	I would ask the previous speaker, as a member of this 
government, why he does not stand up and acknowledge and tell 
the people of Quebec that this entire process that is being 
proposed by the government of Quebec is as I said, illegal, 
illegitimate and immoral. The process is deceitful and a sham. 
Tell the people of Quebec that is the way it is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I did not think there would be 
any doubt after my speech that I did not like the process very 
much. But if it needs to be repeated for the member across the 
way, I am certainly willing to do so in the time that is left.
<P>
	We are not just debating legality here. Constitutional experts 
can argue until all the cows in Glengarry come home as to 
whether or not there is a constitutional provision, implicit or 
otherwise, for a province to secede from the rest of the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Are those cows from Vaudreuil too?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> That is not the point. The point is to keep this 
country together and it is the duty of all of us, in all our 
speeches, in all our comments and everything that we do. We 
should all speak in favour of Canada the way the Prime Minister 
does, lauding the virtues of living in the greatest country in the 
world, Canada, not whether or not there are six constitutional 
experts who say there is such an implicit power. Five would say 
otherwise or the reverse. What difference does that make? That 
does not make any difference if a country is trying to split itself 
apart. What we need is the intestinal fortitude to state that this is 
a great country and to work together to keep the country 
together, this great country of Canada. That is what is important, 
not the rest of that nonsense.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to make a few comments in 
response to the speech by the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. I am told I have one minute left.
<P>
	I would simply like to say to the hon. member that once 
Quebec achieves sovereignty, he will be allowed to keep his 
Quebec citizenship if he so desires and if his country, Canada, 
allows him to. I want to add-I will come back to this later-that 
we have no lesson on democracy to learn from representatives of 
the Liberal government and certainly not from representatives 
of the Reform Party.
<P>
	Let me refresh your memory with three examples. Quebecers 
were never consulted on the Constitution of 1867. And what 
about conscription which the federal government imposed in 
Quebec after promising-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order! Sorry to 
interrupt the hon. member but his time is up. The hon. member 
for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell has 30 seconds to reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I will try to be quick. In fact, 
the hon. members opposite have much to learn. The separatists 
have much to learn, if they think that they can deceive the 
Quebec people with phony consultations on such a contrived 
bill. It will not work, Madam Speaker. You will see, we will keep 
this great country together!
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this is for me, as a Canadian and a Quebecer by choice, 
a very sad day. It was 35 years ago that we chose Quebec and 
Canada. For 20 years now, I have been following Quebec's 
politics. About 15 years ago, I took part in the first Quebec 
referendum, where Quebecers indicated they did not want 
anything to do with sovereignty-association as it was called 
then, with separation as we would say today. They reasserted 
their sense of belonging to Canada and to our federation.
<P>
	Over a year ago, I was elected to this House through a 
democratic process, but we now see for the first time ever a 
government that will decide unilaterally not to respect our 
democratic process. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition in 
Quebec who said that this is not a consultation process, but 
rather a propaganda campaign, a subterfuge, an illusion. He 
added that the issue will be how, and not if, sovereignty will be 
achieved.
<P>
	After promising to represent everyone, the leader of the Parti 
Quebecois has initiated a process which excludes Quebec's 
federalists, that is the majority of Quebecers. If the government 
really wanted to find out what everybody thought about its 
proposal, it would not have launched a consultation process that 
takes into account only one side of the issue.
<P>
	The president of the Quebec Chamber of Commerce himself 
has stated that he disagrees with these consultations. He said 
that the government will have to rethink the whole process. He 
added that, given the current situation, with only representatives 
of the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois sitting at the 
table, there would not be a balance in the views expressed and 
that it would make him very ill at ease.
<P>
	The president of the Quebec manufacturers' association also 
decided not to take part in these consultations, because he thinks 
the draft bill is a sovereignty proposal and does not examine 
every possible option for Quebec.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8843"> 8843 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, the presidents of the Quebec farmers' union and 
the Conseil du patronat also refused to take part in these 
consultations. These four examples clearly demonstrate that the 
PQ leader is not everybody's premier and that he only seeks the 
participation of separatists in this debate.
<P>
	If he really was everybody's premier, he would have asked the 
clear and simple question that everyone can understand and 
answer: ``Do you want to remain inside Canada, yes or no?'' 
Unfortunately, this is not the case because he knows that the 
answer to this question would be no.
<P>
	Finally, two of Quebec's most distinguished political 
scientists, Léon Dion and Vincent Lemieux, also severely 
criticized the PQ's breach of democracy. As reported on 
December 7, 1994, in La Presse, Mr. Dion said: ``The process 
makes me very ill at ease. In such consultations, the public is 
often won over to a cause even before the process starts. In this 
case, it is Mr. Parizeau's cause.''
<P>
	The PQ leader continues to call himself everybody's premier 
and encourages everyone to take part in these consultations on 
the future of Quebec. At the same time, though, this draft bill 
does not include Quebec's cultural communities.
<P>
	Last week, following many statements by members of the PQ 
government and their representatives, I rose here to ask the 
government to reaffirm unequivocally that members of cultural 
communities are, in fact, full citizens of our country. This draft 
bill confirms that the Parti Quebecois does not consider 
members of cultural communities as first-class citizens of 
Quebec.
<P>
	Can the leader of the PQ government invite the cultural 
communities to build a new Quebec and then ignore them 
completely in his plan? Nothing is forcing the Parti Quebecois 
to subject Quebecers to an agonizing process. As my colleagues 
pointed out, Quebec is sovereign in all the areas under its 
jurisdiction. Quebecers live in one of the best countries in the 
world, a country they have built, a country they have chosen, 
just like my parents did. That country has evolved and 
Quebecers are part of this evolution.
<P>
	Personally, I believe, as the Leader of the Opposition in 
Quebec said, and he will lead the campaign against separation 
before the next referendum in that province, that the process 
announced yesterday by the PQ government can only be 
democratic if it meets the following three conditions.
<P>
	First, the process should be based on consultation, not on 
propaganda. The proposed process in unacceptable since it leads 
to a foregone conclusion. The solicited advice and discussions 
have one single purpose: to draft a declaration of sovereignty 
based on the proposals and suggestions that only supporters of 
separation will be interested in formulating.
<P>
	Second, the approach used should focus the public debate on 
the real issue. The PQ is asking the people to discuss the content 
of the declaration of sovereignty instead of the advisability of 
separation in order to avoid the real question: is it in the best 
interests of Quebecers to separate from the rest of Canada? Not 
only is the desire of the Parti Quebecois to avoid this question 
dishonest, but it also shows that the PQ is afraid to hear what the 
answer of the majority of Quebecers to such a clear question 
would be.
<P>
	Third, the process must be fair. In keeping with the spirit of 
Quebec's legislation on public consultations, both sides should 
have equal opportunities to put forward and explain their 
viewpoints. In practice, this means that both sides should have 
the same number of seats, the same resources and equal time.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Will Quebecers have an opportunity to make a decision on a 
clear question in the coming referendum? I doubt it.
<P>
	The question proposed by the Parti Quebecois would ask the 
people of Quebec whether they are in favour of the Act passed by 
the National Assembly, which would define the features of 
Quebec sovereignty. It is a blank cheque the PQ government is 
asking for, because it knows very well that whole sections of the 
sovereignist plan would have to be negotiated with its partners 
in the years following the referendum.
<P>
	Given these factors, and since I chose Quebec and Canada as 
my country, this is a very sad moment in the history of Quebec 
and since the democratic process is not being respected, I will 
vote against the Official Opposition's motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first of all, I would like to tell the hon. 
member for Saint-Denis that her remarks about cultural 
communities, which she said are disregarded by the PQ 
government, are not only false, but also disrespectful to the PQ 
government and to the people of Quebec, a community that is 
not self-centred, but, on the contrary, quite open to immigration 
and newcomers. Let me give her just one example. One of her 
co-nationals, Nadia Assimopoulos, chaired the executive of the 
Parti Quebecois in the 1980s. That is a telling example of the 
openness of Quebecers to cultural communities.
<P>
	I would also like to comment on the so-called undemocratic 
character of the PQ process. I would like to remind the hon. 
member for Saint-Denis, as I set out to do a few minutes ago, of 
four events in the history of Quebecers that were instigated by 
the federal government, and ask her to consider whether they 
were democratic or not.
<P>
	The first one is the Constitution of 1867. Quebecers never got 
a chance to have their say on that Constitution. Then, there was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8844"> 8844 </A></B>
<P>
the conscription crisis. In 1940, the Mackenzie King 
government, which had made an electoral commitment not to 
impose conscription,  reversed its position by holding a 
referendum in which 70 per cent of Quebecers voted against and 
70 or 71 per cent of Canadians outside Quebec voted for 
conscription. Despite his previous commitment, Liberal Prime 
Minister Mackenzie King imposed conscription on all 
Quebecers.
<P>
	More recently, the Trudeau government decided to proclaim 
the War Measures Act in Quebec and proceeded to arrest 
hundreds of people, and search the home of thousands of honest 
citizens. As a result, 20 people waited for months for charges to 
be laid against them.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Is that the Liberals' idea of democracy? Those people have 
the nerve to teach us lessons in democracy. The last event is the 
patriation of the Constitution in 1982. The current Prime 
Minister was one of the main players in what was a tragedy for 
democracy, when they shoved down Quebecers' throats a 
Constitution they did not want. If that is what they call 
democracy, my Liberal colleagues and the hon. member for 
Saint-Denis do not know what they are talking about.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bakopanos:</B> Madam Speaker, every time a member of the 
opposition rises, it is to give us a history lecture-that is not 
interesting. Thank you very much, we have all read the history 
of Quebec and Canada. This is why Canada was chosen twice as 
the best country in the world to live in-including Quebec and 
Quebecers.
<P>
	I would also like to say, just in passing, since he brought it up, 
that a compatriot of mine told me that she quit the Parti 
Quebecois because she was not a separatist, she never supported 
separatism and she does not share that vision of society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. We 
would all like to hear what the hon. member is saying.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Would you like me to repeat it in English?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If we have interpretation again, I would only like to repeat, as 
I said earlier, that I do not need a history lecture. I know the 
history of Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I know what the history of this country is, the greatest country 
in the world. I want to repeat it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to repeat that my parents chose to come to Quebec and 
Canada, and I am proud of it. I want to stay in a united Canada 
and I will fight for it. The Bloc Quebecois also has many history 
lessons to learn because history shows us that Quebec and 
Quebecers have really been quite well served by Canadian 
federalism.
<P>
	We enjoy one of the best standards of living, we live in one of 
the best countries in the world. We really have a quality of life 
which is the envy of the world, and this is due to the unity of our 
country, to federalism which benefits Quebec. I wish to repeat 
that Nadia Assimopoulos, of whom you spoke, resigned from 
the Parti Quebecois because she was not in favour of the 
separation of Quebec. She is not a separatist, and never was.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: The hon. 
member for Yorkton-Melville-Gun control.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased today to speak to this motion which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House enjoin the government to recognize the legitimacy of the 
democratic process initiated by the Government of Quebec in order to allow 
Quebecers to chart their own political and constitutional future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This motion was initiated by the Government of Quebec. Of 
course, what we are witnessing here today is an attempt to 
discredit the Government of Quebec, to claim that it is 
undemocratic, that it does not know what democracy is and that 
it does not respect democracy in Quebec.
<P>
	At the outset, I have to say that I, as well as other Quebecers, 
are clearly shocked to hear the Quebec Liberal Party, the federal 
Liberal Party and the Reform Party declare that Quebec's 
proposal is illegitimate. Need I remind you, Madam Speaker, 
that the Parti Quebecois is one of the most democratic parties of 
all time. The Parti Quebecois was democratically elected and 
forms the government.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The Parti Quebecois has a tradition of parliamentary 
democracy. It is one of only a handful of parties in which 
members elect their leader by universal suffrage. It has passed 
laws governing the way in which political parties are financed. 
It is the only party in Canada to have done so to ensure that each 
and every Quebecer can make a contribution to a political party 
and that the government that is elected is free to act. It is not a 
party controlled by  the big interests or by the big unions. When 
the government makes a decision, it is made freely No other 
government in Canada can make such a claim.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8845"> 8845 </A></B>
<P>
	The Parti Quebecois is responsible for passing of the 
Referendum Act. It participated in the work of the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission which, of course, was set up by 
the Liberal Party of the day. It participated extensively, 
intelligently and regularly in the commission's work. Moreover, 
the outcome of the commission's activities was very positive for 
Quebec. The Parti Quebecois also took part in the Charlottetown 
debate. It never refused to participate in this process. This, 
despite the fact that the federal government was proposing 
renewed federalism, a kind of draft project. We participated 
even though we were opposed. We were also involved in the 
1992 referendum, as I just mentioned.
<P>
	The Parti Quebecois has also taken an innovative step by 
introducing legislation to establish a permanent voters' list. 
Why then is the federal government refusing to co-operate with 
the party in power? It is all rather incredible. In my opinion, the 
main reason why the federalists do not want to take part in this 
democratic debate is that they have nothing more to say. It is that 
simple. They have nothing to offer.
<P>
	Over 35 years ago, Mr. Duplessis used to say we should get 
what belongs to us from Ottawa because we were cheated out of 
our areas of jurisdiction. That was back in 1936. I have a cassette 
tape in my car. I often listen to it, and I can say the speeches of 
today are exactly the same.
<P>
	Mr. Lesage said: Masters in our own house. Mr. Johnson, Sr. 
said: Equality or independence. Mr. Lévesque said: 
Sovereignty-association. Mr. Bourassa tried twice to improve 
things. He passed Bill 150 and gave it up later on. What a 
disgrace.
<P>
	We have been talking about this for a long time. The subject is 
definitely not new, at least not for me. In 1984, when I was 
elected with the Progressive Conservative Party, we talked 
about decentralization and accountability.
<P>
	The then Prime Minister, Mr. Mulroney, did all he could to 
give some dignity back to Quebecers. You will admit he paid a 
steep price for that. He tried to give Quebecers fairness, not 
privileges, but legitimate rights that they had been asking for, 
for decades. Mr. Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party 
was completely thrown out of Canadian politics by English 
Canada. There are only two members left. Why? Because Mr. 
Mulroney tried to give Quebec some form of legitimacy. That 
man ruined his political career to fight for the little legitimacy 
Quebecers need to develop further. This is the main reason why 
his party disappeared, and it is a well-known fact.
<P>
	In 1984, while I was campaigning in my riding, Mr. Lévesque, 
who was my MPP at the time, sent his people to support me. It 
really happened. Mr. Lévesque talked about the ``beau risque'' 
in those days. He said: The Tories seem well-intentioned, we 
will give them the opportunity to grant Quebecers the 
legitimacy they have been requesting for so many years. He 
said: Let us give Mr. Mulroney a chance. I just explained to you 
what happened to Mr. Mulroney for trying. In 1990, when the 
Meech Lake Accord failed, when the present Prime Minister of 
Canada made sure that it failed, it was just because he wanted to 
get into power and to win the election here in Ottawa. He won his 
election, but winning that way, on the backs of Quebecers, is not 
an honour. That is exactly what is going on.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Today, they are trying to tell us that the Parti Quebecois is not 
credible, that its bill is not legitimate. We know very well that 
what they are trying to do is strictly an excuse, because they do 
not know how to justify why Quebecers should stay in this 
federation. This federation is costing Quebecers an enormous 
amount of money. I will give you an example. It is an easy one 
that everyone knows, but they just need to be reminded. 
Quebecers are not naive. They are not drawers of water any 
more. They have been out of there for a long time. Quebecers are 
intelligent people. They are educated, they understand things. 
They understand very well that the Canadian federation has put a 
huge debt burden on their shoulders. Quebecers make up 25 per 
cent of the Canadian population. That means that the federal 
government is creating a debt of $10 billion a year for 
Quebecers, without their permission, because they are still a 
minority in this country.
<P>
	Canada has an accumulated debt of $550 billion and they are 
trying to convince us that this Canadian federation is good, that 
the country is rich. When we look at whether a country is rich or 
poor, we must also look at its debts. When they say that Canada 
has the highest standard of living in the world, we must 
remember that it is a standard of living that was bought on 
credit. Each year, we borrow money to buy food. If a family 
borrows every day to buy its groceries, it will maintain its 
standard of living but one day, it will go bankrupt. Canada is on 
the verge of going bankrupt.
<P>
	Just on the subject of money and the economy, we Quebecers 
do not want to be on this sinking ship. We must take hold of our 
destiny to be more efficient, to be more successful and to 
preserve our standard of living. To say that Canada still has the 
highest standard of living in the world is pure hypocrisy. It is 
crazy to think that.
<P>
	That standard of living has been bought on credit and they still 
keep doing it. The government does not have the courage to cut 
spending, because of the coming referendum. They continue to 
borrow on the backs of Quebecers to maintain an artificial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8846"> 8846 </A></B>
<P>
standard of living. We built an artificial economy and we make 
people believe  that the Canadian economy is doing well. It is 
pure hypocrisy. What we are going through is terrible. It is a 
disgrace. It is worse than the Second World War. If we continue 
on this road, Canada will be totally bankrupt in a few years. We 
are starting to feel it a little more every day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
must admit there is hope, since the hon. member of the Bloc 
Quebecois has said publicly that he was a member of the 
Conservative Party. Anyone who has the courage to admit that 
will certainly have the courage some day to admit his mistake 
and realize that his separatist strategy will not work. By that 
time, there will probably be no reason for his party to exist, and 
to do penance, he may have to join the two members of the 
Conservative Party and stay in purgatory for a while before he 
crosses the floor and joins the Liberal Party.
<P>
	It bothers me to put my question to the hon. member of the 
Bloc, because I realize the Bloc Quebecois does not represent 
the majority of Quebecers.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	It bothers me, because it is like asking the driver of a 
limousine to sell me his boss's car. However, since they speak 
for Mr. Parizeau, I will ask them the question.
<P>
	Last year, when we were elected as members of the Parliament 
of Canada, it was a big surprise for members of the Bloc 
Quebecois when they heard I spoke French, although I come 
from northern Ontario. An even bigger surprise for most Bloc 
members was the fact that, in northern Ontario, we have 
institutions for francophones: we have our own schools, 
universities, colleges and hospitals.
<P>
	So I will put the following question to Mr. Parizeau, through 
his messengers: Since you claim to defend the interests of 
francophones outside Quebec, will francophones outside 
Quebec have a role to play? Do you intend to set up another 
committee consisting of thirteen members of the Parti 
Quebecois and two others, perhaps a Franco-Ontarian and a 
Franco-Manitoban, to convince us that this is the way to go? 
How are you going to defend the rights of francophones outside 
Quebec? Are you going to say the same thing Mr. Lévesque said 
when he came to Sudbury, in my riding? He told 
Franco-Ontarians at Laurentian University: It is too bad for you, 
franncophones living outside Quebec, but we have too many 
problems in Quebec to have time to deal with yours. That is what 
Mr. Lévesque told us in Sudbury.
<P>
	So do not tell us you defend the interests of francophones 
outside Quebec but tell us what role you think we will play in 
this debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> First of all, Madam Speaker, I 
must say that I am proud to have been with the Conservatives for 
six years. It is not because I am against private enterprise. I am 
in favour of a suitable environment for the private sector, in 
order to create jobs. I think that party did a good job in this 
regard, even  though it did not have the guts, no more than the 
Liberals today, to cut spending. I would have wished that they 
cut more spending.
<P>
	Nevertheless, in 1990 I had the courage to resign, because I 
realized that there was nothing more to expect-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> After Meech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Yes, after Meech, of course. It was 
no longer possible to defend the interests of Quebec in Ottawa 
from within a federal party. It is not possible. To do so, you have 
to be free to speak. And the only way to speak freely on behalf of 
Quebec is to belong to the Bloc Quebecois, of which I am one of 
the founding members. This is why we can now speak freely on 
behalf of Quebec.
<P>
	We are the legitimate representatives of Quebec, since we 
won 54 seats out of 75. I consider that a strong legitimacy. 
Quebecers trust us and that is why they voted massively for us, 
especially French Canadians, I mean French-speaking 
Quebecers. Unfortunately we have not succeeded yet in rallying 
allophones and anglophones to our cause. I understand and 
respect their position.
<P>
	Regarding French Canadians outside Quebec, I must say that 
we made more statements and asked more questions regarding 
the interests of francophones outside Quebec than the Liberals 
ever did when I was sitting as a Conservative. What we want to 
do is help French-speaking communities all over North 
America.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, to 
begin, I would like to go back to what my colleague for 
Longueuil was saying. Along the same line, this morning, I read 
an article on the cost of sovereignty. The problem is that it did 
not mention the cost of federalism.
<P>
	In fact, we are forced to recognize that, for the past 25 years, 
we have seen the centralizing policies of the federal government 
turn a thriving country into one which is deeply in debt.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	No matter how loudly the Prime Minister claims in this House 
that we live in the most comfortable country in the world, our 
credit card bill is up to $550 billion. The end of the month is 
going to be something else!
<P>
	I would have liked to have had the time to mention all the 
disgraceful, useless expenses, all the waste originating on 
Parliament Hill and in various departments. Unfortunately I 
have only ten minutes. Therefore, I will focus on overlapping, 
duplication and the cost of federalism in general.
<P>
	Let us look at the various programs the federal government 
implements in Quebec and which compete, in one way or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8847"> 8847 </A></B>
<P>
another, with those Quebec is already offering because they are 
more in tune with our specific needs. Believe it or not, out of 221 
federal programs and 244 Quebec programs, 197 either overlap 
or duplicate another. That means that we could get rid of 197 
federal programs and Quebec would be better served for it.
<P>
	First, we are faced with redundant administrative activities. 
As part of their mandate, well-meaning federal civil servants 
are doing exactly the same thing as their provincial counterparts 
acting in accordance with their mandate specific to Quebec. We 
pay twice for people who do a good job, but who do it twice. 
Once would have been enough since the job was well done.
<P>
	There is worse. There is competition between various 
programs. Because, of course, the federal government wants to 
outdo the provincial government, it favours quantity over 
quality; the quantity of dollars it borrows, spends and, 
unfortunately too often, wastes. Occasionally, it resorts to 
conflict. We do not agree on targets. The federal program goes 
one way, while Quebec-and Quebec knows its constituency 
well and structures its objectives accordingly-goes another. 
Therefore, efforts and funds, instead of being pooled, are once 
again wasted.
<P>
	At times, the programs are in direct conflict with each other. 
Instead of one going one way and the other one, the other way, 
they run counter to one another. How often-and the public is 
aware of this-do lawyers go to  court to make representations 
on behalf of the federal government and object to 
representations on behalf of the Government of Quebec, whose 
lawyers are paid by Quebec taxpayers? It is our money that is 
financing this legal squabble. Duplication, overlap, waste.
<P>
	That is not all. Think of the poor citizens. I mentioned the 221 
federal programs and the 244 provincial ones. Ordinary people 
are completely lost. When you make an application to the 
federal government, you are asked whether you have already 
applied to the provincial government. If so, you have to wait for 
an answer from both the federal and the provincial governments. 
But the provincial government is waiting for the federal 
government to deal with the issue, with the result that the people 
are kept waiting and waiting and waiting, while the meter is 
ticking away on both sides. Such a waste!
<P>
	Finally, I must say that, on top of all that, is an unquantifiable 
factor-unquantifiable because this is money that we never 
see-and that is opportunity cost. While these programs shoot 
each other down or wander one way or the other, the public 
waits. And while the public is waiting, we let opportunities go 
by, right under our very nose. All this to say that there are 
lengthy delays and some people get so totally discouraged that 
they give up projects they could have completed otherwise.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	A case in point is manpower training. Two years ago, there 
were 25,000 people on a waiting list for training, but the federal 
government did not agree with the provincial government on 
required courses. Even the Quebec Liberals said that Quebec 
knew what the needs were.
<P>
	We are still waiting. Do you think that these 25,000 people 
who were looking for training are still waiting in line? No, they 
are no longer eligible, because they do not qualify for UI 
benefits any more. They are now on welfare and programs are 
shutting them out. It is a disgrace.
<P>
	The costs of federalism? Let us say quickly that federal 
institutions definitely lack the flexibility required to compete 
internationally. In fact, the federal system is inflexible by 
definition, despite what a certain minister may say, as 
demonstrated by the many failed attempts to reform it.
<P>
	Everything has been tried. We are not blaming the federalists. 
They tried everything. Mr. Lévesque, with the ``beau risque'', 
deeply believed in it. Mr. Bourassa tried until the last second to 
find some accommodation. It did not work. The system is 
inflexible, cast in concrete. Yet, international competitiveness 
requires great adaptability.
<P>
	I will close by addressing remarks made by some of my 
colleagues opposite, which I found almost insulting. We are 
talking about democracy, about the democratic process. We are 
talking about the question. You will agree with me, Madam 
Speaker, that if the finance minister's next tax increase was the 
subject of a referendum, you know very well that the people 
would vote against it and that this tax increase would never ever 
see the light of day.
<P>
	That would be democracy. But it will not happen that way. It 
will happen through phony consultations, through passage of 
this tax measure here in this House. Canadians will see tax 
increases of up to $120 billion, $125 billion, $130 billion, who 
knows?
<P>
	The Government of Quebec is now following a process whose 
conclusion will be decided by the people. The people will be 
able to say yes or no. That is democracy. That is how it should be 
done and I would urge my colleagues opposite to do the same 
when dealing with important issues. Our Prime Minister says 
that the question that should be asked is: Do you want to separate 
from Canada?
<P>
	I submit that Mr. Parizeau is asking an identical question and 
here is why. The Prime Minister's question essentially is this: 
Do you want to separate from the problem? What Mr. Parizeau 
says is this: Do you want to adopt the sovereignty solution? 
Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion. Mr. Chrétien is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8848"> 8848 </A></B>
<P>
entitled to his; he can keep his problem. Yes, Madam Speaker, 
everyone is entitled to his or her opinion. However-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would just like to ask 
the hon. member not to refer to the Prime Minister by name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Thank you, Madam Speaker. You are quite 
right and I conclude by saying that I am convinced that after a 
clear, vigorous debate, Quebecers will make a historic decision 
with clear minds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
member for Portneuf made a speech on the costs of federalism, 
but he forgot that all the costs always entail benefits as well. His 
colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe, who sits on the finance 
committee, himself estimated the costs of overlap and 
duplication at $3 billion. Even Mr. Le Hir, the PQ minister, 
estimated the costs of overlap at $3 billion.
<P>
	But in the magic formula, they always tend to forget one 
thing: Quebec receives $4 billion in equalization payments and 
Quebecers collect $1.2 billion in unemployment insurance.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	In their bill, will they say that Quebecers must cover 25 per 
cent of the national debt, as the member just said, which 
amounts to $550 billion and the costs that it will entail? Will 
they tell them that milk producers will lose their protection and 
that it will cost all milk producers millions, if not billions, of 
dollars?
<P>
	By chance, the member's calculations overlooked that Mr. 
Parizeau himself had said that all federal civil servants would 
keep their job and would be protected. Add that to the 
calculations and we get into the real debate on the costs of 
federalism versus the costs of separatism.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, I am glad that the member 
opposite is giving me a chance to set the record straight. First of 
all, Quebec has 18 per cent of federal civil servants and we pay 
25 per cent, so we save 7 per cent there. We must look the figures 
in the face.
<P>
	Looking at the balance between what Quebec pays and what it 
gets, we see that Quebec pays roughly $28 billion to this federal 
government here in Ottawa and gets about $28 billion back. That 
seems fair and equitable, but there is a very big difference. 
While Ontarians get their money back in federal contracts, 
research and development and other ways, we Quebecers get our 
money back partly as unemployment insurance and that is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	The cost of duplication and overlap may be $3 billion but that 
is only a small part of it. The real cost is the opportunity cost; 
while things are happening under our noses, nothing is being 
done. Opportunities are slipping away from us and they could 
amount to tens of billions of dollars. With an ability to act 
responsibly, debt problems would disappear.
<P>
	I have been told many times that the Government of Quebec 
will not be a better manager than the federal government. 
Totally false! For example, it costs the federal government $170 
a year to process an employee's pay while it costs the provincial 
government $70. Here alone, it costs us about 40 per cent of 
what it costs the federal government. I am not the one saying 
that; it is the Auditor General. Yes, we are more efficient and I 
am really eager to be able to prove it to the whole world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to the 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have two quick questions. The hon. member spoke of overlap 
and duplication. After one year, 60 or so programs no longer 
seem to overlap or duplicates one another. Was he aware of that? 
Is that not the direction in which we should be heading? I think 
that could be a solution.
<P>
	I wish to mention something else. For the sake of honesty, 
would it not have been much easier to simply ask Quebecers 
what they wanted: to stay in Canada or to separate? Honestly, it 
would have been much better to do this than to use such a  vague, 
fuzzy, imprecise word as «sovereignty».
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, a glass is either half empty 
or half full. We prefer to say that the glass is half full. And we 
will start by filling it. As for instances of overlap, you know as 
well as I do that sovereignty is the best way to eliminate them 
all.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the Official Opposition and the government of Mr. 
Parizeau are trying to convince Quebecers and Canadians that 
Quebec's separation is unavoidable, that federalism adversely 
affects development in that province, and that the consultation 
process recently announced is eminently democratic. At a time 
when countries want to unite together, including European 
nations, Quebec wants to separate.
<P>
	I wish to take this opportunity to correct certain facts and 
denounce some exaggerations and overstatement by those in 
favour of separation.
<P>
	Is Canadian federalism really an obstacle to Quebec's 
development? I usually do not agree with Mr. Parizeau's views.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	However, I must say that I think he is absolutely right when he 
says that Quebec has achieved a lot over the last 30 years.
<P>
	In his speech, Mr. Parizeau mentioned, among others things, 
that in the 1960s Quebec was a modern state with a dynamic 
cultural life, that in the 1970s it had become a leader in 
democratization and education, and that in the 1980s Quebecers 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8849"> 8849 </A></B>
<P>
had taken the reins of economic power and greatly increased 
their international presence. 
<P>
	Mr. Parizeau is absolutely right when he says that Quebecers 
should be proud of these exceptional achievements.
<P>
	But where I do not agree with him and those who support 
separation in general is when they say that Canadian federalism 
is hampering Quebec's development. How can they make such a 
claim when the facts show unequivocally that Quebec made 
tremendous progress over the last 30 years, while being a part of 
Canada?
<P>
	Indeed, it is within the Canadian federation that Quebec's 
quiet revolution got started and that companies such as 
Bombardier and Cascades were able to penetrate world markets. 
It is also within the Canadian federation that the work and talent 
of Céline Dion and the Cirque du soleil gained international 
recognition.
<P>
	Make no mistake. I am not trying to tell you that Quebecers 
became so successful strictly because of Canadian federalism. 
What I am saying is that it is wrong to claim that federalism has 
impeded Quebec's development.
<P>
	Is Canada really unable to recognize Quebec's specificity?
<P>
	In his speech, Mr. Parizeau said that the failure of the Meech 
Lake Accord indicated English Canada's refusal to recognize, 
even symbolically, that specificity. This statement does not 
seem fair to me.
<P>
	The Canadian federation recognized even before Meech and 
continues to recognize Quebec's specificity and to preserve the 
French fact, and not just symbolically. Let me give you some 
examples.
<P>
	Even in 1867, the Constitution Act guaranteed the use of 
French in Parliament and in courts. The Constitution Act of 
1982 reinforced this guarantee and made French one of the two 
official languages of Canada by recognizing its use in all 
institutions of Parliament and the government of Canada. Also, 
the Canadian Constitution allowed Quebec to pass language 
laws to promote French in Quebec.
<P>
	Under the Canadian Constitution, Quebec has jurisdiction 
over education and has a justice system based on the Civil Code, 
the only one of its kind in North America. Control over these two 
areas is crucial to preserve and enhance Quebec's specificity.
<P>
	Three out of the nine judges appointed to the Supreme Court 
must come from Quebec. None of the other provinces has such a 
guarantee.
<P>
	For any issue relating to education and culture, Quebec can 
opt out of any Constitutional amendment to transfer provincial 
powers to the federal government and get full financial 
compensation.
<P>
	Four consecutive immigration agreements have progressively 
increased the role Quebec plays in this area and let the province 
choose its immigrants and facilitate their integration into 
Quebec society. The Leader of the Official Opposition himself 
publicly recognized the merits of these federal-provincial 
agreements on immigration. Let me remind members that the 
other provinces do not have the same rights as Quebec does in 
the immigration area.
<P>
	According to the economic development agreement reached 
by Prime Minister Pearson and Mr. Lesage, then Premier of 
Quebec, during the 1960s, Quebec was able to create its own 
pension plan and set up its own deposit and investment fund.
<P>
	At the international level, Ottawa-Quebec framework 
agreements allow Quebec to sign agreements directly with 
France and Belgium and, pursuant to yet another agreement, 
Quebec has its own seat at the Francophone Summit, something 
other provinces do not have.
<P>
	All these examples show how biased and full of half-truths 
the separatists' rhetoric is.
<P>
	Canadian federalism is not so centralized or centralizing that 
it negates or irons out regional and provincial differences. In 
fact, Canada is one of the least centralized countries in the whole 
world. Canadian federalism is not against promoting the French 
fact. On the contrary, it contributes to the French influence in 
North America.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	To conclude, I want to say that the PQ option troubles me a lot 
as it does most Canadians, especially francophones outside 
Quebec.
<P>
	In British Columbia, most francophones are not only troubled 
but sad. Like me, they feel betrayed. In 1980, I fought with 
petitions and letters, etc, from Vancouver, to keep Quebec inside 
Canada. On the night of the referendum, I was extremely happy 
and, the next day, I gave the wives of eight Quebec police 
officers visiting Vancouver a rose and a note of thanks.
<P>
	I hope to be able to do the same next year, on the night of the 
referendum. This time, if Quebecers say no, I will give roses to 
my colleagues, the women of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have been listening to the federalist members of the House and it 
is as if they were trying to win the championship for 
overstatement. They call the process proposed by the 
government of Quebec a fraud, immoral, illegitimate and 
illegal. They call it a farce. We are criticized for not asking a 
clear question. Yet, as my colleague from Portneuf said, the 
question seems perfectly clear to me: ``Are you in favour of the 
Act passed by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8850"> 8850 </A></B>
<P>
National Assembly declaring the sovereignty of Quebec?'' I 
think that is crystal clear: ``the sovereignty of Quebec''.
<P>
	In fact, they are criticizing us for referring to a bill in which 
Quebec's sovereignty is defined. If you recall, Madam Speaker, 
in 1980, we were criticized for not defining our project. Now 
that we define it, we are criticized for it. We even go further by 
asking Quebec's population to participate in defining the 
sovereignty project. We asked Quebecers to help define the 
project. But still, we are told: How can you ask federalists to 
participate in writing a declaration of independence?
<P>
	I would say that our federalist colleagues are afflicted by two 
diseases: schizophrenia and amnesia. Schizophrenia because 
they have not yet realized that there is no federalist government 
in Quebec City any more, but a sovereignist government, and 
that the majority of members representing Quebec ridings in this 
House are also sovereignists. They are hit by amnesia because 
they refuse to acknowledge that when the Parti Quebecois 
formed the Official Opposition in the National Assembly, in 
spite of its political option, it recognized that a federalist party 
was in power and took part in the various initiatives introduced 
by that government.
<P>
	Members will remember that the Parti Quebecois spent 
hundreds of hours studying the Meech Lake Accord in the 
National Assembly and in committee, that it took part in the 
parliamentary committee which studied the federal 
government's offers that led to the Charlottetown Accord. 
Members will also remember that sovereignists participated in 
the Bélanger-Campeau Commission which proposed two 
alternatives, not ten but two: sovereignty and a last chance for 
renewed federalism. That last chance failed; it was the 
Charlottetown Accord. It failed miserably.
<P>
	So, in keeping with the conclusions contained in the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission report, which was signed by 
the Liberal Party in Quebec and the present Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, we are now moving toward the second alternative, 
which is sovereignty, since the first one failed.
<P>
	It is now our turn to ask our federalist colleagues to take part 
in the process. Why are we doing this? For two simple reasons: 
first, because the question will be submitted to Quebecers for 
approval very shortly and, if the answer is yes, federalists 
should help define what a sovereign Quebec should be.
<P>
	Second, the draft bill refers to an economic association with 
Canada; our federalist colleagues claim it is not possible. We 
want to keep the same currency; our colleagues claim it is not 
possible. We want to keep our citizenship; our colleagues claim 
it is not possible. We want to conclude international agreements; 
our colleagues claim it is not possible. We want them to explain 
to us why it is not possible, and that is exactly why we are asking 
them to take part in the work of these commissions.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I would invite the people of my riding of 
Verchères to attend the hearings of these commissions and also 
the people of the beautiful region where I live when I come to 
work here, the Outaouais region, who are particularly concerned 
about the consequences of the debate that will take place.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not think there is a 
question. Still, I would like to say something about the 
Charlottetown Accord. This agreement was rejected not only 
because of Quebec but also for a lot of other reasons, because the 
agreement proposed to Canadians was too vast, too complicated, 
and even people conversant with the issue could not understand 
the whole package in the Charlottetown Accord.
<P>
	I think that is why it was rejected, because Native people say 
the same thing, everybody says the same thing, namely that the 
Charlottetown Accord was rejected because of its complexity. I 
am talking about separation, not sovereignty. In British 
Columbia, everybody talks about separation. I am sorry, but I 
found Quebec in Canada on my arrival here; I think it is a great 
country and that we should stay together, especially since 
Quebecers have contributed much to Canada and because 
Quebec provides a dimension that Canada needs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
neither the Act of Union of 1842 nor the British North America 
Act of 1867 nor the Constitution Act of 1982 defines an orderly 
breakup of our great country. In the face of this fact, the reality 
is that all the many viewpoints put forth by the separatist forces 
in the absence of precedent are in many cases inaccurate 
projections about the way things will be in a sovereign and 
separate Quebec.
<P>
	I believe Canada will accept separatism if it is the result of a 
clearly worded referendum on the issue and reflects the will of 
the majority of Quebecers. But whoever said outside of Quebec 
that sovereignty association was a negotiable option? A new and 
better Canada requires four strong foundations. It needs four 
principles to stick to.
<P>
	First is responsible spending. Irresponsible government 
spending by this Liberal government, the massive debt it 
continues to add to and excessive taxation it proposes to put 
forward have weakened the financial foundation of the old 
Canada. We need to rebuild the new national home on the 
principle of financial responsibility. The federal government 
must balance its budget and keep taxes in check.
<P>
	Second is the equality of provinces and citizens. Our old 
Canadian home is built on the fault line which separates French 
and English rather than on the solid ground of what all 
Canadians have in common. It is undermined by the linguistic, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8851"> 8851 </A></B>
<P>
cultural and constitutional policies that do more to divide us 
than to unite us. We need to rebuild our national home on the 
principles that  all Canadians will be treated equally regardless 
of race, gender, language, culture, creed and that all provinces 
have the same powers and responsibilities over their own 
destinies.
<P>
	Third is democracy. Our old Canadian home is built on a 
system that serves the political elite and only allows your input 
at election time. We need to rebuild our new national home on 
the principle that you will have more say in how the national 
household is run. Elected officials will be accountable all of the 
time, not just at election time.
<P>
	Finally, a criminal justice system is the fourth principle, that 
is more effective, leaving less interpreted for judges, that 
recognizes victim rights over criminal rights.
<P>
	The reality of the consequences of Quebec separation will in 
many ways be very costly for all Canadians. Bloc Quebecois 
members claim that federalism has not, cannot and will not 
work. They point to the failures of the Constitution Act, and the 
Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords as sufficient proof. 
While I agree that these constitutional efforts represent failure, 
they failed everyone, not just Quebecers because the wrong 
people were negotiating the right things the wrong way, top 
down.
<P>
	What the premier of the province of Quebec is presently doing 
by first introducing a draft bill, passing it in the legislature of 
Quebec first and then going to the Quebec people is making the 
very same mistake. It is a top down approach. It is something 
that may not be accepted by the rest of Canadians in Canada. 
Therefore, it is imperative that when Quebecers and the 
provincial Government of Quebec look at this issue that they 
address it on the basis that the simpler the question the better.
<P>
	If Bloc Quebecois members are questioning why the federal 
government is refusing to participate in the discussions that will 
go across the province, it is because it has no solution. It is 
waiting for other people to step forward and the Reform Party is 
trying to fill that gap.
<P>
	I believe that in the province of Quebec the voters should be 
asked first, then a bill drafted and negotiated. Then the people of 
Quebec will have the legitimacy to begin negotiations with the 
rest of Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 5.15 p.m., it is 
my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every 
question necessary to dispose of the Business of Supply, 
pursuant to Standing Order 81(17).
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those in favour will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> In my opinion the nays 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Call in the members.

	The House resumed from October 26 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-226, an act to amend the Criminal Code, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I think you will find that there 
is unanimous consent for the following: if a recorded division is 
to be taken on the motion before this House this evening, that it 
be deferred until next Tuesday, at 5.30 p.m.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise tonight to speak to the bill tabled by the hon. 
member for York South-Weston, which would delete section 
745 of the Criminal Code. This section gives an opening to those 
sentenced to life imprisonment in Canada because they were 
found guilty of murder.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is simply to delete this section of the 
Criminal Code. When I read a bill like this one, I always feel 
embarrassed, because there are two aspects to be considered in 
such situations.
<P>
	First of all, we should put ourselves in the shoes of the victims 
and their families, who went through the horrible tragedy of 
seeing loved ones murdered. We say to ourselves: It is quite 
normal for people found guilty of such crimes to go to prison for 
the rest of their lives, since it was the sentence handed down by 
the court, the jury, the judge.
<P>
	Yet, other considerations must be taken into account. First, 
Parliament put this provision into the Code following the great 
debate held in the mid-1970s on the abolition of capital 
punishment in Canada.
<P>
	As you know, Canada abolished the death penalty in 1976 
following a great debate in Canadian society. Those opposed to 
doing away with the death penalty demanded that lawmakers see 
to it that the people convicted of first- or second-degree murder 
in some circumstances be incarcerated for life.
<P>
	However, Parliament introduced into the Criminal Code a 
provision allowing those who have served 15 years of a life 
sentence to apply for parole to the Chief Justice in their 
province.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8859"> 8859 </A></B>
<P>
	A whole process is then initiated to review their applications. 
A jury is empanelled to represent citizens and hear the 
application.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	This is not an automatic process, therefore, in that the 
application is reviewed. When making its determination, the 
jury must take into account the character of the applicant, his 
conduct while serving his sentence and the nature of the offence 
for which he was convicted.
<P>
	The members of the jury represent Canadian citizens and they 
must make a decision based on the information provided by 
prison authorities. They must decide whether to reject the 
application, accept it at a later time, or let the applicant be 
paroled. In other words, this provision in our Criminal Code 
does not mean that those who serve life sentences can be set free 
after 15 years.
<P>
	Why did Parliament introduce this provision in the Criminal 
Code? I believe it was felt, rightly so-as this was the prevailing 
philosophy back in the seventies and still is-that after a person 
has spent 15 years in jail, it might not be a bad idea to see if he 
should be paroled.
<P>
	This has nothing to do with erasing a past mistake or offence: 
It is simply a matter of providing the possibility of serving one's 
sentence outside, instead of being kept in jail. The whereabouts 
of a person released on parole are still monitored and the parolee 
must still meet a number of conditions in order to continue to 
qualify for parole.
<P>
	I think that the lawmakers were right to include this provision 
in the Criminal Code. They believed that after 15 years, a person 
who had committed a horrific crime could change, after thinking 
about we he had done and after receiving counselling from 
professionals while in prison. Of course, there are many people 
who believe-and this is somewhat the reasoning behind the 
motion of the hon. member for York South-Weston-that if a 
person has committed a crime and been sentenced to a certain 
number of years in prison, he must serve out his full sentence. 
He did what he did, the person must be locked up and a rigid 
approach must be taken.
<P>
	However, this mind-set seems to be characterized by 
vengefulness and the belief in an eye for an eye and a tooth for a 
tooth. It is an approach that denies the possibility that human 
beings can change and improve, that under certain 
circumstances, they can adopt a different attitude, and once 
released, they will no longer necessarily pose a threat to society.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say that since this provision was 
first introduced into the Criminal Code, of all the applications 
received, 128 have been deemed admissible. Of the 128 inmates 
concerned, 71 have actually applied for parole. Of course, many 
realized that because of their conduct and the nature of the crime 
they had committed, there was no chance at all of their being 
granted parole. Of all the applications received, only 43 have 
actually been reviewed. Some were turned down,  some saw 
their sentences reduced, and some were given a conditional 
release.
<P>
	I think it is fortunate that under our Criminal Code, 
individuals can take advantage of an opportunity like this one. It 
is not very permissive. Canadian citizens who are on the jury 
still have the right to consider the case and to pass judgment on 
behalf of society. We then have an opportunity to consider the 
individual's potential for rehabilitation and ability to make a 
valid contribution to society.
<P>
	I think Canadian society should be proud of having such 
provisions in its statutes. It shows we are not a closed society, 
not an intrinsically punitive society, and that we still provide 
certain opportunities for offenders who have served part of their 
sentence and who have rehabilitated themselves.
<P>
	I think everyone will agree it is normal for people who have 
committed a crime to be punished, and no one in my party wants 
to make it easy for these people, but I think it is important to 
have a provision on the books that shows we do not give up 
entirely on people who have the potential to be rehabilitated.
<P>
	Consequently, I will vote against the bill, because I believe 
that in Canada, this is a valid and useful provision to have in the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Fundy-Royal, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in this House to call for the repeal of section 745 of the 
Criminal Code. I speak today from my own beliefs and most 
important, the beliefs of the many constituents of the riding of 
Fundy-Royal.
<P>
	My riding has been concerned about the implications of 
section 745 for many months. Fundy-Royal residents have 
firm beliefs about justice. That sentiment can best be summed 
up in a few words: A life sentence should mean jail for life, or at 
least for 25 years. Under the present law that potentially has 
been in jeopardy.
<P>
	A petition campaign spearheaded by Constable Evan Scott of 
the Rothesay Regional Police in Rothesay, New Brunswick 
calling for the repeal of section 745 has been both welcomed and 
endorsed throughout New Brunswick. I gave the petition my 
support in a May 17, 1994 letter to the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	In the letter I expressed my view that to allow a judicial 
review for persons who may receive parole after 15 years for 
first degree murder, the worst possible crime in the Criminal 
Code, is unacceptable. I feel it is imperative to our judicial 
system that once an individual has been found guilty by his peers 
for a heinous crime that the sentence provided by the judge 
should be carried out in its entirety.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8860"> 8860 </A></B>
<P>
	I have chosen to speak on this bill today because I have 
examined the issues surrounding the section introduced in 1976. 
I have balanced the merits of those arguments with the values of 
my constituents and I find that the present legislation is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	The facts are staggering indeed. A criminal serving a 25 year 
sentence can be given a 40 per cent reduction in his sentence. 
Seventy-two per cent of the applicants under this section were 
allowed to walk out under early parole. Over the next 15 years 
there are approximately 600 killers who are eligible to seek 
early parole.
<P>
	Anyone can submit an application irrespective of the brutality 
of the crime and at public expense these applications are 
permitted to be made. Therein lies part of my problem with 
section 745. Can we imagine the financial cost to the public 
purse if each of the more than 600 convicted murderers in our 
prisons today filed for a reduction in their parole eligibility?
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	Imagine with that large number of cases the series of 
precedents which could be created. Section 745 could become 
an impressive mechanism that further restricts the rights of 
victims.
<P>
	For example, in the Queen v. Swietlinski, Judge O'Driscoll 
declared the victim impact statements inadmissible in a section 
745 procedure because they were intended to assist in the earlier 
sentencing process. Therefore they were not relevant to the issue 
before the jury considering the criminal's application.
<P>
	Public attitudes have changed since 1975. Today society 
overwhelmingly affirms that victims, and in the case of a 
murderer, the victim's family, should have a greater influence in 
the parole system. This belief is representative of the notion that 
crime affects society and the victim's family. It is no longer 
sufficient that the criminal's sentencing and parole be treated 
independently from the suffering of the victim's family.
<P>
	When section 745 was drafted its primary concern was how to 
integrate the convict back into society as quickly as possible. 
The procedure to determine whether a convict deserves an early 
parole eligibility is much easier for the convict than a regular 
trial.
<P>
	Let me share some examples I find troubling. The jury only 
needs two-thirds majority instead of 100 per cent agreement. 
Most of the evidence presented in the hearing comes from those 
who seek the convicts early release, not the victim's family.
<P>
	It appears to me that the process is structured in such a manner 
that the welfare of the victim's family is completely ignored. If I 
had to choose between this system and one that gives 
consideration to the victim's needs to believe that justice has 
been done I would choose the victim's rights every time.
<P>
	A thorough examination of section 745 warrants that hard 
questions be answered. Who is the Criminal Code supposed to 
protect? What is in the best interests of society? I think public 
confidence in the legal system is of the utmost importance in any 
democratic society. Is the Criminal Code to be weighted in 
favour of rehabilitation or the principle that a sentence for 
serious crimes must be implemented in full? Will criminals now 
realizing their opportunity to shorten their sentences by 40 per 
cent subvert the rehabilitation process? Will the public begin to 
regard 15 years as a life sentence? If this occurs the public wrath 
should be furious. Let us forgo that process and repeal section 
745.
<P>
	In closing I share the concerns of my constituents in 
Fundy-Royal, New Brunswick. The current method of 
determining a convict's eligibility must correspond with what is 
reasonable. Other members of this House have called for the 
repeal of section 745. They have often cited the high profile 
cases of Clifford Olsen who savagely raped and murdered 11 
young children.
<P>
	There is a case which occurred within my own riding. Less 
than two weeks ago a man who admitted he shot an innocent 
victim in the back 16 years ago was before a jury explaining why 
he deserved a reduction in his parole eligibility. When I heard 
about this case I hardened my resolve. I thought about the family 
of that victim.
<P>
	For his family and for the thousands of family members who 
will be in a similar situation as over 600 convicted murderers 
apply for early parole eligibility over the next 15 years, I ask and 
urge that section 745 of the Criminal Code be repealed so that 
justice can be done and a life sentence will mean at least 25 
years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank my colleague for his speech and also for 
producing the numbers. That will save me some time. I am here 
to support the private member's bill of the hon. member for York 
South-Weston to abolish section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Something rather strange happened to me a while ago. I had to 
cross the floor and was in the government lobby. One Liberal 
friend saw me there and said: ``Oh goody, you have seen the 
light''. Well, I have some bad news for him.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	I am really happy that some people from that side of the House 
have seen the light. They have seen the light to such poor 
legislation and are bringing forward a bill of this type and 
finding support for it even though it was a piece of legislation 
that was brought in a few years ago by the very same party.
<P>
	This section of course allows convicted murderers to apply 
for a review to lessen their period of parole eligibility. It gives 
them a process to return to society before serving their entire 
sentence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8861"> 8861 </A></B>
<P>
	Some of those speaking to this bill have their own opinions on 
why a convicted murderer should serve a life sentence for 
killing an innocent victim. Many would admit life should be 
life, or we in this House should bring back the death penalty. I 
would challenge the government of the day to seriously consider 
having a referendum to let the people of this nation decide 
whether we should have the death penalty.
<P>
	We are not here to argue that stand. We are here to argue why 
25 years in prison should be the minimum penalty for taking 
another life and how 25 years is just retribution for inflicting 
untold grief upon the family and friends of a victim of such a 
heinous crime.
<P>
	People have free choice. That free choice may include 
kidnapping, robbery or murder, taking another life. Notice the 
emphasis is placed on their choice to kill an innocent victim.
<P>
	When a murderer is convicted in court, the presiding judge 
decides from the evidence heard what the sentence should be. 
The judge listens to all the evidence. In a case that clearly 
demonstrates that the murderer had no concern for human life 
and no remorse for executing an innocent victim the judge 
knows a life sentence is just. In those circumstances, the judge 
knows 25 years without parole is the right sentence for the 
crime.
<P>
	I hear from the friends and families of murder victims how 
they become members of an exclusive club, a club whose only 
requirement for membership is having one of their own 
murdered. These club members cannot apply for a reduction of 
the life sentence given to them for their loved ones. The 
sentence which entitles them to be members of this exclusive 
club is indeed for life. Every day for the rest of their lives these 
club members will suffer. They will be filled with sorrow and 
will wonder what they could have done to prevent the loss.
<P>
	Those who murder do not have to serve a similar sentence. 
They are still alive. They still enjoy the company of others, the 
benefits of good food, excellent health care and recreation 
facilities. All this is paid for by the average hardworking 
taxpayers like those they killed. The only hardship murderers 
must endure is their restricted access to society. Yet section 745 
gives murderers a chance to reduce their separation from 
law-abiding citizens. That is not justice.
<P>
	That exclusive club has an annual fee. The fee is paid on every 
birthday, every Christmas, every occasion that family and 
friends gather. The memory of the murder victim continues to 
haunt their thoughts. They simply cannot apply to have their 
memories reduced. These club members will shed tears where 
there should be warm embraces and pleasant thoughts of times 
gone by and times to come. They receive no sentence reduction 
whatsoever.
<P>
	These club members are reminded every day of their loss, but 
that is not the only punishment this current justice system 
inflicts upon the survivors. This current justice system punishes 
the survivors further. The friends and family of a murder victim 
must endure further heartache when murderers apply for early 
parole. When murderers apply for early parole after 15 years 
they bring back all the terror and heartache that entered the souls 
of the family members at the time they were first told of the 
death.
<P>
	Why do we continue to punish those who are victims of crime 
and those who are innocent? I have listened to what a section 745 
hearing inflicts upon the survivors. They say they are once again 
forced to revisit the abyss, to relive the nightmare and all the 
pain and horror that goes with it. When a murderer applies for a 
section review of this nature, that is exactly what happens. What 
more needs to be said? What more evidence needs to be stated 
that section 745 must be repealed?
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	If Canadians look at the record of the Parole Board rulings, 
Canadians see patronage appointees who have little concern for 
murdered victims or their survivors. These appointees are 
notorious for listening to bleeding hearts who say the murderer 
has changed, he has remorse or he has found God and is 
intending to care for orphans and the elderly now.
<P>
	These appointees hear reports from psychologists or 
psychiatrists who have spent a minimum amount of time with 
the murderer and have decided the murderer has changed. If 
there is one thing for sure I have learned since becoming a 
justice critic it is that the worst psychopaths know how to work 
the system. They know how to con political appointees who only 
want to follow the mandate of a bleeding heart government. 
These bleeding hearts believe anyone can be rehabilitated or can 
feel true remorse for the most heinous of crimes.
<P>
	All that is needed to believe any political appointees can be 
conned is to remember that one out of three is given early release 
by past appointed employees of the Parole Board and one out of 
three returns to prison.
<P>
	Section 745 must be repealed so the members of this House 
can say to the survivors of murdered loved ones they have been 
given a life sentence, the least we can do is give the murderer 25 
years without parole. The most we can do is offer Canadians 
some minor peace in the knowledge that those who have 
committed the vilest of crimes will not have early parole.
<P>
	Let this House recognize the eternal sacrifice of those 
murdered and eternal pain suffered by their family and friends. 
Let this House support this bill to end section 745.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to point out one thing that was sent 
around by one of the members from the Liberal caucus as to 
reasons why we should not repeal this. It states: ``The Liberal 
Party has never advocated a system of justice based on revenge. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8862"> 8862 </A></B>
<P>
We do not adhere to an eye  for an eye or a tooth for a tooth, 
principles espoused by the Reform Party''.
<P>
	I resent that kind of a statement. What we are calling for is not 
revenge, it is called justice, something this government has not a 
clue about and it has demonstrated it year after year in all the 
legislation it has brought forward.
<P>
	I do believe that if this government wakes up and realizes 
there is such a word as revenge, and if we do not start providing 
justice to our society, revenge is exactly what we can look 
forward to. It had better wake up to the fact that Canadians are 
not happy with this justice system. If it does not believe me turn 
around and ask, it will find out or stand on any street corner in 
any city in this country and just ask them how they feel. I do not 
believe that is the Liberal way so I do not think we will look 
forward to seeing that happen.
<P>
	Please, I ask everyone here to seriously consider the victims. 
Remember the victims. Do not vote to keep 745.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise this evening to support the 
private member's bill put forward by the member for York 
South-Weston.
<P>
	Bill C-226 would repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code of 
Canada. Section 745 allows prisoners given a life sentence for 
such crimes as first and second degree murder the opportunity to 
apply for early parole after serving only 15 years of their life 
sentence.
<P>
	I want to give a little background. Section 745 was introduced 
in 1976 by the Solicitor General of the day who currently sits as 
the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. Section 745 was part of 
Bill C-84 and this bill also abolished capital punishment and 
established two categories of murder, first and second degree. 
Both categories of this horrendous crime carry minimum 
sentences of life imprisonment.
<P>
	Let me be clear. When Reformers and millions of Canadians 
speak of life imprisonment for despicable crimes such as 
murder, it must mean life imprisonment.
<P>
	A number of states in the U.S. have taken the right steps. They 
have abolished parole boards to ensure that criminals serve their 
entire sentence no matter how small or how large their crime.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	Here in Canada we maintain parole boards which increasingly 
come under fire for releasing dangerous criminals into our 
society. We maintain section 745, giving murders, people who 
commit horrendous crimes in our society, the opportunity to 
apply for early parole.
<P>
	As well, as I understand it their chances of being successful 
under section 745, under that appeal, are pretty good. As of May 
1994, 60 applications have been heard under this section and 43 
of these 60 have received some form of early parole. That is 
about a 72 per cent success rate. That is absolutely unacceptable 
in Canadian society.
<P>
	It is my opinion that if the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, who introduced Bill C-84, had his way 
ruthless killers would be out walking the streets after serving 
only 15 years.
<P>
	The member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce argues that keeping 
someone in prison for 25 years serves little purpose. For a crime 
as heinous as murder, I and millions of Canadians say that 25 
years are not nearly enough.
<P>
	In addition to the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce there 
are many other bleeding heart Liberals in this government who 
contend that 25 years-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I am proud to be one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> There are many other bleeding heart Liberals in 
this government who contend that 25 years in prison is a form of 
cruel and unusual punishment and that section 745 gives the 
prisoner some hope or something to look forward to after he has 
completed 15 years of his sentence.
<P>
	To them I say what about the cruel and unusual punishment of 
the victim? To them I say what of the cruel and unusual 
punishment inflicted on the victim's family or the victim's 
community? What of the cruel and unusual punishment that is 
inflicted on society as a result of the fear that is created from the 
knowledge that ruthless killers are out early and walking the 
streets? What about that cruel and unusual punishment? They do 
not speak of that when they talk about letting prisoners out early, 
about letter murders out on to the streets.
<P>
	The second chance that section 745 awards to criminals is 
denied to the victims and the victim's families. They do not have 
a second chance to undo a vicious crime such as murder.
<P>
	In a statement to the House on October 4, I brought to the 
attention of all members the fact that the Supreme Court of 
Canada had recently allowed a first degree murderer another 
chance at early parole under section 745 because during his first 
hearing the crown consistently and improperly appealed to the 
jury's passions. Does that mean the crown was describing the 
vicious crime this person had committed? This is improperly 
appealing to the jury's passions.
<P>
	It would do well for the bleeding heart Liberals opposite to 
listen to this. This man was convicted in 1986 for stabbing his 
victim 132 times-are you listening over there-and using five 
different knives in the process. Because of section 745 it is 
possible that this vicious killer will be out walking the streets 
after serving less than 25 years.
<P>
	In this specific case I would not hesitate to go beyond simple 
repeal of section 745. I would reinstate capital punishment for 
this kind of crime. At very worst this government, this House, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8863"> 8863 </A></B>
<P>
should recommend that such a vicious criminal spend the rest of 
his life behind bars.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	On July 5, 1994 the government created a national crime 
prevention council, no doubt at great expense to Canadian 
taxpayers. This council reports to the Minister of Justice on 
various crime prevention strategies. I would hope that this 
council would take note of the proceedings here this evening and 
consider advising the minister to abolish section 745 in the 
interests and safety of Canadians and our communities, and to 
bolster the sagging confidence level that Canadians have in the 
criminal justice system in this country.
<P>
	I would hope also that the bleeding heart Liberals present here 
tonight are listening to the speeches from their own colleagues 
and from members of the Reform Party. I would hope that this 
council would listen to the pleas of millions of Canadians who 
are crying for a reinstatement of the death penalty for crimes 
such as murder.
<P>
	There are some major problems with the procedure in the way 
applications are heard under section 745. For instance, under 
this section hearing the criminal cannot be subject to 
questioning regarding his offence. Give us a break in this 
country. However, he can give oral evidence as to his successes 
and what a good person he has been while in prison.
<P>
	There have also been cases in the past in which Correctional 
Services Canada has used the Privacy Act, if you can imagine, to 
deny the crown information relating to the criminal's behaviour 
in jail. This amounts to suppression of information which could 
have a profound effect on whether that person should be out.
<P>
	Last but not least, it is the taxpayers who are paying for these 
appeal hearings. In the light of these costs, it is absolutely 
incomprehensible that the bleeding hearts in this government 
would continue to support section 745.
<P>
	The continuation of section 745 is simply not acceptable to 
the victims of ruthless killers in this country. It is not acceptable 
to the Canadian people. I hope that the bleeding hearts in this 
government, in this Parliament, will for once listen to the voice 
of the Canadian people.

the question?

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GUNCONTROL">GUN CONTROL</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, yesterday I addressed a very simple question to the 
Minister of Justice. I do not think the seven million gun owners 
out there will be very pleased with his response.
<P>
	The minister dismissed opposition from the provinces of 
Saskatchewan and Alberta justices ministers, saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have a decent respect for the opinion of my provincial and territorial 
counterparts but in the final analysis this is a matter for this federal government 
to deal with.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As I said in my question yesterday, the legislative assembly of 
the province of Saskatchewan has voted unanimously, all three 
parties, to oppose any further gun controls. The chief law 
enforcement officer for the province of Saskatchewan has 
written to the minister expressing his government's opposition. 
He is concerned about how he will be able to enforce gun control 
laws which the majority of voters in the province know are 
unfair and unnecessary to control violent crime.
<P>
	In September the minister told over 10,000 law-abiding, 
responsible gun owners that he is not interested in making laws 
by taking a head count and yet he continually refers to bogus 
polls, which is a head count, to support his biased view that the 
majority of Canadians actually support his useless, ineffective 
gun control proposals.
<P>
	A Ph.D. with 30 years of experience who teaches an honours 
research design and analysis course at Concordia University 
described an Angus Reid poll on gun control as fraudulent, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8864"> 8864 </A></B>
<P>
saying his students found a dozen fatal flaws in the five 
questions asked in the minister's favourite poll and stated: ``Any 
student who submitted  such biased questions would fail the 
course''. This is what the minister is appealing to.
<P>
	When a Gallup poll asked a well worded question, 69 per cent 
of the respondents felt passing more severe laws over legitimate 
gun owners would have very little influence on criminals. This 
is the exact opposite view expressed in the minister's oft quoted 
poll.
<P>
	If the minister is going to govern by polls then he must ensure 
that the polls ask fair and unbiased questions. Further, if he 
really believes in implementing laws which reflect the will of 
the majority, he should at least allow the members of this House 
to have a free vote on the gun control proposals.
<P>
	Frankly, I do not think the minister is a big believer in true 
democracy or direct democracy. I think his answer to my 
question yesterday proves that specifically.
<P>
	I specifically asked the minister if he had taken a head count 
of all the justice ministers in this country to find out which of 
them support his proposals and which do not. The Minister of 
Justice answered ``we govern by what is right'', referring to the 
Liberal gun control proposals tabled last week in the House of 
Commons. He dictated that this is the government's assessment 
of what is right.
<P>
	What have Canadians learned from the minister's reply? We 
learned that he has indeed consulted ``with officials of every 
provincial and territorial attorneys general ministry'' but that he 
does not care what they think. He is going to do whatever he 
thinks is right, not what the majority of Canadians think is right, 
not what the provincial justice ministers think is right even 
though they are the ones who have to enforce these ineffective 
gun control laws, not what the police on the street think is right, 
not even what the provincial legislators think is right, and 
certainly not what the majority of our municipal governments 
think is right.
<P>
	His only justification for this intrusive and costly 
bureaucratic, make work project is that he and the Liberal 
cabinet think it is right. If Canadians thought for a moment that 
registering their rifles and shotguns and confiscating guns from 
law-abiding firearms owners might actually reduce violent 
crime and stop criminals from acquiring guns, they might 
actually support him. But they do not.
<P>
	They know criminals do not obey any laws, especially gun 
control laws, and criminals will always be able to get their guns.
<P>
	In conclusion, unfortunately democracy and majority rule 
take a back seat to what the Liberals think is right. Frankly, I fear 
a government that will not listen to the people a lot more than I 
fear a law-abiding citizen with a gun.
<P>
	I ask my question again: Has the minister taken a head count 
of all the justice ministers in this country to find out which of 
them support his proposals and which do not and could he share 
the results of this head count with all Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted to have the opportunity to respond on behalf of the 
Minister of Justice. While there were a number of comments in 
the hon. member's intervention that I could answer I shall 
somehow find the fortitude to resist.
<P>
	I am certain that all Canadians support the initiatives of the 
government that enhance the safety of our communities, 
whether those communities are urban or rural. The criminal and 
accidental misuse of guns is just as prevalent in the rural areas of 
Canada as it is in the urban areas.
<P>
	Studies show the homicide rate in rural areas is 50 per cent 
higher than in the urban environment. In Saskatchewan, for 
example, between 1989 and 1992 there was an average of 5.1 
suicides by firearms for every 100,000 residents compared to 
the national average of 3.8.
<P>
	The legislation that will be introduced in the new year will not 
prevent farmers and ranchers, hunters or target shooters from 
using their firearms for recreational pursuits, in the case of 
ranchers for predatory control purposes. The minister has made 
this very clear during his extensive discussions and 
consultations with firearms' owners and users in all areas of the 
country.
<P>
	The government's first objective, supported by all firearms 
interest groups, is to increase criminal sanctions for the use of 
firearms in the commission of crime. Second, and receiving 
broad support, are moves that will be made to control and 
penalize the illegal trafficking and smuggling of firearms. The 
last major objective is to address the ownership and use of all 
firearms in Canada.
<P>
	I believe, this side believes, the government believes that our 
gun control law is accepted by a great number of Canadians. I 
am so glad to see the new politics from these gentlemen.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5) the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.07 p.m.)
