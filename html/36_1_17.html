</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to reintroduce a

It amends the Referendum Act of Canada.  Its purpose is to allow 
the people of Canada to actually do what democracy allows them to 
do and that is to rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view more mechanisms are needed for the people of Canada

accordance with Standing Order 36, I would like to present a 
couple of petitions on behalf of the people in Medley and 
Edmonton, Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners state that there 
are profound inadequacies in the sentencing practices concerning 
individuals convicted of impaired driving charges.  They think 
that Canada must embrace a philosophy of zero tolerance toward 
individuals who drive while impaired by alcohol or drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the petitioners pray and request that 
Parliament proceed immediately with amendments to the Criminal 
Code that will ensure that the sentence given to anyone convicted 
of driving while impaired or causing injury or death while 
impaired reflects both the severity of the crime and zero 
tolerance by Canada toward this crime.  The sooner we act on that 
the better.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have another enormous petition which conforms to Standing Order 
36.  It is signed by literally thousands of residents in the Edmonton, 
Sherwood Park, northern Alberta area and by many other people 
across Canada who are talking about the dreadful murder of Susan 
Klassen of Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This petition comes from her sister, Brenda MacDonald, in my 
constituency and from deeply concerned citizens.  They believe 
that the provocation defence as it is currently used in femicide 
and wife slaughter cases inappropriately and unjustly changes the 
focus of the criminal trial from the behaviour of the accused 
to the behaviour of the victim who, from then on, is 
identified as the one responsible for the accused violence.  It 
is shameful and it is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, it is not consistent with the 
constitutional rights of women, including their right to equal 
protection and benefit of the law and the right to life, liberty 
and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of people pray that the defence of provocation 
be dealt with in the Criminal Code just as soon as possible.  I 
urge the justice minister to do that.

present a petition this morning from many 
constituents of Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre and other parts of 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are very concerned about the pricing of gasoline in 
this country.  They feel that the price of gasoline is set by all 
companies in an unjustified manner.  They believe that since 
energy is a key component and the most fundamental component of 
our economy, there should be some control of its 
pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They call on Parliament to set up an energy price 
review commission to keep gasoline pricing and other energy 
products in check.

petition which is a joint effort between Canadians from the 
province of Quebec and Canadians from across Alberta, my own 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group of people are very concerned about the unity of our 
country.  They ask Parliament and the Prime Minister of

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my honour and privilege to present them on her behalf. 
There are some 500 signatures from her riding, another thousand 
from the lower mainland and several hundred from the prairie 
provinces.  It has to deal with the issue of age of consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These petitioners ask Parliament to consider changing the age of 
consent from 14 to 16, which could assist in the prosecution of 
adults who buy sex from young people because the adult could then 
be charged with sexual assault.  It would not be necessary to 
prove some of the other things that are necessary under the 
current Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efforts of these people to try to make the streets safer for 
young people and to try to make it difficult for predators to 
prey on young kids are a laudable effort.  I support their goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that many of the people who signed their names 
here are teenagers who feel that the current law needs to be

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—UNEMPLOYMENT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK35">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House comdemns the 
Government's use of high unemployment to meet targets on the 
deficit and inflation, its refusal to set targets and 
timetables for reducing unemployment, its failure to make 
adequate investments in health care, education, training, 
culture and the environment, and its pursuit of a monetary 
policy obsessed with future  inflation and blind to the 
immediate human tragedy of 1.4 million unemployed Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to 
enter this debate on the first NDP opposition day not just of 
this parliamentary session but the first NDP opposition day in 
four years since the New Democratic Party was re-established as 
an official party in the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion has been read into the record.  A short version of 
the motion is simply that this house condemns the government for 
its failure to make jobs the number one priority, to make jobs 
the real priority of its economic policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of the argument is quite simple.  It is quite 
straightforward.  It will not be the first time that members have 
heard me say this and it will not be the last time they will hear 
New Democrat members of this Parliament say it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government can set and meet targets to reduce inflation, 
to reduce the deficit, then the government can set and meet 
targets to reduce unemployment.  It is such a straightforward 
argument that it is of increasing concern and an increasing 
puzzle to Canadians why the federal government just does not get 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 84 consecutive months unemployment in Canada has been at or 
above 9%.  Yet a couple of weeks ago when inflation reached 1.8% 
the government decided that this called for decisive action.  The 
government rushed to support the Bank of Canada in its decision 
to hike interest rates to prevent the boom and bust effect of 
economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One Canadian said something to me which I think expressed the 
sentiment of a lot of Canadians: “Doesn't the federal government 
get it that for a lot of people in this country the economy has 
been a bust-bust economy for a good many years?”  They do not 
recognize any signs at all or any threat of a boom and bust 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are asking themselves if the government feels 
compelled to act decisively when inflation reaches 1.8%, what 
level would unemployment have to reach before the government 
would finally act decisively on the unemployment crisis?  With 
inflation at 1.8% and unemployment above 9% it does not take an 
accountant or a statistician to see which is the bigger problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the Minister of Finance took time out from his hectic 
schedule of meetings with the business community to tell 
Canadians that the books are in the best financial shape they 
have been in in 26 years and that Canadians should be grateful. 
The Halifax <I>Herald</I>, the daily newspaper in my city, said it 
all in the headlines: “`The books are fine”, says Martin, but 
the real question is whether the lives of Canadians are fine”. 
If we look at the Liberal rhetoric and set it aside and look at 
the actual Liberal record, it is a very different picture.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of this decade 320,000 more Canadians are 
unemployed. The average family income has dropped by $3,000 and 
52,000 more Canadians every year are declaring bankruptcy, and 
child poverty increased by 25%.  That is not only a national 
disgrace, it is a national tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the minister's friends at the BCNI applaud his slavish 
devotion to deinvesting in health care and education, he is not 
winning applause from Canadians who are battered and bruised by 
the single minded obsession with inflation, or from Canadians who 
are enduring the pain of the reduction of health care services, 
or from Canadians whose access to education is being blocked 
because of the government's withdrawal of support to education 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is perverse that this government continues to use high 
unemployment as a deliberate strategy as a specific means to meet 
its targets on deficit and inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's policy of choking off economic growth, which is 
why the Minister of Finance says we need to hike interest rates, 
is surely madness and shortsighted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time once again to reinvest in our important health and 
education programs which after all are the key to a highly 
productive economy and a healthy workforce.  It also is one of 
the most important, most efficient, most effective ways we can 
produce jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no shortage of ideas on how we can produce jobs in this 
country. There is a severe absence of the political will to make 
jobs the number one priority, which Canadians desperately need 
this government to finally do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be wrong with working together with the managers of 
worker pension plans to invest in environmental retrofit of both 
public and private buildings?  The energy savings that would be 
effected would repay the loans from such a pension fund, enjoying 
a fair return to the fund.  The use of fossil fuels would be 
reduced to protect our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be wrong with eliminating the GST from a selection of 
essentials and increasing the tax credit?  Such tax relief of 
just over $1 billion would result in the creation of 19,000 jobs, 
a far more effective way to achieve jobs than any proposal that 
has come from either the Reform Party or the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be wrong with requiring banks to reinvest a 
reasonable share of their deposits in the communities where they 
originated?  More investment in our communities means more small 
and medium size businesses and more jobs for unemployed 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be wrong with a community reinvestment act similar to 
that in the United States which could create as many as 60,000 
jobs a year without the government's having to spend one red cent 
of public money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be wrong with the government's recommitting itself to 
support social housing, co-op and non-profit housing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the Minister of Finance say last week in his statement 
to the finance committee that there are some things the 
government can and must do.  Surely addressing the need for 
Housing when it is particularly job intensive is one thing the 
government must and can do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I want to share my time with my colleague from 
Qu'Appelle so I will wrap up at this point in this very important 
debate by referring to a forum that took place in my riding last 
week.  It was sponsored by students at Saint Mary's University in 
consultation with students from throughout the Halifax 
metropolitan area.  The forum's theme was “you have the power to 
make the difference, now use it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely gratifying that more and more students, more and 
more young people and their families, more of the 1.4 million 
unemployed Canadians, more of those who are underemployed, and 
there are more underemployed than unemployed, that all of these 
Canadians increasingly are understanding that they do have the 
power to make a difference and they are going to use it.  We look 
forward to working in collaboration and in consultation with them 
to ensure that we make a difference in forcing this government to 
finally make jobs the number one priority in its economic 
policies.

would like to ask the leader of the NDP a question which has been 
raised to me by my constituents from time to time.  I have not 
been able to confirm the accuracy of the claim and it would be 
helpful to have this put into the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous constituents have contacted me over the last year or so 
to say they have heard reports that it is easy for the hon. 
member to be a socialist because she inherited a significant 
amount of money, that she is actually quite wealthy and it is 
very easy for her to go around the country saying all these 
wonderful things about how the government should spend more money 
when she does not have to worry about anything herself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask her a couple of questions.  Is it true that 
she indeed is quite wealthy?  If she is, why does she not spend 
some of her own money as she suggested the banks should do to 
create jobs and relieve poverty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find the member's 
question truly astounding. I have to say that it is precisely 
that kind of cheap politics that erodes public confidence in 
politics these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very tempting to say to the member that it is not his 
business to know what the personal circumstances are of 
individual members of Parliament.  Let me take the opportunity 
since that member has had the audacity and frankly the ignorance 
to stand up in this House to ask that question to make it clear 
that it is not his business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of public record that when my father died four 
years ago after a desperate struggle with Alzheimer's I did not 
inherit one single cent.  I did not inherit any money because 
my father believed in a country that is not based on herited 
wealth.  He believed that we should have a fair tax system in 
this country that redistributes wealth in a way that would 
enable, in fact require, the Government of Canada to invest in 
health care for all, not just for the privileged, to invest in 
education for all, not just for those who can pay high tuition 
fees, to invest in jobs for all, not just for those who happen to 
come into their jobs through nepotism or patronage or through 
being well connected with the corporate elite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make not one single apology for my father's success as a 
businessman in this country who was absolutely committed to 
working in effective partnerships between the public and the 
private sectors.  Nor do I make one single apology for the fact 
that my father struggled and worked throughout his lifetime to 
try to advance a social democratic Canada and the policies for 
which we continue to struggle in this Parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I also would like to remark that I found the type of questioning 
which was directed to the leader of the New Democratic Party to 
be rather disgusting in a place which frankly should be above 
that kind of personal attack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would find myself not agreeing in many instances with the hon. 
leader of the New Democratic Party but I at least respect the 
legacy of the New Democrats having come from a labour family. My 
father was the national director of the United Steelworkers of 
America for 20-some years.  I know the dedication and hard work 
which were put into developing social policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should give credit where it is due.  The New Democrats can 
indeed take some credit for some of the social programs which 
exist in this country, not the least of which is medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I would ask the leader of the New Democratic 
Party to explain to this House how that party's policies will 
work for Canada.  We have seen what happened in the province of 
Ontario from 1990 to 1995. We have seen the devastation that 
occurred as a result of some of those policies which may have 
seemed good on paper but in reality did not stand the test of 
good government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Halifax for a 
brief reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is very hard to give 
a brief reply to a question which asks me to analyse the five 
year record of the Government of Ontario under the New Democratic 
Party. Let me say briefly two things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is that some of the difficulties which the New Democratic 
Party encountered in its five years in office in Ontario had to 
do with the financial chaos and some of the failed policies which 
it inherited from the Liberal government which preceded it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it has to be recognized that as a result of the free 
trade deal into which the government plunged us with the Liberals 
giving their endorsement having initially said that it should be 
renegotiated, the province of Ontario suffered the largest job 
loss of any government in the history of this country in a short 
period of time.  That of course had immense implications for a 
government trying to deal with that situation in the midst of a 
recession, at the same time that the federal Conservative 
government, followed and accelerated by the Liberal government, 
was offloading and downloading federal responsibilities left, 
right and centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes it is true that Ontario was reeling.  The tragedy that we 
see today is the hardship which was created by the current 
Conservative government.  It effectively has been a partner in 
crime with the federal government in its continued offloading and 
downloading of costs and services to the municipalities and on to 
the backs of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no short answer to this question, but I look forward to 
many weeks and months of debating the real issues which underlie 
the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the federal and 
provincial governments in this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
most important challenge facing us today in this country is 
putting Canadians back to work, putting Canada back to work.  We 
now have 1.4 million Canadians who are unemployed, 1.6 million 
Canadians who are underemployed or who have just dropped out of 
the workforce and millions more on welfare across this country. 
Officially 9% of the Canadian population is unemployed.  Our 
challenge is to figure out ways to put these people back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say at the outset that I am an optimist. 
We have an opportunity now.  We have turned the corner in terms 
of the fiscal crisis in the country.  We can now turn our 
energies and resources toward setting goals and targets to put 
the Canadian people back to work and to build a strong and robust 
economy to make this country the greatest country in the new 
millennium.  This is the challenge and that is what we have to 
do.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad commentary in our country when we have more food 
banks than we have McDonalds, when we have people who are living 
on welfare, in poverty and without decent housing.  Farmers are 
going bankrupt. Students are dropping out of universities because 
they cannot afford the tuition fees.  It is a sad commentary when 
we come from the wealthiest country in the world yet so many of 
our people do not have an opportunity to do what they want in 
life, to have a decent job, a decent trade and a decent skill in 
order to raise their families. This is a national disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have the same determination and zeal to fight the war 
on unemployment and to set targets and goals as this country has 
had on the war on the deficit and setting targets and goals over 
the last five or six years. This makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagreed with many of the ways the government tackled the 
fight on the deficit.  I disagreed with many of the provinces in 
the way they fought the deficit.  But at least there was a plan, 
there was a goal and a timetable.  Now we should do the same 
thing when it comes to fighting for jobs in the country and for 
putting the Canadian people back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Blair has targets and timetables in terms of youth 
unemployment in Great Britain.  The same thing is being done in 
other countries around the world, so why can we not do that in 
this country?  I am afraid now that the finance minister has 
wrestled the so-called inflation demon to the ground he is going 
to allow interest rates to rise and slow down the economy and add 
to more unemployment in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at what happened in the past, it was not government 
programs that caused the debt in this country, it was the 
interest rates.  A couple of years ago a study by Statistics 
Canada showed that 50% of the debt was caused by high interest 
rates.  Only 6% of the debt was caused by government programs. 
The other 44% was caused by tax expenditures and tax loopholes 
and the failure to have a fair tax system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It worries me when I see stories in the paper about the 
possibility of interest rates rising once again.  We have this 
great inflation demon raising its head again.  Inflation is 1.8%. 
With inflation at 1.8% and 9% of our people unemployed and the 
Canadian dollar sitting at about 73¢ American, why is the 
government now concerned about fighting inflation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government is going to do is cool down the economy. It 
has already raised interest rates twice this year.  In all 
likelihood it is going to increase interest rates again in the 
next few days, certainly within the next week or two.  When it 
does, the banks increase their lending rates to small business, 
homeowners and farmers and the whole economy slows down. People 
lose their jobs, people are laid off and the wage fare is once 
again going to remain flat and stagnant in the months and years 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge is to get out and do whatever we can as a nation 
to put our people back to work.  To make sure, the Minister of 
Finance in his talks with Mr. Thiessen, the governor of the Bank 
of Canada, should say that a 1.8% inflation rate is not too high, 
it is not too dangerous and it will not hurt the economy. Instead 
let us keep interest rates in the country low so we can stimulate 
the economy and put Canadian people back to work.  This is 
extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to look at the negative part in the manner in which the 
government fought the debt and deficit.  Only 6% of the deficit 
is caused by the government's programs.  About one-half of the 6% 
was spent on social programs.  Because of the cutbacks of 
billions of dollars we have many needless victims of the war on 
the deficit.  I think of the people who go to the food banks, 
those living in poverty.  There are the cutbacks in the health 
care system, the line-ups in the emergency rooms, people waiting 
to get into hospitals and the cutbacks in transfers to the 
provinces for health, education and social programs.  There is 
tremendous poverty and third world like conditions on many of our 
First Nations reserves and in the inner cities.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the victims of the war of the Minister of Finance on 
the deficit.  It did not have to happen.  The natural growth in 
the economy because of the drop in interest rates in the last few 
years would have been enough to bring down the deficit within the 
targets the Minister of Finance set two or three years ago.  He 
did not have to leave a carnage of victims across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I warn the government that if it listens to the 
Governor of the Bank of Canada and the Minister of Finance we 
will be back in the same old vicious cycle of higher interest 
rates, fewer jobs, flat wages and people suffering because of the 
monetary and fiscal policies of the government across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we need more money spent on health and education.  We 
have to restore at the minimum the funding that was there two or 
three years ago before the beginning of the cutbacks.  We have to 
restore transfers to the provinces in these important areas. We 
also need a sensible targeted tax cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are suggesting dropping the GST entirely on some essential 
goods in Canada such as children's clothing and books and 
increasing the tax credit for low income people, an expenditure 
that would cost about $1.2 billion which would not only be a 
relief to people who need it the most but would create jobs in 
terms of stimulating the economy.  These are some of the things 
that need to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be introducing a motion very shortly in the House to 
establish a community reinvestment act, an act that is very 
similar to what we see in the United States.  It would require 
banks and financial institutions to invest a certain proportion 
of the money they take out of a community back into the 
community.  That is a way of creating jobs.  More important, it 
is one way of trying to rectify some regional inequities in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have a recovery, so they say, but the recovery is very 
unequal.  The recovery is primarily in four or five regions of 
the country:  Alberta, southern Ontario and two or three other 
regions.  In much of the country there is no recovery.  In much 
of the country there is still a great recession.  In much of the 
country people are still going hungry and there is still poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way of trying to redistribute income and opportunities a bit 
is to have a community reinvestment act where banks and financial 
institutions have to invest a certain amount of the money in 
deposits they receive from a community back into the community. 
Those are some things that can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a great opportunity.  We have turned the page.  We have 
a new parliament that is much more balanced than the parliament 
we had in the last three or four years, a parliament that can be 
much more progressive.  The government must change its ways and 
get off that neo-conservative agenda of the Margaret Thatchers 
and the Ronald Reagans it has been following in the last four 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to stop listening to the Reform Party which 
wants to make it more conservative than Conservatives and start 
listening to the people who want a good, progressive government 
which gets involved and shows some leadership from coast to 
coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want a strong government that tries to correct 
inequities. They want a strong government that supports social 
programs and social spending.  They want a strong government that 
once again will show some leadership in making the number one 
issue in the country the creation of jobs by setting targets and 
timetables; by keeping down interest rates; by having targeted 
tax cuts; by investing in people, health, education and social 
services; and by investing in research and development.  Then we 
will build a strong and competitive economy and make Canada the 
best country in the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel (Secretary of State (Science,

colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, with respect to the additional spending he mentioned in 
certain areas that obviously could use that kind of assistance, 
does he have any indication of the costs involved?  He mentioned 
a number of proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, with regard to reductions in certain tax measures, how 
much would that cost the federal treasury?  If we were to look at 
both the expenditure levels and the dollars lost in terms of the 
adjustments to some programs that he suggested, could he put them 
in the current framework of the deficit and the debt?

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have two very brief questions with respect to his 
intention to have banks invest some of their profits.  Has he, 
his party or anyone else done an analysis of how much money is 
involved, what it would produce in actual tangible results and 
what impacts there might be on the operations of banks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, might they need to or feel they need to do 
something in terms of reduction of employees? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a final question.  Are there lessons to be learned from 
the New Democratic governments in power today?  I do not say that 
facetiously or tongue in cheek.  For example, in British Columbia 
and Saskatchewan, unless I am badly informed and I do not think 
that is the case, there are opportunities in terms of some 
proposals made by my colleague that have not been followed up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps he would answer those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will take these 
questions very briefly in reverse order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we learn from the NDP government in Saskatchewan? 
Indeed we can learn from most governments across the country.  In 
Saskatchewan, in particular, when the cutbacks came from the 
federal government in health and education, the provincial 
government backfilled those cutbacks so that spending was at 
least stable in those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spending has not increased in constant dollars or in real 
dollars because inflation has gone up.  We still have a problem 
in that province in terms of spending on health and education, 
but that problem is not as severe as elsewhere because the 
Saskatchewan government backfilled the lost federal dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing happened when it came to some cutbacks in areas 
involving Indian and Metis people.  Again the provincial 
government tried to backfill some of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence, along with Alberta we have the lowest 
unemployment rate anywhere in the country.  It is under 6% and it 
has been consistently under 6% for a long time.  That is better 
than my hon. friend's province of Manitoba which has a similar 
economy.  One reason for it is investment in social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently Saskatchewan is the first province in the country to 
balance its budget.  That happened three or four years ago. There 
have now been four successive surpluses in the province and a 
commitment by the province to spend a third of a surplus on new 
spending for health and education, about a third on tax cuts and 
a third to pay down the accumulated debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can learn from the Government of Saskatchewan that investing 
in social programs is a good idea for helping the people and for 
creating jobs.  That is a legacy of the Saskatchewan CCF and NDP 
with Tommy Douglas, Woodrow Lloyd and Allan Blakeney.  I know the 
member in a previous incarnation was very proud of some of those 
programs in terms of the ideas he promoted in the province of 
Manitoba, and I hope he still is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I will go to the banks.  I am not talking about an act that 
would force banks to invest a proportion of their profits in 
communities but an act that would force banks to invest a certain 
percentage of their deposits in the community where its deposits 
were drawn from.  We would tailor it after what exists in the 
United States.  Economists who have looked at say that it would 
create about 60,000 new jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make one final point.  Just reinvesting money again into 
health and education to bring us up to the levels of the federal 
government before the cutbacks would cost about $7 billion.  That 
would be a very positive thing for the government to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

Canadians about what we have been able to accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government took office we had a deficit of $42 billion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>During that period we have seen our national debt peak at $583 
billion.  In the last year we have been able to pay that down by 
$11 billion.  This is not an abstract exercise in dealing with 
the deficit and debt.  We have seen very practical results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of our prudent fiscal management, monetary and 
fiscal policy since we first took office, we have seen interest 
rates fall by a full five percentage points.  From two percentage 
points over the American rate to below short, medium and long 
term U.S. interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of weeks ago when interest rates went up only 25 basis 
points, mortgage rates continued to fall, showing that these 
policies are working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon member for Qu'Appelle said that high interest rates cost 
us jobs.  How does he think we got the low interest rates which 
are starting to produce jobs?  It is because we have been 
responsible fiscal and monetary managers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also seen the pay-off in terms of low interest rates and 
growth of our economy.  Our economy is now growing by OECD and 
IMF estimates over the next few years at the rate of 3.7%. This 
is the highest of G-7 countries.  In the second quarter of this 
year we saw how our economy grew at an annual rate of 4.9 per 
cent.  This is the way that we are going about the important task 
of creating jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one in the House on any side, I would venture to say, does 
not realize that probably the most difficult thing we as members 
of Parliament go through as individuals is seeing qualified 
people who want to work and have the capacity to contribute not 
being employed to the full extent of their capacities.  If any 
one of us had a wish, I am sure we would all agree it would be to 
ensure that every Canadian had a job commensurate with their 
abilities and capacities.  How do we do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing the results of our prudent management of the 
economy now paying huge dividends.  When we took office there was 
11.4% unemployment.  It has come down to 9%.  We know that is not 
good enough but in the private sector in Canada, which is the 
only place where jobs will be created, we have created 1.1 
million new jobs.  This is an extraordinary record of 
accomplishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first nine months of this year we have created 279,000 
new jobs.  Estimates are that over the next two years we will be 
creating them at the rate of at least 300,000 new jobs a year. 
This is the pay-off for what we have introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very sympathetic to NDPers when they talk about the need 
for jobs.  They are telling us that we have to set targets.  Did 
either of their two speakers today tell us what the targets 
should be?  No.  Here is how they told us they would achieve 
them.  Let me go through them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said that labour sponsored venture capital funds should be 
forced by the federal government to do retrofits.  They cannot do 
retrofits. Are they talking about increased tax incentives for 
these funds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talked about further tax cuts.  I will just go through the 
list the first two speakers put before us.  At the same time they 
called for increased spending on health care, education, 
training, culture, environment, child poverty and housing, as 
well as a major expenditure program on the GST tax break.  They 
were talking about eight new expenditure programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also said “Let inflation go, just let it go.  We do not 
have to worry about inflation”. 
The actions taken to date do not have an effect on monetary 
policy until a year to a year and a half down the road.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Qu'Appelle said that high interest rates cost us 
jobs.  How do we get high interest rates?  By allowing inflation 
to go amok.  It was when interest rates were at 22% that 
inflation was in the double digits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are never going to allow Canada to go that way again.  We are 
going to keep interest rates low by managing the economy 
sensibly.  Members of the NDP have come out—we will see the 
details of it later—with a program they think will create jobs, 
60,000 they say. The community reinvestment act, which they are 
going to enact in Canada, will require funds taken as deposits in 
a community to be reinvested at least to a certain extent in that 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have looked at this.  Do members know who the net losers 
would be?  They would be the Atlantic provinces and a couple of 
the prairie provinces because they are now the net beneficiaries 
of the lending of our banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More money is lent to these poorer areas of Canada than is taken 
from these provinces in deposits.  If that is the type of policy 
that they are advocating for Canada, either their research is 
wrong or they are on a totally wrong track in trying to give hope 
to the areas of Canada that most need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not unmindful of the need to keep fighting to get 
unemployment down.  We are particularly concerned about youth 
unemployment, which is almost double the rate of unemployment in 
other areas of the economy. That is why we introduced the federal 
public sector youth internship program.  That is why we have 
brought in the youth employment strategy which involves summer 
placements, international internships and science and technology 
internships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly proud of the 6,000 jobs that have been created 
for the First Nations and Inuit peoples through the internship 
program that has been provided there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, regrettably in our quest to deal with the tremendous 
deficit and debt problem, unfortunately we have had to make cuts 
in transfers to the provinces, cuts in health care, which when 
analysed in total, including tax points that have been 
transferred and cash transfers, is an overall cut at its maximum 
of $3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If half of that was allocated to health care, it would be less 
than 3% of the total health care budget in Canada. We do not like 
to have to do that but we did have to cut.  Our cuts to the 
provinces were at the level of 8%, whereas cuts to program 
spending were in the order of 13%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, needs have been recognized and increased funds 
have been allocated in the 1997 budget for health care, $150 
million for better approaches to providing health care, $50 
million for the health care information system and $100 million 
for children's health initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very mindful of the fact that education is the key to 
future prosperity.  That is why we have taken recent measures. 
On Canada student loans, which have a 30-month grace period, the 
limit has been doubled to $4,000 for registered educational 
savings plans.  We have increased the amount that is deductible 
for student tuition fees and tuition credits are up. We are 
conscious of how that has to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are criticized by the NDP in terms of culture.  Yes, our 
cultural industries are key, not only a major player in the 
economy, employing almost 900,000 Canadian, but also in defining 
who we are as a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why new moneys are allocated, $25 million a year, to the 
Canada Council starting next year, with another $10 million to it 
to help us honour the millennium.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our most important initiatives in health care, education 
and the cultural sector was to recognize that as governments have 
to cut back, perhaps the private sector could contribute more. 
That is why in so many areas tax incentives have been enhanced, 
to allow the private sector to help contribute in these areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it was with interest that I listened to members from the 
New Democratic Party as they alluded to my home province of 
Saskatchewan.  The success of those in Saskatchewan in achieving 
some of their goals in recent years is because they adopted a 
policy that was not unlike the NDP policy with the premier there, 
but they followed a more conservative policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend when I returned home—this hits both the opposition 
and the NDP—an 80-year old lady who is very close to me fell and 
broke her hip and her shoulder.  She had just finished waiting 
six days, not six hours, in agony to get a post-operative bed.  I 
would like to inform the members to my left that these are some 
of the horror stories in Saskatchewan at the present time.  I 
know there is restructuring and I know they are trying to make 
amends, but do not ever let it be known that all is well in the 
province that initiated medicare because it certainly is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day horror stories cross my desk from my constituency and 
beyond.  Which province probably has the longest waiting list for 
hip surgeries?  Saskatchewan.  Which province has cut more beds 
per capita than any other province?  Saskatchewan.  Which 
province at the present time has the longest waiting list for 
access to an MRI machine?  Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it be made known that in order to get to the point they are 
at today with the cuts from this government, all is not well in 
the socialist medicare system of Saskatchewan. As the result of 
the delays for MRI machines, people are now going to North Dakota 
where they can get an MRI diagnosis within two days once they 
apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following statistics just came in.  The trans-Canada highway 
in Saskatchewan is a national disgrace and some of the blame has 
to be borne there.  There is no question about that with the 
robbery of the excise tax and Saskatchewan getting about 4%. 
Hon. members know that when they put 50 litres of gas in their 
gas tanks, $5 goes to the federal government through its excise 
tax, and about 40¢, that is all, is returned to Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the provincial government has been a little better, the 
eastern and western sections of the trans-Canada highway that 
runs through Saskatchewan are presently untwinned.  Already this 
year that highway has claimed seven lives unnecessarily.  That 
same small stretch of untwinned highway has claimed 38 serious 
accidents. Do not tell us about all of the glories, about what is 
happening across Canada.  In Saskatchewan alone these are the 
facts and no one can get around it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with interest to this speech because we do not hear 
much in the House about my province.  I will leave that with hon. 
members.  While I congratulate them for some of things that are 
being done, let us not deceive the people that all is well in 
socialist Saskatchewan.

way possible.  Canadians do not have to worry about that.  We are 
not a Reform government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak on the NDP opposition motion which 
is before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to hear the hon. leader of the NDP clarify the 
question which I asked on behalf of my constituents.  I realize 
that a number of members of the House were a bit upset by the 
question.  The leader herself seemed a bit agitated.  However, I 
make no apology for asking the question on behalf of my 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a great believer in not putting up with rumours that go 
around.  I would rather go to the source and ask for actual 
information.  That is what I did today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the member had a chance to put something on 
the record.  It means that I can mail out that <I>Hansard</I> to 
those constituents and that will put an end to the matter.  I 
thank her very much for doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Why don't you apologize? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  I hear a member opposite saying that I 
should apologize.  I will never apologize for asking questions in 
the House on behalf of my constituents.  Let me make that very 
clear.  If we turn this place into a politically correct place 
where we cannot ask questions on behalf of our constituents, then 
we cannot represent them. I express in the House opinions from 
all sides of the spectrum. Those who were here in the last 
Parliament will know that. Mostly I speak to Reform policy, but 
there were many occasions on which I brought forward points of 
view from my constituents which disagreed with Reform policy.  I 
see that as my duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get on to the matter at hand, I was happy to hear that the 
hon. leader of the NDP was pleased with her father's 
contribution.  By being a successful business person he was able 
to support the political philosophy of which he was in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminded me of another famous socialist from a different 
country, the Hon. David Lange, who was prime minister of New 
Zealand.  I had the good fortune to meet with him for about two 
hours in 1995.  He told me about the terrible problems he went 
through in 1983 when New Zealand was on the verge of bankruptcy 
and the awful decisions he had to make as a Labour Party prime 
minister, which is equivalent to the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He told me that he had come to recognize that you cannot have 
good social programs unless you have a vibrant private sector.  I 
believe that relates very well to what the leader of the NDP said 
when she said that by her father having a successful business he 
was able to contribute to the goals of his political philosophy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is something that we really need to remember here. 
If we treat business as the enemy in trying to achieve the things 
that the NDP are trying to achieve, then we are really not going 
to get any progress down that road at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform unfortunately is not in a position to support the motion 
as it is written because we really feel it is illogical.  It 
mixes the cause and effect and really contains a lot of erroneous 
assumptions that do not tie together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the motion suggests that measures to bring 
government spending under control lead to high unemployment. I 
would venture to say that the evidence throughout the world is 
exactly the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look, for example, close to home at the Klein government 
in Alberta, by reducing government spending dramatically, running 
surpluses and reducing taxes, the unemployment levels in Alberta 
have plunged.  It is the place in Canada right now that is 
generating a huge number of jobs and the economy there is really 
barrelling along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at the Harris government of Ontario and see similar 
sorts of things beginning to happen now.  The Harris government 
was preceded by an NDP government which followed the sorts of 
policies that are being proposed by the NDP where this tax and 
spend philosophy actually kills jobs.  It creates unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look to the United States where any of the states that 
have cut taxes and reduced government spending have created jobs. 
In New Zealand, where I am originally from, the unemployment 
level there now is below 5%.  Yet the government is only 
one-third of the size it was in 1983. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence is overwhelmingly opposite to what is being 
proposed by the NDP in the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did mention the NDP government in Ontario.  In 1990 it tried 
to spend its way out of the 1990 recession.  All it did was bring 
the province to the edge of bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the same problems happening in B.C. where the NDP 
government there was the beneficiary of enormous amounts of 
inflowing foreign investment for a few years and it disguised its 
inability to get control of the spending, but now those pigeons 
are coming home to roost and we are starting to get into a much 
more difficult situation in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, if government spending on job creation could create jobs, 
we already have a $600 billion debt in Canada, enormous deficits 
that have been run up starting with the Liberal government in the 
late seventies; enormous debt that has been incurred in the 
lifetime of the average 20-year old who is out working right now. 
With that huge terrible debt of $600 billion, if government 
spending created jobs we would all have three by now because that 
is an enormous amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see is that the government pours money into programs 
that create short term temporary jobs that really go nowhere such 
as heavy water plants that produce a product for which there is 
no market, grants and subsidies to steel mills or coal mines that 
cannot market competitive productss, airports which are beautiful 
facilities that have no flights coming in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a famous company in my area of the country.  Ballard 
Technologies, which everyone is in love with at the moment, has 
received huge infusions of government money.  It is disguising 
what the truth is about fuel cells.  Nobody ever asks where the 
hydrogen comes from to run all these fuel cells.  When we ask 
that question we discover it comes from the decomposition of 
natural gas, from fractional distillation of air, from hydrolysis 
or some other process that uses enormous amounts of energy to 
create the hydrogen in the first place.  It is very convenient to 
ignore the fact that pollution is being created somewhere else to 
make all this hydrogen to run a fuel cell so that somebody can 
say this is a nice little non-polluting fuel cell.  It is only 
half the story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really look at the whole process we find that it is 
completely uneconomical.  It is cheaper, more efficient and 
cleaner to run a bus on a natural gas engine than it is to 
generate hydrogen somewhere and run it on a fuel cell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet no one asks the question.  The government blindly runs in 
huge grants to this company, ploughing money into it, buoying up 
its reputation.  Now its shares have shot up to something $85 a 
week or two ago and yet I still do not think people are asking 
the right questions before they put government money into a 
company that has never made a profit and has no hope of doing so 
for a long time, maybe never.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the sorts of ways the government wastes money, 
claiming to create jobs when all it is doing is giving certain 
companies unfair advantages in the marketplace and moving jobs 
from one place to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another flaw in the motion is that it trivializes the negative 
consequences of the monetary policy we have with regard to 
inflation.  It was not long ago that Canadians were facing 
mortgage interest rates of 16% or more because we had run up such 
huge government debt.  In 1993 when the Reform party was trying 
to get governments to start controlling their spending, and we 
should take a lot of credit for moving the Liberal government in 
that direction, 80% of the new money we were borrowing was coming 
from overseas.  Those lenders were demanding high interest rates 
because of the huge debt that had been built up by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can't have your cake and eat it too.  You have to get to a 
low inflation and low interest rates by controlling government 
spending.  It ends up creating jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of speakers from the NDP mentioned that banks should be 
forced to plough more money into the community.  Credit unions in 
British Columbia do exactly that and I assume that credit unions 
in other parts of the country would do the same thing.  Surely we 
do not need to change the rules.  We just need to encourage 
people to switch from a bank to a credit union.  I think the 
credit unions are already trying to do that.  Instead of having 
more government interference, we should let the marketplace make 
that change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a huge amount of material here on health care and things 
we could do to create new jobs.  For example, the U.K., New 
Zealand and Sweden have all allowed some choice in health care. 
They have managed to increase the number of jobs in health care 
tremendously.  We could certainly benefit from the experiences of 
those countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize my time has expired.  It is unfortunate that we do not 
have more time to spend on this.  I look forward to perhaps being 
part of questions and comments later in the day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  I think the member 
is having his cake and eating it as well.  A few moments ago the 
Reform party member for Souris—Moose Mountain got up. He is a 
former Conservative MLA in Saskatchewan under the administration 
of premier Grant Devine which, according to one of his former 
speech writers, was the most corrupt government in the history of 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Souris—Moose Mountain was complaining about the 
lack of money going into health care and highways.  The Devine 
government in its nine short years ran up the biggest per capita 
deficit of any provincial government in this country and the 
second largest per capita debt, second only to Newfoundland, of 
any government in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Devine government was a soulmate of the Reform party.  It 
spoke one way before an election about fiscal responsibility and 
after the election was the most irresponsible spender in the 
history of this country, almost bankrupting my province.  That is 
one reason why we do not have the flexibility today we would want 
to have in terms of the programs the people of the province 
require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member how he can get up in this House and talk about 
fiscal responsibility when his soulmate in Saskatchewan, Grant 
Devine, leader of the most corrupt government in the history of 
this country, was the biggest spender we have ever seen in terms 
of driving up the debt and deficit and burdening the people for 
generations to come.  That is sheer hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Devine government made promises about fiscal responsibility 
and when it became government it was irresponsible.  We saw the 
same thing happen with the Mulroney government.  There is no 
doubt that these traditional old line governments like we have on 
the Liberal side of the House make these promises and they feel 
quite happy to break them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason the Reform party is here.  In 1983 when 
westerners voted for the Mulroney government it made a promise 
that it would get the deficit and spending under control.  The 
Tories promised us they would do it and they did not.  They got 
into government.  They lost their nerve and went on the usual tax 
and spend.  Liberal-Tory, same old story.  They were all the 
same.  That is one of the reasons the Reform party came into 
being.  We were the ones who made it fashionable to get 
government spending under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody can deny that in 1988 and 1993 in the election campaign 
material we had information on digging the debt hole, everything 
was focused on making governments become responsible.  Reform 
needs to take all the credit for what has happened from coast to 
coast across this country.

they always follow the trend and Reform managed to push them into 
some fiscal responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the member, like him, I condemn the Devine 
government for what it did.  I condemn the Mulroney government 
for what it did and that is why Reform came into being. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
will come as no great surprise to you that I will be voting 
against the motion of the members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is the setting of realistic deficit targets, 
realistic debt targets and then going on to set employment 
targets.  When one has revenue coming in one knows what the 
revenues are.  When one knows one's expenses one knows how to set 
realistic targets.  That in my view is the central thesis of the 
fatal flaw of the NDP's position, namely that to set an 
unemployment target is simply an exercise in futility and 
something with which the government cannot possibly cope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the members opposite how, without entering into massive 
deficit spending, increasing debt and entering into programs that 
are utterly useless, will they be able to set realistic targets 
and achieve that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if the member 
thought he was asking a question of the NDP, but it was my 
speaking time and my chance to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with him that the NDP fatal flaw is that it thinks that 
we have to increase spending by massive amounts to create jobs 
when all the evidence is that type of spending does not create 
long term jobs.  It creates unemployment instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member's observation that massive spending is 
not the way to prosperity or to lower unemployment levels. On the 
other hand, I see no harm and I think Reform sees no harm in 
setting a general wish to move the unemployment levels down, not 
a specific target I agree.  We cannot pick a number out of the 
air like 3% but we want to move it down.  We have seen other 
jurisdictions get below 4% and 5% where they have these low tax, 
low deficit or surplus regimes and we should be aiming for the 
same sorts of achievements.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak today on this 
motion by the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While not agreeing with all of its details, this is 
nevertheless a motion which points out that the battle of the 
deficit, in which the government is proudly proclaiming great 
victories, has been won at the expense of the workers, the 
employers, all those who have paid into the employment insurance 
fund and who have generated the surpluses we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the surplus is $12 billion.  In the NDP motion, when 
they refer to the imbalance between the battle against the deficit 
and the way the unemployment issue is being addressed, I feel a 
clear message is indeed being sent to the government, that it must 
readjust its sights and correct the way it is expending its 
energies, whether the energy it is focussing on unemployment is 
sufficient, and whether it is taking the right approach.  I 
believe, in this connection, this will be a worthwhile motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to see that the battle of the deficit, as 
the motion states, has been waged by cutting transfer payments. 
In this connection, when the NDP states that it condemns the 
federal government for: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—its failure to make adequate investments in health care, 
education, training, culture and the environment— 
</UL></UL>
<it is obvious that the federal government has no jurisdiction per 
se in the majority of these sectors. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, in the view of the New Democratic Party, the federal government 
should perhaps bypass the provinces to invest in these areas, a bit like 
the Liberals tend to want to do now that they have financial manoeuvring 
room. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the solution is much more to open the tap and allow 
transfer payments to find an adequate level of equilibrium. On this 
subject, they might say: “You sovereignists are always going to oppose 
the federal government's investing money in the provinces, because you 
want to withdraw”. However, the effect of the cuts in transfer payments 
is not felt just in Quebec. 
The same situation is also hurting Ontario, given all the changes in the 
health and education sectors. As we can see these days, there is even 
the threat of general strike of Ontario teachers. The same sort of 
criticism has been made by the other provincial premiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, as far as the motion is concerned, we can agree with the fact 
that, when there are budget surpluses, the federal government's secret 
for remaining in control of its budget is to ensure that the additional 
money that could be invested in these areas is invested through transfer 
payments, that is, the provinces should be given the necessary sums the 
equalization system may generate and allowed to manage them and use them 
as they see fit, since they are the experts in these various sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third sector contributing to the deficit is the cuts in the 
federal bureaucracy. However, as luck would have it, this is the sector 
where objectives were not met. Contributions by employers, employees and 
the unemployed to the employment insurance fund exceeded the objective. 
They were asked for more, and more was contributed than was asked for 
initially. In the matter of transfer payments, screws were tightened to 
the hilt, and the provinces were forced to live with the constraints. 
However as far as the contribution by the federal government machinery 
is concerned, the objectives were not met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, in fact, a deeper look is needed, and I think the 
government's current prebudget consultations will reveal that people 
want tighter management in direct government program expenditures. 
For too long the bureaucracy in the national capital region, that is to 
say the Ottawa area, has been growing, somewhat at the expense of other 
regions in Canada, and I think that no one in Canada or around here 
wants this model to spread. Efforts will have to made to ensure that, 
thanks to the room for maneuver being created, the money will be used in 
federal areas of jurisdiction or, through transfer payments, that the 
provinces have the necessary room to maneuver, fiscally speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP motion also deals with a very important issue: the economic 
choice that always has to be made between inflation and unemployment. 
Whether we like it or not, a balance has to be struck there and, looking 
back on the past as an indication of what might lie ahead, the Bank of 
Canada's tight money policy in recent years has slowed down the economy, 
leading to the economic crisis of the early 1990s under the 
Conservatives. Even now, we must ensure that the government will 
maintain a positive attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, how high can the rate of inflation be allowed to rise 
so that, on the other hand, the rate of unemployment can be reduced to 
a more reasonable level? The current rate of unemployment in Canada is 
not acceptable. 
The effects of the squandering of human resources will be felt for 
decades because the 20, 30 or 40-year olds whose jobs do not match their 
skills today are not gaining the experience required to contribute to 
society adequately in the future and build an interesting future for 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several unanswered questions which, I think, should be 
brought to the attention of the government and it would certainly be in 
the interest of the government to decide whether to change course or to 
stay the course. The Speech from the Throne was rather significant in 
this respect. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing the Liberals did when they realized they would have 
some room to maneuver was to pour money into projects that are in areas 
under provincial jurisdiction. This is what I call not learning from 
past mistakes. The government cannot see that it is once again setting 
in motion the same big machine that generated the deficits of the 
nineties and that formed the basis of the Trudeau government's 
philosophy, which was to try to get involved in every sector, because 
the federal government was the one that could find solutions for people. 
However, we came to realize that this philosophy did not work at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our debates, we can do a critical review of the past—I think 
it is important to do so—but we must also learn for the future. It is 
true that if we have budget surpluses, we will have to ensure that we 
slowly reduce the debt, that we allow the pressure on interest rates to 
remain low and even to diminish, so that economic activity can regain 
momentum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we should also think about rewarding those who helped 
reduce the deficit. 
For example, since those who contribute to the employment insurance fund 
generated a $12 billion surplus and since nowadays 30% to 35% of those 
who contribute are eligible for benefits, compared to 60% in the early 
nineties, this so-called employment insurance program, which in fact is 
meant to provide an income for those who are between jobs, no longer 
meets its objectives, because the government applied too much pressure 
to ensure that the surplus of that fund went to reduce the national 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since employers and employees made a tremendous effort, it would 
now be in order to reduce employment insurance contributions. 
It would also be important to improve the living conditions both of 
seasonal workers and of new arrivals on the job market.  Right now, 
it is discouraging for young people, particularly in seasonal 
sectors, to be required to work 910 hours, the equivalent of 26 
35-hour weeks, to be eligible.  The risk is that the young person 
will ultimately be unable to accumulate enough hours to qualify for 
employment insurance.  He will have paid premiums, but will not be 
entitled to reimbursement, which is completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to compensate those who have helped to lower the 
deficit, the federal government must, over the coming years, stick 
to the areas over which it has jurisdiction, managing them as well 
as it can and not opting for certain measures just because of their 
possible impact on a future election. 
When it comes to the areas of health and education, the provinces 
are the experts.  The government's contribution must take the form 
of transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this sense, the government will have to learn from the past 
so that, in five or ten years, we do not find ourselves back in a 
debate like the one we have been mired in for the past five years, 
with those members of our society who were not the most well off 
having to play a disproportionately large role in lowering the 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the government is listening to this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for recognizing me so quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to put a question to my distinguished colleague, 
the member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, since his riding is similar in every respect to that of 
Frontenac—Mégantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell him about an encounter I had last week in 
my riding.  Last week was a week set aside for members who wanted 
to touch base with people in their ridings.  That is what I did 
during the seven days available to us to meet with our 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Lac-Mégantic, at the Sears store, I met a saleswoman who 
told me a rather sad tale about her daughter. 
Her daughter had left university and worked hard to find a job. 
Unfortunately, three weeks ago, she received notice that she was 
being let go. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT20"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT20"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1140

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, because she had to live, she left home.  She had to pay 
for rent and for food. She had to make payments on her furniture and her 
television. She had to pay for cable, the telephone and so on. So she 
went to the employment insurance office. The good Government of Canada 
had played with the terms so it is no longer unemployment insurance, but 
employment insurance. As she was short some ten hours in order to be 
eligible, she will have to turn to social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government says that the rate of unemployment has dropped 
since it came to power on October 25, 1993, it is not telling the truth, 
it is playing with the figures. 
Accordingly, when a person is not actually receiving employment 
insurance or actively looking for a job but living off social 
assistance, they are not counted. The same head cannot be counted twice. 
You can only count one person once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my distinguished colleague from 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, since I managed 
to remember the very complex name of his riding, to tell us whether I am 
mistaken or whether I am right and whether in his riding, which is 
identical to Frontenac—Mégantic, unfortunate situations like the one I 
described keep occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the question from my 
colleague from Frontenac—Mégantic. In fact, his is a clear example of 
the unacceptable disparity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the employment insurance reform, a person entering the 
labour market for the first time worked 15 hours a week for 20 weeks for 
a total of 300 hours of work and could then receive benefits. Now the 
requirement is 910 hours. The difference between the two is 610 hours. 
That means that the number of hours required for eligibility has been 
increased by 600%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You gave a specific example. The young person you were speaking 
about will have made contributions but will never be entitled to them. 
At the end of the year, the counter returns to zero, and so hours worked 
in the first year do not count in the second year. 
This is one example of an area in which the Government of Canada 
ought to show some humanity and ought to remedy the situation, 
ought to ensure that we have in this House, as soon as possible, a 
bill to change the unacceptable aspects of employment insurance 
reform.  We are not saying that the reform should be done away with 
completely, just that errors need to be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his address, the hon. member made me think of my meeting 
yesterday with some women who are involved in community kitchens, 
who prepare meals together because they have very limited means. 
That was the reason they set the kitchens up.  Now they are faced 
with a situation where the regional health authority, which sets 
the budgets, is being forced to make cuts, thus obliging them to 
regroup and adopt a less efficient way of operating. 
When it comes down to the bottom line, the fundamental cause of 
this situation is that each of the organizations, each of the 
regional health authorities in Quebec, gets its budget from 
the Government of Quebec.  Part of that Quebec budget comes from 
federal transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not easy for someone on welfare, someone trying to get 
off welfare, to see all these long term effects happening, and to 
realize that they originate far away from them. I think, however, 
that it is important to know this, and it is important to be able 
to judge what actions the government will be taking in future 
years, whether a very significant portion of the $42 billion that 
have been cut in transfer to the provinces since the early 1990s 
will be reinstated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am certainly pleased to speak on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a unique perspective from most members in this House in 
that I served here for five years from 1988 to 1993.  I was 
defeated in 1993 and was resurrected again in 1997. It is kind of 
like a time machine.  I was out for four years but all of a 
sudden I have been thrown right back in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a perspective where I can see the effect of the changes 
perhaps more dramatically than others.  Others who have served 
here have seen the incremental changes resulting from the 
government policies over the years. I see a dramatic change.  I 
see a very dramatic change in almost every social program, every 
issue that deals with people who need the most help, every area 
that needs the most help.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has impressed me a great deal that even in our jobs as 
members of Parliament we are much more active and much busier 
trying to help people through the system.  When I was here 
before, people who had reasonable requests received reasonable 
reception and it took a reasonable time to get through the 
system.  Now it seems to take forever to get through anything, 
whether it is employment insurance, job training, health care, 
education, or any aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that a few minutes ago the hon. minister for 
foreign trade said in his speech that we made these cuts and we 
made these changes with the support of Canadians.  He said that 
Atlantic Canada was one of the cheap beneficiaries of these 
policy changes.  We ran out of time but I wanted to ask him if 
Canadians supported him, how could he possibly interpret what 
happened in Nova Scotia as support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May there were 11 MPs in Nova Scotia and every single one was 
a Liberal.  In the 1997 election every single Liberal member of 
Parliament was defeated. I do not know how that is interpreted as 
support but I am sure the hon. minister could come up with an 
interpretation that 100% defeat is support.  I am not sure how to 
do it but I am sure he can do it. As he spoke I thought he must 
have the map turned upside down because certainly the people in 
Atlantic Canada sent a strong message that we do not support the 
cuts to all the social programs and all the things that help the 
people most in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All social aspects were hit.  My area has one of the highest 
unemployment rates in Nova Scotia. Our unemployment rate falls 
between 15% and 40%.  There is no program.  There is no strategy. 
There is no job training of any consistency to help people. This 
coincides with and certainly supports the NDP motion in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only unemployment but there are cuts to health care. 
Our health care system is in chaos.  Doctors are leaving faster 
than we can replace them.  We have band-aid solutions.  We kind of 
bribe doctors to come in and set up in our area but it is just a 
band-aid solution and the problem again is cuts to our social 
fabric and the social programs.  It seems to me to be totally 
contradictory to the Liberal philosophy of helping people which 
was always there but seems to have completely disappeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In education the government has come up with this new idea of 
public-private partnerships to build and replace schools that are 
now dilapidated and deteriorated beyond repair and really need to 
be replaced.  They have started a few of these public-private 
projects to try to save money to keep the province and the feds 
from borrowing money because the transfers to the province were 
reduced.  All of a sudden they are packing up.  They are not 
working.  There are all kinds of problems with them.  They have 
bypassed the tendering system.  There is patronage and 
favouritism.  There is false economy wherein the government may 
save borrowing a few million dollars but the obligation to the 
people of Nova Scotia is incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of highways, my area has one of the most dangerous 
highways in Canada.  Forty people have died on that highway.  It 
is in drastic need of replacement so the government says “Well, 
we do not want to replace that dangerous highway.  We will 
propose a toll highway”.  Even in a report submitted by a group 
of lawyers who worked on this project they say “One is 
immediately struck with the realization that this region of Nova 
Scotia is not one which should be conducive to a successful toll 
road. Highway 104 is anticipated to handle only 6,000 vehicles a 
day in a rural and economically challenged region of the 
country.”   In effect they say that it should not be a toll 
road, that the government should pay for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It then goes on to say that if we can control the tolls totally 
and put them up whenever we want to, if we can direct traffic, 
prevent people from taking other roads and force them to take 
this toll road, we may be able to make this economically 
depressed region of Nova Scotia work.  It says that if we can 
relax construction standards, make narrower asphalt, no shoulders 
and all these sorts of things, maybe we can ram it through and 
maybe it will work.  Well, I do not think it is going to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is false economy. In order to save $60 million on 
that road the government is obligating the people of Nova Scotia 
and Newfoundland to 30 years of paying tolls that will total $538 
million.  They are going to cause the people of Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland to spend $538 million while pretending that it will 
save $60 million.  It will create an interprovincial trade 
barrier.  It is in every way just false economy to obligate the 
people to spend $538 million to save $60 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my region all employment is done by small business.  There 
are no large employers, no giant international corporations.  It 
is all done by small business.  The overcharge on employment 
insurance is costing jobs.  There is also the fact that there is 
no money being put into retraining, nor is there any consistent 
policy which would help to address the tremendous unemployment 
problem.  In certain pockets of my riding as I said before it is 
as high as 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically the small business employers in my riding are being 
fined by being overcharged on employment insurance premiums. 
There is still no plan, no consistent retraining programs and no 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, I was away for four years and now I have come 
back.  The thing that hits me the hardest is what is happening to 
our Canada pension plan and to the people who need disability 
benefits.  When I left, if a doctor said a person was disabled, 
within a reasonable length of time if the person qualified for 
CPP disability, if they had paid the premiums, they could get 
disability benefits.  Now I do not know how disabled a person has 
to be to get disability insurance.  It is incredible. I have a 
couple of examples which reflect on the impact the policy changes 
have on the people who need help the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Marjorie Newman of Oxford Junction, Nova Scotia applied for 
Canada pension disability benefits in March 1995.  Through 1996 
and all the way through 1997 she has been stalled and given 
excuses. There have been all sorts of delays.  Now she is told 
that she will not have a hearing until late 1998.  She applied in 
March 1995.  We cannot imagine the stress on this poor woman.  We 
cannot imagine the frustration and the fear which this lady has. 
This just should not be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The doctor's report said “Marjorie Newman is totally disabled 
and unable to work”.  Mrs. Newman is clearly disabled and unable 
to work at any job and it puzzles me how her application for 
Canada pension disability has been refused.  It started in 1995 
and now she is looking at late 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another example which I find shocking.  I do not 
understand how people can be expected to pay into the Canada 
pension plan and then have this happen.  This case concerns 
Archie Black.  He lives in a place called Shenimecas in my 
riding.  I have known him all my life.  He comes from a long line 
of dedicated, hard working people.  He can no longer work.  He 
wants to work.  His doctor said “Mr. Black is completely 
disabled from any form of employment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He applied in September 1994 for Canada pension disability. 
Through 1995, 1996 and 1997 they kept asking him for more 
information.  We cannot imagine the mental anguish and stress 
which have been placed on this man.  Now he is fearful of losing 
his home.  I do not understand how this can be allowed to happen. 
A disabled person has to wait three or even four years for an 
answer as to whether they qualify for Canada pension disability 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incredible.  All of these things indicate the philosophy 
of the Liberal government.  It does not matter whether it is 
unemployment, education, health care, the Canada pension plan or 
even killer highways.  The present Liberal approach hits the 
poorest regions the hardest and it hits the people who need help 
the most the hardest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will support this motion today because it reflects on the 
overall policy of the government.  I agree with deficit 
reduction, but I do not agree that it should be achieved on the 
backs of the people who cannot help themselves and who need help 
the most. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the hon. member for 
Cumberland—Colchester.  It seems to me that the government has 
turned the corner with respect to what it has done over the past 
number of years in getting its fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply ask him to consider the evidence.  Low interest 
rates and accelerating job opportunities.  Housing starts and 
resales are up.  Business investment is surging.  Consumers are 
spending again and growth is taking off.  Yes, while there have 
been sacrifices, we have now turned the corner and are on our way 
to an economic renewal which we have not seen since the 1950s and

1984 and 1993 which caused the mess that our government has now 
had to clean up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, I often 
think that in the Liberal caucus there must be a great big 
picture of Brian Mulroney. 
They must all come in and worship at the altar of Brian Mulroney 
every day because he is the one that brought in free trade which 
has allowed our economy to expand.  It was Brian Mulroney's 
government that brought in free trade which the Liberals opposed 
vehemently all night and all day for a long time in this House. 
However as soon as they were in, not only did they embrace it but 
they enhanced it and expanded it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same with the GST.  The Liberals opposed the GST hour 
after hour in this House.  They vilified Brian Mulroney and his 
government for bringing in the GST but as soon as they were in, 
what did they do?  They embraced it again and in our part of the 
country they enhanced it.  They talked the provinces into turning 
the provincial sales tax into GST as well.  Not only did the 
Liberals follow what Brian Mulroney and the Conservative 
government did but they enhanced it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The low inflation policy was started by the Conservative 
government.  That is a policy which was carried over. We started 
that and I am really proud of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the success we are having today, and I 
am sure the Liberals know it, started with the foundation that 
was built by the Conservative Party from 1989 to 1993.  The 
Liberals can say everything they like but actions speak louder 
than words. Their actions are screaming “We love Brian 
Mulroney's policy on free trade.  We love Brian Mulroney's policy 
on GST.  We love Brian Mulroney's policy on low inflation because 
we endorsed it, we enhanced it, we embraced it and we love it”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time today with the member for Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I rise in favour of the motion.  I am proud of the 
initiative and leadership taken by my party with respect to this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured today to stand in the House of Commons as the 
member of Parliament for Bras d'Or, a riding that takes in much 
of the island of Cape Breton.  It sweeps from the coalfields of 
Glace Bay and Donkin where my father began as a coal miner and 
where I grew up, down past the historic site of Louisbourg, 
through the fishing communities to the south and then up again to 
Cheticamp and the beginning of the Cabot Trail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is diverse.  French, English and aboriginal 
communities live side by side.  There are families who came here 
from many of the world's nations to work underground or in our 
steel mills or on our oceans.  These are the people of Bras d'Or. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One hundred years ago Glace Bay was the fastest growing town in 
the British empire.  It was a magnet for people from around the 
world, for people who wanted to make a better life for themselves 
and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fought for decades to make conditions better for the workers 
in our communities.  The miners went on strike to fight for a 
living wage, for safe working conditions. They had to fight tooth 
and nail for every scrap, for every little advantage that today 
we would take for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I come from a region where we are used to fighting, where we 
are used to having to work hard for everything we have.  It has 
always been a tough place to live and our history is full of 
hardship and sacrifice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cape Breton helped build our country, feeding the people and 
industry as we expanded to the west.  But somewhere over the 
decades as our success turned into Canada's success, we started 
to slip away from the centre of national life.  The handful of 
rich men who owned our industries moved on to new ventures in new 
regions and we were left to cope as best we could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And cope we did. Cape Bretoners are an industrious people who 
are used to hard work, who enjoy hard work, who are good at the 
task they set their minds to. One of the great tragedies of the 
last two decades has been to see these people deprived of the 
work they love. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the rest of the country went through booms and busts, Cape 
Breton was on a slow decline. Even in the days of big government 
no thought was given to reviving our island. Instead we saw 
millions of dollars thrown away on megaprojects that made a few 
people, often strangely enough, friends of the government of the 
day, into millionaires and left the people where they had been, 
increasingly desperate, increasingly isolated.  Many left.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I was elected in June, I have been amazed at the number of 
Cape Bretoners I have met across Canada. Nearly all of them left 
home to find work.  Nearly all of them would love to go home 
again if work was there for them.  Of course, there is no work in 
the late 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his town hall meeting last December the Prime Minister told 
Canadians that people who lived in places like Cape Breton were 
basically out of luck.  Just last week the finance minister spoke 
at great length about the Canadian economic miracle.  But just a 
few months ago he said that any economic recovery in Canada would 
likely pass Cape Breton by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking for special favours from the government. We do 
not want any more heavy water plants or other white elephants 
dreamed up by bureaucrats.  All we want is help to get back on 
our feet, help so that we can do the things Cape Bretoners are 
best at: hard, honest work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had many promises from the government. We were promised 
that the Donkin mine would open, a mine built at public expense. 
It still has not opened. We had a promise that education would be 
made a priority.  Instead, we had the slash and burn budgets of 
the last three years, budgets that forced the provinces to accept 
fewer teachers, larger classes and lower standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were promised a fair deal on taxes.  Instead, the tax burden 
went up for working and middle class people, especially in 
Atlantic Canada where the federal government held hearings with 
its provincial counterparts and gave us the BST, a good name for 
a tax I must say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are paying more, getting less and the government has told us 
it is our fault.  When offices are closed down, making it 
impossible for Cape Bretoners to access the services other 
Canadians take for granted, we are told that we are to blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were promised accessible health care.  Instead, we see 
transfer payments reduced and hospitals closed. We see patients 
dying because they cannot get access. That is not something I am 
saying to inflame the members of the government. That is a 
message straight from more than a dozen doctors in the town of 
Glace Bay who held a press conference this past May to say that 
approximately 40 deaths had been directly related to health care 
cuts.  What a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time I go home I hear about more cases, of patients turned 
away, of waiting lists, of doctors and nurses so overwhelmed with 
work and so fatigued that they cannot properly do their jobs, of 
Canadians dying because they live in Cape Breton. As the Prime 
Minister put it, I guess they are just not lucky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the human side of the government's action.  While the 
American bankers pat the Minister of Finance on the head and give 
him extra brownie points from the world finance candy store, my 
neighbours are sick and sometimes dying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Prime Minister travels to Russia and speaks about the 
need for the country to reform so it can rise to our level, there 
is a community in my riding where raw sewage flows through the 
streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and the Prime Minister in waiting can talk 
all they want about growth, and the government backbenchers can 
happily bleat the party line about unemployment.  But tell those 
lines to the people of Birch Grove where the children cannot play 
outside because of the danger of contamination.  Tell that to the 
man who lost his wife because the doctor did not have time to 
properly diagnose her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some towns and village in Bras d'Or have a real unemployment 
rate of over 50%.  Half the people in the communities are out of 
work.  Many people have given up, finally crushed by decades of 
struggle that seem to get them nowhere, by odd jobs and 
government work schemes that promise to lead them back to 
security but led them instead to their Prime Minister telling 
them that they had better move if they wanted to get ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party believe we need to improve health 
care and other social programs, not just because it is the right 
thing to do, but because it will also create good jobs and enable 
many more skilled and talented Canadians to participate in the 
workforce in every part of Canada.  Money invested in health care 
produces three times as many jobs as the money being used for an 
income tax cut.

is available to all without an American style, two tier system. 
It would create meaningful jobs in Canada.

accessibility, portability, comprehensiveness and public 
administration.  It would create meaningful jobs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Promote a community based health system which is driven by the 
health care needs of the people rather than fee for service 
medicine.  It would create meaningful jobs in Canada.

meaningful jobs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Support the development of community based facilities for

such as shelters for battered women and women's health centres. 
It would create meaningful jobs in Canada.

communities in taking action to improve their health, broaden 
research, identify culturally relevant approaches to aboriginal 
health issues and increase advanced education for aboriginal

jobs in Canada.

working.  Reducing the deficit does not have to mean the old 
style slashing pushed by the Liberals, Tories and Reform.  It 
could have been done without threatening health care for 
Canadians and education for our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it going to be?  Is the government going to own up to 
its responsibilities in times when questions are tough or is it 
simply going to duck and weave, dodging blame and grabbing credit 
wherever it can and thinks it can get away with it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
this is my first time speaking in the House and it is indeed a 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to the motion of the NDP and to the response of 
the Liberal government.  I represent a riding which is not very 
well off. A lot of people are looking for government assistance 
and are on government assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general thrust, as I listen to the members of the NDP and of 
the Liberals, is that with the spending that will take place, 
jobs will be created.  However, the evidence is to the contrary. 
Yes, we do need to spend money on many of our social services but 
that is not going to create meaningful jobs.  It is going to 
create jobs that are there but are not meaningful jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important for the economy is to reduce the deficit.  I 
have business experience.  I am a small businessman and in the 
last 15 years the tax burden on my business has exceeded to the 
point where I have had to cut staff in order to balance my books. 
It is lower taxes and the proper environment that will create 
the investment and create meaningful jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two daughters in university who will soon be going into 
the job market.  They are looking for training in jobs that will 
be meaningful and help in our prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy is changing into an information age and moving into 
a global economy.  That is where we will excel in the job 
training aspect by retraining our youth.  It is not in spending 
money but in creating the environment for the business sector. We 
all know it is the business sector that will create the jobs, not 
the government sector.  The government sector is always 
inefficient so we must create an environment for the businesses 
that will create the jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not disagree with some of the points that she has made 
concerning spending money on training which will create jobs. 
Yes, it may create jobs but it will not create ever-lasting jobs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we hear from the NDP is that there are many unemployed and 
we should be spending money to create jobs. I differ on that. The 
spending of money is not going to create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the proposals which were just mentioned may create jobs 
and may be necessary.  It is not going to make a big dent in the 
unemployment rate.  I share the view that we should bring the 
unemployment rate down.  Our fundamental difference is that the 
NDP is asking for spending and we are not.  We are asking for a 
climate to create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is ironic that 
my colleague does not feel that a nurse, a doctor and a teacher 
are relevant jobs and are not needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I reiterated in my address to the motion, I come from a part 
of the country that has the highest rate of unemployment in the 
country. Over the last two years 700 individuals in the health 
care system have lost their jobs due to the cuts by the 
government.  My colleague is saying that they are not important 
jobs.  I invite him to come to Cape Breton and talk to the 
gentlemen who wishes he had that nurse to look after his wife. 
That is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform are not making the government accountable for what it 
is doing to the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
speak in favour of the motion.  I will focus on the crisis with 
aboriginal employment which we all know has historical roots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The royal commission report on aboriginal people should have 
left no one questioning the cause of the crisis facing aboriginal 
people.  Treaties were signed with aboriginal peoples, and the 
Government of Canada and the crown at the time of Confederation 
altered the treaty relationship, making aboriginal people and 
their lands the object of unilateral federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1876 we had the first version of the Indian Act.  These 
actions over time transformed independent, viable aboriginal 
nations into bands and individuals who were clients of a 
government department and wards of the state.  This was not done 
with any consultation with the aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's policy was intended to undermine aboriginal 
institutions and life patterns and to assimilate aboriginal 
people as individuals into mainstream society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have just mentioned is almost word for word from the 
summary of the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples.  Numerous actions were the instruments of the 
destruction: the Indian Act; the removal of jurisdiction from 
aboriginal governments; government control over who was 
recognized as an Indian; forced attendance by several generations 
of aboriginal children at residential schools; adoption of 
aboriginal children into non-aboriginal homes; the loss of 
two-thirds of the land set aside in treaty; the exclusion of 
aboriginal culture from processes related to education, justice, 
health and family services; and substitution of welfare for an 
effective economic base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many people who believe that aboriginal people have 
had it easy and have no reason to complain.  For those 
unbelievers let me read a few excerpts from a speech given by 
Father Hugonard on Saturday, May 27, 1916.  Father Hugonard was 
with the Lebret Indian Industrial School. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indians are no longer lords of the Prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five tribes with different languages compose the Indian 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study of Indian languages is interesting and indicates their 
different characteristics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have no words to express metaphysical ideas of religion and 
such words had to be made. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Father Hugonard relayed the words of Chief Piapot. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great spirit made berries for us and the white men have put 
fences around them.  And told us: Do not go there: and those 
berries were made for us.  The white people were using our wood, 
our hay and killing game. 
In order to be become sole masters of our land, they relegated us 
to small reservations as big as my hand, and made us promises as 
long as my arm; but the next year the promises were shorter and 
they are the length of my finger, and they keep only half of 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hugonard stated the mode of living on the reserve was widely 
different from what it had been on the prairies.  Buffalo meat 
was replaced by bacon.  They live in small houses without floors. 
Consequently their health was not as good as it was before when 
they lived in tepees, the site of which was often changed, and 
they decreased in number by about a half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1882 the Parliament of Canada made an appropriation for the 
establishment of Indian schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, Hugonard noted At first great difficulty was 
encountered in getting the parents to send their children to 
schools off reserve.  Indians have a natural attachment for their 
children and like to have them around, more for their own 
gratification than for their own welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was this sick kind of belief that has resulted in the problems 
we have.  Education was made compulsory because many aboriginals 
refused to send their children away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hugonard went on: “I believe the Indians of Canada have a 
useful and happy future”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Father Hugonard concluded his address by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new problem in Indian matters may be arising; for a while, 
most Indians have been contributing splendidly to the Red Cross 
and Patriotic Funds, a great number of the ex-pupils of our 
Indian schools have enlisted and are now drilling or actually 
serving the Empire in France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is possible to predict what the effect of mingling with and 
being treated as equals of and knowing that they are in many 
cases the superiors of their white comrades will be upon these 
young soldiers when they return to their reserves.  It will not 
be in their own interest or to the benefit of the country to 
allow them to leave their reserves and obtain the suffrage as no 
doubt some will demand; and while their ideas will have been 
broadened and the influence of the old generation of hunting 
Indians will be lessened—. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policies of this government on aboriginal people are the 
cause of aboriginal dependence on government subsidies.  They are 
the cause of poverty and the cause of unbelievably high crime 
rates and violence involving aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department of Indian affairs acceptance of providing First 
Nations with substandard housing, education facilities and 
educational opportunities ensures that the proper infrastructure 
is in place in the way of roads and proper water and sewage 
systems equal to that of non-aboriginals and, dare I say, they 
were not treated with the same consideration of largely white 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deplorable state of housing and living conditions on 
reserves saw in the last Parliament the government's having to be 
shamed into making even minimum moves.  Not until New Democratic 
Party Manitoba MLAs Eric Robinson and Gerard Jennison brought 
media attention to conditions in Shamattawa where water was so 
high in methane that it would catch fire, not until then did the 
former Liberal member even attempt to act.  Once the media died 
down, the promised improvements, less than half a finger, have 
never happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The royal commission report states aboriginal unemployment in 
the labour force rose from 15.4% in 1981 to 24.6% in 1991 despite 
advances in education. Aboriginal participation in the labour 
force is 57%, below that of all Canadians at 68%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost to the economy in foregone income, $5.8 billion, plus 
the remedial expenditures lead to a loss of $7.5 billion 
annually. Some 300,000 new jobs will have to be created for 
aboriginal people in the next 20 years just to reach that liberal 
“it's okay to be there” 9% to 10% unemployment level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Demographic pressures alone will increase the losses to the 
economy if the present trends continue to $11 billion in the year 
2016. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding aboriginal communities unemployment has always been 
unacceptably high, to some points 95%.  Cuts to health and 
education saw decent paying positions cut in a number of 
communities.  Hydro projects irreversibly altered ways of life 
and means of income to inland fishers and trappers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cuts to CN and VIA took jobs from many communities which were 
built up along the rail lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal workers are abundant in our communities.  Cuts to EI 
have left proud people forced to go on welfare because they were 
short a few hours.  Lack of government services and assistance by 
way of people with a voice, not a machine, has left many in a 
position of no assistance as they get frustrated trying to 
understand voice messages coming out of Brandon.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the member from Parkdale—High Park speak on her 
first day in the House.  Her exuberance over her life in Canada 
was such that it reminded me of a cheerleader waving white and 
red pompoms.  My life in Canada, as well as that of my family, 
grandparents and great-grandparents when they came from Ukraine 
and Sweden, has been great.  That has not been the case for 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was allowed to value and respect all my cultures.  I was not 
denied access to my family as a result of wanting an education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have reflected on this part of Canadian history in the Royal 
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples report for two reasons.  First, 
I am sick of Reformers spouting off about treating aboriginal 
people the same and equally.  Aboriginal people were not treated 
fairly or equally since the first contact with the Canadian 
government.  We must go beyond what is expected for everyone else 
to right that wrong and to improve the rate of employment for 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remove all the hindrances, poverty, poor housing.  The 
first step which requires no cost is an apology to aboriginal 
people for a government policy that fully intended to lead to 
cultural genocide.  At a time when the government has seen fit to 
attain its economic surplus by using unemployment, at a time when 
government policy has people working two to three jobs to make a 
living, the government must commit to all Canadians, aboriginal 
and non-aboriginal, to go beyond that half a little finger 
election promise and create jobs, decent, make a living jobs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, let me start by saying that 
today's motion has more to do with some obsolete NDP theology 
than it does with any of today's economic realities.  It seems to 
be almost an article of faith to the hon. member that our 
government is “blind to the human tragedy of 1.4 million 
unemployed Canadians” and the supposed proof of our sin is that 
we have succeeded in meeting our target for dramatic deficit 
reduction and consistent inflation control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member of an old saying that there are none so 
blind as those who will not see.  It is very clear that this 
opposition party cannot see or understand some of the fundamental 
facts of life about jobs, about deficits, about inflation and 
about responsible government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the government and members in this House are 
concerned about the opportunity that Canadians have for 
employment.  Another fact to put on the table is governments 
cannot create jobs for every Canadian in this country.  It is 
only the marketplace that can do that through the work of the 
entrepreneurs and their companies creating the products and 
services that people need and can pay for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of the worst barriers that government can put forward are to 
let deficits rise and inflation get out of control.  High 
deficits and inflation are a guaranteed recipe for economic 
weakness and job loss and most Canadians understand that.  They 
have seen destructive dynamics at work in the past and they are 
finally seeing government turning the corner and starting to see 
the reduction of deficit and low interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deficits mean nothing more than higher taxes tomorrow to pay for 
the money the government has borrowed.  It is the prospect of 
high inflation that pushes interest rates up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an ideology.  This is a matter of hard economic 
reality.  Letting deficits and inflation rise pushes up taxes and 
interest rates and puts conditions in place that drive down growth 
and job creation.  That is irresponsible government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester went on about the 
success of the Mulroney government and how Canadians are bowing 
down to the great policies of that government.  The past 
administration had no political will to reduce the deficit, to 
put conditions in place to encourage jobs and growth.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would go as far as to say that the prior administration could 
not hit the side of a barn as a target.  It proved that in all 
the years it was in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came to office the government committed itself to 
breaking the vicious cycle of deficits, debt and inflation.  We 
knew that it was the best and surest way to spur the economic 
growth which produces jobs, good jobs, sustainable jobs. It was 
the best and surest way to make it possible for government to 
stop raising taxes and ultimately, as our finances improved, be 
in a position to reinvest in Canadian priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister told Canadians in last week's economic and 
fiscal update that the plan is working.  We have achieved a 
dramatic turnaround in our national deficit burden, with the 
lowest deficit in 20 years.  With the commitment of the 
government and the Bank of Canada to firm targets, inflation is 
at its lowest sustained level in 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not abstract achievements.  There is no plot by 
bankers and bureaucrats to oppress workers and worsen employment, 
as the hon. member's motion implies.  The proof is clear and 
concrete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 we began hitting and beating our deficit targets.  As 
inflation remains stable, short term interest rates have dropped 
5 percentage points.  That means falling below and staying below 
U.S. rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, long term 10 year bond rates are down nearly 4 
percentage points over the same period.  They have been below 
U.S. rates since February.  That is performance which is 
unprecedented in Canada's post-war history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes this so important?  It involves more of the facts 
which today's motion does not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Bank of Canada has some influence on short term 
interest rates, it is the market and only the market that sets 
the long term rates.  What the marketplace is saying about 
Canada's long term rates today is that our prospects for 
continued growth and stable inflation are among the best in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private sector economists are now saying that Canada's growth 
over the next two years will be at its strongest level in 
decades.  In fact, they predict we will have the strongest 
back to back growth of any of the group of seven leading 
industrial economies, better than Japan, larger than Germany and 
stronger than America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing some of the benefits of low interest rates being 
delivered now.  Five year mortgage rates are at their lowest 
level in decades.  Housing starts are up 24% over 1996 because of 
those interest rates.  People are buying new houses.  That means 
new jobs in construction and manufacturing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Low rates have also helped to increase business investment.  It 
has surged over 25% from last year.  That means plants being 
built and people being hired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumer confidence is the highest it has been in over eight 
years.  Again, that means people buying cars and other goods, 
creating more jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of this year 279,000 new jobs have been 
created.  That is the economic plan at work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that members have heard of this outstanding outlook 
before in the House, but I want to say that it will be repeated 
in the coming months.  It will be repeated because these are the 
facts that the various opposition parties want Canadians to 
forget and ignore.  They want to blind Canadians to these facts, 
or at least denigrate and downplay them.  These facts prove that 
our balanced, consistent approach to growth and job creation is 
working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be specific about a couple of issues which are tied to 
today's motion. The hon. member goes on to condemn this 
government about being obsessed with future inflation.  Inflation 
takes time to build a head of steam.  The Bank of Canada eased 
off the gas pedal to avoid having to jam on the brakes later on. 
That is the best way to avoid the painful boom-bust cycle which 
Canadians saw in the 1970s and 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members talk about pain and suffering.  What about the pain 
and suffering that Canadians felt when they came crashing down 
through these boom-bust cycles because the monetary policy was 
not flattening out those cycles and ensuring they stayed 
consistent so that Canadians would not suffer through them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week a Canadian auto workers union economist said that 
economic growth and lower interest rates alone would have allowed 
us to meet our deficit targets.  In other words, we did not need 
to cut any government spending.  In fact, just freezing it would 
have allowed us to meet our targets and that would have been good 
enough.  There are some real problems with this myopic and 
partisan analysis.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister always made it clear that our deficit 
targets were never intended as the most we could do but were the 
least we could do.  It is always hoped that we would do better. 
It is absurd to suggest that meeting deficit targets is good 
enough and that there is no benefit in doing better than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister announced an $8.9 billion deficit, down from the 
projected $24 billion.  That means there is $15 billion less 
borrowing than we originally forecasted.  That means that $15 
billion is not being added to the debt and that $15 billion will 
not be costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars of 
interest charges.  That is a real bottom line benefit to beating 
our targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A private senior economist said earlier in the week that 
interest rates would not have fallen to 30 year lows had 
financial markets not been convinced the federal government truly 
had spending under its control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that unemployment remains tragically high and that 
we have to do more.  It is a commitment of the government.  It 
was an important part of the finance minister's update last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a dramatically evolving world economy, an environment 
where the foundations for employment are changing.  It presents 
new challenges and responsibilities for government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me close by saying that the government can make a difference 
in some key areas.  First, a sound economic framework is 
essential for ensuring sustained prosperity that creates more and 
better jobs.  Second, promoting knowledge and innovation in the 
economy is key to ensuring a more positive economic future. 
Third, the government has a responsibility to ensure that 
Canadians not only survive in an evolving economy but are well 
equipped to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians need and deserve a government that is truly 
committed to economic progress, to growth that creates real jobs 
and generates new revenues which can help us preserve valued 
programs such as health care and to creating conditions for 
economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are committed to do.  That is the road we are 
constructing.  That is the destination we will help Canadians 
reach.  As a result, more jobs will be created and there will be 
greater security for today's citizens and for our children.

Liberal colleague from Ontario, the hon. member for Stoney Creek, is 
showing no compassion for the people of Canada, all Canadians, and low 
income earners in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witness his allusion to the Minister of Finance stating, in his 
economic statement last week, that a $10 billion shortfall was 
discovered. I can tell you where this missing money can be found: in the 
employment insurance surplus, a plan whose premium rates are clearly too 
high. 
Unemployed workers who show up at the EI office to claim what paying 
these high premiums entitles them to are often told they are short a few 
hours—since the new system counts hours—to qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefit period for those who qualify was also reduced. In 
short, premium rates are sky high, there are fewer eligible claimants 
and benefits are paid over a shorter period. This is how we end up with 
the $12 billion projected surplus for the year ending March 31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance also lacks compassion. Here is further 
evidence: a millionaire, who registers his ships in countries described 
as tax havens to be able to hire crews that do not fall under Canadian 
jurisdiction and to pay them less as well as to avoid paying taxes here, 
in Canada, that is who we have as a Minister of Finance.

mechanism in many cases. The program was not perfect of course, but it 
was a safety mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the riding of Frontenac—Mégantic want to see the

April 27 and June 2, he visited the region three times and twice came to 
the riding of Frontenac—Mégantic. But now, it is impossible to talk to 
him. He is silent as the grave. 
The minister shows no sign of compassion toward these workers.

that he does not know either what it is like for a family to live on an

the question.  With reference to his comments about the EI fund, 
it is a question that has been asked over and over again in the 
House.  I will repeat the answer for the benefit of the member. I 
hope I can be very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1986 the auditor general has made the request that the 
government include the EI fund in consolidated revenues.  I am 
not sure where the member pulled his figures from when he talked 
about a $10 billion surplus.  We do not have a surplus in any 
fund.  Any changes in the EI program would deal with the bottom 
line of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we have taken office we have provided a cumulative 
reduction in employment insurance of $4 billion.  The government 
recognizes that employment insurance premiums should not be going 
up but should be going down.

in speaking against the motion I note that the federal government 
has accomplished what many said could not be done.  The federal 
government has transformed the economic, political and social 
reality and environment over the past four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government with astonishing speed has taken the 
country from a $42 billion deficit in 1993 to a zero deficit in 
the next fiscal year.  Something considered undoable has been 
done.  Canadians understand and know that sacrifices had to be 
made to get our fiscal house in proper balance.  Canadians were 
prepared for some pain to ensure long term viability and gain for 
future generations, and this has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strong economic foundation which has been laid and expanded 
upon is now paying off for Canadians.  Canadians are seeing real 
economy advances not seen since the boom years of the 1950s and 
the 1960s.  With this strong foundation comes a confidence needed 
by people to propel the economy into the 21st century.  It is 
confidence built on hope and expectation.  It is confidence built 
on solid performance and optimism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have waited a long time.  While we can and will 
continue to work hard to ensure prosperity for all sectors of the

rebounded.  Consumer goods enjoy strong sales throughout the

Jobs are being created at an accelerating pace and growth as 
measured in gross domestic product is outstanding even by 
international standards.  People are starting to feel good about 
the economy and what is happening in Canada.

In short, our economy is in remarkable shape.  That is why the 
international consulting firm of KPMG, which did a comparative

one of the best places in the world in which to invest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is poised on the cusp of a prolonged economic expansion, 
all of which spells good news for the country and good news for 
Canadians.  This enables the federal government as both a

they need.

dividend formula, that being 50% for programs and the other 50%

the next millennium.  It should be about how best to build a

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular letter, the hon. Minister of Transport goes 
on to say that the 20% fuel tax fails to do a number of things. 
He makes quite a list here.  He says, “I should note that the 
federal government collects the road fuel tax as part of the 
consolidated revenue fund and uses the proceeds to fund such 
areas as health, welfare, education, defence and transport.” Now 
comes the phrase that I would like the hon. member to pay 
particular attention to “as well as to help reduce the federal 
debt”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week the Minister of Finance indicated that there was 
an $8.9 billion deficit coming forward for the next fiscal year. 
I wonder if the hon. member could tell us and convince us somehow 
that an $8.9 billion deficit is in fact not an increase in the 
debt of Canada rather than a decrease.  If over the years this 
20% fuel tax has been collected to reduce the federal debt, then 
I would like to know where it was that this money was applied to 
the federal debt?  As I look at the government's balance sheets I 
notice that each year the debt is climbing.  Yet for some reason 
or another, the Minister of Transport says that part of the 20% 
fuel tax has gone to reduce the federal debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to please address that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the 
member opposite for the question.  I found it of particular 
interest that he would make reference to the chamber of commerce. 
Certainly those people in the chamber of commerce in my area of 
Canada and indeed those members of the board of trade in various 
places across this great land have cheered the government in 
terms of what it has been able to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very glad that he would make that point on my behalf.  I 
very much appreciate that because business, as members know, have 
been able to see the merits of what the federal government has 
been able to accomplish over these past numbers of years.  In 
fact, they are very grateful for the kind of things that have 
been done to secure the kind of climate that is necessary for 
people to live and work and secure the quality of life that is 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was particularly interested in the question with respect to 
the infrastructure program.  As a former mayor of a municipality 
in the region of Waterloo we very much value the infrastructure 
program that was put into place not only in 1993 but also in 
1996-97.  For example as a municipality we spent enormous amounts 
of money in partnership with the province and the federal 
government to ensure that sewage treatment plants were in place, 
to ensure that highways were built and roads were secure and in 
doing all kinds of things in the best interests of the people we 
represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the hon. member to make reference to the infrastructure 
program I can certainly say that it was a wonderful program which 
benefited Canadians not only in my part of Ontario and Canada but 
people across this great land.

like to split my time with the member for Kelowna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking over this opposition motion by the member for Halifax, I 
notice that the NDP address some serious problems in the country 
but they have the wrong solutions.  But it is not only the NDP 
that does not have the solutions, it is the Liberals across the 
way who are missing solutions as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP have suggested that somehow by making an investment in 
culture they will ameliorate unemployment and will provide jobs. 
I do not know how flower power is going to put people back to 
work.  The sixties are over. Buying million dollar paintings does 
not put people to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers in Saskatchewan who voted for the NDP would not be in 
favour of buying million dollar paintings.  Seniors in Kamloops 
or Burnaby would not be in favour of buying million dollar 
paintings.  Unemployed fishers in Atlantic Canada would not be in 
favour of buying million dollar paintings, but the NDP is.  The 
party that some of these people voted for is. 
I think some of those people have to question whether or not 
those members truly understand their needs. Then I look across to 
the Liberal benches.  Once again I will lay out the problem and 
talk about the lack of solutions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of unemployment, we are in our 84th month of 
unemployment at a rate of 9% or worse.  What have they done in 
response?  They have an employment insurance surplus which is now 
at about $15 billion, or will be by the end of the fiscal year. 
For every single average working Canadian in the country it means 
$700.  The Liberal government is taking $700 from the average 
working Canadian for employment insurance and it says it is 
accountable and is looking after the situation of unemployment? 
News for them.  Economics 101 is that payroll taxes kill jobs. 
Until the Liberals understand this they will not be able to 
rectify the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also talk about how they want to put $90 million toward 
youth unemployment.  They talk about how they care, but they do 
not. They are talking about $90 million to hire some temporary 
bureaucrats for the summer to once again grow the size of 
government.  If we look at this a little more closely, beyond the 
myopic Liberal view of the next election in trying to buy some 
votes, we realize it would take about 140 years for the Liberals 
to solve the youth unemployment problem by employing all the 
unemployed under the age of 30.  They cannot rectify it that way. 
It is a joke as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals then talk about spending a billion dollars in 
handouts to students.  What they do not tell Canadians is that 
for every dollar they pay, for every one person they claim to 
help, they hurt nine more.  For every single person who will get 
some sort of benefit, nine more have a bigger debt to face.  They 
have a higher deficit.  They have higher taxes.  That is what 
will kill their opportunities when they go into the job market. 
The government fundamentally misunderstands what it is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments, whether it be the ministers or the prime minister 
in the front benches now or in the past, have always erred on the 
side of big government.  The government has a theory and it is a 
wrong-headed theory because it does not hold up in reality.  The 
theory is that the bigger government is, the more centralized it 
is and the more people it employs, this will somehow rectify the 
situation of unemployment in the country.  The government 
supported then an unemployment insurance policy now an employment 
insurance policy that subsidizes people in seasonal work to be 
unemployed. It encourages the problem.  It doubles the 
unemployment rate of our neighbours to the south, the United 
States, and the Liberals sit smug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who were unemployed voted for the Liberals. Farmers in 
Saskatchewan voted for the NDP.  Seniors who are facing real 
crunches because of fixed incomes received from the government 
through pensions or other means voted for the NDP.  Unemployed 
fishers in Atlantic Canada who once again gave the Liberals a 
chance despite the failed Atlantic groundfish strategy were 
willing to give the NDP a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those people have been failed because the socialists to the 
left of me, the NDP, talk about going ahead and spending money on 
million dollar paintings and funding artists.  This will not help 
unemployed fishers.  It will not help farmers in Saskatchewan and 
it will not help seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals across the way say they want to help youth but go 
ahead and put taxes against them with the Canada pension plan. 
Shame on them.  They go ahead and jump the CPP contribution rate 
to 10%, a $10 billion tax that will be levied against students 
and young people in the country so they can subsidize their MP 
pensions, and they gloat with pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has the gall to stand up in the House 
and brag about their accomplishments.  How can they brag about 84 
months of unemployment above 9%?  How can they brag about a $10 
billion tax?

did it with 36 tax increases since 1993 and two more to boot in 
the first session in this House?  The government has brought 
forward Bill C-2 which is a $10 billion tax hike. It has brought 
forward Bill C-10 which goes after seniors who receive social 
security benefits from the United States.  How can it be proud of 
a record like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a Liberal could be proud of a record like that.  Only 
Liberals could feign pride in this House and stand up to say that 
they support those measures, that they are doing it for the sake 
of tax fairness, that they are putting in a $10 billion tax for 
the sake of tax fairness, that they are taxing seniors on their 
social security benefits for tax fairness.  Where is the fairness 
in that?  I do not know.

last comments be made without clearing the record for Canadians. 
I will speak slowly so the hon. member will understand me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiums that are paid by Canadians into the Canada pension 
plan do not flow to consolidated revenues of the Government of 
Canada.  Taxes flow to consolidated revenues of the Government of 
Canada.  CPP premiums flow to the Canada pension plan fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact after a year and a half of consultations with the 
provinces of this country, an agreement was signed to establish 
an investment fund which would provide Canadians a better rate of 
return on their retirement income. The easiest thing for us would 
have been to do nothing, which the prior administration decided 
to do.  But we are doing this so there will be a Canada pension 
plan in this country, not to engage in the kind of political 
rhetoric we just heard.  That is a point of clarification for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad the member across 
the way has touched on the CPP tax hike fiasco because it gives 
me an opportunity to illuminate a little more on that subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government of the day first brought CPP in, it said 
that it would be a fund that would never rise above 5% of 
somebody's salary.  Paul Martin Senior, the father of the current 
supporter of the plan, said that it would only cost a couple of 
hundred dollars a year.  Now the government has the gall to go 
ahead and tax Canadians the thousands of dollars that it does, 
10% of their income, double what it was initially said to be. The 
government members of the day made promises on the stumps back in 
1966.  They talked about how it would never rise above 5% and 
today we look at something that is double what it was and they 
say “trust us again”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the Liberals say that those funds flow to the CPP fund. Once 
again, can they not gloat with pride when they have a $500 
billion unfunded liability?  That is according to their own 
numbers.  I do not like to trust government numbers very much 
because they often prove to be inaccurate.  The Fraser Institute 
puts it at a trillion dollars.  Split the difference somewhere in 
between or cut it down the middle. Seven hundred and fifty 
billion, five hundred billion, one trillion, it is a lot of 
money.  For them to stand with pride today in the House and say 
that those funds only go toward the CPP fund with a $500 billion 
unfunded liability, shame.

who have the misfortune to lose their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the old scheme, up to 65% of those who lost their jobs

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear my colleague's views on what should be 
done with this large amount of money, which comes solely from 
taxpayers and companies, and not from the government.  If he were 
the Minister of Finance, how would he go about using this $10 to 
$12 billion to revitalize the economy? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if only we had somebody on 
this side of the House who was the minister of finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the surplus in the EI fund started off as $7 billion 
in the first year of its overpayment and overcontributions.  By 
the end of this fiscal year it is expected to be about $15 
billion.  With all the projections in sight it will get bigger. 
They are not saving up a rainy day slush fund.  It is a tax, pure 
and simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are bringing in billions of dollars, $700 more per 
average working Canadian than what they should, what should the 
government do?  Liberals should open up their ears and pay 
attention.  They should be telling this to the finance minister. 
They should be pleading with him on behalf of their constituents. 
They should be asking for a payroll tax cut.  The Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business has talked about a 25% tax cut 
in the EI premiums because it creates jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote their own finance department studies, when they 
increased EI premiums from a little over 3% to close to 5% it 
resulted in killing 26,000 jobs.  It is expected by their own 
Department of Finance studies that this recent hike, these 
overcontributions, will kill 76,000 jobs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is 
something in the NDP motion that I very much support.  The motion 
demonstrates a deep concern about the shortcomings of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unemployment is at an unreasonably high level and it has been 
sustained.  It is about the only thing that has been sustained by 
the Liberal government.  Unemployment remains consistently high 
and the debt has consistently increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate part of the motion is that it mixes up causes 
and effects.  I will not defend the Liberal government in any 
way, shape or form but I will support the intent of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its intent is to call to the attention of Canadians that the 
government has failed to create jobs, to make adequate 
investments in health and in education, and has not done what it 
should have done with the fiscal management of the affairs of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has failed to recognize that people care about 
the unity of Canada, about the fiscal management of their affairs 
and want to have a standard of living of which they can be proud 
of and can pass on to their children.  Hopefully their children 
will have a better standard of living than what they enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current regime that is not likely to take place.  The 
average family of four has $3,000 less to spend today because of 
the increase in taxes.  Thirty-eight tax increases have now taken 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize that it is the skills and abilities of 
people that create the strength of a nation.  It is not primarily 
the natural resources although they help.  The use and the 
application of natural resources comes through the skill, 
abilities and hard work of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it then that the government ought to be concerned about? 
It ought to be concerned about creating jobs.  There is ample 
evidence that by increasing taxes the government is doing the 
exact opposite.  Increasing taxes, payroll taxes, property taxes, 
income taxes, surtaxes or excise taxes, has the impact of 
decreasing jobs and not increasing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me refer to a particular incident in the United States. 
There have been several instances of tax decreases but I want to 
pay particular attention to the Michigan experience. 
In 1991 John Engler took power in the state of Michigan.  Since 
that time total employment has grown to 4.6 million people, a 
record high in just six years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the same period the state unemployment rate was cut in half 
from a high of nearly 10%, which by the way is just about where 
it is in Canada, to a low of 4% in May of this year.  That is 
something the government could be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did he achieve that?  Governor Engler states “Our strategy 
of cutting taxes, reducing regulations and balancing budgets is 
paying off in more jobs, higher pay and healthy growth”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Secretary of State for International Financial 
Institutions to pay particular attention to what I am about to 
say.  Since 1991 Engler has instituted 21 tax cuts.  That is the 
exact opposite to what has happened in Canada.  We have had 38 
tax increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government really wants to increase job opportunities it 
should cut taxes, not increase them.  There is ample evidence for 
that.  This is only one example.  There are many examples which I 
could cite at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Isn't it beautiful to cut taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  “Isn't it beautiful to cut taxes?” 
The gentleman is already beginning to recognize that he could 
turn it into music. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wouldn't all Canadians wish to sing a new song?  They would love 
to sing the song “I have a job and I have less taxes to pay.  I 
have more money for my children's education.  I have more money 
for entertainment.  I have more money to do the things I really 
want to do”.  I am so glad the hon. member opposite recognizes 
there are countries in the world which know how to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize that it is very important for hon. members 
opposite to recognize what the role of government ought to be.  I 
would like the previous parliamentary secretary to the minister 
of industry to listen very carefully.  The role of government is 
to maintain a culture which rewards entrepreneurship, innovation 
and research, and ensures a level, competitive and honest 
marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can that be done?  It can be done by creating a change in 
attitude from dependence upon government handouts to one of 
independence, creativity, the ability to apply one's initiative 
and an attitude which will give us the incentive to produce, 
develop and become increasingly efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That happens when taxes are reduced and when people are allowed 
to spend the money they have so carefully earned instead of the 
money being spent by a politician or a bureaucrat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individual people in Canada are far more capable than any member 
of the House of spending money in their best interest.  They know 
where it ought to be spent.  That ought to be our number one 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sympathize with the NDP when it says that we ought to create 
employment.  Its solution is to give more money to these people 
through taxes.  That would be taking the taxes from one group of 
people, giving a bit to the bureaucrats and politicians, and 
giving a bit back to the people.  It would create dependent 
people.  It would not solve anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money should be left in the hands of the people.  They will 
spend it wisely.  They will develop, produce and provide the 
kinds of services that will make the country better and make them 
richer.  It would even make NDPers richer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to show precisely how convinced even the Minister of 
Finance is that payroll taxes actually cut jobs.  More than one 
official in his department has demonstrated clearly that payroll 
taxes cut jobs.  He has ample evidence all around him to show 
that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business surveyed over 
19,000 small businesses.  It found that over half, or 50.8% to be 
specific, would hire more individuals if payroll taxes were 
reduced.  That is only one kind of tax, payroll tax.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If over half of them would do that it would increase the number 
of jobs rather dramatically.  Only 10% of the businesses surveyed 
believed the government's infrastructure program—and I wish the 
hon. member who was just talking about the infrastructure program 
were here to listen—would encourage more hiring.  Over half of 
them believed that if payroll taxes were reduced they would hire 
more people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have anecdotal evidence of my own.  I know full well that as 
the payroll taxes go up the number of new hires goes down.  If we 
want to get serious about creating jobs we will not increase 
payroll taxes; we will reduce them.  That is what we will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent paper was delivered by Canadian economists Livio Di 
Matteo and Michael Shannon.  They found that each percentage 
point increase in payroll taxes reduced employment by .32%. Based 
on current levels of employment, a one percentage point increase 
in payroll taxes will kill 44,000 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put this into perspective.  Just recently the Minister 
of Finance announced in the House and to all Canadians that CPP 
would be increased by more than 4%.  That means four times 44,000 
fewer people in the workforce.  That is significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to sit here and they to sit there saying that this is 
good for Canada?  It is not good for Canada.  Payroll taxes ought 
to be cut.  That would be a solution to the unemployment problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really want to create a better environment for our 
children and our grandchildren we would cut taxes and let the 
people spend the money.

that, in coming to Ottawa, everyone here has forgotten what the 
real situation is in our country.  I think they have even forgotten 
that, in some areas of this country, there are people who do not 
have the money to put bread on the table so that their children can 
go to school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have trouble understanding our colleague from the Reform 
Party who is saying that, by lowering taxes, we will create 
employment.  I am not interested in the statistics, the economic 
studies and the research papers.  These figures are not right.  We 
are interested in what is really going on.  What is really going on 
is that government gave money to companies for technological 
change, which eliminated 600 or 800 jobs, and companies increased 
their profits without creating employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's banks have made profits in the billions of dollars 
and they are letting people go, not creating jobs.  I still have 
trouble believing that immediately lowering taxes will put an end 
to the employment problem in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that it is not the fault of ordinary people 
that there are no longer any fish.  It is not the fault of 
Newfoundlanders, of the employees who used to work in fish plants. 
It is not their fault if they are not working. In a united country, 
as we are supposed to call it, we are supposed to look out for one 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, I will ask my colleague a question.  If 
the Reform Party were in power, what would their short term 
solution be for those who have nothing in the house to eat, and who 
get $38 a week to feed their family?  That is where the problem 
lies.  In the short term, a solution must be found to help people 
in Canada and, in the long term, other solutions must be found to 
create real jobs that will give our workers some dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe, and I will never agree, that the people in

Every Canadian needs those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely what the Reform Party is all about.  It is to 
create the situation where everybody has an opportunity to apply 
their initiative, their talents, develop their skills and 
abilities.  That is what we are all about.  We want to create the 
environment so that people will be able to perform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accusation that was made, the implication was that somebody 
in Canada believes somewhere along the line that Atlantic 
Canadians are somehow lazy.  I have never said that.  I have 
never intimated it.  I have never even suggested that. The hon. 
member is grossly mistaken when he suggests that is the kind of 
thing that the Reform Party believes. That is absolutely false. 
Mr. Speaker, that ought to be made abundantly clear.  He should 
take it back immediately.  Nobody takes that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position is that even people in Atlantic Canada, if he wants 
to take that position, will spend their money more wisely than a 
politician here in Ottawa.  It has to be made abundantly clear 
that the people need to recognize that they must apply those 
skills and abilities that they do so well. Does that not mean 
that there are some temporary solutions that have to be made on 
an emergency basis?  Absolutely and of course. Where there is a 
crisis that has to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about are the long term solutions as well. 
We need both, not just one.  A cut in taxes will create long term 
solutions and will also allow enough money to deal with the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am sharing my time with the member for Thornhill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In preparing for this debate I read very carefully the NDP 
motion.  Central to the whole discussion is the words in the 
motion that the NDP is criticizing the government's policy and 
creating unemployment because of its pursuit of a monetary policy 
obsessed with future inflation and so on and so forth.  The key 
words are “monetary policy” as opposed to fiscal policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may explain the difference, monetary policy has to do with 
interest rates, money supply, the manipulation of the exchange 
rates of currencies across borders. Fiscal policy, on the other 
hand, has to do with government spending; the government public 
accounts, the amount of revenue it gets in, the amount of money 
it spends and whether or not it runs a deficit as a result of 
these spending practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realized as I looked at the motion that one of the reasons why 
the economies of the nation, of Canada and the provinces, have 
got into such tremendous trouble over the past two decades is 
because governments have been pursuing incorrect ideas with 
respect to the impact of monetary policy on the creation of 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP or social democrats in general believe that we can 
arbitrarily influence employment levels by manipulating the money 
supply and manipulating inflation.  It believes this is an 
absolute thing that can be done and that fiscal policy can be set 
aside.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fiscal policy has to do with keeping accounts balanced.  It is 
very clear that throughout the 1970s and the 1980s, the previous 
federal government, for example, took the lead of the NDP which 
was very strong in that Parliament.  It set fiscal responsibility 
aside and pursued a policy that had to do with arbitrarily 
manipulating money supply or interest rates or thinking it could 
do so.  But in the long run the government ran up a huge debt of 
over $500 million.  At the time that government lost office it 
was running an annual deficit of around $43 billion or $44 
billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It shows me that the New Democratic Party, the fourth party in 
the House, is still a dinosaur in its attitude toward the 
economies of nations and the economies of this nation.  NDP 
members should be aware that the direct manipulation of economies 
through monetary policy has failed worldwide. This is why the 
Soviet Union collapsed.  This is why the controlled economies of 
eastern Europe collapsed.  The highfaluting theories of 
arbitrarily controlling the strings of the economy and expecting 
that would directly create jobs just does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of Canadians except for a few people in the 
NDP know it is quite simple.  You do not spend more money than 
you receive.  You have to keep your house in order.  It makes no 
difference whether you are a federal government, the government 
of the United States or an ordinary household anywhere in Canada, 
in the maritimes or in western Canada, if you spend more than you 
take in you are going to get into a lot of trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had occasion to test the Canadian public's opinion on this 
issue.  The fourth party members are fond of pretending they 
represent ordinary working people and the intelligence of 
ordinary working people.  They certainly do not represent the 
intelligence of ordinary people, be they in cities or in rural 
areas.

conducted an excellent fiscal policy which has chiselled down the 
deficit from $40-odd billion to $8 billion in the last year.  It 
expects to eliminate the deficit in the next year. By any other 
yardstick in the G-7 the deficit is already eliminated.  The 
finance minister mentioned yesterday that we have actually begun 
to pay down the debt to the tune of $11 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In anticipation of this good news, on Thanksgiving weekend I 
conducted my poll at the booth at Rockton fair. 
I placed four jars on the table in front of my booth.  I had 
another tin that said surplus.  On a big sign I said “If you 
were Paul Martin and you had a surplus, how would you spend it?” 
The four glass jars I had labelled tax cuts, reduce the debt, 
reduce the GST, restore social spending.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As each person came by the booth and expressed an interest—it 
is amazing how interested people were—I offered them four beans. 
I said “Pretend you are Paul Martin and this is $4 billion. You 
can put it in these jars however you like, in whatever order you 
like no matter what”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing how enthusiastically people took those four beans 
and approached the jars and thought and considered carefully how 
they would spend that $4 billion surplus.  They would hesitate 
here and there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five hundred and twenty-five people took part in my poll.  They 
represented every walk of life.  There were farmers.  There were 
pensioners.  There were young people.  There were people from 
Hamilton because the Rockton fair pulls in people from Hamilton. 
There were people from all over the region.  On Thanksgiving Day, 
it even brought in people from Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an excellent sampling of public opinion, and it cost a lot 
less than an Environics poll or any of these other very expensive 
polls that the government engages in.  I would suggest that it 
was far more accurate than most of those polls because the sample 
was very large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give the results of the poll. On the first two 
days 321 beans showed up for reducing the debt, 207 for increased 
social spending, 101 for reducing the GST and 121 for income tax 
cuts.  The following day the numbers were similar:  341, 208, 160 
and 126. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approximately 42% of all the people who came by the booth felt 
that we should reduce the debt first. I wish both opposition 
parties would bear in mind that these are ordinary Canadians from 
all walks of life. They said that of course they would reduce the 
debt first because if that is done first, everything will follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad of this opportunity to speak in the House today 
because I can say to the finance minister, to all my colleagues 
and everyone in the House that I feel, as a result of this 
experience, the correct course for government is sound fiscal 
policy first. Forget about monetary policy because that follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The correct course of government is to get the debt down.  Then 
there will be more money to spend on social spending.  What I 
hope will happen is that we will have more money to not cut 
income tax but to cut the GST.  I think it is the worst tax 
imaginable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the finance minister use 50% of his surplus 
just as was suggested by the poll on reducing the debt and the 
rest divided equally between reducing the GST and improving 
social spending. 
We, as Liberals, have to be very concerned in maintaining the 
social safety net.  This is where we differ so enormously from 
the Reform.  We are not prepared to spend like blazes like the 
NDP in order to do it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we just had a classic lesson in Liberal voodoo economics 
that totally ignores the realities of this country. The member 
talks about the debt and the deficit.  Let us look at how we got 
into this situation of a debt and a deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three major causes.  The first cause, of course, is 
devastatingly high levels of unemployment.  If folks are not 
working, that increases the bill for unemployment insurance and 
other social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is interest rates.  Historically, interest rates have 
been far too high.  It is only recently that finally the Bank of 
Canada has lowered those interest rates under tremendous 
pressure.  Now Gordon Thiessen, the Governor of the Bank of 
Canada, is suggesting that we have to go back up which would be 
enormously destructive.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final major cause is a tax system which has been 
historically completely skewed and unfair.  That is the basic 
reason for the high levels of the debt and the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the Liberals have to say? They should heed the very 
thoughtful terms of this motion.  Is this really revolutionary? 
If we can set targets for the deficit, if we can set targets for 
inflation rates, surely we owe it to the people of this country, 
particularly that 20% of young people who are desperately trying 
to find jobs and who are losing hope, to set targets.  We must 
set some goals and objectives to reduce the obscene levels of 
unemployment.  That is what this motion says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member says they have wrestled the deficit to the 
ground.  The finance minister goes out and triumphantly says that 
the deficit is gone.  Let us look at how we have arrived at this 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has it been through equal sacrifice?  Has it been through a 
sharing of the burden?  Absolutely not.  We have arrived at this 
point today because the poor, the powerless in this country have 
paid a disproportionate amount to reduce the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the casualties in the war against the deficit. 
They include the unemployed.  A few years ago 90% of unemployed 
Canadians were eligible for employment insurance. Today 
approximately 40% are eligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened to the other Canadians, desperate people 
looking for work?  If employment insurance runs out those people 
are forced to turn to social assistance.  What has happened to 
social assistance?  The Liberal government has abolished the 
Canada assistance plan.  It was the one national program which 
provided leadership in the fight against poverty.  National 
standards are gone entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, poor people are casualties.  Co-op and non-profit 
housing are gone under the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign aid has been shamefully cut.  Canada is now at number 
11 instead of number 5 a few years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to child care, the government has abandoned any 
commitment whatsoever to our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal programs have also been casualties.  My colleague 
from Churchill spoke very eloquently earlier today on the price 
the aboriginal people are paying in the war against the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students have been casualties.  Sure, the deficit has been 
reduced, and at some point we may even start to reduce the debt, 
but we have transferred that debt burden to students.  An average 
graduating student carries a burden of something like $25,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research granting councils have been cut. Cultural programs have 
been devastated, the CBC, the Canada Council, the National Film 
Board. Environmental programs have been cut savagely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Liberal member stand in his place and suggest that 
it is programs which should be cut?  Those programs have helped 
to at least minimize the devastating impact of the gap between 
rich and poor.  He should accept the recommendation of our party 
which calls on us to set those targets.  Is he seriously opposed 
to setting targets for reducing unemployment in the same way as 
we have set targets to reduce inflation and the deficit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can he not demonstrate some humanity, some return to those 
old Liberal values and recognize that we should be setting those 
targets and making this the number one economic priority for the 
people of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if empty rhetoric could 
create jobs, then the NDP would create full employment very 
rapidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is nonsense.  If the member opposite had listened to me he 
would know that I would not reject renewed social spending when 
there is a surplus.  This is certainly one government which has a 
heart and a conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is the previous Conservative government overspent. 
It strangled the economy.  That created unemployment. The way to 
correct that, the way to create jobs, is to allow the economy to 
create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite would create jobs out of a vacuum.  It does 
not work that way.  It works by having people in Canada who are 
actively creating employment taking risks, creating business. 
Sorry, I said business.  Good lord, we should not say business to 
the NDP.

unions, are the ones that are driving this economy.  They are 
fueling the growth of this economy which is growing faster than 
any other economy in the G-7.  As a result of that, I believe in 
the last six months or so we have created some 240,000 jobs in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just shows that we have our fiscal house in order, fiscal not 
monetary. Monetary has to do with funny money going across 
borders.  Germany experimented with that in the 1930s. It printed 
money.  Actually the Social Credit in the west had similarly 
crazy theories during the 1930s.  Oddly enough it was the father 
of the Leader of the Opposition who was very much involved in 
some of these weird theories coming from the west.  All weird 
monetary theories came from the west, whether it was the NDP or 
the Social Credit, it was the cradle of this kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to suggest that Ontario, Quebec, the maritimes and

parts of the country, but I do believe that certainly Ontario and

NDP members, will agree that good fiscal policy, getting your 
house in order is the way to create jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to participate in today's debate.  I have been listening 
very carefully to the comments of all members on both sides of 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I looked over the motion that was presented by the fourth 
party I was struck with the word “condemns”. I believe that if 
they were being fair and reasonable they would compliment the 
government on the result of its policies and its fiscal plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important when we consider this motion to look at the 
record, to look at where we started, to look at where we are 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to say the job is done.  It is not.  There is 
more to do.  Unemployment is too high.  My goal is to see that 
anyone who wants to work will have the opportunity to fully 
participate in our society. That is the goal. I think it is the 
goal of every member who sits on the government side of the House 
and frankly I think it is the goal of every person who comes here 
to this wonderful place.  We want people to have opportunities to 
maximize and achieve their potential. We want them to have the 
dignity of work.  We want them to have the skills so that they 
can prepare for the jobs being created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be fair and reasonable as we begin and continue this debate 
today, we have to look at where this government started from, 
where we are today and where we are going.  Then we can consider 
this motion before the House today for what it really is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where did this government begin?  In 1993 the deficit that was 
inherited was some $42 billion.  Where are we today as just 
announced by the finance minister?  The deficit stands at $8.9 
billion with an expectation that the budget of the Government of 
Canada will be fully balanced with a deficit of zero by the next 
fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an incredible and enormous achievement.  The assessment 
is not by those of us who sit in this House.  It is not just by 
the Liberals.  That assessment is by the international investment 
community which looked at Canada a few short years ago and said 
this country is on the verge of bankruptcy, this country is not a 
good place to invest, this country needs solid, prudent fiscal 
and economic management. 
I suggest especially to the people in my wonderful riding of 
Thornhill that is exactly what Canadians have had under the 
Liberal government since 1993.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations has declared that Canada number one in the 
world as a place to live and work.  More recently a study by KPMG 
determined that Canada, among all those countries surveyed, has a 
significant competitive advantage.  Our cities rank among the 
best in the world not only as a place to live but as a place to 
work.  The same study suggests that Canada is head and shoulders 
above our neighbours to the south as a place to invest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain things that give us that competitive 
advantage.  Those things are relatively new and some have been 
around for a while.  What are those things?  We have a government 
dedicated to balancing the budget, to responsible and prudent 
fiscal management and which is dedicated to ensuring interest and 
inflation rates are low.  These are the things we need to create 
a climate for job creation and investment. They go hand in hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When government attempts to create jobs directly it has to do so 
with tax dollars.  This does not mean those jobs are not 
important.  It means that government must tax in order to create 
jobs. It is far more effective to create a climate which 
encourages the private sector to create those jobs.  Since 1993 
we have seen over one million jobs created in this country.  In 
this year alone 297,000 jobs have been created across the 
country.  Is that enough?  Of course it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 unemployment was 11%. Today unemployment is 9%.  Is that 
low enough?  Of course not.  There are two particular segments of 
our society that concern me.  One is youth who have not had their 
first job or who are finding it difficult to get a job and to use 
their talents, skills and education.  The other is the older 
workers who have been displaced by restructuring and technology 
and who need training and retraining to be productive and useful 
in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sound and prudent responsible fiscal management that this 
country has had since 1993 has resulted in interest and mortgage 
rates, which were so much higher in 1993, now fueling economic 
growth and job creation that will lead the G-7 nations.  Canada 
will out perform all the G-7 nations.  Is it just the members on 
this side of the House who are saying that?  No.  Independent 
forecasters are looking at the rate of growth of the Canadian 
economy.  They are looking at the job creation numbers and they 
are the ones that are saying that the fiscal plan, the sound 
economic management as proposed by the finance minister and the 
government is working.  We are not there yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other factors which make our competitive advantage 
something to shout about.  As a former provincial minister of 
health I can say Canadian medicare is a huge competitive 
advantage. 
They have tampered with medicare, killed medicare.  I say to my 
friends in the Reform and Conservative parties, whose policies I 
believe would devastate medicare, that medicare is a significant 
competitive advantage.  If medicare is tampered with it kills 
jobs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who are sceptical about the government's commitments, I 
say that the government was very quick to respond to the National 
Forum on Health which said that the federal government should 
maintain the transfer payment commitments to the provinces at 
$12.5 billion.  That is the commitment of the government.  It 
will help the provinces to sustain and maintain medicare and 
ensure that the principles of the Canada Health Act are 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two reasons. First is our competitive advantage and 
the second are the values and the soul of this country.  I do not 
think there is a Canadian who is not proud when told by people 
outside this country that we live in a place where money is not a 
factor in access to medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there problems today?  Yes, there are.  I challenge everyone 
in the House to consider what is happening south of the border. 
Take a look at the 40 million people in the United States who 
have no access to health care, to the 100 million people in the 
United States who have inadequate coverage.  Try to understand 
what would happen if the Reform or Conservative parties were 
successful in their Americanization of Canadian medicare.  I 
shudder to think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 jobs were being lost, people were feeling insecure, 
people had no hope. Today Canadians are confident.  Jobs are 
being created, interest rates are at an all time low, the budget 
is on the verge of being balanced.  Canadians know that we will 
have new problems and challenges because the demands of a global 
economy and of those who need the assistance of government will 
continue to be there.  It will be very difficult to respond to 
all of those demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we talk about the importance of sound fiscal management, it 
is also important to note that it must continue. We on this side 
of the House will continue to follow a prudent and responsible 
course, one that will give opportunities to the young and the 
old, one that will enhance and ensure that those who need it will 
have access to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians expect medicare to be preserved.  That is my goal and 
the goal of the government. We want to create an opportunity for 
all in the country to prosper. That is why I will not support the 
NDP motion which is before the House today.  It is misguided and 
irresponsible and out of touch with the realities of 1997.

last two government members.

up a poll to demonstrate their point of view. The government is hiding 
the facts. Canada is the greatest country in the world, Canada is the 
richest country in the world. Every time such comments are made, someone 
rises to remind the government that our country has the highest 
unemployment rate, that it has the largest number of poor, hungry 
children, that it has the most trouble with its debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it mean to be the greatest and the richest country in the

</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be in the hands of those who control it. We are asking the 
government to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that debt reduction should be a priority. However, we 
disagree with the means used to achieve this result. We are telling the 
government: “The idea is good, but do not implement it in this fashion. 
Stop asking the weakest in the family to make an effort to pay off the 
family's debts. They should not have to do that. They will do their 
share, but the other family members must also do theirs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stop putting the burden on the most vulnerable ones. This is 
what we are asking the government, but it is so concerned by its public 
image that it no longer sees reality. 
It merely says: “We are the best, we are the finest. We meet with world 
leaders. We go to Russia and bend over backwards”. Meanwhile, 1.4 
million Canadian children go hungry. The national unemployment rate 
exceeds 10% and the government is burying its head in the sand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the Liberals would wake up and realize it is time to set 
more appropriate objectives, such as those proposed this morning by NDP 
members, even though we do not fully agree with them. We tell them too 
that the target is right. However, in order to hit that target, they 
seem prepared to give up all the powers granted to the provinces and 
give them back to the federal government. This is what concerns us, and 
we will discuss this issue. Again, even though we may agree on a given 
objective, different means must be used to achieve it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will respond to my 
colleague in this way.  I believe that we must have a strong 
economy in order to address the important social issues and 
social programs that we have always valued. I also believe that 
Canada is a partnership where each of the provinces comes 
together with the federal government to solve our problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remarks I was very careful to be clear that the job is not 
yet done.  While the United Nations sees us as the best in the 
world and while private forecasters say we are doing better than 
any of the G-7 countries, we know we have problems that must be 
addressed.  Unemployment is still too high.  Child poverty is a 
real issue.  There is a need for educational opportunities for 
research and development and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategy of the government is to provide a balanced approach 
where we will work together with our partners in the provinces to 
achieve our goals.  We will do it in a responsible way.  We will 
do it with the hand of partnership and in a fiscally responsible 
and prudent way so that around the world people will know that 
Canadians are working together.

frightens me when we hear the Liberals talking is that they speak 
with such passion they are quite convincing.  They believe that 
what they say is true.  It frightens me because they are able to 
deceive Canadians by being so totally deceived themselves about 
the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw an analogy.  In my youth I worked as a truck 
driver on the big rigs.  We did not have phones in the rigs in 
those days but let us take it to modern days.  Here I am, my job 
is to haul some combines from Regina to Winnipeg, which 
conveniently is about 600 kilometres, about 100 kilometres for 
every billion dollar of debt we have.  I take the truck and 
phoned my boss and say I am doing fine.  I tell him I am at 
Indian Head, a few kilometres away, and I am doing great.  He 
says, “Good, what time do you think you will get to Regina?”  I 
say, “Well, I may not because Regina is behind me.  I'm on the 
road.  I'm going about 20 to 30 kilometres an hour but it is 
behind me.”  I keep on driving all day and the boss phones 
again.  He says “How are you doing now?”  I say, “Well I've 
just crossed the border into Manitoba”.  He says, “Hey, you are 
supposed to go to Regina”.  I tell him I will go a little 
faster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the Trudeau Liberals for awhile and then we had Mulroney 
Conservatives and they goosed the thing up to 40 kilometres an 
hour, $40 billion a year.  Now we have these Liberals and just as 
they are approaching Winnipeg, $600 billion, they are bragging 
because they have slowed the truck down to 17 kilometres an hour. 
I am sorry, now it is only going nine kilometres per hour, but 
Winnipeg is just about there and Regina the destination is way 
back behind in the rearview mirror.  And these guys think they

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Larry Takahashi was sentenced to three life sentences for 
committing 14 rapes on Edmonton women.  He is now serving time at 
the Ferndale golf and country club for minimum security prisoners 
in my riding of Dewdney—Alouette, B.C. For his punishment Mr. 
Takahashi is confined to an institution that boasts a nine hole 
golf course and a choice of Coke and Pepsi machines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Ferndale golf and country club too intrusive for the 
balaclava rapist that he now needs leave to visit family and 
friends?  He raped 31 women and in 1991 he was granted leave 
which was revoked due to public pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens of my community, of Edmonton or anywhere else in 
Canada, should not have to beg the solicitor general to keep 
their families safe from sexual predators.  A competent and 
compassionate minister would place the safety of the Canadian 
public and the well-being of victims above the demands of coddled 
criminals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, chapter 21 of the Auditor General of Canada's latest 
report deals with the mismanagement of the military and the way 
it conducts the $100 million plus household goods removal service 
of the federal government.  It is inefficient, provides poor 
service and is open to corruption and conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past month the Regina police laid fraud charges against a 
former manager of a moving company.  The 24 alleged victims 
included 7 private citizens, 10 corporations, 5 provincial 
government agencies and 2 RCMP moves.  The competition bureau is 
also investigating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994 the average weight per government move has increased 
by 14% while the military has reduced its penalties for fraud. 
Why is the military restricting the ability of over 80% of the 
3,000 carriers in Canada from doing moves for the federal 
government? It is time to get the military out of mismanaging 
government moves and to return the military to military 
functions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a powerful social and economic force in Canada today the 
10,000 co-operative enterprises represent a unique form of 
business, bringing together both capital and people to fulfil 
community needs.  For many people and communities the 
co-operative model is vital, relevant and a financially sound 
business solution.  It allows members, communities and employees 
to jointly establish new businesses and save existing ones.

profoundly committed to the co-operative option as a viable way 
of helping to revitalize rural Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in this 
time of technology, science and small business we need to 
recognize that today about 52% of all Canadians employed in the 
private sector are in small business with fewer than 100 
employees per business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least 85% of all new jobs created in Canada are created by 
small business.  Many of these businesses relate to advances in 
computer and telecommunications technology.  They are altering 
the core products and processes at the heart of the Canadian 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the increasing competitiveness of highly skilled labour 
forces dedicated to superior product design and performance, 
small and medium size businesses have the advantage.  It is 
easier to sustain innovation and competitiveness.  Indeed several 
of the most prosperous and competitive economies of the world 
today are based on small firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knows that the above is true.  Why does it take 
small business tax dollars to provide grants to big business?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the week of October 19 to October 25 marks YWCA Canada's second 
annual Week Without Violence.  For these seven days the YWCA is 
challenging all Canadians to live without perpetrating, 
participating in or observing violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This universally significant initiative should be supported year 
round.  A society with less violence is a desirable goal.  We as 
parliamentarians should take a visible role in supporting 
initiatives such as this one.  May our support stand as a 
statement to all Canadians that any violence is unacceptable in 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular we need to encourage and teach our youth that 
there are alternatives to violence.  To that end I am proud to 
advise that in our gallery today are students and teachers from 
Waterloo-Oxford District Secondary School in Bayden, Ontario. 
This high school is located in my riding of Waterloo—Wellington. 
I am proud that we are able to afford these students greater 
insight into the Canadian federal system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As they got off the ship on the morning of October 10, 1697, with 
the mission of teaching young women and looking after the disinherited, 
the handicapped and the sick, it was a moment of great excitement for 
the settlement of Trois-Rivières, which had been founded 63 years

Bloc Quebecois' decision to force the BQ member for Drummond to pay back 
corporate donations accepted during the last election campaign is, to 
say the least, questionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Bloc justify demanding that this MP pay back donations 
received from corporations when the Bloc never applied the same rule to 
itself? What difference do the righteous separatists from the Bloc 
Quebecois make between corporate donations and the $153,048 received 
from the Parti Quebecois in 1993-94? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would they have us believe that the Bloc Quebecois is less likely

Speaker, this week marks the struggle by Canadian women to be 
recognized as legal persons in their own country.  It reminds us 
of one thing and that is just how much the federal government has 
reduced women to the status of non-persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are women persons under the law when the government will not 
honour the law of pay equity?  Are women persons under the law 
when the government leaves women without protection from a 
violent partner?  Are women persons under the law when the 
government terminates all women's career counselling centres? Are 
women persons under the law when the government offloads 
responsibility for health care on to the shoulders of women and 
their families?  Are women persons under the law when the 
government denies women the right to a pension in their own name? 
Are women persons under the law when the government has relegated 
the vast majority of women to part-time, short term, on call, low 
skill and low paying jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, women are not persons in the full sense of the word under 
the government.  Let today be a call to action to reverse this 
trend to ensure women their right to live in safety, in security 
and with dignity.

worrying about the fact that the Reform Party will take $3.5 
billion out of health care.  I would be lying awake at night 
worrying about the Reform Party which has cut $3 billion out of

taxes than they do for food, for clothing and for shelter

Fresh start is their program. In their second taxpayers' budget,

budget, what she would see is that the government elevated 
registered education savings plans to a new level.  In fact they 
have taken off so that parents can save for their children.  We 
have brought in tax credits and allowed students to transfer them 
to other people so that they can pay for their education.  We 
brought in a new measure to enable students to postpone their 
student indebtedness.  This year we brought in the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation and the millennium fund for 
scholarships.

government bills, a function that used to be performed by 
legislative counsel; prohibiting legislative counsel from 
providing legal advice to members in relation to government bills 
or amendments to government bills either in private or in 
committee; restricting the drafting of members' amendments of 
government bills to compatible language as opposed to credible, 
legally binding amendments drafted by legislative counsel, a 
service to which we were accustomed in the previous 
Parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I only want to comment briefly. 
The issues referred to by the House leader for the official 
opposition refer to proceedings of the committee and what a 
committee is able to do in terms of its authority to ask for 
witnesses, its authority to exceed the powers of the House and so 
on.  We are not discussing an issue like this today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue brought to our attention has to do with officials of 
the House under our command, the command of the Board of Internal 
Economy through you as its chair, Mr. Speaker, and whether they 
exceeded any authority vested in them by all of us, particularly 
in an era where we asked officials to reduce budgets and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be that as it may, later this afternoon—I am told it is at 5.15 
p.m.—the committee of the Board of Internal Economy, you, Mr. 
Speaker as our chairman and all of us sitting on the board have 
mandated to review the precise issue of legislative services and 
what services are afforded to members. We will be dealing with 
precisely the services in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the information brought to the attention of the 
table and the Chair be handed to that committee.  It could assist 
the committee in its deliberations.  The committee could then 
recommend to the Board of Internal Economy an appropriate course 
of action in terms of the restoration of services which may or 
may not be deficient as alleged by the hon. member in the 
question of privilege raised a moment ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the committee and the mandate we gave to the 
committee at the board was to act expeditiously.  Therefore, I 
can only conclude that the board as a whole would be seized of 
this very rapidly.  Then it will be up to us as representatives 
of all political parties in the House at the board level to take 
the course of action which is warranted. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As always my colleagues, questions of 
privilege are taken very seriously by your Speaker.  I think what 
the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville is seeking here is redress, 
something that will satisfy his quest for whatever kind of 
information or advice he and other members need, because he is 
speaking on behalf of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank him for bringing up the point.  I would 
like to thank the hon. House leader of the Reform Party and the 
government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the fact that I believe a committee will be seized 
with that this afternoon, I am going to rule at this point that I 
am going to hold a decision in abeyance so that I can ascertain 
and I can get more information as to what suggestions if any the 
committee is going to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the suggestions in my view do not go far enough to deal with 
this grievance, then I will come back to the House and I will 
reopen this question of privilege.  I do not want to rule on it 
right now.  I will have another look at it at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to hold this in abeyance until this committee which was 
struck by the Board of Internal Economy has a chance to meet to 
see if the procedures which were discussed will indeed be acted 
upon.  I want to let this sit at this point for now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Mr. Speaker, do I have to put the motion?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in this debate on the motion put forward by the New 
Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, first of all, like to point out that my party supports 
this motion, because it believes in it fundamentally. The motion, I 
would recall, condemns the government's budgetary measures, draconian 
cuts and its lack of concern regarding the vital issues of job creation 
and individual suffering. 
It also condemns the government's obsession with inflation, which 
results in high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance's budget measures have been fruitful, as we 
saw last week in Vancouver. The deficit for the past fiscal year will be 
about $9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, add something to this estimate. I would recall 
that, last February, when the Bloc Quebecois expressed the possibility 
that the deficit in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1997 would not be 
higher than $10 billion, the Minister of Finance said that we did not 
know what we were talking about, because he was then speaking of a $19 
billion deficit. That was eight months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was still talking about a $19 billion deficit for the last 
fiscal year, so when we pointed to a deficit of some $10 billion and 
accused him of not being totally honest with the public, he said we were 
incompetent. Eight months later, he acknowledges the Bloc Quebecois was 
right in its estimates, because he himself announced that the deficit 
would be somewhere around $8.9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless one is a total incompetent, it is impossible to err in 
predictions by 53% in eight months. It is impossible. Today I reminded 
the Minister of Finance of what I told him last week in Vancouver: that 
he was not intellectually honest, that it was dishonest of him to 
present incorrect figures on the deficit, as he has done since becoming 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His predictions were terrible, way out of line. Again on Sunday 
evening, I was with the president of the forecasting firm Informetrica. 
We discussed the Department of Finance's estimating methods and realized 
that, however we looked at the February figures, trying to make 
adjustments between revenues and expenditures, that is, tax revenues and 
expenditures, there was no way the Minister of Finance could maintain in 
February his forecast deficit of $19 billion. Everything pointed to a 
deficit of between $10 and $12 billion.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister withheld information from the public to avoid any 
debate on the drastic cuts he imposed on the provinces for social 
programs, employment insurance and other initiatives that directly 
affect Quebeckers and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to these cuts, the minister showed a total lack of 
compassion since tabling his very first budget, but particularly since 
his 1996 budget. Where did our dear Minister of Finance take the money 
to achieve such results? He took it out of the pockets of the poor. He 
got the money by slashing social programs, by cutting $6 billion per 
year from programs designed to help the poor. 
By the year 2003, federal transfers to fund social assistance programs 
administered by the provinces, to fund higher education, which is also 
administered by the provinces and which is a field under exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction, and to fund health will have undergone 
cumulative cuts of $42 billion by the Minister of Finance. These are the 
minister's own figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at his 1996 budget and planned cuts until the year 2003, 
we see that, for the fiscal year that just ended, the minister cut $4.6 
billion. In 1997-98, which is the current fiscal year, cuts will reach 
$10.9 billion and will affect provincially administered programs in the 
social assistance, higher education and health sectors. In 1998-99, cuts 
will total $17.2 billion, then $23.5 billion in 1999, and so on, for a 
cumulative total of $42 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So when the Minister of Finance tells us that his government 
announced it would invest $6 billion in social and health programs 
over the next five years, this has nothing to do with the $42 
billion it will cut and will continue to cut until 2003.  It does 
not present an accurate picture to the public of what this 
government is really doing to help the most disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, the Minister of Finance announced that several 
hundreds of millions of dollars would be earmarked annually to help 
the poorest members of society, to revitalize the health sector, to 
provide scholarships for students.  This assistance is a sham.  It 
shows a lack of intellectual honesty to give this impression, when 
there are going to be $42 billion in cuts in the very sectors they 
are claiming to want to focus on in order to help the most 
disadvantaged, the ill, and students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cuts in social transfers to the provinces represent 53% of the 
federal government's spending cuts.  It is not the government, but 
the provinces, that have done the work.  The proof is that for 
every $1 cut in health care in Quebec, 93 cents was because of the 
decision by the federal Minister of Finance to cut Quebec's health 
transfers.  Ninety-three cents on every dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for social assistance and post-secondary education, every 
time Quebec cut a dollar in these sectors, 73 cents was because of 
cuts by the federal Minister of Finance.  So we are not talking 
about peanuts.  This year, for the first time, Quebec would have 
balanced its budget, had it not been for the drastic cuts by the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very well to tell us about the Minister of Finance's 
wonderful ability to manage, but any old biped of average 
intelligence would have done exactly the same thing.  It is easy to 
steal from your neighbour and say that you came by our money 
honestly.  That is what the Minister of Finance has done.  He has 
had others do the work.  He has also had the unemployed workers of 
Quebec and of Canada do some of the work.  For the past three 
years, he has asked them to contribute almost $20 billion to help 
reduce his deficit.  How did he do this?  By keeping premiums 
abnormally high, by generating surpluses that will reach $13 
billion this year. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT66"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT66"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1530

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we went from a $6 billion deficit in the UI fund in 1993 to $13 
billion in accumulated surpluses this year. The calculation is simple: 
the $6 billion deficit was eliminated by imposing very high employer and 
employee premium rates and by making the employment insurance plan 
stricter. Add $13 billion to that and there are the $19 billion that did 
not go to the unemployed these past three and a half years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is $19 billion taken away from the unemployed, that should 
have been used, partly at least, to pay benefits to the unemployed to 
help them get back to work. But it was not. This amount could also have 
been used to create jobs. Again, it was not. Job creation is not 
important to this government. 
If it was important, we would not have 1.5 million unemployed workers in 
this country. If it was important, the employment insurance premium 
rates would not be maintained at an artificially high level, as they 
currently are; premiums rates, which are payroll taxes, would be 
lowered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High premium rates slow sustainable and meaningful job creation. 
Now that the public finances are in better shape and that he has the 
most vulnerable taxpayers to thank for that, what is the Minister of 
Finance waiting for to correct the situation, by admitting his mistake 
and his responsibility in the deteriorating poverty situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we must not think that billions of dollars, $42 billion by 
the year 2003, can be cut without serious harm being caused to the 
people of Quebec and Canada and without this being reflected somewhere 
in the statistics on poverty. 
It already is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is reference to child poverty.  The incidence of child 
poverty was 14.5% in 1989.  The percentage of children living in 
families below the poverty line was 14.5.  At the present time, the 
figure is 20.5%, a rise of 4.5%, and this is connected to the 
Minister of Finance's policies, the Minister of Finance's drastic 
cuts to social programs.  That is the only explanation there is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at unemployment, the minister is boasting of 
fantastic surpluses in the unemployment insurance fund, which he is 
putting toward reduction of the deficit, when we look at the 
restrictions which have helped accumulate the unemployment 
insurance fund surplus, the restrictions to the new employment 
insurance program, we see that this is no joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990, 77% of the unemployed, the men and women who lost 
their jobs, were entitled to unemployment insurance.  This year, 
only 41% were.  Why?  Because the rules were tightened up.  The 
eligibility requirements were tightened up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So where do you think people go today, when they are no longer 
entitled to unemployment insurance?  Most go on welfare.  They 
become marginal.  Once again, the one responsible is the Minister 
of Finance.  He is the one who pretends to have a heart, while in 
fact he has no compassion, none whatsoever, along with the rest of 
the government, for the most disadvantaged and for the unemployed. 
He is the one responsible, he is the one marginalizing workers, who 
end up cut off from the realities of the workplace, once they are 
marginalized and forced onto welfare.  They are cut off from that 
reality, and it is hard to get back to a normal job search 
afterward. 
One has to be close to the labour market to improve one's chances of 
finding work. The Minister of Finance totally disregarded that aspect in 
his efforts to meet his budgetary objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion tabled by the NDP also deals with the monetary policy. 
It is the federal government which dictates the main thrusts of the 
monetary policy to Gordon Thiessen, the Governor of the Bank of Canada. 
At the very least, the minister sends signals, even though he does not 
administer the monetary policy himself. He sends signals to the Governor 
of the Bank of Canada on behalf of his government, so that the latter 
will apply specific interest rate policies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance, who claims to support employment and who 
gives all kinds of wrong figures, which makes me wonder about his 
intellectual honesty, tells the Bank of Canada: “Go ahead with the 
strong medicine; interest rates must go up as soon as economic recovery 
is in sight. We must not create too many jobs. It would generate 
inflationary pressure. Go ahead, raise interest rates. Do what the Bank 
of Canada used to do, which was to apply strong medicine whenever there 
was any emerging inflationary trend”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister agrees with this policy. Last week, in the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>, while everyone else in Canada was criticizing— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The hon. member for 
Tobique—Mactaquac, on a point of order. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, I find it unfortunate that you 
interrupted— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel:</B> —such a fine speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Such a fine speech, as my hon. colleague said. I 
did not say so. Even the Reform Party agrees this was a fine speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, Madam Speaker, the Minister of 
Finance, who claims to be in favour of job creation, is sending the Bank 
of Canada signals that directly contradict this government's job 
creation objectives. He keeps saying to Gordon Thiessen, the governor of 
the Bank of Canada: “Go ahead. Whenever the economy starts growing too 
fast and inflationary pressure may develop, use your strong medicine the 
old way, by raising interest rates”.  That is a recipe for jeopardizing 
economic recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bank of Canada monetary policy is rather complex, but it 
basically boils down to this. 
As soon as there is an economic recovery and economic growth creates 
employment, if growth is deemed to be too fast, according to His 
Excellency the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Gordon Thiessen, he 
immediately raises interest rates to slow the rate of growth right down, 
thereby slowing job creation too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the silliest policy Canada has had in years. Three years 
into a technical recovery, labour market conditions have yet to be 
restored to their prerecession levels. Participation levels are lower 
than ever. Our capacity to reduce unemployment—there are currently 
1.5 unemployed Canadians—has diminished. 
Even Gordon Thiessen realized last year that he had perhaps gone a 
bit too far with interest rates in the last quarter of 1995; that 
he had perhaps slowed down the rate of job growth a bit too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable that there is a lack of jobs, that the rate 
of unemployment is so high, and that they are holding to an archaic 
policy of staying below the Bank of Canada's own inflation target. 
A minimum of 2% inflation was mentioned.  Right now, inflation is 
around 1.7% or 1.8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bank of Canada forgot the other part of its mandate, which 
is to see that the money market does not reduce job creation 
opportunities.  They have completely lost sight of this.  They are 
obsessed with inflation.  It is cruel to do what they are doing. 
They are ruining unemployed workers' chances of finding jobs 
because they are keeping interest rates high during an economic 
recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has to change.  As the NDP's motion points out, the 
Minister of Finance must get back on track and give a clear signal 
to the Bank of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question of continuing this sort of dogmatic 
policy, of raising interest rates when they should not be raised. 
The emphasis should be on using low interest rates to encourage 
investment, which will then lead to job creation.  It is time the 
Minister of Finance changed course, because we will never bring 
down the high rate of unemployment we are now facing with a policy 
as pathetic as the one favoured by the Governor of the Bank of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one aspect of the Minister of Finance's approach to 
righting the budgetary situation that I forgot to mention just now. 
I forgot to mention that the Minister of Finance sat with his arms 
folded for two years. 
He watched the train go by, revenues fill the coffers of the federal 
government, because another $23 billion in taxes went into the federal 
government's coffers, because the Minister of Finance did not index tax 
tables, because the Minister of Finance told Revenue Canada to reduce 
all tax credits including tax credits for persons with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you had any idea, and my colleagues can confirm this, of the 
number of people with disabilities who come to our riding offices and 
complain that Revenue Canada is after them demanding the return of the 
tax credit for persons with disabilities that they received in the 
previous five years. They even go so far as to tell people who are 
totally unable to pursue normal work activities that they have no 
disability, that they are not entitled to this credit. 
This is the government's budget policy, this is the Minister of 
Finance's budget policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell you that we too, like our colleagues in the NDP, condemn the 
federal government for its negative attitude toward employment and 
toward people who are suffering. It is in fact the government that put 
them in that situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your 
appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member, well known in this House, has just made some fairly 
trite remarks. It is always the same old story from the hon. member on 
the subject of federal government meddling in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the member has a lot of criticisms on the Minister of 
Finance's position on the economy. I must say that our economy is in 
full recovery. I realize it is difficult for the member to comprehend 
the fact that this Minister of Finance is not only one of the most 
popular ministers of finance, but his ideas, words and leadership have 
revitalized our economy. It is bouncing back for good reason. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very interesting that the Bloc Quebecois members 
continue to talk about the fact that so much money is being taken 
away from them and that somehow the federal government can be 
blamed for just about everything.  Frankly after having heard 
that for three or four years in the past Parliament we think 
perhaps there could be some kind of development to their 
thinking. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This might be a good opportunity for the Bloc Quebecois to rethink 
things, given that the economy is recovering vigorously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer a few points raised by the member opposite on the political 
and monetary plans of the government and the Bank of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, it will not come as a surprise to you that in 
this country the federal government does not interfere and does 
not ever want to do what it did some 35 or 40 years ago when it 
interfered in monetary policy.  It goes to prove just how out of 
touch the Bloc Quebecois is when it failed to recognize that 
after 35 years, in my lifetime, we have never seen interest rates 
this low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So why Bloc members would continue or why they would obsess 
themselves with the idea that somehow this is a major problem is 
beyond me. What I can tell the hon. member, and I am sure Madam 
Speaker you would understand, is that our economy has never done 
any better. From my view I think what the hon. Minister of 
Finance has done is not only commendable, it is exceptional.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, could the hon. member, in his wisdom, not 
acknowledge here in the House that our economy, including that of the 
province of Quebec, is in full recovery and that the cuts in assistance 
to the disadvantaged came not only from the federal government, but also 
from the provincial government and his former party chief? Would he not 
agree, with the rest of the country, that the reality of the 1990s is 
that we must provide sound financial management for the disadvantaged, 
the poor and the future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, I will not respond to all the 
remarks and all the questions. I would say that 90% of them are not 
relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleague is saying that we are hauling out things that are old 
hat. That is because the members across the way do not understand. We 
have been obliged to repeat the same thing to them for the past four 
years, because they understand nothing, even though we put the figures 
in plain view before them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to take his responsibilities a bit more 
seriously and get his facts straight. Cuts of $42 billion over the next 
five years will not have a positive effect on the most disadvantaged. 
Nor will they improve the health network, since the provinces are being 
deprived of $42 billion in federal transfers for social assistance, 
education and health. 
If he puts a little more thought into it, I think he will understand 
things that he had not quite grasped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bank of Canada has shot itself in the foot too. It has just 
said that the Minister of Finance did not do as his predecessors had 
done, which means that he has not done his job. He is supposed to send 
a signal to the Bank of Canada on the direction monetary policy is to 
take. If the government has job creation objectives—and he says there 
are job creation objectives and they are important—he ought to give 
a different signal to the Bank of Canada. He is empowered by the 
Constitution. He can give signals. 
He cannot direct monetary policy or set the interest rate every 
Wednesday, but he can give signals by indicating that the government 
considers employment important and that the inflation rate could rise a 
bit without killing anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, the rate of inflation is over 3%, and the 
rate of unemployment is 5%. This makes all the difference between an 
intelligent policy—perhaps a more intelligent Parliament as well from 
time to time—and the Minister of Finance's very misplaced policy on 
interest rates. Our real interest rates are higher than those in the 
United States. He should find out about that. This party has a 
communications problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not think it is 
necessary to throw insults around just because we do not agree on 
major issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of true rates, the hon. member said that interest 
rates in the United States are higher than in Canada.  This is a 
first.  I am therefore taking the floor to respond to this member, 
who has just said that the interest rates are far lower in the 
States. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is simply not the case.  It is more poppycock than we are 
familiar with on this side of the House because they are based on 
some ideological principle that does not allow them to open up 
their ideas, does not allow them to open up their minds to 
anything that would allow them the understanding that we are 
progressing in this country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must repeat my question to the hon. member once again, in 
this context.  Does he not agree with me that, when we have a 
system with a huge deficit and huge debts, the interests of the 
disadvantaged are protected when we take taxation and monetary 
measures to ensure that the country will benefit from sound 
management in future? Does he not agree that we are the best 
country in the world by more than sheer luck? Does he not agree 
that we are a country like no other?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, if things were all that 
great, we would not have the same number of unemployed, after three 
years of economic growth, as we had in 1993 before this government 
was elected.  Will he eventually figure that out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anyone on that other side who will figure out one day 
that we have a job shortage, that we need jobs, that this 
government is doing nothing to help employment, that it is doing 
nothing to get the unemployed onto the labour market?  That it is, 
instead, doing everything to keep them on the sidelines?  Are they 
going to understand that it is abnormal that, but a few years ago 
in 1993, 77% of the unemployed were entitled to unemployment 
insurance benefits, while at this time only 44% are? 
After all, it is certainly not me who, along with my party, set the 
rules that apply to employment insurance claimants. It is his 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member also realize that there are five million 
Canadians who live in poverty, including 1.5 million children? The 
figures have not changed in two years. If anything, they might be going 
up. Can he figure that out? Can he make the connection between, on the 
one hand, the government's repeated cuts to social programs and 
tightened UI requirements and, on the other hand, the workers being 
marginalized because they are no longer eligible for unemployment 
insurance benefits, not to mention the poor, who are the victims of the 
$42 billion in cuts? Will the member realize this at some point? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not so difficult to understand. Can he read the newspapers? 
Last week, Canadian economists were unanimous. They said that, two weeks 
ago, Gordon Thiessen had no business raising interest rates, that there 
was no overheating of the economy, and that the governor was 
contradicting his own statements of a couple of months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what the Governor of the Bank of Canada said a couple 
of months ago? He said our economic growth could reach a cruising speed 
without causing inflation and requiring the Bank of Canada to raise 
interest rates. Two months later, he has changed his mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time he changes his mind, it prevents an unemployed worker 
from getting a job. Is this normal? This seems to me to be a matter of 
common sense. The people across the way should find out the facts, 
instead of talking nonsense.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and 
Youth), Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
present what we have done as a team in attempting to deal with 
and improve the lives of young people across the country and with 
the troublesome concerns about employment opportunities for young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that in an ever-changing workplace and with the 
global markets as they are, that this is not a simple problem, 
not one tasked to one minister, one department or one level of 
government.  It is one that we share with other countries and 
organizations that have amassed the collective experience and 
wisdom to deal with such matters. It is a partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we were first elected in 1993, the government has shown a 
great deal of concern and has taken significant steps to improve 
the prospects for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the good fortune to be in this position, first to 
work with youth and training and now with children and youth and 
to follow the progress in perhaps a more detailed way than most 
members have because of my mandate. We intend to continue to 
build on those opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reason to be somewhat hopeful, although there is a sense 
of doom and gloom.  We have an obligation as elected officials to 
give hope to people, not false hope but to be honest about the 
problems.  I am not prone to brush problems under the carpet and 
forget about them.  I am one who is honest about the progress 
that has been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last four months youth employment has risen by 63,000

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's generation of young Canadians are the best educated in 
our history and, as a nation, we are in an excellent position to 
thrive in the emerging knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that young Canadians benefit from the economic 
revival so that they can take their rightful place in society. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Partnership is the key to success. And as stated in the Speech from 
the Throne, we will continue to work with our provincial and territorial 
partners to reach mutual objectives in that area. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has identified three priorities:  first, 
providing a better chance for youth who are at risk because of 
low skills and lack of education.  We cannot afford, with the 
resources we have to be distributed among our citizens, to forget 
those who are most in need.  This has been cited time and time 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second priority is helping youth make a successful 
transition from school to work and the third priority is ensuring 
that young people have access to education so that they can 
fulfil their educational potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To support youth at risk, we will develop and expand community 
based programs with partners to assist young Canadians who lack 
skills and have low levels of education. Part of that will 
include establishing aboriginal multi-purpose youth centres to 
provide targeted support for urban aboriginal youth.  We will 
build on the success of the school to work initiatives under the 
youth employment strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will also create a Canada-wide 
mentorship program.  This will enable a young person to link up 
with a mentor who has experience in the field that the young 
person wants to explore.  We will also expand the youth 
internship program and extend support for summer student job 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more important than ensuring that young people who are 
coming out of college, universities and high schools have an 
opportunity to work in the summer and to help contribute in their 
own way to their community and to their country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will do its part to ensure that 
post-secondary education is accessible and affordable to as many 
Canadians as possible.  Education is, after all, one of the keys 
to their success and we continue to reduce barriers by providing 
further changes to the Canada student loans program.  But we 
cannot do that alone. We have our partners at the provincial 
level to consult and our partners with the organizations that 
hold that expertise and responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased assistance for low income students with dependants 
through special opportunity grants should help 25,000 students 
each year.  New scholarships, such as the Canada millennium 
scholarship endowment fund announced by the Prime Minister, will 
help low and moderate income students who show excellence in 
their studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone deserves an opportunity.  Everyone deserves a chance to 
do the best he or she can.  Young people do not want a handout. 
They want a hand up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the youth unemployment numbers are analysed, two trends 
appear.  First there are young Canadians who, for whatever 
reason, do not get beyond a high school education and have low 
skills.  They are in danger of being left behind in today's 
economy.  These individuals need more help than they can get 
through work experience alone.  They need a variety of 
interventions such as counselling, skills, upgrading and literacy 
coaching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we find that those young Canadians with a post-secondary 
education are doing relatively well on average but some of these 
individuals find themselves in a catch-22.  They have no 
experience, therefore they cannot get a job and they have no job, 
therefore they cannot get experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we know that education is one of the factors in weighing 
a person's success in society.  Rising post-secondary education 
tuition costs may make this difficult for some.  Providing access 
to post-secondary education is a central goal for this 
administration and government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the NDP was not a member of this House in the last 
Parliament. 
Perhaps she is not aware of just how much the government has done 
in an attempt to deal with this very troublesome problem that we 
are addressing today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 we began fulfilling our election promise to help 
Canadian youth when we brought in the youth employment and 
learning strategy.  After five months of being in government we 
pulled together a strategy. This initiative gave us our first 
look at youth internship, Youth Service Canada and student summer 
job action, programs that have proven their worth and continue to 
do so to this day. In our March 1996 budget the Minister of 
Finance announced the reallocation of $315 million over three 
years to help create employment opportunities for youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been building incrementally.  We understand there is not 
one quick fix. We understand that what we have done is not 
enough.  We understand and realize that.  Our commitment is 
longer than one effort to deal with this issue.  Other measures 
have followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February of this year we introduced the new youth employment 
strategy.  This strategy which consolidated over $2 billion in 
new and current funding builds upon existing programs and is 
helping 110,000 young men and women acquire extremely valuable on 
the job experience.  For example, the new federal public sector 
youth internship program in partnership with the private sector's 
Career Edge and YM-YWCA will help 3,000 young Canadians gain 
experience in occupations that have great potential for future 
demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member realizes that our youth internship 
and Youth Service Canada programs have a high success rate. Youth 
Service Canada has a 68% success rate and youth internship has a 
78% success rate.  This means graduates either return to school 
or find meaningful employment within six months of completing 
their work in the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we cannot just measure the success of the programs 
quantitatively.  We must look at them qualitatively as well.  I 
have had the opportunity of meeting with many of the participants 
of government sponsored programs where we have engaged in some 
very good partnerships.  Qualitatively some of these programs 
have given the opportunity, the hand-up that these young people 
need which otherwise would not be there.  It has made a 
difference in the lives of young Canadians who want equality of 
opportunity. They are not asking for freebies.  They are asking 
for an opportunity and this is what has been made available to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth Service Canada and youth internship are helping 
approximately 20,000 youth at risk this year alone.  That is just 
one section of the program.  This year summer student job action 
provided summer jobs for more than 63,000 young Canadians.  Our 
human resources centres for students helped about 200,000 
students prepare for the job market.  We understand they need the 
counselling, they need the assistance and they need the support. 
That is what we have made available to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nearly 40,000 callers have made use of the youth info line since 
the middle of August.  Our Internet site has been visited more 
than 66,000 times since it was introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the hon. member's province of Nova Scotia, young men and 
women are participating in our youth internship programs.  Our 
partner, Manutech Regional Industry Council, is helping the 
participants to become COBOL programmers for which there is an 
increasing demand as we approach the year 2000.  The first class 
of these programmers will graduate shortly and a local employer 
is offering employment to those with at least an 80% average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding of Western Arctic five young people spent the 
summer and early fall researching job growth in northern mineral 
and mining industries.  Anyone who watches the news will know we 
are encroaching in the Northwest Territories on the largest 
diamond mine development in the western hemisphere. There is a 
small diamond development in Colorado, but for all of North and 
South America this is it.  These young people are becoming a part 
of that by participating in this program. 
Their work will give us a data bank of 142 mining occupations 
which will soon be available on the Internet so that youth across 
the north can learn about the mining industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite these accomplishments, this government has no intention 
of resting on its laurels.  We fully realize that youth 
unemployment is a serious problem.  We share the concerns with 
hon. members of the opposition parties.  We understand and share 
the concerns of our provincial partners.  It is important enough 
that the premiers will convene a meeting with the Prime Minister 
to deal with youth unemployment and some of the other social 
issues that evolve around this particular problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne we renewed our commitment to make 
employment opportunities for Canada's young people a major 
priority.  One of the key ways for doing that is to create an 
economic environment that will stimulate job growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to tell hon. members that we are seeing signs of 
improvement.  We now have the lowest interest rates in 35 years 
and the lowest mortgage rates in 30 years.  Our exports and 
international trade are at record levels.  The overall 
unemployment rate is now at 9%, the lowest it has been since 
October 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we first took office in 1993 more than 1.1 million jobs 
have been created in the private sector.  We do not pretend that 
government creates jobs.  That is not what we are all about.  We 
understand that we have to create the climate.  In just the past 
seven months, 292,700 jobs have been created.  Among the G-7, 
Canada's rate of economic growth is second only to that of the 
United States.  The OECD is projecting that our rate of 
employment will be higher than any other G-7 country both this 
year and in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I would like to say to the hon. leader of the NDP 
that this government has demonstrated that helping Canadian youth 
fulfil their potential is a major priority.  It is a priority 
because we understand that they are the future leaders of this 
country.  They are the people who will fill the seats of this 
House in the years to come.  They are the people who will make 
the decisions that will forever effect this country.  We 
understand that and we do not see the expenditure under education 
experience as being wasteful.  We see it as an investment.  We 
cannot afford not to invest in the future of these young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the hon. member from the opposition party and all 
members of this House to join us in working together because the 
interests of young people go far beyond partisanship and beyond 
politics.  It is something we share in.  We all have children and 
children whom we know and care about.  We all understand that 
their future lies within the kind of initiatives that we can take 
in partnership to work on together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite them to work with us.  I also invite them to encourage 
the young people by visiting their local projects, by 
participating in the committees and meeting with the people who 
have ideas.  The wealth of ideas is not contained within the 
walls of Parliament.  There are people out there who have ideas 
and experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take for instance the Ottawa-Carleton area.  It has one of the 
best crime prevention programs for young people headed by 
Constable Claude Turgeon who is an expert in his field.  In 
Vancouver there is the Picasso Cafe. Street youth provide the 
services in that very wonderful restaurant.  Those young people 
have made the transition from street life to engaging in a very 
positive activity to advance themselves in their own life and

Toronto for young people.

There are ideas outside of these walls that will help us to 
engage in further contributing to getting rid of unemployment for 
young people, in making the quality of life for young people 
better and in making Canada what it really is.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome the NDP's motion.  It shows an awareness of the most 
disadvantaged, the poorest members of society, and as long as that 
is where they are headed, I am with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to my colleague opposite praising her 
government, the state of the budget. But, apart from eliminating a 
large chunk of the deficit, what has the government done for the 
poorest and most disadvantaged members of society?  My colleague 
spoke about summer jobs for students.  That is not what young 
people want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What young people want is permanent jobs.  There are large 
numbers of young people who have graduated from top universities, 
who have BAs, MAs, PhDs, but no jobs, or jobs at starvation wages, 
but not in the field for which they were trained.  All young people 
in Quebec want a job to be able to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many 25 or 30 year olds are there in deep debt and 
unemployed?  They are told:  “Give us part of what we gave you; pay 
back your loan”.  Every six months, every month, a notice goes out 
asking them to pay back their loan with interest.  They do not have 
a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is shocking to say that things are going well.  It is 
creating false hope to say:  “Here is what we have done, what we 
will do”.  It is so much hot air.  What young people in my riding, 
and elsewhere of course, want is action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at young people who are unemployed.  It is said they are 
better educated than before and that is true. 
But what is the point of having four diplomas if students do not get to 
make use of them for years and their parents have to support them 
because they have nothing to live on? That is my first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as seasonal workers are concerned, there are a great many of 
them in my region of Matapédia—Matane. This winter, a number of people 
will be short 50, 60 or 75 hours to qualify for employment insurance, 
which I will continue to call destitution insurance, at least for the 
time being. What are we to do with these people this winter? It looks as 
if it could be a cold, long winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, members opposite boast: “Everything is fine, the 
country is prosperous”. All our colleagues across the way seem quite 
pleased. They lack compassion, to a certain extent. In our riding 
offices, we can see that people are suffering, really suffering. They 
are worried and increasingly depressed. They come to us and ask: “What 
can we do?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my hon. colleagues opposite to think for a moment about how 
destitute people are, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas. When 
bread winners cannot fish because of the cuts in fishing quotas or lose 
their job in the logging industry because winter is coming and roads are 
closing down, what are their families supposed to do?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The people across the way should ask themselves the question. What 
will these workers do? They will get income security. People back home 
are very proud to work and to work hard. They are not afraid of starting 
at five or six o'clock in the morning and working all day until five or 
six in the afternoon. Don't come and tell me that they are lazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members opposite lack the will to help these people, because, 
often, there is something missing, but very little missing. 
I would like my hon. colleague to tell me if, as a member of Parliament 
and a woman—because there are many single mothers who suffer 
terribly, whose young children often have nothing for breakfast and go 
without dinner—she knows what this government could do to help these 
families, and disadvantaged families in particular? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
respond to the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member spoke from what I consider to be a perspective 
from his riding in Quebec.  It pleases me to say we have engaged 
in the area of the labour market agreements.  We have an 
agreement with Quebec that frees up the resources for that 
province to the tune of $7 billion or $8 billion to effectively 
structure the resources and the framework of labour market 
activities so that they can best benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about partnership.  Have we done enough.  No, we have 
not done enough.  In the prime minister's words, as long as there 
are unemployed people in this country what we have done will not 
be enough.  But we are attempting to do a number of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I indicated that currently all levels of government are seized 
with this problem. The provincial premiers as well as the 
ministers at provincial and federal levels are discussing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said students do not want summer jobs.  That is 
not the case.  About four or five years ago the summer employment 
program was to phase out. We have doubled the amount of money for 
young people.  Talk to any young people coming out of university 
or high school.  Not only do they want permanent jobs, but they 
want summer employment.  I have met many who want to be gainfully 
employed to pay their own way during that period of time while 
they are attending school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked what will we do about the poor people, 
those who are most in need.  For many of the programs that I have 
taken part in developing and assisting I have gone to those 
people to ensure that it passed their litmus test.  If people are 
at a disadvantage, including youth and children, programs should 
reflect that and provide opportunities for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member reads the material that he receives in 
the House.  This government is currently engaged in starting the 
national child benefit in July which will give $850 million to 
those needy families, to those individuals who are most in need. 
In much of the legislation that we are engaged in there is always 
a provision as we have for unemployment.  The hon. member talked 
about seasonal workers.  I understand and I sympathize.  I know 
that no piece of legislation is wonderful and perfect but the 
fact remains that many of the opportunities, as in the $800 
million in active measures, are designed to reach those people 
who are the poorest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transitional job fund is for high unemployment areas.  I 
know that people in not necessarily his constituency but in high 
unemployment areas have benefited from that.  They have taken a 
part of the $300 million and a good portion of the $800 million 
as well as the youth programs. 
They are now in that position as a province.  They have a labour 
market agreement of $8 billion.

success for the people who need it most.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to split my time with my colleague for Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I am pleased to take the floor today to speak to 
the motion from our party, the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be kept in mind that in our area—which I will use as 
an example to start with, and then will move on to the rest of the 
country—there are a lot of seasonal workers.  The changes to 
employment insurance have been disastrous to our regions.  New 
Brunswick alone used to receive about $243 million that it has now 
lost with the changes to employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The region I come from, Acadie—Bathurst, has lost more than 
$66 million in funds, which means that it has lost jobs instead of 
creating any.  We have lost jobs because the small and medium 
businesses have been forced to close, since no one is buying their 
goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My predecessor, Doug Young, travelled through the Acadian 
peninsula in 1989, telling people “Vote Liberal, that will save 
employment insurance”.  That was what he said in Acadie—Bathurst. 
I will tell you another thing my predecessor said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The newspapers reported “Mr. Young is calling for New 
Brunswickers to submit briefs to the legislative committee that 
will be holding public hearings this coming September in the 
province on employment insurance. 
According to the hon. member for Gloucester—in opposition at the 
time—New Brunswick must strenuously oppose any change to 
employment insurance and any proposed change, because it will have 
serious repercussions on the region”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the gift from our predecessor.  Our predecessor became 
the Minister of Human Resources Development and is the one who made 
the changes to employment insurance.  Unbelievable, and 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My predecessor was not the only one, however, to talk like 
that.  Let us talk about Marcelle Mersereau, Liberal Minister of 
Natural Resources in New Brunswick, who was still saying this week 
that employment insurance changes were a disaster for New 
Brunswick, that there were terrible repercussions and that it had 
added more people to the welfare rolls. 
This is what the minister of natural resources of New Brunswick, another 
Liberal, was saying publicly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are they doing? They take people who are on social welfare who 
have no rural experience and they pack them off to work. I have no 
problem with the people on welfare having an opportunity for a job, but 
I do not agree with the fact that the government, because of problems 
due to its changes to employment insurance, takes people and, to get 
them off welfare because changes to employment insurance have resulted 
in an increase in the number of people on welfare, and sends them 
working in order to get them on employment insurance and off the 
provincial rolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look at the figures. There are families on welfare 
receiving perhaps $750. People are sent to work at $6.25 an hour. If you 
figure you work 40 hours a week, that means $1,000 a month. 
When we multiply that by 55%, that gives $550. They are going to make 
these people even poorer. 
This is what they have to realize.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a sort of jobs that have been created in our regions. And 
that is what hurts. If we have a look today, what do we see? We are told 
that if taxes are cut jobs will be created. I said that this morning 
here in the House, if taxes are lowered, jobs will be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the government gave money to large corporations to 
promote new technologies. Where did that take us? The companies made 
more money, but with the new technology, in the mines for example, in 
the Brunswick mine in Acadie—Bathurst, there were some 1,400 employees. 
Well, not long after the arrival of new technology, the number of 
employees dropped to 800. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can take a look at what happened with the banks. In the next ten 
years, 35,000 people will lose their jobs in Canada. The banks are 
making millions and millions of dollars in profits. They are not 
creating jobs, they are laying people off. This is what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, let us look in the Atlantic region, not only in 
Acadie—Bathurst, in Newfoundland, for example. Everyone there is 
affected by the closing of the fisheries. Cod fishing is closed. 
Everyone there is affected, and people in the Reform Party are 
saying that the TAGS program must be terminated. Just imagine the 
number who will starve to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign, I met people and entered the homes of 
some poor people. But what I heard after the campaign was even more 
painful, because I am the new member for Acadie—Bathurst and the people 
of my riding expect a lot from me. They expect me to do a lot for them 
because they are living in poverty. One evening, this woman phoned me up 
and said: “Mr. Godin, I am so glad you were elected. Finally, someone 
will speak for us in the House of Commons in Ottawa instead of merely 
looking at the deficit. We are in dire straights and, last night, my 
husband and I seriously considered committing suicide together. We have 
worked all our lives. We both used to work in a fish processing plant 
for $6.50 an hour. Today, we are out of work because the cod fisheries 
have been closed down, crab quotas have been reduced and lobster quotas 
are all but gone.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of testimony is painful. I can feel what these people 
feel. I can understand that some members do not meet these people, but 
I can tell you that, in my riding, I do see them. I can certainly speak 
for our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia is going through the salmon crisis. They will face 
the same problems we have had in Atlantic Canada. When I say that people 
back home are hard working, I know that they are indeed. They would 
travel to the other end of the country to find work. They are hard 
working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bathurst for example, when it was announced that a new CPP 
office would open and that there would be 60 positions to fill, 800 
people showed up. Go to the Brunswick mine today and you will see that, 
even though they are laying people off, there are between 1,000 and 
2,000 people at their door looking for work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards fish plants, those who do not know, those who have never 
seen poverty in this country should visit our region in the summertime 
to see what is going on. They will see women—because 80% of fish 
plant workers are women—get up at 8 a.m., seven days a week, to work 
until 2 a.m. at the plant. This morning, Reformers claimed I accused 
them of saying our people were lazy. No, they did not say that. That 
comment was made by my predecessor, in Hamilton, Ontario. He is the one 
who said that people in my region were lazy and that it was time for 
people to stop abusing the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do our regions need? What is required to help New Brunswick's 
economy? What is required to help Newfoundland's economy? 
What is required to help Nova Scotia's economy? These economies need 
real jobs. We must be able to use the natural resources that our 
provinces are lucky to have and do the first, second and third 
processing. This is the only way we can create jobs back home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never—and I will say it in this House—will GM build a plant 
in New Brunswick. Never will Chrysler come to our province. Therefore, 
we must use our resources and do the second and third processing.

make sure there is bread on the table in the morning for children who go 
to school. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I would like to say that I can well 
understand the emotion and the figures provided by the new member 
for Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the hon. member that, despite everything 
he said about my former colleague, Mr. Young, governing is not 
about saying one thing in one context and something else in 
another.  It takes leadership and courage to say and do some rather 
difficult things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that it was not easy for the member before me or the 
member before him to make these decisions, but they saw that it was 
absolutely necessary that the system change.  After ten or so 
years, the unemployment insurance system was in such bad shape 
that, in the end, everyone was being penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I know very well, as does the hon. member, that the 
collapse of the cod fishery was due to environmental causes and was 
not the fault of the federal government or individuals.  I know 
that the member is very familiar with the situation that exists in 
his area, Acadia, in large urban centres like Toronto, and 
elsewhere in Canada.  I must therefore ask the hon. member a 
question.  What changes would he like to see to ensure that people 
at the other end of the country are not penalized by the system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must point out that there are people in my riding working 
for $6 or $7 an hour, who do their job, who at least try to make a 
living when the day is done, but who must pay insurance.  Is the 
member proposing a system in which there would be no employment 
insurance, or does he favour a sound system that would work for 
everyone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Madam Speaker, I will be pleased to reply to my 
hon. colleague. First of all, why is it that, when the Liberals were in 
the official opposition, my predecessor used to say it would be 
disastrous for our region? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it is not my fault nor that of the government, supposedly, 
if fishing quotas were cut in New Brunswick and if there is a complete 
ban on cod fishing. I congratulate the fortunate ones who have found 
jobs, I am happy for them. But if we are to live in a united country, 
where we all look after one another, attention should be paid to those 
regions experiencing difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What my hon. colleague said is starting to sound like what my 
predecessor used to say, claiming that the unemployed were lazy and 
should stop abusing the system. He said that, in his region, people get 
up in the morning and work all day long. That is very similar to the 
remarks my predecessor used to make. What is different with the people 
in my region is that, when they get up in the morning, they do not have 
a job to go to. Jobs have disappeared because there is no cod to fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot go ice fishing for cod in winter. We cannot make a hole 
in the ice the same way we would on a lake in Ontario and put our lines 
through. That is not how fish is caught in the Atlantic ocean. Another 
thing: New Brunswick blueberries cannot be gathered under the snow.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Peat bogs cannot be operated under snow, the same way that 
Christmas wreaths do not get made in July. That is the problem we are 
facing in our region. And tourism is slow in New Brunswick in the 
winter, as compared to the summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our jobs are seasonal jobs and, until the government does the 
responsible thing and invests in natural resource processing at 
the secondary or tertiary level, this will remain a problem. In 
the meantime, what we need is a short term solution, not $12 
billion hoarded for bankers and for Paul Martin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38, 
it is my duty to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, law enforcement officers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise to speak in support of the very important motion placed 
before the House today by the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new member of the House, having been here for about a month 
and listening to the debates which have taken place, I have been 
struck by the rhetoric that flows around this room.  What is 
important about the motion is that it deals with the number one 
issue facing Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was our commitment from the day we came to the House to raise 
the issue and make the government accountable with respect to 
unemployment and job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in my riding of Vancouver East last week when the finance 
minister was also in Vancouver speaking to the finance committee 
about the state of the economy.  He was in the Hotel Vancouver 
with all the media and the fancy hardware making his speech.  I 
was across the street with some of my constituents.  It was not a 
huge crowd.  They were people who had rallied at the last minute 
because they had heard the finance minister was coming to town. 
They wanted to speak out.  They wanted to address what they 
understood to be the real issues facing them as well as other 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister spoke about the state of the economy.  He 
gave himself and the government a nice pat on the back.  We were 
across the street in the pouring rain, unfurling a banner which 
pointed out that social and human costs of the budget of the 
Minister of Finance had been devastating to our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I went back into the hotel to listen to the finance 
minister, none of his statistics pointed to the real crisis we 
are facing, which is unemployment among our young people and 
other Canadians.  We have growing poverty. The motion before the 
House today addresses this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the Secretary of State for Children and Youth 
earlier today say that the NDP has not been here and might not be 
aware of what the government has done for youth unemployment and 
young people in general.  We may not have been in the House with 
party status in the last parliament, but we have been aware along 
with other Canadians of exactly what the government has not been 
doing to address unemployment, particularly unemployment among 
our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter what the government says, there is no escaping the 
fact that for the 84th month we are facing an unemployment rate 
of 9% or more.  We are now facing the highest sustained 
unemployment rate since the 1930s.  When we couple that with the 
severe cutbacks that the government has enacted in its obsession 
to deal with the deficit, we can see what a toll it has taken on 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider 1.4 million Canadians are unemployed and add in 
those who are underemployed and those who have dropped out 
because they have given up looking for work, we are really 
talking about 3 million Canadians who have failed in the system 
because the system has failed them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today I heard a member saying that sacrifices had to be 
made, that these were tough times and we had to make sacrifices. 
A question needs to be raised.  Sacrifices by whom? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the record of the government and the finance 
minister is being carried out on the backs of the unemployed.  It 
is being carried out on the backs of women who are trying to 
re-enter the workforce.  It is being carried out on the backs of 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at real statistics in terms of new jobs that have 
been generated, part-time work with lower benefits and no job 
security, and when we look at the cutbacks there has been a 
sacrifice.  But that sacrifice has not been equally shared by all 
Canadians.  I think that point has to be made.  We need to 
understand who has really paid the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is clear.  The government's economic proposals and its 
obsession with dealing with the deficit and meeting the agenda of 
corporate Canada have been at the expense of the lowest 20% of 
low wage income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from my colleague from Acadia—Bathurst about the 
situation of unemployment insurance and what a severe impact it 
has had on unemployed workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about sacrifices and what opportunities have been 
created, we need to know why the government has not addressed the 
issue of fair taxation.  Why will we be witnessing for another 
year a record $7 billion in windfall profits for major Canadian 
banks? Why do we still have $17 billion in deferred taxes?  Why 
do we have tens of thousands of profitable corporations and 
businesses that do not pay any taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to tell the Minister of Finance that his state of the 
economy is really a one-sided view.  It has failed on every 
ground to address the real crisis of unemployment.  It has failed 
to address growing poverty.  It has failed to address that in the 
1990s we have seen a decrease in full-time jobs and an increase 
in low wage, part-time jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today with our motion to draw attention to stark 
reality and to say that it is time the government is held 
accountable for the situation in terms of unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address one particular aspect which concerns 
young people.  Youth unemployment is double the national average. 
At this time almost 500,000 young people are unemployed.  Since 
the Liberals took office in 1993, 40,000 more young people have 
ended up on the unemployment roles.  For those who are lucky 
enough to find a job there has been a doubling of part-time work. 
It is very difficult to find full-time work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear the Liberals say they are committed to youth.  Listening 
to the minister today, these are just hollow words that have no 
meaning for young people who are desperately trying to pay off 
student loans and find work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were truly committed to young people and 
solving the crisis of unemployment among them, the first thing it 
would do is restore the cuts to post-secondary education.  This 
year alone we will be witnessing a cut of $550 million.  Is it 
any wonder that tuition fees have gone up 45% since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should take note of what the provincial 
government in British Columbia has been able to achieve.  Despite 
federal cutbacks of $2.29 billion in post-secondary education, 
the NDP provincial government has been able to hold the line and 
freeze tuition fees to give our young people a fighting chance to 
get through post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Liberal plan what is happening?  Our young people are 
graduating into poverty.  The government has to restore funding 
to post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot about this millennium fund and that somehow 
it is a wonderful thing that will happen in the year 2000 to help 
young people.  Young people cannot wait until the year 2000.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people need assistance for post-secondary education and 
they need to have a freeze of tuition fees. They do not need a 
scholarship program.  They need a realistic plan that will 
relieve their debt load which is now at $25,000. That is what we 
are saying to young people who go to post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hollow words and the rhetoric I have heard from members in 
the House are little comfort to unemployed Canadians.  If we are 
serious about our commitment to unemployment the government has 
to address a program of job creation.  It has to embark on a 
program of fair taxation.  It has to ensure that it intervenes in 
the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I heard from a hon. member across the way that some how 
the marketplace is responsible for job creation, not the 
government.  If we look at the cutbacks we have witnessed in the 
last four years, $7 billion in the public sector alone, they have 
had a massive impact on unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion brings back a sense of reality to the House.  It is 
a motion that addresses the real issues facing Canadians.  Those 
of us in the NDP caucus have listened to the government records. 
We have witnessed the record of the government and so have 
Canadians.  We are determined to continue to raise the number one 
problem of unemployment.  To have 1.4 million Canadians 
unemployed is absolutely unacceptable.  It is a national disgrace 
and it is a crisis.  The finance minister and the Liberal 
government have to make this the number one priority. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member with interest.  She 
included a lot of information from in her previous speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned the $17 billion in deferred taxes and 
tens of thousands of profitable companies that pay no taxes at 
all. The Ontario NDP government carried out a survey when it 
first came to power. It found that the principle reason why tens 
of thousands of profitable companies did not pay taxes in a 
particular year was they were carrying forward losses from 
previous years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants to remove the ability of companies to 
carry forward their losses, losses they incur to keep people in 
jobs when the company is not doing well, can she not see that 
will kill jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do these companies avoid paying taxes? Could the hon. member 
give me the list or give the House a list of reasons why 
companies do not pay taxes, especially profitable companies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.  It is something which he has raised with me before. 
The issue of fair taxation is something that is very important to 
us in the NDP.  It is something which has not been taken up by 
the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about is a situation where profitable 
businesses pay a fair share of taxation. Look at the taxation 
system and the burden it places on working people and middle 
income people.  Time and again we hear we have to tighten our 
belts.  If there were loopholes they would have to be taken away. 
When it comes to businesses those loopholes still exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are calling for is a program of taxation reform, a 
program of fair taxation that will ensure we will not continue to 
see a shift in taxation from major corporations to individuals. 
That is the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never hear Reform or Liberal members or the finance minister 
addressing this.  Why do we not hear those members willing to 
stand up and question why profitable corporations are not paying 
taxes?  Those are issues which should be raised by the government 
and by the Reform Party.  I challenge them to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to make reference to the 
comment made by the member for Vancouver East that a 
representative from her community came before the finance 
committee in Vancouver and made a very effective and very real 
and significant presentation.  I want the hon. member to 
understand that there was no one around that table who did not 
empathize with what was going on.  The message came through loud 
and clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to correct some information that was put forward in 
the speech.  It was stated that the jobs created in this country 
were all part time jobs.  The majority of the 279,000 net new 
jobs that have been created in this country are full time jobs. 
Although the unemployment rate for young people is still 
excessively high, I want the hon. member to acknowledge that 
those with a post-secondary education have an unemployment rate 
below the national average.  Our focus must continue to be on 
education.  The finance minister in Vancouver did indicate that 
there would be additional focus and emphasis on education now 
that the books are very close to being in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the hon. member to understand that the cuts or anything 
that went on in British Columbia cannot always be pointed back to 
the national government.  The transfer cuts that took place in 
British Columbia amount to 1% of the total B.C. revenues. British 
Columbia will receive over $3 billion under the Canada health and 
social transfer this year alone.  With the increase to $12.5 
billion as the cash floor, British Columbia will receive an 
additional $800 million through the Canada health and social 
transfer.  It will receive and has received $1.3 billion over 
five years to fund training initiatives for the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This national government is doing things for Canadians.  I refer 
to what we have done for the province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question.  The unemployment rate for young people who have had 
the opportunity to go through post secondary education is lower 
than for young people who have not.  However, that does not deal 
with the crisis of young people in post-secondary education who 
are now facing massive debts and are basically graduating into 
poverty.  That is an issue this government has not addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the millennium scholarship fund which 
the government claims will start in the year 2000 will not help 
students today and will not help students who are in great 
financial need because it is based on a scholarship program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, post-secondary education is critical in terms of finding a 
good paying job, but what are we saying to our young people when 
we force them into poverty and into massive debts of $25,000, 
which is what this Liberal government has done by cutting back on 
post-secondary education?  That is the effect of what the 
government is doing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with 
my colleague from Hillsborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is truly lamentable that the federal NDP motion before us 
sees fit to condemn but does not offer any creative solutions to 
the remaining challenges that confront our people today.  By its 
motion it would like us to believe that deficit and inflation 
should no longer be of concern.  It would like us to believe that 
the federal government has made no appropriate investments in 
health care, education and training.  It would like us to believe 
that the federal government is blind to the plight of the 
unemployed.  Far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it be said that this member for Winnipeg North—St. Paul and 
this government on whose side this member sits have been 
concerned with unemployment since we took office in 1993 and 
remain determined to continue working so that any Canadian who 
wishes to find work can find it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since first taking office in October 1993 this government has 
created close to one million jobs distributed around the regions 
of our country.  In fact, 279,000 jobs were created in the first 
nine months of this year alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1993 the unemployment was 11.4%. 
Today it is at 9%, decreasing despite the increasing demand for 
jobs. Consider what would have happened had there not be a surge 
in job creation.  Canadians recognize this, but they equally 
recognize that this government has achieved a level of success 
that points to the direction of continued success.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We appreciate that Canadians renewed their confidence and trust 
in this government last June.  This is the government that 
reduced the interest rates to record lows, thereby easing the 
burden on our national and personal debts through reduction of 
interest payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the government that has continued to contain inflation, 
thereby protecting the buying power of our hard earned Canadian 
dollars.  This is the government that inherited a crushing 
deficit of $42 billion or 6% of the gross domestic product in 
October 1993 and reduced it to $8.9 billion in four short years. 
This is the smallest federal deficit as a proportion of our 
national economy, 1.1% of GDP, in over two decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This deficit reduction should be known.  It has been achieved 
not only by improving government efficiency but by stimulating 
the growth of the economy with resulting increase in revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No later than the fiscal year 1998-99 this government pledges 
the crushing deficit of 1993 will be turned ultimately into a 
fiscal dividend.  This means Canada will enter the new millennium 
with more than a balanced budget; with a surplus, thereby 
clearing the way for future generations.  We can do no less for 
our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should never forget that the government has been able to 
restore fiscal health only because Canadians shared the 
discipline and sacrifice and the common determination to so 
succeed.  How can the federal NDP be so blind and deaf as to fail 
to see and hear this good news? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good government does not stop at its economic and fiscal 
success.  As the finance minister aptly said in the last budget, 
a government relieved of the deficit burden is not a government 
relieved of its obligation.  It is a government able to exercise 
its obligations.  It is awareness of this duty no doubt that 
prompted our prime minister in his address in reply to the Speech 
from the Throne to say we owe our greatest obligation to the 
future of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That future is best ensured when we invest in health care, child 
benefits, education and training and research and development, 
all of which are essential in maximizing opportunities for the 
economic and physical health of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this government has increased the CHST cashflow to 
$12.5 billion for health care alone.  This means that in 1998-99 
provinces will receive $700 million more for health than 
currently budgeted, and this will further increase by at least 
$1.3 billion every year until the year 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this government has invested $800 million for the 
Canada innovation fund to help universities and hospitals in 
their research and development requirements.  That is why this 
government has established and will be enhancing the national 
child benefit program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the prime minister has announced the creation of 
the Canada millennium scholarship endowment fund to ensure access 
to post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only time limits for debate prevent me from cataloguing the many 
government initiatives aimed at easing the human tragedy of 
unemployment and preparing Canadians, particularly our youth, for 
tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize our work is not complete and that is why we are 
asking all Canadians and provincial governments to be partners 
with the federal government in its pursuit of our common 
challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also firmly believe that a balanced approach is the way to 
go.  This balanced approach has enabled us to restore fiscal 
health and at the same time sustain our national priorities. Thus 
we have been able to maintain our standing in the world community 
as the number one nation in which to live while at the same time 
just about balancing our national budget. 
Certainly this is not the time for condemnation, for retreat into 
the unworkable federal NDP approach of the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say this? Allow me to quote at some length from one 
provincial NDP premier.  In his state of the province address 
delivered before the Saskatoon Chamber of Commerce on February 10 
this year, Premier Roy Romanow of Saskatchewan declared with 
pride: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our economic and fiscal picture is looking brighter than it has 
in a long time—.  Now I wish to stress that this doesn't mean 
we'll be taking any wild swings at the established tracks.  We 
are not going to derail this train.  What it does mean is making 
careful, targeted investments to prepare for the next century. It 
means a balanced approach—keeping an eye on debt and prudent 
fiscal management.  We have come too far and worked too hard to 
restart the cycle of careless spending. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the federal NDP is not about to condemn their provincial 
counterpart.  If the quote so far is not enough, may I continue? 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there is no magic well where the money came from.  The 
unfortunate truth is this.  If we take a larger portion from our 
budget for health we have to reduce elsewhere.  However, as the 
economy continues to grow we will be able to broaden our choices 
in a balanced and fair manner. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I be permitted at this juncture to share with my colleagues 
a pearl of wisdom I recently heard from a former senior 
distinguished colleague.  He said, and I paraphrase “A bird has 
two wings, the right and the left.  It needs both to fly”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can be assured of our commitment to look forward on 
our agenda, to make Canada not merely a participant but a leader 
in the modern economy and thereby assure them access to the 
greatest range of opportunities available.  Our priorities are 
clear, as the finance minister in his economic and fiscal update 
of October 15 last week so clearly articulated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we must preserve and improve the valued programs on which 
all Canadians depend such as our health care, education and 
pension systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we must work together to enhance the learning and 
training opportunities available to Canadians, focusing on 
accessibility and addressing the wide range of needs that begin 
at early childhood and extend through working life. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the time remaining that you have just indicated to 
me, Mr. Speaker, let me conclude.  Let no one doubt our resolve 
to remain the number one nation in the world as we enter the new 
millennium.  I urge the NDP and all colleagues to join Canadians 
in their great sense of optimism in the future for Canada, thanks 
to the superb and caring leadership the government has given to 
all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
friend from Winnipeg just said a bird needs a left wing and a 
right wing in order to fly.  The problem with the Liberal bird is 
that the muscles in the right wing are too strong. There is not a 
proper balance between the two wings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Is that why they are going around in 
circles? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  They are flying around in circles, Mr. 
Speaker.  What we need to do is correct that imbalance.  I hope 
we can do that by bringing us back to the left a little to give 
more balance to the Canadian economy and society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member one specific question.  He did not 
really mention interest rates.  I am concerned that the Minister 
of Finance and the Governor of the Bank of Canada have already 
increased interest rates twice very recently and indications are 
that they are going to jack them up once more. They say inflation 
is becoming a problem. The inflation rate now is 1.8%.  The 
Canadian dollar is still strong at about 73¢ American. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What advice does the member have for the Minister of Finance. 
Is he willing to say to us today in a spirit of independence that 
he thinks the Minister of Finance should persuade the Governor of 
the Bank of Canada not to increase interest rates?  An increase 
in interest rates will slow the economy and throw more people out 
of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member is independent minded.  Is he willing to 
publicly advise the Minister of Finance that he not increase 
interest rates? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his kind words.  It is that independence which tells 
me that when we look at an issue, just as when we look at a 
patient, we cannot only evaluate one symptom to be the basis of 
the total diagnosis.  We have to look at the total picture. 
Therefore, when we look at interest rates we cannot only look at 
the short term interest rates, we must look equally at long term 
interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member would admit that short term interest rates have 
somewhat increased.  Of course, we wish it had not happened. 
However, we must realize that the long term interest rates which 
have continued to remain low are an indication of the economic 
confidence that investors continue to have.  They have that 
confidence in the country or they would not have allowed the long 
term interest rates to go down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That side of the equation indicates that although there has been 
an increase in short term interest rates, the fact that long term 
interest rates have remained low and that Canadian interest rates 
are lower than those in the United States by five percentage 
points indicate that we are on solid economic ground.  We should 
continue the track we are on and when we show a surplus, have a 
balanced approach, but never again to go back to deficit 
spending, as the NDP premier of Saskatchewan said.  That is what 
this motion seems to indicate we should do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot 
let this go by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member exactly what he means by 
going back to deficit spending since we have not left it since 
the Liberals first came to power in the 1970s. We have had 
deficit spending every year, including every year since this 
government was elected in 1993 and even now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Admittedly the deficit is now smaller. We are going away from 
the target of no debt at a slower rate, but the debt is still 
increasing.  That cannot be denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance said that the deficit has been brought 
down to $8.9 billion, which deserves mild applause.  However, we 
are still borrowing. The debt is bigger now than it was when the 
government took office.  It is growing this year.  Interest 
payments are still going up. Thank goodness for low interest 
rates, otherwise we would be in deep trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member talk about going back when we never left 
deficit spending? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is beautiful 
application of the analogy of the bird with two wings.  On the 
one side the traditional NDP suggest that we spend more. That is 
why I alluded to not returning to deficit spending. Admittedly, 
we have not quite balanced the budget yet, as I said in my 
speech.  It is only projected to be balanced by the year 1998-99. 
My optimism tells me that it may be sooner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has suggested in its platform to spend 
everything on the reduction of taxes. That would not be the right 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government would like a balanced approach using the 
right and the left so that it can fly beautifully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have a surplus we will continue to spend half on social 
and economic programs and the other half will go toward the 
reduction of taxes and reduction of the national debt.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in light of today's 
opposition motion, I take great pleasure in speaking in support 
of the government's record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the leader of the New Democratic Party has introduced a 
motion that attempts to chastise the Liberal government.  But 
considering her party's platform, I believe it is quite obvious 
to Canadians why the NDP is the fourth party in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion goes to great lengths to cover many aspects of 
government policy.  I point out that the motion is a lot like the 
NDP platform that says that government can and should do 
everything.  Likewise the motion tries to cover everything:  job 
creation, monetary policy, funding to health care, education, 
training, culture and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to address everything in the motion today.  I 
will concentrate on job creation, the priority of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the NDP I believe the people in my riding of Hillsborough 
and the people of Canada as a whole need a balanced approach to 
government.  The government believes that it can no longer afford 
to create jobs on its payroll.  That is right.  The government 
cannot afford grandiose make work programs. It cannot afford to 
create jobs just for the sake of creating jobs.  What Canada 
needs are stable jobs created through long term economic growth, 
not temporary jobs created through short lived programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I realize the opposition members are wondering 
about my views on the infrastructure program.  It was a very 
successful program.  There is a need for programs to upgrade our 
national infrastructure but we can rely on these programs only 
for short term jobs.  We cannot rely on them alone to create 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The infrastructure program and its extension was just part of 
our approach in the last Parliament.  By implementing a balanced 
approach the government has created an economic climate that 
supports private sector job creation.  It is this job creation 
that has created close to one million jobs since October of 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast let us look at the NDP platform.  While it has 
commendable objectives, the cost is irresponsible.  It pledged 
almost $8.5 billion over five years in capital investments for 
infrastructure, public housing and highways.  The problem is that 
it failed to explain how it was going to pay for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP election platform is filled with outdated, discredited 
ideas left over from a utopian era.  It is an endless list of new 
and costly programs to be paid for by higher taxes for all, with 
the supposed goal of cutting the unemployment rate in half.  What 
it fails to realize is that these policies would ultimately be 
very harmful to job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind all members that the level of government spending is 
not the best measure of the effectiveness of action.  We know 
that. Canadians know that.  Obviously the NDP does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total its platform contains $8 billion in tax increases and 
$19 billion to $20 billion in spending increases.  That is 
alarming enough on its own but even more alarming is the $12 
billion between the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today during debate, members heard statements indicating the 
national debt was created not by program spending but by high 
interest costs and lost tax revenues.  That is just semantics. It 
was created by overspending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I ask my constituents how the debt was created they would not 
say high interest rates, they would not say say by lost tax 
revenues, they would say by overspending.  The more you overspend 
the more the associated interest costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is taking control of the finances.  We will not 
let the government books fall back down the slippery slope of 
overspending.  My colleagues know full well the impressive 
results the government has achieved over the last four years. 
Part of that is the support provided to innovation, science and 
technology.  It is essential that Canada not only conduct its own 
research and development but that it be quick in applying that 
research to business applications.  To remain competitive in a 
global market we must innovate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government can support and assist the realization of key 
discoveries, the implementation of new technologies and the 
financial requirements of Canadian entrepreneurs. Various 
measures have been implemented, including the network of Centres 
of Excellence to support the research and development activities 
of Canadian institutions.  The Canada Foundation for Innovation 
has been created to expedite the jump from creating new 
technologies to their implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue to address the financial needs of small business and 
entrepreneurs.  Together with our partners we created the $30 
million Atlantic venture capital fund.  This fund is helping 
Atlantic Canadians to capitalize on their entrepreneurial spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the NDP platform pales in comparison.  Buried among the 
vague promises it wants to restrict the science research and 
economic development tax credit. This credit alleviates a portion 
of the enormous R&D expenditures Canadian firms make.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without this credit, considerable research and development might 
not occur.  That would be a sad state of affairs for Canada. 
Canada would not remain competitive for very long.  Since R and D 
supports thousands of jobs across the country, such a move would 
be short-sighted and very detrimental to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Atlantic Canada, especially in Prince Edward Island, we are 
striving to improve and enhance the high technology sector.  It 
is this sector that will allow Atlantic Canadians to regain their 
former economic importance within North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back at the time of Confederation the maritimes were an economic 
engine running on substantial international trade.  Over the last 
130 years their strength has been overshadowed by the sheer 
numbers of central Canada.  However, with the knowledge based 
global economy the maritimes are again in a position to resurrect 
that engine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advantages are there:  low labour costs, a skilled labour 
force and a high quality of life.  In short, Atlantic Canada 
leads Canada in low business costs.  This was clearly illustrated 
in the recent KPMG study which listed four Atlantic Canadian 
cities with the greatest cost advantage relative to the U.S. 
four-city average.  I am proud to say that a city in my riding, 
the city of Charlottetown, the birthplace of Confederation, is 
ranked second on this list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These cities rank much higher than major centres across the 
country.  The advantages of Charlottetown are almost double that 
of the city of Ottawa, more than double that of Toronto and 
triple that of Vancouver.  To earn that ranking Charlottetown had 
four top 10 rankings for lowest costs.  Among those was the 
number one ranking in total labour costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Canadian cities ranked so well because the federal 
government created an economic environment which encourages job 
creation.  We lowered interest rates by wrestling our spending 
under control.  We introduced programs which will support key 
sectors of our economy.  In short, we restored confidence in 
Canada and regained our economic sovereignty.  Canadian business 
is no longer penalized with high interest rates because of a 
crushing federal deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to end my speech today by informing members of the House 
that like many of them I have unemployed people in my riding, in 
fact too many people who are unemployed.  Practically not a day 
goes by that someone does not come into my office looking for 
help in finding a job.  Neither I nor my party is satisfied with 
this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have to ask ourselves if we use measures from the 
past, measures which together created part of the problem we are 
trying to fix today.  Do we use huge make work programs which add 
to the government deficit and create only temporary programs? Or, 
do we look forward and put into place the fundamentals for 
stable, permanent jobs for Canadians as we enter the 21st 
century? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is clear.  Canadians do not want a party which 
promotes old programs that no longer work.  Canadians want 
programs that work.  Canadians want a government that works, and 
the government they want is a Liberal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the hon. member for Hillsborough talked about what 
the Liberals want.  He said that Liberals want long term jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to hear that is what the Liberals want.  When 
we look at their actions and hold them up to the light of day 
they just do not wash.  Their desires and their actions are two 
different things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the last parliament Bill S-9 was passed.  That 
bill was supported by Liberal members, by Reform members and by 
Bloc members.  The only party which opposed it was the NDP.  Bill 
S-9 has done for the country the opposite of what the Liberal 
member has just talked about, that is creating jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-9 did a number of things.  Primarily it gave Canadians, 
retroactive to 1988, a refund of estate taxes paid in the U.S. on 
wealthy estates.  Their estates were reimbursed eight years back. 
It gave Canadians tax deductions in Canada for making 
contributions to U.S. charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scandalous point I want to emphasize today is that it gave 
Canadians who make contributions to U.S. universities like the 
University of Arkansas and so on tax deductions in Canada from 
Canadian income.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand the Liberals take money away from education, 
creating great hardships to our students.  They give hundreds of 
millions of dollars in tax deductions to wealthy Canadians who 
can afford to send their children to the States.  If we look at 
the numbers there are 30,000 Canadian students in the U.S. right 
now and only 3,000 American students in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see, with a ratio of ten Canadian students to one American 
student, where the money is going to flow.  It is going to flow 
south.  Yet the Reform, the Bloc and the Liberal government 
embraced and supported the bill to the detriment of Canadian 
youth and Canadian education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter I want to raise with the member.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am writing to you about an issue that is of concern to me.  I 
am in my second year at the University of Regina and have just 
recently finished paying my tuition fees.  The price of going to 
university is getting outrageous.  I am only taking four classes 
and it is costing me $1,300, plus the price of books on top of 
that. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the point: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within this last year, I have noticed that the cost of tuition 
has gone up dramatically.  Talking to people who went to 
university five years ago, I have found that the price of one 
semester now would have been the price for two semesters when 
they were going.  If this rate of increase continues, it will be 
very hard for me to be able to continue my education and achieve 
my degree since I am paying for it myself and only working at a 
minimum wage job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually, I can see only the rich or academically gifted 
attending university while the rest of us serve them food at 
McDonald's.  It seems that every time a new budget comes out 
there are more and more cuts to school funding.  I am not sure 
how this problem can be fixed but I know that something must be 
done.  I do not want to spend the rest of my life working for 
very little money at a job that is going nowhere. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A high number of students writing to me say they need jobs. 
Education expenses are increasing and are out of control.  The 
member says he wants to talk about how they desire long jobs, but 
every action the Liberals take is contrary to what they wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member for Hillsborough.  What does he 
think of Bill S-9?  Why does he think it is something we have to 
continue to support at the cost of the Canadian youth in our 
education systems? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud:</B>  Madam Speaker, no government in a long 
time has done as much for students as this government is doing 
with the bursary system and the tax deductions we have brought 
in, in the last four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me add to what the member said.  There is no doubt tuition 
fees are going up.  If we look at enrolment in universities it is 
going up dramatically as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there is an awful cost to going to university today.  The 
prime minister just announced a program the other day for 
bursaries for students of middle and low income families.  We 
will continue to do this with training programs and in other 
aspects of society such as high technology industries.  We are 
doing very well in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students are accepting it.  They come to my office.  I know the 
member gets letters from people who are having problems. 
Everybody has problems paying their way in society today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I read in the newspapers the other day, the increase in 
enrolment in universities proves that what we are doing by making 
student loans available, giving bursaries and giving more tax 
deductions to students will enable more students to go to 
university than ever before.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Madam

of the hardest working people in the country.  I fully realize 
they would expect nothing less from their member of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Tobique—Mactaquac are a proud people.  They are 
proud of their families, proud of their rural heritage and proud 
of their community.  It is a privilege to sit in the House on 
their behalf.  I will make every effort to represent them to the 
best of my ability.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This week we are celebrating National Business Week.  It is sad 
the government only recognizes businesses one week out of the 
year.  The other 51 weeks it is choking us to death in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 Canadian businesses shut down in record numbers.  We 
have in New Brunswick the harmonized sales tax and a 15% federal 
tax.  It is the government which introduced and put the bill into 
effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also a businessman.  I own and operate a little convenience 
store and I sell gasoline.  Before the HST came into effect I was 
selling on average 3,000 litres of gasoline per day.  Now I sell 
on an average 300 litres a day.  This is a drop of 90%.  At the 
same time, before the HST came into effect, 80% to 85% of the 
people buying gas would come into the store to buy something 
else.  My gross sales have now dropped by 40%.  I have five 
employees in my little convenience store.  Now I have one.  Is 
this what the government calls job creation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there are many Canadians who believe it is up to the 
government to create jobs.  As a businessman I say it is not up 
to the government.  Government cannot create jobs.  It is up to 
us, the private sector and the business community, to create 
jobs.  The government has a responsibility to help us create the 
climate and to create much needed jobs for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could start by giving us a tax break that would 
help us create much needed jobs.  A good way would be to cut the 
EI payroll tax, not from $2.90 per hundred to $2.80.  Why does 
the government not bring it down to $2.20?  Why have a $5 billion 
surplus in the EI fund when we could keep people to work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government came to power we had a $42 billion deficit. 
I agree totally that this deficit had to come down and had to be 
eliminated.  What I do not agree with is the way the government 
brought it down.  It shoved its problems on to the provinces 
instead of cleaning its own mess in Ottawa.  The only cut the 
government made wasted a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more important to all Canadians is their health and 
education of their children.  Yet the government cut those two 
items by $6 billion.  What a shame to see the youth unemployment 
at 32% in New Brunswick.  The government had a youth internship 
program but it was cancelled this summer.  According to the 
Speech from the Throne the government will be putting more money 
toward our youth.  I hope that some of that money will make its 
way to my riding of Tobique—Mactaquac because the people are 
hurting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government does not come first.  The people we represent come 
first.  I will be voting for the NDP motion because in my riding 
we believe in the same values and principles attached to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a 
quick comment for the Conservative member.  It seems that when 
the Tories were in power they refused to listen to the people. 
They pulled all sorts of shenanigans, including loading the 
Senate in order to jam through the now hated GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems the GST, the mother of all hated taxes, has a daughter 
called HST.  Now for some reason they are talking against the 
HST. 
Clearly it has a tremendously deleterious effect on the economy. 
There is no doubt about it.  The member has said that his own 
experience shows that.  I would like to know whether he would 
enlighten the House regarding what they would do with the 
HST/GST.  What is their intention?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>  First of all, Madam Speaker, I am not 
on the government side.  I am on the opposition side.  I am just 
like one of them. Second, I was not part of the past Conservative 
government that put the GST into place, but I agreed with the tax 
100% and I will tell members why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I own two companies.  As a contractor and as a painter, before 
the GST came into effect in 1990 when I wanted to buy a gallon of 
paint it would cost me 18% on that gallon of paint.  It never 
showed because it was incorporated into the price of the gallon 
of paint. On a roll of masking tape, I would pay 11%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the GST came along, the companies would have had to get out 
of that tax and include the 7%.  Some of the companies did that. 
They took the manufacturers sales tax out and just included the 
7% but there are a lot of companies that did not do that.  They 
kept the manufacturers sales tax as a profit and included an 
extra 7% on top of that.  That is what made it a bad tax but it 
is not the fault of the previous Conservative government.  The 
GST was a good tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about the HST, this government felt that the HST was not 
a good tax.  They brought up the HST but now we are paying 15% 
instead of 7%.  In my store alone my business went down by 40% 
and my gas consumption went down by 90% but my electricity bill 
went up by 8% and my oil bill went up by 8%.  Do you call that 
fair? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were here in the province of Ontario or in Manitoba or 
further west, I would only pay 7%.  Why should I have to pay 15%? 
That is why I am saying to this government to give us a tax 
break so that we can really create jobs in this country, 
especially in New Brunswick.  We cannot create the jobs we need 
because this government is choking us to death with taxes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have just a couple of points for the Conservative 
member.  I thank him for his support of the NDP motion.  I 
believe if it does get passed it will go a long way in helping 
Canadians out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to debunk the myth that comes from members of the 
Reform Party mostly that the government cannot create jobs.  If 
they keep saying that eventually people may say “Why do you keep 
saying that?” I do believe the government can create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A prime example is our post office. It has taken away what were 
good jobs, a job my father did for 11 years as a letter carrier, 
and now there are superboxes.  All they have to do is replace the 
GST and in Atlantic Canada the HST.  Take that money off, put it 
back into the corporation's profits, get rid of the superboxes 
and thousands of letter carrier jobs can be created right across 
this country so that those shut-ins, those seniors, those people 
who are disabled or those single mothers at home do not have to 
leave to go get their mail in inclement weather.  There would be 
thousands of jobs created right there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area where they can create jobs is in regulation.  The 
state of Oregon from my understanding has no self-serve gas 
stations.  There is a station open right across from my 
constituency office in Lower Sackville with 12 pumps, all 
self-serve.  I asked the manager.  She said that it was 
Petro-Canada's policy.  That is insane.  The fact of the matter 
is that gas prices will not rise if full service stations are 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Conservative member honestly believe that government 
cannot create jobs or does he believe that government in 
consultation with industries can create jobs together? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>  Madam Speaker, to answer the question 
from my colleague from the NDP, government cannot create jobs but 
it can work in co-ordination with the private sector with big 
companies to create jobs in this country.  It is the companies 
that will create the jobs, not the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on the NDP opposition day motion condemning the 
immediate human tragedy of 1.4 million unemployed Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier the leader of the New Democratic Party alluded to the 
fact that it had been four years since her party had been able to 
present a motion in this House.  I would like to congratulate her 
and remind her that the NDP is not alone in that predicament.  We 
have also waited four years to participate in debate in this 
House.  And truly thus have all Canadians waited from sea to sea 
to sea to participate, for surely the last Parliament was the 
least participatory of any Parliament in Canada's history. In 
that Parliament we had one party that wanted to break up the 
country, another party that wanted to help them and a third party 
called the government that did whatever it wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the parts of the motion that state that we need to 
set targets to reduce unemployment but the flawed NDP notion that 
1.8% inflation regulates the 9% unemployment rate is an 
oversimplification of a wrong-headed policy. How many times must 
we state that government is not the engine to drive job creation? 
Government creates the atmosphere so business has a climate it 
can thrive in, live in, breathe in, eat, drink and sleep in. 
Business is a living thing and we control it. From that climate 
industry will grow and industry will create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today government members rose to their feet and applauded the 
fact that unemployment has only increased by 300,000 Canadians 
since 1990.  I hesitate to call this good government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of infrastructure where government can actually help 
build a foundation for job creation, this government has a dismal 
record.  Infrastructure is one path that leads to jobs. Highways, 
container piers, railroads, wharves, navigational aids, a well 
educated workforce all belong on that path.  Make work projects 
do not belong on that path.  If we ever in this nation choose to 
follow the path of make work projects, we will be lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester spoke about 
the possible social and psychological costs of high unemployment. 
Food banks, poverty, hospital line-ups because of transfer cuts 
to health and education, these are real problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What in the world is the matter with this government?  It 
credits itself with reducing unemployment from 11.4% to 9% as if 
that is some kind of a record.  Instead of slapping themselves on 
the back, Liberals should be ashamed of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stated earlier that actions taken today do not take 
effect until a year or so down the road.  This will be the 
closest the government will ever come to crediting the previous 
Tory government for the unprecedented recovery and growth from 
1992 to 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been no discussion of the casualties of frolicking in 
the sunshine of this unprecedented growth without a bit of 
sunblock.  Who has been burned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start with the youth of Canada.  There has not been 
enough discussion in this Parliament about the fact that Canada's 
youth are the part of this equation that has been completely left 
out of the unemployment numbers. We have had a recovery in the 
1990s.  We have had a recovery for adult workers in the 1990s. 
We have not had a job recovery for youth. 
The adult unemployment rate is 9.4%.  The unemployment rate for 
youth is 20%.  This government is not prepared to do anything 
about the radical imbalance of the unemployment figures as they 
affect youth in this country.

to high school students at Parkview Educational Centre. It was a 
tough and difficult speech to deliver.  They asked me to come as 
their MP and discuss their opportunities to participate in the 
future of this nation, their opportunities to continue their 
education and come out with the prospects for a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Job prospects for Canada's youth are terrible. Everyone in this 
House should go into a classroom filled with 150 high school kids 
and try to tell them that the best thing they can do is continue 
their education, get a post-secondary degree, spend $12,000 a 
year, run up a bill of $50,000 to $60,000 and that will increase 
their chances of getting a job.  That does not guarantee them a 
job, but that will increase their chances of getting one and they 
should feel good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I delivered that message because that is the truth but I did not 
feel good about delivering it.  I did not offer them much promise 
and I did not offer them much hope.  Somehow it is the job of the 
government of this nation to be able to offer them some promise 
and to be able to offer them some hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes we have business initiatives for youth.  We have 
internships.  We have co-operative education programs.  We have 
mentor programs.  But they are not putting numbers of youth back 
to work.  It is too little, too late and there is not enough of 
it. Yes the federal public sector youth employment program has 
helped create 6,000 jobs for aboriginal youth.  It is the tip of 
the iceberg.  It is not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last is an issue that has not been touched upon while we have 
discussed unemployment in the House. That is the 60,000 people in 
the east coast fishery who are out of work. That is a very real 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you would indulge me, Madam Speaker, I would like to relate a 
story to the House.  It relates to this caring, sharing 
government.  Hon. members opposite would have us believe that 
somehow they are a caring, sharing government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the height of the downturn in the fishery in the town of 
Shelburne, Nova Scotia when there were no jobs in the fishery 
sector and all the services were downloaded on the backs of these 
fishers, the government in its wisdom decided at that time, at a 
crucial moment in the history of Shelburne county, to pull out of 
the naval base in Shelburne.  They lost 120-some armed forces 
personnel who contributed to the economy of that town.  They lost 
40 to 50 full time jobs supplying that base and all of the income 
generated from it. And this is a caring, sharing government? 
That is how it answers the east coast fishery problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are on the subject of fisheries, we have an 
interception fishery on both coasts of this country.  We have 
done nothing about it in British Columbia. Those salmon under 
international agreement were headed for Canadian rivers.  They 
were Canadian fish.  We allowed the Americans to catch them. 
We did nothing about it. On the east coast 
of Canada we have an interception fishery off of Greenland. We 
have done nothing about it.  We allow the Europeans to catch all 
the fish they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot even as a government support the salmon hatcheries in 
Nova Scotia.  There are three salmon hatcheries slated for 
divestiture in Nova Scotia. This government has chosen to allow 
them to go.  There is a $400,000 cost of maintaining them. 
In return they create employment. They support singlehandedly a 
$10 million sport fishery in Nova Scotia.

Speaker, I draw the attention of the member for South Shore to a 
few numbers which he may like to consider. I listened to him with 
great attention and I hope he will listen to me with the same 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 when his party was in power the bank rate was 13%. Today 
in 1997 I believe the bank rate is 3.75%.  In 1990 when his party 
was in power the prime rate was 14%.  Today the prime rate is a 
mere 5.25%.  Best of all, in 1990 when his party was in power the 
five year mortgage rate was 13%. Today in 1997 under the Liberal 
government after four years of fiscal responsible administration 
of the country, the five year mortgage rate is a mere 6.75%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the member that the reason there is so much 
unemployment and so many problems is that the previous 
Conservative federal government failed to manage the economy 
responsibly, created a stranglehold on the economy and jobs were 
lost.  Now we see that even the NDP has to admit that because of 
excellent fiscal financial management of the affairs of the 
nation we have driven down interest rates in an extraordinary 
fashion. When the economy is rolling the jobs will follow and 
they have been following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the member for South Shore has to say about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of things 
to say about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First is his judicious use of numbers from 1990 versus 1997. Let 
us get to when we actually had an increase in the economy of the 
country when the Tories were still in power in 1992.  Take a look 
at and spout those numbers because they do not wash quite as 
easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His party does not change economic policy or the bank rates in 
this country. That did not happen overnight.  They rode on the 
Tory coattails and are sitting there because the economic policy 
was put in place before you ever won your seat. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the New Democratic Party I thank the 
Conservative member for South Shore for his efforts in the 
application to get our motion passed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic to hear the Liberals speak about how great they did 
on the fiscal policies and the low interest rates.  It means 
absolutely diddly-squat if you do not have a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish you would get this through your head.  It means 
absolutely nothing— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I remind hon. members that they should 
address all remarks to the Chair. We do not want members going to 
nose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I apologize.  As I have 
asked before, in terms of tax cuts that the Reform and 
Conservative parties have asked for in the past, would he not 
agree that a tax cut to the HST and the GST would be much more 
beneficial and provide a much more immediate dividend to the 
Canadian people?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, of course a tax cut to the 
GST and the combined HST would be a benefit but there are other 
ways to do the same thing.  We can put more money back into the 
economy by cutting payroll taxes. We have said it.  We have been 
preaching it.  We will say it one more time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as we put the money back so it is in the hands of the 
consumer, I do not care if it comes from cutting the GST and the 
HST, from cutting the EI payments, from cutting whatever payroll 
taxes we want to cut, if we give the money back to the consumers 
they will spend it.  They have to.  Times are too tough.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing 
my time with the hon. member for Durham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I wish to address the motion tabled by the NDP. I listened 
to several speakers from the Bloc Quebecois who raised the issues of 
federal transfers, employment, health, inflation and monetary policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For three and a half years the Bloc Quebecois has been urging the 
federal government to amend its monetary policy to take into account its 
impact on employment, saying “We believe that the Bank of Canada's 
strategy condemns the Canadian economy to operate below its potential. 
To keep inflation at a very low level adversely affects the economy, and 
the benefits of such a policy have not been demonstrated”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Bloc Quebecois, the Bank of Canada's monetary 
policy is based on an excessive desire to throttle inflation by 
maintaining high real interest rates. It is a policy which impacts 
negatively on employment and on the economy as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To stimulate employment and to promote economic recovery and 
development, the Bloc Quebecois proposes an in-depth review of the 
Canadian monetary policy, and primarily a change in the monetary policy, 
so that the inflation target of the Bank of Canada, through its interest 
rate policy and the expansion of the monetary supply, would be set at 
3%, with a variation of plus or minus 1%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During these months and years, Bloc members proposed an inflation 
rate target of 3%, rather than 2%, as is currently the case, with the 
same 2% variation. This, they claimed, would result in the creation of 
460,000 jobs, while also bringing the unemployment rate down to under 
7%. As we know, the idea was put forward by Pierre Fortin, a professor 
of economics from Montreal, before the finance committee, when it was 
doing preliminary work for the budget. 
It seems that the Bloc members bought Mr. Fortin's arguments, since 
they adopted this idea in their report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came to power, the Minister of Finance and the 
Governor of the Bank of Canada agreed to aim at a lower inflation 
rate.  Thanks to a moderate monetary policy and the effectiveness 
of the new deficit reduction measures, interest rates have not been 
this low for 35 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came to power, Canadian interest rates were two points 
higher than U.S. rates.  Today, the opposite is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to paint you a picture.  We have heard the Bloc 
members speaking numerous times today about federal transfer 
payments.  What exactly are federal transfer payments in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the topic is offloading the deficit, health care or 
welfare cuts, or whether there is a more sophisticated debate on 
the advantages and disadvantages of the federal system, the 
question of transfer payments to the provinces keeps coming up in 
the House of Commons, in the Quebec National Assembly, in ridings 
throughout the great province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make an important distinction right away.  There are 
two sorts of transfer payments: equalization payments and social 
program funding.  Equalization payments are calculated in a complex 
way, based on the fiscal capacity of each province.  The idea is to 
ensure all Canadians, whether they live in rich provinces or poor, 
of access to public services that are more or less equivalent in 
quality.  Equalization payments have no strings attached, in other 
words the provinces may use them however they see fit.  That is 
important: the provinces may use them however they see fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization payments have not, however, always been affected 
by federal transfer payment reductions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak of offloading the deficit, we are referring 
essentially to the other transfers. That is the truth. Up to last year, 
these transfers were made under two programs, that is established 
programs funding, such as for education and health, and the Canada 
assistance plan, social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance regrouped all that in a single program, the 
Canada social transfer, much less generous, to be sure. But if we look 
at the significance of the federal tables for each province for the 
1996-97 fiscal period, the figures are expressed in a per capita basis. 
It goes without saying— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, I believe your earphone is up close 
to the microphone. 
You should put it in the desk. It is right by the microphone, and should 
go in the desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for your comment, my 
paper was blocking the microphone, and I apologize. I am brand new in 
the House of Commons, I have just arrived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of equalization payments, which vary enormously from 
one province to another, we can see that Quebec receives a lot less than 
the others. This is not injustice, it simply reflects the fact that 
Quebec is the least poor of the poor provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Payments made under the Canada social transfer, which are based 
merely on the population size, do not vary obviously a lot from one 
location to another. 
On the subject of transfers between provinces and with respect to 
Quebec, there was a very spectacular drop, which must be situated in a 
broader context. There are columns on the right and on the left. For 
Quebec, the equalization payment was $216 of the Canada transfer and for 
the others it was $1.381 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figure is based on the size of federal transfers not as a 
function of provincial budgets but rather of the economy of the 
individual provinces. We can see that the federal transfers have not 
decreased in Quebec; they have increased. This may appear odd but it is 
true. However, the amounts are the same. How can this be? For my friends 
of the Bloc Quebecois, I would point out that provincial governments' 
expenditures increased much more rapidly than federal transfers until 
1990. This is the history of federal transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day they were talking about health care.  There is 
a small community at Clova, and I heard the PQ MNA, Jean-Pierre 
Jolivet, say “They are closing the CLSC in the small town of Clova 
and transferring it to Parent.  We are not the ones transferring 
it.  The federal government is to blame”.  Who took the decision to 
transfer a nurse from Clova to Parent at a cost of almost $30,000? 
The decision to transfer this small centre from Clova to Parent was 
made by ministers, by Lucien Bouchard and Jean-Pierre Jolivet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say something.  When it comes to job creation, 
what is the role of the government?  What is the role of the 
government in the Province of Quebec?  If we look at the 
government's role— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No props. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, these are my personal notes. 
He is trying to say they are props.  You can start in with the 
same old refrain, dear colleagues.  Go ahead, there is more fun 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government plays a large and critical role in 
Abitibi-Témiscamingue.  Why?  Because our economy in 
Abitibi-Témiscamingue is always up and down like a yo-yo, 
depending on market prices, on the price of metals, gold, copper, 
or the price of softwood lumber and particle board.  With people 
from our area and from the Province of Quebec, and the government 
in power, we decided that there should be a regional and local 
development fund, that is the public and parapublic sector, in 
which the Government of Canada is involved, and in which the 
Government of Quebec is also involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we supply human resources in our region of 
Abitibi-Témiscamingue, almost 53% of the funds are provided 
through partnerships.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why those funds?  Where do they come from?  I will tell you. 
They come either from Desjardins investments, or from the FTQ.  I 
hear the member for Témiscamingue talking about a donation, when he 
means a loan, and saying that a loan is a donation, that it is the 
same thing.  I never understood the story.  It is true that the 
donation was $1.7 million to the Bloc Quebecois before the 1993 
campaign, but they never noticed that the donation was not like the 
one borrowers are given in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, that is, the 
interest was thrown in.  If the interest on loans is 6%, what they 
got at 2% is a donation.  In any event, we will come back to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, our people, whether we are talking about the 
Government of Canada, the Government of Quebec, or through the 
Federal Office of Regional Development for Quebec and the CDIC, are 
partners contributing to the creation of jobs in order to lower 
unemployment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to ask a question of my colleague from Abitibi 
and will start by rectifying once again some of the statements he 
has made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said something earlier on about transfers to the provinces. 
I would like to remind him of this.  He said that the provinces 
could do what they wished with transfer payments, could use them as 
they saw fit.  I would remind him that, when he was a Conservative—he 
ought to remember—there was quite a battle with the Minister 
of Health to make sure that the Canada Health Act was respected by 
the provinces.  There was a huge fuss connected to transfer 
payments. 
British Columbia had been threatened with a loss of its transfer 
payments less than two years ago, because it was not conforming to 
certain aspects of the Canada Health Act.  So saying that these are 
transfers with no strings attached is totally false, and once again 
a misleading statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for economics, my colleague has suggested here already that 
a gift and a loan were the same thing.  Allow me to say that this 
is totally false.  I went to the manager of my caisse populaire, 
and told him that I would not be repaying my mortgage because a 
gift and a loan were the same thing.  All he needed to do was to 
phone the hon. member for Abitibi, who would explain it all to him. 
He strongly suggested that I make my mortgage payments, because 
that was not the way it worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point, federal transfer payments—I am getting to my 
question now—the hon. member for Abitibi does not say this when he 
talks about health and social programs.  As for cash transfers the 
government was making when the Liberals came to power, these were 
$17 billion a year.  Now, the figure is barely $11 billion. They 
cut $6 billion in cash transfers and forced the provinces to play 
the bad guys in health and education, which are their 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke of another concept as well and I would like him to 
take the next few minutes to clarify it for us.  He referred a 
great deal to equalization payments— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but I 
want to give the hon. member for Abitibi the opportunity to 
respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, in reply to the Bloc Quebecois 
member, the member for Témiscamingue, when I said the provinces 
could use the money as they saw fit, I was referring to an article 
by Claude Piché in <I>La Presse</I> on Saturday, October 4.  It is well 
written, and I would like to quote from it.  “The calculation of 
equalization is a complex matter.  It is based on the fiscal 
capacity of each province.  The idea is to ensure that all 
Canadians, from rich and poor provinces alike—that is what I am 
explaining—have access to public services of essentially equal 
quality.  Equalization payments are therefore unconditional, that 
is the provinces may use them as they see fit.  Equalization has 
not always been affected by cuts in federal transfer payments”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing the member opposite has not spoken about today is 
job creation.  He never mentions it.  His riding of Témiscamingue 
benefits from what the federal government provides. 
It benefits from money from all Canadians in the CDIC and many 
companies—there are 40 companies in his sector—create jobs.  I do 
not have a lot left, but this pamphlet from—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
comment focuses on the fact that the member opposite spent a lot 
of time debating the NDP opposition motion and yet said very 
little with respect to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All day members opposite have had very little to say about what 
our motion actually entails. The message in the motion is very 
simple.  The federal government has failed miserably in dealing 
with the real problem. By attacking the deficit it has not dealt 
with the issue of setting targets for unemployment.  Our motion 
is very clear on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A previous speaker asked us to consider this motion for what it 
really is and then proceeded to talk without even dealing with 
the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another member opposite was educating the “dinosaurs” on this 
side of the House on the difference between fiscal and monetary 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I campaigned during the federal election I spoke to one of 
my constituents.  It was interesting because, again, a speaker on 
the other side— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We will have to come back to the debate. The 
hon. member for Durham. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to enter this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion by the New Democratic Party talks about the 
immorality of the government in reducing its deficit and debt. 
The previous intervener talked about dinosaurs.  It seems to me 
that every time the NDP brings something to the floor of the 
House I have heard it before, usually about 20 or 25 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had to deal with the deficit and debt problems.  We have done 
that ferociously, so much so that interest rates in the country 
are at an all time low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the basic fundamentals of economics which 
create jobs.  In the last nine months 297,000 new jobs have been 
created.  Only in the last couple of months 63,000 of those jobs 
were filled by young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it difficult to set targets, as the motion entertains? It 
is because of something called the elasticity of labour.  As 
people begin to seek and find work in the economy more people 
offer themselves for those jobs.  Even though there has been a 
tremendous amount of job increase, a number of people are seeking 
employment.  It is very difficult to determine who is going to 
seek new employment.  As more and more people reach the labour 
market their friends, who are at home for one reason or another, 
may decide they also want to enter the labour market.   It is a 
very difficult problem to solve because it is always changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One part of this motion deals specifically with education, which 
I find interesting.  The Conference Board of Canada recently 
issued a report.  I suggest the members of the NDP take some time 
to read it.  Despite its motion, which talks about the dismal 
failure of the government to deal with matters of education, the 
Conference Board of Canada states that in 1993 Canada spent 7.6% 
of its gross domestic product on education.  That is more than in 
the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy or the United 
Kingdom.  Nearly two-thirds of all Canadians aged five to 29 are 
enrolled in educational programs, a record exceeded by only three 
other OECD countries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite Canada's spending, its grade 8 students placed only in 
the middle of a pack on standardization in international tests in 
science and mathematics.  Domestic testing confirms these 
disappointing results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being said here?  It is saying that increased spending 
does not necessarily get results.  This flies in the face of the 
rhetoric of the NDP whose members believe that they can solve all 
problems simply by cranking out cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was amazed to notice in this survey that in the area of 
post-secondary education, Canada spends 2.8% of its GDP.  That is 
the highest in the world.  The one area for which the federal 
government has some responsibility, post-secondary education, 
Canada is spending the highest amount of any country in the 
western world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP members say that we are not doing enough.  Are we 
supposed to be spending three times more money than every other 
country in the western world?  I would have thought the NDP would 
have been concerned about giving people basic skills to get high 
paying jobs. I would have thought that they would be trying to 
find ways in which to make that spending more effective, not just 
to crank out more dollars. In fact, I suspect less money can 
actually be spent while getting better results, that is, if we 
take a little more of an approach to managing the way we are 
spending some of our money today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time as this spending is going on, Canada's literary 
skills are only middle of the pack in the western world.  I am 
proud to be part of a government that recognized that two years 
ago, before many of these members showed up here, increasing the 
budget by over $50 million in the area of literacy skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  You've done a wonderful job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can see that the 
members are getting a little upset with the facts, but the facts 
are quite clear.  The government has committed to spending more 
in the area of post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear that the Conference Board of Canada recognizes 
that Canada spends tremendously more money than most of its 
competing partners in the OECD countries.  At the same time, we 
are not really getting a lot of positive results. Yes, we are 
getting a polarization between knowledge based workers and all 
the rest.  We have to find better ways to get more people 
involved in lifetime training skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize and I share some of the things that the conference 
board has said.  I would have thought that some of the members of 
the NDP would be concerned about some of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about how to develop lifelong learning skills, how to 
encourage employers to engage in some of these programs. It has 
been this government that has recognized the importance of making 
an intervention between people who are now taking higher skilled 
education in the post-secondary education system and integrating 
them with a work force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been very pleased to be part of a government that has 
developed a program to take young students who are engaged in 
information technologies and introduce them to some of our small 
and medium size businesses to upgrade their skills so that they 
too can employ more people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing when we actually look at some of our industrial 
structure, that we see many of our businesses spend less money on 
technological innovation than do our American partners.  It is 
very important that we start putting more stress in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has expanded the use of the IRAP program to 
encourage and foster evolving technologies in small and medium 
size businesses.  It has created another horizons plus program 
which basically takes some of these young people who are also 
engaged in the area of trade and studying trade at post-secondary 
education and injects them into small and medium size businesses, 
the purpose of which is to make them export ready. These are some 
of the positive ways that governments can be part of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is introducing an $850 million Canadian 
innovation foundation.  I can tell members that the 
post-secondary institution in my riding is very happy with that 
initiative. I am spending a lot of time making sure that they get 
a piece of that so those young people can get better and higher 
skilled jobs in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time as we are talking, we have a problem because 
the immigration department is besieged with requests to bring 
more people into the country to take highly skilled jobs because 
we do not have people to do that work.  That is atrocious.  It is 
a travesty of our system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, just a point of 
clarification for the Chair.  Through you to the hon. member for 
York South—Weston, we are following what we did with the 
previous bill, Bill C-44. We are moving it from first reading 
right to committee stage.  The exact same bill, Bill C-9, is 
undergoing the same procedure as did the original bill.  The 
opportunity will be for members of the House to do their work in 
committee as quickly as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is an established 
procedure in this House that a bill be given second reading 
before it is referred to a committee.  Before we invoke this 
special power to refer a bill to a committee before second 
reading, there ought to be extenuating circumstances why the bill 
ought to be expedited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to understand from the government what the 
extenuating circumstances are in order to have this bill 
expedited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Technically speaking, the debate on this 
particular motion is over.  When the hon. member brought up his 
point, I thought we would expedite matters by getting a point of 
clarification.  I do not believe that we should be going back and 
forth any more in this debate. I put it to the hon. member for 
York South—Weston, does he wish to vote at this particular time 
on this particular motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the government is not 
prepared to answer the question, then I think we ought to take a 
vote.

have been moved. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a very serious issue that concerns 
all Canadians.  I attended in September a memorial service 
honouring the law enforcement officers who gave their lives in 
the line of duty. One way of ensuring protection for peace 
officers and indeed all Canadians is to ensure that individuals 
who are convicted of first degree murder do not receive early 
release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 29, the following day, I asked the Minister of 
Justice if she would stop worrying about the protection of 
criminals and do the right thing by repealing this offensive 
section of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her answer certainly demonstrated little if any compassion for 
the families of victims.  She basically told us at that time that 
in no way does she intend to repeal this section and that we will 
have to content ourselves with the amendments that were made by 
her government last year; that is, she intends to simply lock the 
issue up and throw away the key, something she refuses to do for 
first degree murderers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Justice does not know it, Canadians do. 
Modifications made in January 1997, of which the Liberals are so 
proud, do not prevent dangerous criminals such as Paul Bernardo 
from applying for this early release.  The answer should be, and 
the minister knows this, that people like Mr. Bernardo should not 
have the right to go through a judicial screening process in any 
way, shape or form.  Going through this judicial screening 
process is in itself an extreme insult to the victims, their 
families and all victims and Canadians in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People like Mr. Olson and Mr. Bernardo have forfeited each and 
every right that every Canadian has and they should not have the 
possibility to rehash their crimes and offensive acts. This is 
not a right convicted murderers should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister needs to know and needs to be reminded of what 
occurred at the Olson hearing in British Columbia this summer. 
Let us remind the minister of this horrific hearing that took 
place in August 1997.  It was a very sad and frustrating day for 
the families of Mr. Olson's victims who had to sit through this 
ordeal of the appeal hearing and relive the horror this man put 
their families through 15 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no justification in the world for a hearing like this 
to take place.  It only underscores the need for the immediate 
abolition of section 745.  Furthermore, it provided the media, in 
particular television, with the opportunity to sensationalize the 
coverage of this hearing.  It shamelessly appealed to a number of 
people in the public who lust for vicarious enjoyment of the 
agony these individuals had to live through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that when this change to the Criminal Code was 
brought in and amended, this faint hope was permitted to 
continue.  Although it was lessened, this was the intent of the 
changes that were made. This faint hope clause still exists in 
its present form.  The argument that it is a useful tool for 
rehabilitative purposes is certainly lost on the families of 
those individuals who have to relive this process and have to 
undergo the further agony of having this person who committed 
these horrific acts be given media attention all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Life sentences were initially a substitute for the taking of a 
life as retribution on occasions where first degree premeditated 
murders occurred.  Let us live up to the intent of the life 
sentence.  Let us put truth in sentencing. Those criminals who 
have gone through the process, been tried, convicted and put 
behind bars should be kept there.  I remind the Minister of 
Justice that the opportunity is there and I put it to the 
minister that now is the time to live up to Canadians' 
expectations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We consider these reforms a fair compromise between normal concern 
for victims and the safety of society and the search for a criminal 
justice system that reflects a whole set of values.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With the amendments we have made, offenders who commit multiple 
murders after January 9, 1997 will no longer be allowed to apply 
for judicial review.  In addition, the two changes we made to the 
system, including offenders currently in the system provided that 
they had not already applied when the amendments came into force, 
were judicial screening and that the jury considering the 
application must be unanimous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Bernardo case even though the murders were committed 
before the amendments came into force, the judicial screening and 
the unanimity on behalf of the jury will apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one can ignore the pain that the Olson and Bernardo cases 
have inflicted on the families of the victims.  The difference 
between the government's approach and that of the Conservatives 
and Reform is that the government wanted to do more for the 
victims and their families and to acknowledge the pain they feel. 
We are not going to stop only with the focus on section 745.  We 
are doing more in terms of the families of the victims and the 
government will be speaking to that in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  A motion to adjourn the House is now deemed
