</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-510, an act to provide cost of 
production protection for the family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, by means of a very short introduction, 
this is a bill to provide to the agricultural producers of our 
country income that is reflected in their cost of production.  It 
is to be calculated on a three year basis.  It covers most 
commodities in the country.  It is something that farmers have 
been calling for, for a long time.  It ties the cost production 
formula into what income they get when they sell their 
commodities, be it grain in the fall or livestock at certain 
times of the year.

be abolished.  The reason they are asking for that is because the 
Senate costs the Canadian taxpayers some $50 million a year. They

that it is not elected and it is therefore not proper to have a 
Senate as part of our modern democracy.

<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-71, an act to implement certain provisions of 
the budget tabled in parliament on February 16, 1999, be read the 
third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate the 
opportunity to speak at third reading of Bill C-71. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with strengthening health care, increasing the Canada 
child tax benefit and assisting below and modest income 
Canadians, Bill C-71 also covers a range of other measures such 
as debt management, income tax administration, first nations 
taxation and public service pensions, among other things. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1010
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While wide ranging, I would say, and I am sure hon. members 
would agree, that all these measures are connected.  They fall 
within the sphere of the government's ongoing commitment to an 
effective, efficient and fiscally responsible government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to briefly summarize some of the bill's highlights. 
Bill C-71 provides for the transfer announced in the 1999 budget 
of an additional $11.5 billion in health care funding to the 
provinces under the Canada health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that this increase will be 
distributed equally for every Canadian in every province.  By 
eliminating the per capita disparities in the distribution of the 
CHST, all provinces by 2001-02 will receive identical per capita 
entitlements, thereby providing equal support for health and 
other social services to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces will receive $8 billion of the $11.5 billion 
through the CHST over four years beginning April 1, 2000.  The 
additional $3.5 billion will be paid in the form of an immediate 
one time supplement to the CHST from funds available this fiscal 
year.  The provinces can decide for themselves how much they will 
draw down each and every year over the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the immediate one time supplement of $3.5 billion 
is to respond directly to the concerns that Canadians had from 
coast to coast to coast about the lack of emergency services that 
they were able to access, as well as the long waiting lists. The 
$3.5 billion will be in the hands of the provinces to immediately 
draw down as they see fit in order to meet the needs of their 
particular constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the funding increase reaches $2.5 billion in 2001-02, 
direct federal cash support under the CHST will be $15 billion a 
year.  The health component then of the CHST will be as high as 
it was before the expenditure restraint in the mid-1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next measure in Bill C-71 deals with two components of the 
Canada child tax benefit: the base benefit and the national child 
benefit supplement.  Both are changed in the 1999 budget.  Bill 
C-71 sets out the design of the 1998 budget commitment to provide 
an additional $850 million increase in the national child benefit 
supplement payments to low income families.  The maximum national 
child benefit supplement benefit level is being increased by $350 
in two stages: $180 in July 1999 and $170 in July 2000.  The net 
income level at which the national child benefit supplement is 
fully phased out is also being increased to $27,750 in July 1999 
and $29,590 in July 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes mean that a family with two children earning 
$20,000 will receive an increased benefit of $700 for a total of 
$3,750 per year.  As well, a $300 million enrichment of the base 
benefit in July 2000 will increase benefits for modest and middle 
income families by $184 per family.  It will also be accomplished 
by means of an increase to the $29,590 in the net income 
threshold of these benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also addresses assistance for children in another area 
by ensuring that the full amount of the single supplement of the 
GST credit will go to single parents earning under $25,921. 
Unfortunately some very low income families with children may not 
have been receiving the full GST credit supplement.  This bill 
addresses this problem by increasing the GST credit benefits for 
low income single parents to complement the national child 
benefit by providing these parents with the full $105 amount of 
the single supplement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also addresses first nations taxation issues.  The 1999 
budget confirmed the government's willingness to continue 
discussions about taxation matters with first nations and to 
implement arrangements with first nations members.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-71 gives the B.C. Sliammon first nation authority to add 
a value added tax on all tobacco products and fuels sold on 
reserves.  B.C.'s Westbank first nation, which already taxes 
tobacco products and alcoholic beverages, will now be able to 
charge a 7% GST style tax on its on reserve sales of fuel. In 
addition, the Yukon First Nation Self-Government Act will be 
amended to give effect to the GST rebate provisions which were 
added to their self-government agreements last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also measures involving the administration of 
taxation.  A service agreement signed last October between 
Revenue Canada and Nova Scotia allows for a limited release of 
taxpayer information to Nova Scotia Workers Compensation Board. 
The bill also allows for co-operation in audits.  Certainly this 
exchange of information helps ensure amounts owed are indeed 
paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will be pleased to note that before exchanging any 
information the federal government will ensure that the workers 
compensation board fully adheres to the current confidentiality 
safeguards that apply to the sharing of information with agencies 
outside Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another part of Bill C-71 deals with good financial management. 
Hon. members are aware that the government is committed to 
managing its debt cost as effectively as possible.  This bill 
amends the Financial Administration Act to enhance the 
effectiveness of debt and risk management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments, many of which are technical, confirm some 
existing practices.  They clarify the authority governing the 
government's borrowing and distribution of its debt and modernize 
the government's fiscal and risk management powers.  The bill 
also spells out the government's standing authority under the FAA 
to ensure that maturing debt can only be refinanced within a 
given fiscal year, a practice the government has followed for 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New borrowing authority to finance a deficit would be obtained 
as in the past through a borrowing authority bill.  It is 
important to ensure that all members understand that the 
amendments to the FAA are in no way compromising the authority 
that is required to finance a deficit.  In fact, that authority 
would be obtained as in the past through a borrowing authority 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other measures guarantee that parliament will receive 
information annually on the government's debt management programs 
and plans which speaks to the transparency and openness of the 
management of our debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, some of the other 
measures of Bill C-71 have to do with amending the basic pension 
formula in the public service, Canadian forces and RCMP 
superannuation acts which calculate benefits on a five year 
rather than the current six year average salary.  That is an 
improvement to the existing plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also included in the bill are provisions for amending the Patent 
Act to clarify the Minister of Health's authority to pay the 
provinces moneys collected by the Patented Medicine Prices Review 
Board from excessive pricing of products by patented 
manufacturers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also included in the bill is a measure clarifying the scope of 
federal loan guarantees under the Agricultural Marketing Programs 
Act to financial institutions that fund advance payments to our 
agricultural producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the bill also includes a measure that will provide the 
Minister of Finance with the authority to undertake financial 
operations necessary to meet Canada's commitments under the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget omnibus bill establishes important foundation 
blocks for the future in terms of new funding for our public 
health care system.  It benefits children and families in need 
and implements measures that improve the operations of 
government, all while sustaining our commitment to financial 
discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally and overall it is important to note the 1999 budget 
extends the government's plan to build a strong economy and a 
secure society.  It is an approach that we as a government have 
consistently followed, an approach which is designed to advance 
living standards of Canadians.  It is a strategy that we have 
applied through each of the government's six budgets to date.  We 
essentially take action on three fronts: maintaining sound 
economic and financial management; investing in key economic and 
social priorities; and providing tax relief and improving tax 
fairness.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, certainly strong economic growth and reduced debt burden 
better enable the government to provide tax relief and make key 
investments.  The 1999 budget again confirms that the era of 
deficit financing is over.  We will continue to deliver balanced 
budgets or better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, our investments in health care and research and 
innovation and other key areas improve Canadians' ability to work 
and their quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third pillar of our strategy tax relief is very clear.  In 
essence the 1999 budget delivers tax reductions of $16.5 billion 
with the 1998 budget collectively.  When we include the reduction 
in unemployment insurance that number escalates to $17.3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that our approach will be one of balance 
and it will remain balanced.  We have demonstrated a three front 
strategy over the last number of budgets.  We will continue with 
that approach.  The government has eliminated the deficit faster 
than anyone expected.  We have seen the results of our financial 
management in low inflation, low interest rates, the increase in 
job creation and the ongoing economic activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note as well that the work of the government 
in this area is still not complete.  We still must continue to 
provide improvements to the quality of life and the standard of 
living of Canadians.  We need to continue to provide tax relief. 
We need to continue to provide opportunities for Canadians to 
work and enjoy the quality of life they are accustomed to in this 
great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that many benefits will result from Bill C-71.  I 
urge my hon. colleagues to pass this legislation without delay. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise and debate Bill C-71. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is part of what the government introduced in the 
budget in February.  It gives us a good indication of where the 
government's head is at when it comes to some of the big issues 
that confront the country today in terms of the economy and those 
sorts of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about one of the big current debates in the 
country.  In fact it is a debate that the government helped 
initiate, mainly the industry minister.  It has to do with the 
issue of productivity.  Most people who follow this issue closely 
would acknowledge that improving the productivity of the nation 
is critical if we are going to give Canadians an improved 
standard of living, something that we have enjoyed almost every 
generation since Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I pose to the government is does this budget really 
improve the nation's productivity?  Does it take a step in the 
right direction in terms of making the country more productive? 
Does it at least help us reach our potential when it comes to 
being more productive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On close analysis this bill does not come anywhere near doing 
that.  I do not think it makes Canada more productive.  I do not 
think it helps us improve our standard of living.  I do not think 
it helps us improve our health care anywhere near the degree that 
Canadians are expecting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the finance committee discussions are being held on the issue 
of productivity.  Yesterday we had several people before the 
committee, some economists, some from banks, insurance companies 
and the conference board. There were people representing 
particular interests such as the education sector, the biotech 
sector, the high tech sector, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All have acknowledged that we have to improve our productivity 
if we want to improve our standard of living.  We are far behind 
our major trading partner, the United States, in terms of our 
productivity.  There is some debate as to whether or not that gap 
is getting worse, but everyone acknowledges that for the last 10 
years we have been substantially behind the United States. The 
consensus yesterday was that the gap would be about 20% behind. 
When we have a gap that big, it means that our standard of living 
is also that much further behind that of the United States. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people ask why compare ourselves to the United States, the 
Americans are bad and that kind of thing.  It is important to 
look back and remember that Canada used to have a standard of 
living that was actually superior to that of the United States. 
We had a standard of living where we were their economic betters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is wrong for us to settle to be the poor cousins of the 
United States.  We deserve to have a standard of living that is 
as good or better than theirs.  It is something that my parents 
grew up with and people became accustomed to over a long period 
of time.  Sadly we seem to have fallen behind the Americans now 
and I think it is time to reclaim our rightful place as their 
economic equals at the very least, if not their betters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is how do we improve our productivity?  How do we 
get to become a more productive nation?  This is something we put 
to the experts who were assembled around the table. While there 
was not necessarily a consensus on what we should do, there was 
some agreement on what the key factors are for improving 
productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among them is a good education system. In Canada people would 
have to acknowledge that we do have a good education system but 
certainly it could be improved. It is also a fact that we spend 
more on education than almost any other country in the world.  We 
do put a lot of money into it. I do not think it necessarily 
needs more money but it probably could be improved in various 
ways, shapes and forms.  It is important to point out that most 
of that responsibility falls on the provinces because education 
belongs to them according to the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some agreement that we have to put money into 
infrastructure in Canada.  That makes sense to me.  Of course 
most of that responsibility does fall on the provincial 
governments, even though it is interesting to note that the 
federal government does take about $3.8 billion a year from 
consumers through gas taxes and fuel taxes of various kinds. Most 
people would say it would make sense to put that back into 
highways and that kind of thing, but the federal government only 
puts a few hundred million dollars of that $3.8 billion back into 
highways.  The government is probably not doing the job it could 
be doing to improve infrastructure in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that over the last generation or so the size 
of government grew dramatically and money did not go into one of 
the most important things for improving our overall productivity 
which is infrastructure.  It went into all kinds of soft 
programs, such as social programs, which are well and fine but 
they do not necessarily improve our productivity as a nation, 
something the government claims to be very concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that improves productivity, and I know there 
is a consensus on this, is a country that does not burden the 
people who create the wealth with all kinds of rules and 
regulations.  There has been some progress made in that way over 
the last many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have entered into free trade agreements which have helped 
improve the flow of goods and services between Canada and the 
United States and Canada and other countries, as we now trade 
freely with several countries, more or less.  There are always 
trade disputes but basically that was one of the other factors 
which improves our ability to trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly we still have all kinds of internal trade barriers in 
Canada between provinces.  Although the federal government 
promised it would deal with this, and this was something the 
industry minister said he would address a long time ago, frankly 
the federal government has done very little to improve the state 
of trade within Canada.  We still have many internal trade 
barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a tremendous amount of regulation in Canada.  I 
remember one day phoning the Library of Parliament.  When I asked 
them to tell me how many federal regulations are on the books in 
Canada today, they basically laughed at me.  Every year we 
produce hundreds of regulations.  It makes it extraordinarily 
difficult for business people to do what they do best which is 
produce wealth, prosperity and jobs for people when they have to 
sit down and fill out forms and obey regulations that someone 
produced 50 years ago that in many cases probably are not 
applicable any more.  Sadly we still have to contend with that. 
This government has not done a good job of eliminating burdensome 
regulation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are probably other factors as well that I have not 
mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally we come to an issue that the Reform Party has pushed for 
as well as other people who are very concerned with the state of 
the Canadian economy, which is simply that we have an 
extraordinarily high tax burden in Canada today, and that does 
hurt our productivity.  It hurts it in a number of ways.  This 
was an issue that was debated a bit yesterday as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, when we have taxes that are as high as they are in Canada 
it causes many people, who in many cases are very skilled and 
have great talents, to go elsewhere to pursue their careers.  We 
see this all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People on the government side are saying there really is not a 
brain drain, that it is not a problem because we are bringing in 
as many people as we are losing and they are highly educated 
people.  I do not buy that for a second.  Yesterday we had all 
kinds of people appear before us.  They told us they were in the 
high tech field and that they know what is happening.  They said 
they are losing people from their companies who go to the United 
States because there are more jobs, they pay better, they tax 
them more lightly and they can purchase more with the money they 
earn because their dollar is more valuable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear that over and over again.  We hear it from companies 
like Nortel.  I would argue that Nortel is the leading company in 
Canada.  It employs 76,000 people, many of whom are in Canada. 
It is a real world leader in all kinds of high tech areas.  It is 
involved in things like telephone switching, and now the 
Internet.  It is doing wonderful things.  It employs tens of 
thousands of people who are given a chance to have wonderful 
careers with wonderful salaries.  Officials of Nortel are now 
saying to the government that it must start to cut taxes because 
if it does not they ultimately may have to follow all those 
employees they have lost to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not often that a leader of business will stand in front of 
the government and say that its policies are wrong.  It takes 
policies that are so wrong-headed that they are having a real 
material affect on the bottom line of those companies.  For 
obvious reasons these companies do not want to alienate 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It speaks volumes when a company like Nortel speaks up. 
However, it is not just Nortel.  My goodness, we had Mr. 
Desmarais speaking out.  He has very close connections with the 
Prime Minister.  We had Mr. Pattison speaking out.  These are 
captains of industry in Canada who are saying “If you continue 
to tax us this heavily we are going to have to seek opportunities 
elsewhere in the world and we will no longer be able to continue 
with the same level of investment in Canada that we have in the 
past”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not me speaking.  In many cases it is people who have 
close ties with the government who are speaking out, saying 
“This must come to an end because we are driving some of our 
best and brightest out of Canada”.  That is the first point I 
want to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard yesterday from someone who is involved in the 
biotech field.  That gentleman told us that it is not just a 
question of salaries, but because there is so much more economic 
activity going on in the United States and its economy is 
booming, it is able to offer this gentleman, a brilliant 
scientist, a geneticist, an extraordinarily interesting job. That 
is what motivates a lot of these people.  It is not just the 
money, it is the jobs as well.  He had been offered an 
opportunity to head up a $15 million research project in the 
United States.  He did not tell us whether he was seriously 
considering it, but the very fact that companies are coming to 
Canada and making these offers to some of our people should 
concern us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another reason that has to do with high taxes which is 
causing people to go to the United States.  When there are lower 
taxes, as there are in the United States, there is more economic 
activity because there is more money in people's pockets.  There 
is more wealth being created.  They are able to provide more 
money for all of these wonderful research projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall recently an article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that 
talked about a biotech firm in Quebec that was simply unable to 
attract senior researchers to the company because they were going 
instead to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recently had people from the universities appear before the 
committee who said that their problem was not that they could not 
find people, it was that they had lost their senior people to the 
United States.  It is usually the United States, but not 
exclusively.  They were having to fill those positions with very 
junior people.  Then the cycle continues.  Once those people get 
some experience, many of them head off to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extraordinarily serious problem and it obviously 
impacts our productivity.  When we lose all of these highly 
skilled people it means they are not producing wealth and jobs 
for Canadians.  That ultimately means, of course, that our 
standard of living falls.  As I pointed out earlier, in Canada we 
are accustomed to seeing our standard of living actually double 
every generation, but that is not happening now.  Our standard of 
living is much lower than it used to be relative to our major 
trading partner, the United States.  We have fallen far behind. 
There is a consensus on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I must point out that even the Minister of Industry has 
made an issue of this.  He has suggested that our standard of 
living has fallen below that of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. 
He gave a speech on this in February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  My hon. friend across the way is 
piping up.  I am sure he is a little embarrassed about that.  It 
was his industry minister who did it.  If he wants to take 
someone to task he should take his own industry minister to task. 
I am simply pointing this out.  Obviously, whether or not those 
are accurate facts, there is a serious problem today.  If they 
were not accurate, I just do not know why the industry minister 
would be telling Canadians that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have established that there is a problem and that 
high taxes are a big part of the problem, what do we do about it? 
What did the government do in Bill C-71?  It talked about 
lowering taxes.  What did it do in the budget overall?  It talked 
about lowering taxes.  The government talks about $16 billion in 
tax relief over three years.  What it does not talk about is that 
while it is reducing taxes marginally on the one hand, it has 
already set in motion tax increases on the other hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business appeared before 
the committee the other day, saying that what the government does 
not say is that because of bracket creep, which is the inflation 
tax the previous government basically set in motion, every year 
we see the impact of those tax cuts the government was bragging 
about eroded to the point where after three years there is no tax 
relief at all according to the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government also did not say was that a couple of years 
ago when it set in motion the huge increases to Canada pension 
plan premiums it did not calculate them as tax increases.  It 
said it was a rise in premiums.  However, Canadians have to pay 
those premiums.  They do not have a choice.  That is a payroll 
tax.  By the way, they are not getting any more pension for those 
huge increases in payroll taxes.  In fact, they are getting a 
slightly smaller pension as a result of the changes the 
government made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, the point is that the tax burden continues to grow.  If 
hon. members opposite doubt what I am saying, I would refer them 
to something in the 1996 budget documents, which is that the real 
way to measure whether the tax burden of a country is going up is 
to look at the tax level to GDP.  Back then it was about 14%. 
Now it is up to 17%.  That is at the federal level and this is 
the government's own measurement that we are talking about. 
Taxes are ramping up.  That is the objective fact.  It is not our 
data; it is the government's data.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can forget about what the government tells us about taxes 
going down.  The true fact is that taxes are going up and the 
government should be straight with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax relief is extraordinarily important for getting our economy 
moving again at a rate where it will produce the types of jobs we 
once took for granted.  Some people doubt that tax relief 
actually helps productivity, but there are a couple of ways it 
does that.  I mentioned brain drain a minute ago.  If it will 
stem brain drain it will help our productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I want to make came up again at the finance 
committee yesterday.  Another way that lowering taxes will help 
productivity over the long run is that it will help capital 
formation.  There are a couple of ways it does that.  If we lower 
income taxes overall there will be more money in people's 
pockets.  If we lower capital gains taxes we suddenly free up all 
that locked in capital which people are afraid to cash in.  They 
know there will be a huge tax bill if they do that because of the 
high capital gains taxes we have in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between cutting personal income taxes and lowering capital gains 
we free up a lot of capital that is currently locked into 
investments that otherwise would not be locked in.  There would 
be a better return on investment.  Ultimately a pool of capital 
would be formed which would allow individual workers to produce 
more.  That is the rough definition of what improving 
productivity means.  When we improve productivity the standard of 
living for Canadians goes up.  We need to start lowering taxes 
for that reason as well.  Those pools of capital will be formed 
and then all of a sudden they will be used to start new 
businesses of various kinds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence is very clear.  In the United States when capital 
gains taxes and income taxes were cut we saw a boost in revenues. 
The reason for that is just what I pointed out a minute ago; all 
of that potential was unlocked and all of that money all of a 
sudden came forward.  Some of it was taxed, but people were happy 
to have it taxed because it was taxed at a lower rate and they 
were able to use the bulk of it to create jobs by starting new 
businesses and that kind of thing. Ultimately everybody was 
better off.  The government even brought in more revenue.  How 
can that be a bad thing?  It is a very good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the chairman of the finance committee pointed out yesterday: 
Does everyone agree that we have to produce more wealth before we 
can redistribute the wealth?  That is a good point.  I am glad my 
Liberal colleague from Toronto made that point.  Certainly 
members on this side agree with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the end of the first half of what I want to 
say.  In essence, I do not believe that Bill C-71 brings about 
the productivity benefits that many of us believe we have to have 
in Canada.  It simply does not lower taxes enough.  It does not 
deal with things like regulation.  It does not lighten the burden 
for Canadians.  It does not unlock all that wealth that we could 
be using to produce jobs and give people the personal financial 
security that so many people crave today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many families are absolutely stressed out because both parents 
have to work, and not because they want to.  They have to because 
Canadians are taxed so heavily today.  This government really 
does punish people for the great crime of trying to make a 
living. That is absolutely wrong.  We need to see some major tax 
relief in Canada, not when it suits the government but today.  If 
we do not deliver it today we lose all kinds of opportunities 
every day.  We lose all kinds of opportunities for investment, 
more jobs and wealth that will benefit everybody.  We need to 
have that.  That is one big reason that I oppose Bill C-71. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the other major aspect of Bill C-71, the 
part of the bill that addresses the issue of health care. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT10"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT10"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1045

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-71 is part of the budget that came down in February when 
the government put back some of the money that it originally took 
out of health care starting in 1995.  Basically for every $2 it 
took out it put about $1 back in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By anyone's definition that is a shell game.  It is not a 
question of improving health care.  It devastated health care on 
the one hand.  Then it put a band-aid on it with the other hand 
and wants to be patted on the back for it.  As somebody once put 
it, it has gone out and started a huge fire.  Then it tries to 
put it out and wants credit for saving everyone because it put 
out the fire.  That is a ridiculous approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to acknowledge that some money has to go back into 
health care.  We also have to point out that this is only a 
stopgap.  We have to find other ways to make health care more 
effective in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues across the way like to talk about how much more 
superior Canada's health care system is to that in the United 
States.  It is superior in many ways.  I agree with that. 
However, we need to assure Canadians that just because we do not 
necessarily support the health care system as it is today the 
American system is not the only other option.  I do not want the 
American system.  There are many things about the American system 
that are horrible.  I do not like a lot of what the American 
system is about.  That does not mean that we cannot improve the 
Canadian system.  There are many things wrong with the Canadian 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard my colleagues across the way talk for five years about 
how wonderful it is that we all have equal access to the health 
care system in Canada.  More or less that is true, but we do not 
have equal access to health care.  We might have equal access to 
the system.  We have equal access to a waiting line. In Canada 
today over 200,000 people are on waiting lists to get surgery. 
That is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from personal experience, as I am sure colleagues on both 
sides of the House know, that family members are sometimes 
stricken with a serious illness and end up in the hospital.  It 
could be because of an accident or for some other reason.  Very 
often they cannot get the treatment when they need it.  I 
personally have had family members who had to wait seven or eight 
weeks with extraordinarily serious illnesses.  That is wrong. 
When the health care system denies people health care when they 
need it, it is time to take off the blinders and say that we have 
to make some fundamental changes to health care.  It is not 
serving the public well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we are in a situation where relative to what the 
future holds the problem is fairly easy to solve.  Down the road 
as the baby boom generation ages and is inflicted with more and 
more sickness and ill health that come with old age, we will be 
in a situation where the health care system, as presently 
constituted, will be under unbelievable pressure.   We will see 
the great bulk of the population needing to get health care 
treatment and the little remnant that is left, the people still 
in the workforce, having to pay for it.  The government has not 
done anything to prepare for the coming crunch in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to quit cranking up the rhetoric about American style 
health care and deal seriously with the issues.  There are ways 
to do it.  The first thing we have to do is find ways to 
accommodate some flexibility for the provinces in dealing with 
this issue. They fund the great majority of health care in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, while I am talking about this point, I should point 
out that friends across the way will often say that American 
health care is a private system and in Canada it is a public 
system.  That is baloney.  First, the United States funds 
publicly about 47% of its health care.  In Canada our public 
funding is 69%.  We both have substantial public investments but 
we also have big private components to our health care. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should lay that on the table and make sure people are 
clear about it.  Let us not have a phony debate about not having 
any private health care in Canada at all because we do, and let 
us not pretend that they do not have in the United States because 
it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the provinces, we know for instance in Alberta 
that in the past the provincial government has tried to find some 
ways to take the pressure off the waiting lists for health care. 
It did that by allowing a public-private system for eye surgery, 
for instance.  In doing so many people were able to go to the 
Gimble eye clinic and get eye surgery.  They did not have to wait 
for weeks and weeks or months for a service that they wanted and 
in some cases really needed.  At the same time it opened up a 
spot on the public system so that someone else could move up and 
get surgery faster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government got wind of that it said it could 
not have it; it just made too much sense.  It punished the 
Government of Alberta by cutting back the transfers to Alberta. 
That was a huge mistake.  It sent a message to all the provinces 
that the federal government would not allow them to be creative 
and find ways to help their citizens, or would not deal with the 
upcoming health care crunch by giving them some flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government plays the phony game of Canada having 
public health care and that is all it has.  As I pointed out, 
about a third of our system is already privately funded and has 
not meant the disintegration of health care.  To the contrary, it 
has meant that we have had some money go back into the system so 
that we can give people health care when they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing I can think of that is worse than having to pay 
for health care out of our own pockets is not having health care 
when we need it.  Unfortunately we just do not get it in the 
health care system in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  What about Brazil?  Maybe we want to go 
to the Brazil system next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  My friend across the way is yelling at 
me.  If he believes so strongly in the public health care system, 
why did the Liberals take $21 billion out of it in 1995?  That is 
what I ask him.  If they believe it is so wonderful, why did they 
take that $21 billion out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although my friend across the way can criticize me for what I am 
saying, I think he should look at his own actions and question 
whether they made sense, if he really believes in public funding 
of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that Bill C-71 has failed Canadians in a 
couple of important ways.  I do not think it deals with the issue 
of improving our standard of living by giving us the tools to be 
more productive.  We on this side would do that by cutting taxes. 
We have laid out a plan for tax relief which amounts to $2,000 
for the average family of four.  That is just a beginning.  We 
would also dramatically reduce our debt and at the same time 
ensure that we improve our health care in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I want to make is that the government has not 
addressed the health care issue.  It has thrown some money at 
health care but basically has said to the provinces that it will 
not let them be creative and reform the system in a way that 
helps their people in their provinces.  The provinces are 
answerable to the public according to the Constitution for health 
care.  The federal government is saying it does not care how many 
people are on waiting lists for surgery.  It will do it its way 
and relegate people to waiting in the hallways of hospitals.  I 
think that is despicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my friends across the way to adopt a new approach, an 
approach that is a bit more open minded to some of the things 
that have worked not only in the past in Canada but also in other 
countries around the world.  If the Liberals did that, not only 
would they win the support of this party but they would also 
overwhelmingly win the support of hard pressed Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak at third reading of Bill C-71. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by focusing on one particularly unpleasant 
aspect of this bill, the one that changes the rules of the game. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is changing the rules of the game in the 
way funds are allocated to the provinces to fund social 
assistance, higher education and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget, without warning—and this particular provision is 
in Bill C-71—the Minister of Finance decided that, in contrast to 
past procedures, the most important criterion for the allocation 
of funds for social assistance, higher education and health 
would no longer be the provinces' needs but their population, 
over a two year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That changes the picture; that changes things. When it comes to 
the funds allocated to social assistance to help the most 
disadvantaged, the most important criterion should not just be 
the provinces' population, but their needs as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If in one region of Canada, in one province that has urgent 
needs because there is a higher incidence of poverty, the logic 
of social policy is to give to those in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance decided unilaterally, without talking to 
anyone, especially not to the government of Quebec, that 
henceforth all the money would be allocated according to 
population.  As a result, Canada's most populous province, 
Ontario, will get about 64% of the funds. 
As early as this year, Ontario will be the big winner regarding 
the Canada social transfer since, all of a sudden, population 
becomes the sole criterion for the allocation of funds, even in 
the case of social assistance, and that province has the largest 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that, over the next five years, under this new 
formula, Ontario will get about $5 billion out of the $11.5 
billion in new money from the federal government. By comparison, 
Quebec will get $900 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these unilateral arrangements made by the Minister of 
Finance, Quebec will suffer an annual shortfall of at least $350 
million over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate that we had at report stage in this House, 
some Liberal members said “There is no pleasing you. You are not 
happy because we are treating all Canadians across the country 
equally. They are all on an equal footing”. That is not the 
issue. It is important to stress this again, because the members 
opposite have a very hard time grasping it. Perhaps this is due 
to a lack of interest in the most disadvantaged across Canada, a 
lack of sensitivity or a lack of compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand that the funds provided for a 
social policy must be allocated to those who need them. With 
this new criterion solely based of population, we can no longer 
talk about a social policy but, rather, about a policy of equal 
redistribution of funds across Canada, on the sole basis of 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot claim to have a Canadian social transfer, 
a social policy, when this policy no longer targets low-income 
households. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might say that, if there are more Quebecers who are 
unemployed or on welfare, Quebec's policies should be a little 
more proactive and contribute to economic growth and job 
creation.  I agree.  Clearly, Quebec has to do more.  It must 
innovate, take up the challenge of the new economy and grab the 
bull by the horns, as it were, in order to reduce our level of 
unemployment and steadily eliminate pockets of poverty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the federal government must do its part as well.  Quebecers 
are paying approximately $31 billion in taxes every year to the 
federal government.  It would perhaps be a good idea for the 
Liberal MPs from Quebec to one day do their job properly.  I 
will explain what I mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is still not receiving its fair share.  We sound like a 
broken record.  A journalist once told me we were playing the 
same old tape.  Quebec is not receiving its fair share.  If 
Quebec were to receive its share of federal government spending, 
we would not need to point this out.  The situation has not 
changed in 30 years.  The federal government is systematically 
discriminating against Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it did, perhaps Quebec would not have 30% of all the welfare 
recipients in Canada.  Perhaps Quebec would not have, year in 
and year out, a two or three percentage point difference in its 
unemployment rate compared to the Canadian average, never mind 
its position compared to Ontario.  Perhaps the Canada social 
transfer would never have been necessary, since Quebec would 
have had fewer people unemployed or on welfare, but that is not 
how it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some illustrations, because this is so important. 
We do seem to be repeating ourselves, but I will do so ad 
nauseam, until the federal government shows some justice toward 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking the example of goods and services expenditures, Quebec 
has 25% of the Canadian population but, for the past 25 years, 
federal goods and services expenditures in Quebec have been far 
lower than its demographic weight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For goods and services alone, the government's day to day 
spending, last year the federal government spent 20% in Quebec. 
That is 4 percentage points short.  We have 24% of the 
population, and the federal government purchases goods and 
services from Quebec companies which account for only 20% of its 
total expenditures in this field.  That difference means jobs, 
and poverty as well.  There would be less poverty if that figure 
were raised from 20% to 24%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at federal government capital investments, again Quebec 
is not being treated fairly.  Quebec receives 19% of the federal 
government's capital and general investments, while its 
population is 24% of the total.  Once again, that difference 
means jobs, construction jobs. 
It would also mean less poverty, if we increased the percentage 
of federal capital investments from 19% to 24%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal subsidies to businesses shrink every year as well.  Only 
18% of federal funding to Canadian business goes to businesses 
in Quebec.  It is easy to say that Quebec businesses have a low 
productivity record.  The fact of the matter is that the federal 
government siphons off $31 billion worth of our taxes annually 
in Quebec.  It does not give us our fair share, which is about a 
quarter of the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal laboratories in Quebec receive only 16% of all 
capital spending on federal labs.  Unless things have changed in 
the past few minutes, we still have 24% of the population and 
get only 16% of federal funds for federal government labs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For research and development, the figure is generally 14% 
compared to 24%, although R and D is everything and will make 
our businesses competitive in the future.  R and D is what makes

</I></B></P><P align=left>No one can tell me that this does not have an impact. It has a 
definite impact on the relative competitiveness of Quebec and 
Ontario. Ontario gets help from the federal government, while 
Quebec gets neglect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In science and technology, Quebec gets 13% of the federal jobs. 
The number one province in that respect is Ontario. For all the 
expenditure items I mentioned earlier, the winner is Ontario 
with 45% to 50% of all the federal funds allocated for goods and 
services, investments and general capital expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several years now we have been doing an annual tally of what 
readjusting federal spending could mean in terms of job 
creation, if it were based on Quebec's demographic weight. Do 
members know how many jobs this means per year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, tomorrow morning, the federal government decided to do 
justice to Quebec—it would be even better if Quebecers decided 
to achieve independence and keep all of the $31 billion they 
send every year to the federal government—and invested in 
Quebec a fair share of research and development, goods and 
services and so on, there would be between 30,000 and 42,000 
more jobs on the Quebec labour market. This is a lot of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> I hear a member from Ontario. 
I would rather not reply. When you have it all and you start 
criticizing those who are not so lucky, it is not very nice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With 30,000 to 42,000 more jobs, do members know by how much we 
could lower the unemployment rate in Quebec? It would drop by 
1.2 points. This means that instead of an annual difference of 
two to three percentage points for the past 25 years, there 
would have been a difference of one to two points between the 
unemployment rates in Quebec and Ontario, or the average 
unemployment rate in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reducing the unemployment rate by more than one percentage point 
takes energy, originality, economic policies and relatively good 
conditions for a fair length of time. Simply restoring the 
criterion of demographic weight, i.e. 24% in goods and services 
procurement, research and development spending, federal 
laboratories, and their staff as well, and all the salaries this 
research and development staff would receive within Quebec, 
would reduce the unemployment rate by one percentage point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the latest unemployment figures, this would mean the 
rate would be 7.8% instead of the current 8.8%. 
That is still high, but simply by treating Quebec fairly and 
adjusting payments and procurement of goods and services, the 
federal government could reduce unemployment by one percentage 
point, create the 30,000 to 42,000 jobs Quebecers are waiting 
for and are entitled to but are being denied.  They are being 
denied a share of the taxes they pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $31 billion in taxes they pay the federal government adds up 
over time.  And it is time the federal government assumed its 
responsibilities and started treating Quebec fairly.  We are not 
asking for more than our share.  We are asking for 24% of 
spending, our demographic weight in terms of the total 
population of Canada.  There are 30,000 to 42,000 jobs riding on 
the good will of the federal government and fair treatment for 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not surprisingly, people say they are tired of hearing 
Quebecers' same old refrain about federal transfer payments ad 
nauseam.  This is not something dreamt up by sovereignists or 
the Bloc Quebecois.  The Bloc Quebecois was formed in June 1991. 
This situation has been going on for 25 years.  Federalists in 
Quebec City, such as Mr. Bourassa, have denounced this 
situation, based on federal government figures.

They are federal figures from Statistics Canada.  If hon. 
members look in the Statistics Canada catalogues under federal 
government expenditures on goods and services, by province, and 
under capital expenditures, they will find them.  They are not 
made up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a bone to pick with the members of the Liberal Party from 
Quebec, across the way. 
It seems to me that the first thing to do, as Quebecers, would 
have been to demand justice of the Minister of Finance or the 
President of Treasury Board, as far as federal transfers and 
general expenditures are concerned.  They have not done so. 
They prefer to laugh in our faces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time the question of inequality of federal government 
expenditures and investments in Quebec is raised here in the 
House, I see Liberals from Quebec over there laughing, finding 
it funny.  They find it funny that we are, year after year, 
shortchanged to the tune of 30,000 to 42,000 jobs.  They find 
that funny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they receive people in their riding offices who have lost 
their jobs, mothers or fathers in their forties, or in their

the state of the federal public finances makes it impossible. 
We will work very hard at it, though”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do nothing of the kind.  They are a bunch of do-nothings. 
The best proof of this is that, in the last budget brought down

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario ministers got something from the Minister of

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was saying before this 
interruption, there are even members from Quebec in the Liberal 
Party of Canada who, following the budget of the Minister of 
Finance, travelled around Quebec to explain that Quebecers got 
the largest part of the budget, that they should be happy 
because equalization payments, over three years, would give us 
$1 billion.  They were supposed to be happy as well because all 
the jobs were going to Ontario and because the formula for 
calculating the funds allocated under the Canada social transfer 
had been changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes people who have sold out and who are intellectually 
dishonest to go around Quebec saying that it had won it all in 
the budget, when there were three winners in this budget: 
Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia.  These three provinces 
were the strongest supporters of the social union framework 
agreement.  The Minister of Finance in a way bought Mike Harris 
and company with the fine gift they got in the allocation of the 
Canada social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time the minister has bought the silence 
and co-operation of the provincial premiers at a cost of hundreds 
of millions of dollars.  Members may remember when there was the 
harmonization of the GST with the provincial sales taxes in the 
maritimes. 
The federal government paid the maritimes almost $900 million to 
keep quiet and let it have its way.  That is how the Minister of 
Finance and this government operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec should be concerned.  Each year it pays taxes to the 
federal government and the members opposite are not even 
fair-minded enough to see that Quebec gets a demographic share of 
the taxes it pays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec should also be concerned when it hears that 30,000 to 
42,000 jobs will not be created in Quebec as a result. 
It should be concerned when it knows that, if the federal 
government were to return to a more equitable allocation of 
federal funding for goods and services procurement, for research 
and development, and Quebecers employed by the federal 
government in federal laboratories, Quebec's unemployment rate 
would drop by more than a percentage point. Better yet, these 
investments would have all sorts of direct and indirect effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Minister of Human Resources Development, who is 
completely lacking in compassion for the less fortunate, 
shamelessly tightened up the EI rules a few years ago, Quebec's 
welfare rolls have jumped by almost 200,000 and the Government 
of Quebec has picked up most of the tab.  If federal transfer 
payments were to return to former levels, the number of people 
living on welfare would probably drop as well.  This should also 
concern Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should be a major issue, particularly for the Quebec 
members of the Liberal Party of Canada, who always laugh at or 
make fun of figures that, believe it or not, are provided by 
Statistics Canada and the federal government, and that clearly 
show—the data is not from us, we simply refer to it—the 
injustice done to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also things that are not included in this bill. Ever 
since the Liberal government was first elected, in 1993, we have 
been asking for a comprehensive reform of the federal tax 
system, which has not undergone any substantial review since the 
late sixties, with the Carter commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pointed out, among other things, some blatant injustices in 
the personal income tax system. 
Along with the Reform Party, we recently condemned a few of 
these injustices regarding double or single income families. But 
there are others. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one, for instance, that has existed since 1986. I am 
referring to the fact that the tax structure, including tax 
credits, exemptions, tax brackets and income categories, is not 
fully indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is extremely costly to taxpayers and will continue to be 
until full indexation, which was eliminated in 1986, is not 
restored. Under the current system, any inflation rate lower 
than 3% is not taken into account by the federal government. The 
tax tables remain unchanged if inflation is lower than 3%. And 
since inflation has been around 1% for the past three years, and 
was between 2% and 3% for seven or eight years before that, 
there has hardly been any indexation since 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is profitable for the federal government, a kind of hidden 
tax.  Without the government having to lift a finger, every year 
the lack of indexation means we pay more taxes to the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right back in its first year of application, in 1986, this 
measure brought $500 million into the coffers of the federal 
government.  If we factor in economic growth, we probably get up 
to $600 or $700 million per year that do not remain in the 
taxpayers' pockets. And then we are surprised to see that the 
taxpayers are getting poorer in recent years, compared to 
previous generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year, their assets go down.  So does their disposable 
income. Measures like these are what is impoverishing people. 
But they do not show.  This is why the Minister of Finance does 
not want to do away with this provision. 
All he needs do is saunter about with his hands in his pockets, 
and $500 million, at the very least, drop automatically into his 
coffers, without his having to impose any unpopular measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not small change.  Looking at the cumulative losses of 
disposable income for Quebec and Canadian taxpayers, since 1986 
the average taxpayer would have lost $7,000, in today's dollars. 
Had that amount been invested every year, there would now be 
more than $7,000.  I imagine the taxpayers would have liked to 
have had that much in their pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not equipped to keep the taxation level that high. 
And this is only one example, because there is a whole lot of 
bias in taxation, which means that middle income taxpayers, that 
is, about 70% of Quebec and Canadian taxpayers are paying more 
than they ought to, had the Minister of Finance done his job 
correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He took advantage of the state of the economy.  He did not do 
much.  I have often called him lazy, and I think he is.  Had he 
wanted to, he could have changed the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now he is developing a bit of an interest in taxes.  How long 
has this been going on?  Since all the opposition parties rose 
in the House and said “Enough.  Taxpayers have had it.  The tax 
system must be changed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the government struck a sub-committee to tour Canada. 
It will take a number of months if not a number of years before 
the tax system is reformed, but there is no need to reinvent the 
wheel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an example about the lack of fully indexed tax tables. 
The federal government could have indexed them long ago.  It 
could have also established a parliamentary task force to review 
the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Bloc Quebecois published two analyses, one of personal 
taxes and the other on corporate taxes, our stand-up comic, the 
Minister of Finance, rose and said “Well done, you have done a 
good job.  It contains some interesting proposals”.  He said 
that in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were flattered.  We figured we had not wasted our time. 
The minister seemed serious when he said that these were 
interesting proposals and that he would examine them. He 
congratulated the Bloc Quebecois for its two reports on 
taxation. Since then, what has the minister done? Nothing, 
except to set up a task force, which worked behind closed doors 
for several months and postponed by several months the release 
of its report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon reading that report, one can see why the task force delayed 
its release. It focussed on corporate taxes, not personal taxes. 
Why was the release of the report postponed? Because there was 
not much in it. Moreover, it even contained measures that were 
detrimental to the growth of businesses. It was making the 
burden heavier rather than lighter in the area of corporate tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can understand why the tabling of the Mintz report was 
delayed. There is no trace of that report now. 
My guess is that the Minister of Finance ditched it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how serious this government and its Minister of Finance, 
who wants to become the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, 
are. It sure sounds promising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This attitude is unfortunate, because a lot needs to be done in 
the area of taxation. With our small team, we were able to carry 
out an in-depth review of the tax system, particularly tax 
expenditures. We came to the conclusion that some of these 
expenditures have become obsolete and should be discontinued. 
There are also tax measures that are totally disconnected from 
reality, particularly as regards the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a hundred or so specialists at its disposal, the federal 
government could have done the same thing, and it certainly 
could have implemented these recommendations for fairer taxation 
for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already we can here the Minister of Finance and his faithful 
members telling us that the government is barely out of the 
woods, that it does not have the money, that it must be careful. 
Yes indeed, it must be careful.  In fact, this is a very 
important issue for the Bloc Quebecois.  We do not want the 
Liberals slipping back into their old ways of annual deficits. 
No more deficits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, that was the title of a paper we used last year as part 
of a province-wide consultation in Quebec of real people, asking 
them what should be done with taxpayers' money, what should be 
done with the huge surpluses the Minister of Finance is racking 
up at the expense of everyone but himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No more deficits: in fact, we were the only party to table a 
bill recommending that the deficit be reduced to zero and kept 
there, in other words, that the budget be balanced.  We were the 
only party to table such a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true that the government has no money.  The government 
has money coming out its ears.  It keeps this very quiet, and 
certainly does not put it in writing.  There were still zeros 
all through the Minister of Finance's last budget, and no sign 
of a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fiscal year that has just ended on March 31, 1999, the 
1998-99 fiscal year, the Minister of Finance had a surplus of $15 
billion.  As well, he took $7 billion from the employment 
insurance fund.  That is highway robbery, I repeat highway 
robbery, and it is unacceptable.  It is unacceptable to do the 
same with the pension funds.  There is talk of the President of 
the Treasury Board getting his hands on a $30 billion surplus, 
but that is another story.  The figure for the last fiscal year 
was $15 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the present fiscal year, which runs until March 31, 2000, by 
our predictions the surplus will be $20 billion.  The reaction 
may well be “Oh those predictions, oh those economists”. 
Certainly, economists do have their shortcomings, but they also 
have positive qualities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the good qualities of economists, sometimes, ourselves 
included, is to be cautious. 
Since 1994, every year the Bloc Quebecois and its little team 
have predicted the deficit, as well as the surplus generated by 
the Minister of Finance, we have been no more than 2% or 3% off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a company specializing in predictions in Quebec and in Canada 
had such a result, it would be in great demand.  The average 
margin of error in predictions is between 5% and 10%; ours was 
between 2% and 3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time we put our finger on the true deficit, which the 
Minister of Finance was hiding from us, we were dead on.  Every 
time we started talking surplus, and came up with a ballpark 
figure for that surplus, we were dead on.  So much so that the 
credibility of the Minister of Finance, where figures are 
concerned, is virtually zero, if not below zero, for most of the 
analyses.  This is not something I am inventing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day after the budget is presented, you open the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>, the <I>Toronto Star</I>, <I>La Presse</I>, any one in fact, you listen 
to the analysts on television; when the subject of the Minister 
of Finance's forecasts comes up, it is one big joke.  People 
laugh.  They double over, they twist themselves in knots, they 
roll around on the carpet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet it is not all that funny.  We have become accustomed to 
the Minister of Finance giving us a false picture of Canada's 
tax situation.  Given such a totally false picture, Canadians 
were not aware of the real state of public finances and of the 
options the Minister of Finance and the Liberal government had 
to do things, move, help the most disadvantaged, lower income 
taxes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad thing when the government knowingly presents false 
information, when six months later its figures are proven wrong. 
I remember once, two years ago I think, we had predicted there 
would be a certain level of surplus in February.  The Minister 
of Finance criticized us violently, accusing us of throwing 
figures up in the air.  He made fun of us.  Six months later, 
our exact predictions had come true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad thing to play with people like that, play with 
information, not tell people the truth and lie to their faces. 
It is beneath a minister of finance and a member of parliament. 
This is however what this Minister of Finance has done, half 
baked, since assuming his position.  He literally and 
systematically hides the truth of the figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, if the government had a $15 billion surplus in the last 
fiscal year and now has a $20 billion surplus, it should leave 
the current surplus of $7 billion in the employment insurance 
fund to workers and the unemployed. The government would still 
have $13 billion left to do things with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance could have done many things. As I said 
earlier, he could have done justice to Quebec and restored 
fairness in how the government spends money on goods and 
services, investments and staff in federal laboratories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could have done all that. He could have said “From now on, I 
will no longer use the surplus in the employment insurance fund, 
except to help the unemployed or to lower contributions”. The 
minister could have done all that. But in order to do these 
things, one must be honest, tell the truth and take action based 
on the truth. 
If one's actions are based on lies, one cannot do these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last budget of the Minister of Finance is nothing but a wad 
of lies. All the expenditure and revenue items were cooked, and 
even the auditor general was surprised, since he has repeatedly 
asked the Minister of Finance to stop cooking the books like 
that. There are no longer any reliable figures in the minister's 
budget. There are zeros everywhere, instead of real surpluses of 
between $15 billion and $20 billion. This is terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the minister could have done a lot. He could have done more 
to help children living in poverty. This is the minister's 
favourite theme. Every now and then, he gets up, puts his hand 
on his heart and starts talking about poor children. Child 
poverty has been on the rise since 1993, but he never mentions 
that. 
Since the Liberals have been in power and he has been Minister 
of Finance, child poverty has increased.  People are poorer than 
before, children as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can he rise in the House, put his hand on his heart, and 
talk about child poverty in Canada, knowing what he does?  The 
Minister of Finance knows the figures, he knows how to hide them 
and how to make them say what he wants.  He knows that child 
poverty has increased.  How can he get up with a smile on his 
face and make jokes, then say that his government has done a lot 
for poor children and that it has worked tirelessly, with the 
means at its disposal, to reduce child poverty?  How can he do 
such a thing, knowing all the way that it is not true? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can he do such a thing and, at the same time, help himself 
to $7 billion a year from the EI fund?  How can he say such a 
thing, when less than 40% of unemployed workers qualify for 
benefits under the new EI system?  The other 60% or 70% are 
living in poverty, on welfare perhaps, as are the parents of 
these poor children the Minister of Finance says he wants to 
help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the public were to pay a little more attention to the debates 
in the House of Commons, it would soon be appalled.  It is 
almost sickening to hear things presented like this when we have 
been fed this nonsense for six years, told that everything is 
fine, under control, that the Minister of Finance is working 
hard to put our fiscal house in order, when it is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But he is making everybody else, the unemployed, the 
disadvantaged, those who can no longer draw unemployment, do the 
job. And that is truly shameful.

federal transfers, because then they will be able to work and 
earn their living with dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will continue to work on their behalf, and I 
can assure the House that we will spare no effort in making this 
government listen to reason, because what it is doing no longer 
makes any sense.

<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must say that I am absolutely delighted 
to have the opportunity to stand in the House today to make a few 
comments regarding the budget implementation bill.  Budget 
implementation bills tell us a great deal about a government's 
priorities.  They tell us about a certain value system that is 
reflected in the government and in its budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to categorize my view of this budget and the 
government.  I will use two or three examples to start with. 
Perhaps what we should be doing today is debating whether or not 
the Minister of Finance should be arrested and charged with 
theft.  I think it is commonly assumed that the Minister of 
Finance has stolen billions of dollars from the EI fund in order 
to balance his budget.  I think that is fairly— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys has far more experience 
in this Chamber than I, but we cannot be attributing specific 
motives to specific individuals.  We can do that with respect to 
the government, but not when it concerns a specific minister.  I 
would admonish the hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and 
Highland Valleys in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I accept that admonishment, 
which is probably well placed.  I was going to blame an 
individual, but I suppose we have to blame the collective 
government or the collective cabinet and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that over the last number of years while we have 
heard people applaud the government for balancing its budget and 
reducing the deficit, I think it is fair to say that part of that 
has been on the backs of the people who do not have a job, who 
are expecting some employment insurance benefits to come their 
way because they have lost their job, but in fact they do not 
qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst case scenario concerns the young people of Canada.  In 
the last 48 hours we have been told that only 15% of young people 
who lose their jobs actually qualify for employment insurance. 
The people who have been paying into the system do not qualify. 
So 85% of young people who lose their jobs are SOL.  They are out 
of luck.  They do not collect any benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this is theft.  I am not going to say that an individual 
should be charged.  We cannot put the whole government in jail, 
so we have to assume that there is one person who has to take the 
hit, and we can speculate on who the most appropriate person 
ought to be.  That is one example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak today to this budget implementation bill there is 
another debate going on in one of the committee meetings around 
the pension system for all of the public employees.  Again the 
government is dipping into that particular pot to the tune of 
grabbing $30 billion out of the retirement fund of federal 
employees, members of the RCMP and members of Canada's armed 
forces.  Now the minister is dipping into that to use the money 
for various purposes in terms of the federal treasury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House we have to shake our heads with a 
combination of disgust and perplexity.  What on earth would a 
government be doing dipping into a surplus in the EI fund of 
$25.9 billion and $30 billion in the pension fund? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government tries to give the impression that somehow it has 
done magical things and balanced the budget.  Of course if we 
take money from other people we can balance the budget.  I 
suspect, on a personal basis, that if we held up a bunch of 
people on Sparks Street this afternoon and took all of their 
money, we could say that we balanced our budgets as well.  We 
could pay off our credit cards and our mortgages through robbery 
because we held up people and stole their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that people might be thinking this sounds far-fetched, 
but it is the truth.  Whether this is technically theft I do not 
know.  I suppose lawyers could argue this for some weeks. 
However, it seems to me, as an average citizen, that when we dip 
into places where we should not be dipping and take money that we 
are not supposed to be taking, that is a form of theft.  That is 
the one point I want to start off with.  This tells us a bit 
about where the government seems to be going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that the last budget was sort of a 
wait and see budget for most folks.  The millionaires in Canada 
do not have to wait and see. They got a nice tax break.  I 
calculate that for one million dollars they would save about 
$8,000 in income tax.  That is not much for a millionaire, but 
$8,000 is $8,000.  They could go out and put a down payment on a 
nice car or something.  However, did mothers or fathers who are 
raising children on social assistance get anything in this budget 
in terms of tax breaks?  No, there was nothing for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government that says it should give a tax break to a 
multimillionaire, but it should not give a tax break to mothers 
and fathers who are raising children on social assistance.  There 
is something wrong with this picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on to talk about a number of points.  Let me make my 
case and I will tell members in a second where I am taking them. 
There is a very clear school of economics at work.  First, should 
those people on waiting lists in our hospitals and those waiting 
for a major increase in support for hospital care across the 
country be cheerleading this budget?  The short answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it is going to restore funding to health 
care.  To my Liberal funds opposite I say that is true.  After a 
number of years it hopes it will have restored the level of 
funding to health care up to where it was in 1995.  We are almost 
at the year 2000.  It is saying that if we wait a bit longer the 
funds will eventually be up to 1995 levels.  Is it a real 
commitment to health care and medicare that we have seen over the 
last number of years?  The answer is clearly no.  This is a bit 
of a shell game.  The impression is that the federal government 
is playing its role once again, when in fact it is not.  It is 
playing a very minor role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about all those Canadians who are looking for work?  Did 
they see initiatives in this budget that will give them some 
encouragement?  Again, I regrettably have to say that the answer 
is, by and large, no.  Is there anything in this budget that will 
give some hope that the future is going to be better for those 
who are suffering hard economic times in the forestry sector, the 
fisheries, agriculture, mining; the resource sectors that 
essentially built this country?  Regretfully, the answer is no. 
There is nothing in this budget to give those folks hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the homeless people?  What about the people who are 
struggling to get their family into a decent home?  We all 
appreciate the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of 
people today who cannot afford decent accommodation.  A lot of 
young people who are starting out in their careers cannot afford 
to buy a house, a condominium, a townhouse or anything.  They 
have to rent because they simply cannot afford it.  The housing 
market is priced out of their limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past we have seen federal governments, and I will give 
them full credit, say they would do something about the housing 
crisis.  They did.  Those governments introduced various programs 
and made various tax changes to encourage more rental 
accommodation, more co-operative housing and a whole number of 
programs that would enable ordinary working men and women to get 
into a decent house.  Was there anything mentioned in this budget 
to assist those needing a home?  No, to say nothing about the 
tens of thousands of people who are sleeping on the streets of 
our cities.  If they are homeless or seeking better 
accommodation, or accommodation period, there is nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not even talk about first nations accommodations.  If 
there is a national embarrassment globally it has to be the fact 
that so many of our first nations people are living in absolute 
poverty and in absolutely disgraceful conditions. 
Again, did this budget do anything to assist those individuals in 
any real way?  The answer unfortunately is no. Let us go on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing that unifies Canadians from coast to coast 
to coast of all ages, all cultures, all backgrounds, all economic 
strata, it is the concern about the environment.  We listened 
carefully when the Minister of Finance delivered the budget as to 
what was in it that was going to give some hope to those people 
concerned about the future environment of Canada.  Again there 
was nothing in this budget.  We are supposed to be fulfilling the 
Kyoto protocol.  We have a whole set of programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hold it, I have to be fair to the Minister of Finance.  There 
was something.  He was going to give to the Canadian Federation 
of Municipalities $1.2 million over three years to study ways to 
conserve energy.  Where the hell have we been for the last 10 
years?  We could go down to the parliamentary library in the next 
20 minutes and probably get 50 publications on how to save energy 
and energy costs.  It is not as though we need to find new 
solutions.  We have all kinds of solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact I remember a vote in the House not long ago 
where we all voted in favour by and large of an energy retrofit 
for all federal buildings to make them more energy cost 
effective.  It makes sense to change the way we insulate our 
federal buildings, to change the way we heat and cool them.  In 
other words, we should become a leader in the community in terms 
of making public buildings more energy efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as though we do not know what to do.  We need some 
cash or we need some incentive.  We need some direction and some 
leadership.  All the Minister of Finance could say was “Let us 
study this for another three years” with the assumption that 
after that presumably we will see some action. The environmental 
issues were abandoned in this budget. Let us go on.  I do not 
want to go on too long because it gets very depressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all Canadians were listening carefully in the last 
election.  I know I certainly was.  I know my constituents were 
wondering whether they should support me because the Liberals 
were saying “Elect Liberals and we are going to introduce a 
national home care policy.  Not only that, we are going to 
introduce a national pharmacare policy, plus a national child 
care policy.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of my constituents looked at me and said “The Liberals 
are promising home care, child care and pharmacare. You are a 
member of the New Democratic Party, you are probably not going to 
form the government”. I was hopeful, but they are very pragmatic 
electors. They said “Why should we support you?”  I said “You 
know something, I like my Liberal counterpart, a nice person, but 
I do not think he knows what he is talking about.  I do not think 
the government will deliver on home care, child care and 
pharmacare”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as in the last election they said they were going to 
deliver on eliminating the GST.  Remember that?  “We will 
eliminate the GST if you elect Liberals”.  The Liberals were 
elected and they did not do it.  It was very disappointing. I 
said “When you get to the home care, pharmacare and child care, 
do not hold your breath.  You are going to blow up if you do 
because it will not happen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now two years into the new mandate and again we listen 
carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening to this speech and I am really impressed. 
I think it would be very honourable for other members to come 
into the House and listen because there could be some lessons 
learned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the hon. member 
for Portage—Lisgar requesting a quorum call? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is what I am 
calling for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for

is up giving a speech and there is nobody here to give it to, but 
now people are here and it is much more encouraging. 
I realize the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance 
is here and I know he represents a large cadre of other folks. 
Perhaps we can say one represents a group.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal:</B>  The important people are 
here.  We listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B> My friend the Minister of National 
Revenue indicates that the important people are here to listen. I 
know he listens to every word I say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get back to my theme.  The original thought was that the 
RCMP should be brought in to charge the government with theft and 
take it to court because of the dipping it has been doing into 
the EI fund and the federal pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second theme was that a lot of people had to wait because 
this budget was not going to do much for them.  I am thinking 
particularly of those people who are looking for work, people who 
operate a farm, people who are in the ranching sector, the 
forestry sector, the mining sector and the fishery. Anything to 
do with primary resources is pretty light in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Restoring the funding for health care was not there.  It was a 
bit of a shell game.  The promise for health care, home care, 
pharmacare, none of the cares was represented in the budget. This 
was very sad for many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some selective tax breaks and I want to focus on them 
at the moment.  Those tax breaks were intended to provide an 
incentive for certain people to do things.  We have identified 
that some people need to be bribed into activity.  They tend to 
be wealthy people.  It is said that if we can bribe wealthy 
people or industrialists into doing things, this will eventually 
benefit the other folks. These are fancy words for an 
old-fashioned term called trickle down economics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance is well studied in trickle down economics.  He graduated 
from that university.  He knows trickle down economics probably 
better than most people I have ever met.  It is like Peter Pan; 
if we believe we can fly, we will eventually fly.  If we believe 
things are going to pick up, they will eventually pick up or 
trickle down better yet.  If we feed a bit at the front, 
eventually the benefits trickle down to normal Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say uncategorically here and now that Canadians are 
sick and tired of being trickled on for years and years and 
years.  The trickling has to stop.  We are almost drowning.  The 
trickle down theme seems to have been introduced into this 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to identify two or three of the more general things that 
were missed.  I would be remiss not to quote from two or three 
people about the budget.  For example, the Canadian Federation of 
Students said that tuition fees continue to rise while the 
quality of education continues to erode. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance on many occasions has talked about the 
importance of education and training for the future.  As we 
approach the knowledge based economy of the 21st century, there 
is no question that education and training are crucial if we are 
going to have success in terms of economic growth and prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was in this budget that would lend itself to support 
education?  Was there a break on tuition fees?  No.  Was there 
some significant support for universities across the country? 
No. Was there any support at all for persons who are graduating 
from our post-secondary educational institutions with huge 
debt loads?  No there was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we talking about here?  What is going on?  We need to 
have more support from the federal government for education 
across the country and we did not get it.  That is what is so 
frustrating. I suspect people listening to this will reflect that 
frustration.  I know students certainly do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge my friend the parliamentary secretary and I hope he 
will respond to this.  Why not as a government be bold and say 
“We believe in education.  We believe in a quality education. 
More important, we believe in access to quality education.  We 
can take care of improving the quality but we have to do 
something about access. What can we do as the federal 
government?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do what many other countries have done and abolish 
tuition fees from our colleges, universities, technical schools 
and vocational schools from coast to coast to coast.  Wipe out 
tuition fees. My friend implies that this is some kind of a pie 
in the sky thought.  Most countries did this years ago.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact the CEGEPs across the river in Quebec do not 
charge tuition fees.  Everywhere else in Canada certainly does: 
$1,000, $2,000 and $3,000 just for tuition fees, let alone the 
cost of books and laboratory supplies.  As well the students have 
to stay alive; they have to borrow money to simply live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the federal government not say that it will wipe out 
tuition fees from coast to coast?  How much would that cost?  We 
have the money.  It would cost the federal government about $3 
billion.  There is a $3 billion slush fund.  It is called a 
contingency fund for special occasions.  What better signal could 
the government send?  What better suggestion could it make?  What 
better leadership could be provided by the Minister of Finance 
and the government than eliminating tuition fees for everyone 
across Canada who wants to improve his or her education? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cheer would go up across the country if they were to say that. 
Who would say it was a rotten idea?  Most OECD countries have 
done it years and years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be bold.  Let us get out there and say we will do 
something completely different.  However, what would we do?  We 
all find frustrating at this time of the year filling out tax 
returns, those who can do it.  Many people have to hire 
accountants or take them down to the little shops along the road 
for someone else to fill them out.  We need tax reform, and it is 
time the Minister of Finance informs us of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, a number of phenomenal forces are at work in the 
country that we must address.  We did not address them in this 
budget but let us do it in the next one.  We must come to grips 
with the forces of globalization and rapid technological change. 
Technology will change.  I am thinking of the impact of 
electronic commerce on the way people work and the way business 
is conducted.  There is also the tremendous changing demography 
of our country, the aging population, the major move into 
self-employment in terms of lifestyle for people, and the whole 
increasing urbanization phenomenon.  The federal government has 
to provide leadership on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there is a growing gap between those who have and 
those who have not.  On a local scale, a regional scale, a 
provincial scale, a national scale and a global scale, the gap 
between those who have and those who have not is increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at a crossroads as we enter the 21st century.  While this 
past budget was a bit of a disappointment, to say the least, let 
us look forward to a better and more timely budget in the year 
2000. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I sat and listened attentively 
to the hon. member.  He just made a comment about how mothers and 
fathers raising children on social assistance were in essence 
paying tax and that the budget did nothing to deal with that 
segment of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I caution the hon. member that as a result of the 1998-99 budget 
any Canadian family raising children would pay no net federal tax 
on an income of $30,000 or less.  I am not saying that is in any 
way an achievement for which we would stand, pound our chests and 
say our job is done.  We obviously need to do more in terms of 
helping families raise children and ensuring that Canadians have 
a better quality of life.  However, with those two budgets, 
Canadian families who are raising children and earning $30,000 or 
less will be paying no net federal tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well the hon. member made mention of the fact that health 
care funding was somewhat of a sham.  I caution the hon. member 
that the restoration of funding to the provinces with respect to 
health care took two forms.  One was the $8 billion over a period 
of time.  The $3.5 billion immediately was meant to address what 
the provinces were saying and what Canadians were saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member sits on the finance committee.  He toured the country 
along with myself and other members of parliament.  We heard from 
Canadians who said that they needed additional moneys put back 
into the health care system.  The $3.5 billion allows the 
provinces to draw that down as they see fit.  I understand 
Manitoba is drawing down its portion as quickly as it can.  It 
can do so over a three year period. 
I caution the hon. member when he says it is a sham.  I would 
tend to disagree.  Hopefully the additional information I am 
providing will give him an opportunity to clarify his position.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of trickle down economics, I am certainly familiar with 
the theory.  It is a something the United States was very 
accustomed to following under Reagan and Reaganomics.  However I 
would disagree with the hon. member.  We have put in place a 
number of economic policies which deal with certain segments of 
society.  We targeted our tax cuts initially.  We took 600,000 
Canadians off the tax rolls at the low end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to the elimination of the 3% surtax.  As soon as we 
had the money we eliminated it for individuals who were earning 
$50,000 or less.  We targeted our approach to those at the lower 
end of the income scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that information I only hope the hon. member would say that 
he might not agree with everything the government does but he 
could agree with the thrust and the direction of the government 
and urge us to do more.  I welcome the opportunity for the member 
to urge us to do more as Canadians are doing.  We fully respect 
the priorities of Canadians and are committed to doing more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, there he goes, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance making sense 
again.  I must say he is right when he says that there have been 
some good changes and some appropriate changes.  I acknowledge 
that the elimination of the 3% surtax was a good step.  Next we 
have to work on bracket creep, which I think he would agree was 
overlooked in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he would also agree that I said there was an increase in 
funding for health care which would eventually bring the federal 
portion up to the 1995 level.  If we could clap with one hand, I 
suspect that is what we should do for that.  It is a step in the 
right direction, but taking it up to 1995 levels is hardly 
something we should get too excited about.  However he is correct 
on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge my hon. friend when he says there are no net federal 
taxes for people living on social assistance.  The one tax change 
we have been advocating is a reduction in the GST.  My friend 
would know that people on social assistance certainly pay the 
GST.  They probably buy stuff with every dollar they collect. 
They buy services and they buy goods and therefore pay the GST. I 
realize they get some returns on that, but we can debate these 
issues in terms of the need for more refundable tax credits and 
so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go on to a point my friend makes in terms of families 
making under $30,000 and not paying net federal taxes.  My dad 
asked me to raise a question the next time I was speaking in the 
House of Commons, which I guess is today.  My dad is 94 years old 
and he is on a pension, an extremely modest pension.  He gets by, 
to be fair.  He had to fill out his income tax forms.  He could 
not see very well so he got my ex-brother-in-law to fill them out 
for them.  He ended up paying a few hundred dollars in income 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked me to ask a question of the Minister of Finance who 
unfortunately is not here at the moment but will be here later. 
Why should a 94 year old man who worked hard all his life, paid 
taxes all his life and was never out of work, have to pay income 
tax on a very modest pension income?  He was frustrated.  I guess 
I am asking it rhetorically, but perhaps the parliamentary 
secretary could respond in place of the Minister of Finance in 
case my father is listening at the moment.

am pleased to say a few words in this debate.  When the bill is 
passed it will mean hundreds of millions of dollars to be used 
for the benefit of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think about the country many words come to mind.  I think 
about quality of life, security, prosperity, freedom, compassion, 
co-operation and many other things other countries do not have. 
Generally the very last thing we associate with Canada is poverty 
and all the suffering and loss that come with it. 
Most of us simply do not want to admit that the very real problem 
of poverty exists in Canada.  I do not think the government has 
come to grips with it or wishes to admit it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, the reality is that for millions of Canadians 
poverty is a way of life.   As the poor become more vocal through 
various organizations in which they become involved, through the 
media and anti-poverty associations and whatnot, many Canadians 
come to realize it is a very real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments at every level will not be able to ignore that 
problem much longer and will have to take action on it fairly 
soon.  They will have to do a bit more than actually appoint a 
minister for the homeless.  They will have to give that minister 
the resources to do the job that needs to be done to address the 
issue of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of poverty is a very difficult one, as we are all 
aware.  The government knows very little about the true state of 
poverty in the country.  We have not developed an effective way 
to identify and to measure poverty.  We have yet to identify all 
the causes of poverty.  We still do not have an effective and 
complete strategy to eliminate poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is also complicated due to the large number of effects 
it has on many different social classes, whether it be women, 
children, the working poor, the unemployed poor, aboriginals or 
disabled persons.  I am not sure if the bill does anything to 
address the plight of many people who are well below the poverty 
line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all very much aware that back in November 1989 the leader 
of the NDP, Ed Broadbent, introduced the following motion in the 
House of Commons: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House express its concern for the more than one million 
Canadian children currently living in poverty and seek to achieve 
the goal of eliminating poverty among Canadian children by the 
year 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jean Charest, the minister of state for fitness and amateur 
sport and the deputy leader in the House at the time, moved at 
the end of the debate that the motion be supported unanimously by 
the House of Commons, and it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read some of the positions of members of the PC Party, 
the Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party at the time on the 
whole issue of child poverty.  In the speech to the motion Perrin 
Beatty of the PC Party, then minister of national health and 
welfare, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to be afraid of the future.  We have a prosperous 
and a dynamic economy which if managed well promises to improve 
even further.  We have the tools to reduce the number of children 
living in poverty as we have for each and every year since 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a few short weeks we will be entering the new decade.  This is 
a good time for us to reflect on the very real progress that we 
have made in the past and to think about what accomplishments we 
want to make in the 1990s.  Any society that cares about its 
future must care about the plight of its children today.  This 
government demonstrated that commitment and I can assure you it 
will continue to demonstrate that commitment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech introducing the motion Ed Broadbent of the NDP 
showed that child poverty had increased.  He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1980 to 1986, when the child population actually fell by 
some 4%, the number living in poverty in Canada at precisely the 
time that the rest of us were doing better increased by 13.4%. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also pointed out that the rate of poor children in poor health 
is 150% higher than the national average.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Broadbent went on to explain how the cycle of poverty works. 
He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is now in Canada and the United States a vicious cycle 
involving the poor.  Poor kids are undernourished, underhoused, 
more sickly, more poorly educated, get the second or third rate 
jobs, and when the lay-offs come, they get laid off first.  The 
same young people marry each other and then they produce 
children, statistically out of proportion, who go through the 
same cycle.  We have a cycle of poor food, poor housing, poor 
clothing, poor education, poor jobs, poor spouses, more poor 
kids.  This is a vicious cycle.  It is a vicious cycle that can 
be broken and it is a vicious cycle that must be broken in this 
Canada of ours. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ed Broadbent said that back in 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This quote is truly the most interesting quote of all.  It is a 
statement made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs who was in 
opposition at that time.  In speaking to that motion, he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never hear the Minister of Finance talk about the real deficit 
in this country, which is those one million kids in poverty. That 
is the real lack of investment.  That is the real tragedy. In 10 
years from now those are the children who should be tomorrow's 
teachers, business people, politicians or journalists.  They will 
never get there because they will never get up to the starting 
line.  When you have a million children living in poverty, that 
is the greatest lack of investment.  That is the greatest deficit 
we face.  That is the problem, and there is nothing being done to 
address that kind of issue. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the now Minister of Foreign Affairs who said that the 
greatest deficit we had in this country were our poor children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the child poverty motion was unanimously supported 
by all members from all parties in the House of Commons, very 
little has been done to take action on that problem.  Even today 
we realize the governments of the past, and today's government in 
particular, have really not taken any action on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to read the quotes with a few modifications to names 
and dates, we would realize that the words of a decade ago apply 
to the situation we face today.  In fact the number of Canada's 
poor has increased and their condition has worsened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that motion was passed back in 1989, we had one million 
children living in poverty in Canada.  Today, 10 years later, 
when we pledged that we would eliminate child poverty in this 
country by the year 2000, we do not have one million children 
living in poverty, we now have 1.5 million children living in 
poverty in Canada.  That is a real tragedy and one for which all 
of us have to bear responsibility.  It is not only this 
government but governments of the past that have to bear 
responsibility for the very glaring tragedy we have in our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty statistics are debatable and very controversial, 
especially in Canada.  An example of that is Statistics Canada's 
low income cut-off.  The low income cut-off is the most widely 
used formula to establish a poverty line in Canada, even though 
Statistics Canada says it should not be used as the poverty line. 
Nevertheless, this does not mean that the statistics are useless 
and that we should not be using them.  Most of them are very 
accurate.  The point is that we need to develop a clear and 
widely accepted formula for measuring poverty in Canada.  Only 
then, when we have the real hard facts on poverty, will we be 
able to effectively deal with the problem.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully, as the poverty task force travels the country, we 
will be able to, and I think we are, gather all of the good, hard 
evidence that the government will need to effectively deal with 
the problem, if it is serious about dealing with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hundreds of statistics on poverty in Canada.  However, 
we have to make sure that we do not get bogged down in numbers 
and lose sight of reality.  If we only look at numbers we might 
end up thinking that Canada is not a very good place to live in 
this world.  That is not really true.  That is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these numbers we can see that there is a major poverty 
problem in Canada.  However, we must not and should never lose 
sight of the fact that we are doing many good things in the 
country and that we are a very strong country.  That is why we 
should be able to find ways to eliminate the whole issue of 
poverty in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of child poverty has always touched a very sensitive 
chord with most Canadians.  The reasons for that are fairly 
obvious.  Children are some of the most vulnerable people in our 
society. They are helpless and are innocent victims of their 
environment and their socioeconomic condition.  Needless to say, 
by eliminating child poverty, the aim is not only to eliminate 
child poverty, but to eliminate all poverty in Canada. Children 
are dependent upon parents. If we eliminate child poverty we 
eliminate parent poverty and people poverty as well. One of our 
goals has to be the elimination of not only child poverty but 
also parent poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, the year for which we have statistics available, 1.5 
million children were living in poverty in Canada.  That is an 
increase of 21% since 1995, but it is an increase of 60% since 
1989 when the motion to eliminate child poverty was passed in the 
House of Commons.  It is a very real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the government is aware of the number of people 
using food banks in Canada.  As travel go from province to 
province, many people have come before our committee to talk 
about how frequently they have to use food banks. It is 
heart-rending to listen to not only the unemployed poor but the 
number of working poor who come before our committee on a weekly 
basis to tell us their stories of the loss of pride and how they 
have to go once a month—and in most cases they can only go go 
once a month—to a food bank in a country that has the kind of 
resources and riches that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a national tragedy that we have over 800,000 people per 
year using food banks in the country.  It is a national disgrace. 
Forty-two per cent of people who depend on food banks for all or 
part of their food are children and people under 18 years of age. 
Can anyone imagine 800,000 people per year using food banks in a 
country that has our resources and riches?  It is hard to 
imagine.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics for 1994 estimated that 57,000 Canadian children 
under 12 experienced hunger due to a lack of food or money. We 
are now living in 1999 and I believe that number has probably 
gone up to 100,000 children under 12 who are experiencing hunger 
due to a lack of food or money.  The majority of hungry children 
lived with lone parents and a high percentage of these children 
were aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our poverty task force travelled from province to province, 
we had quite a number of women who came before our us to talk 
about their problems.  Women are struck very heavily by poverty, 
especially single mothers.  We do have a kind of arrogant and 
cynical attitude in some quarters today toward single parents. 
People tend to say, especially people in government, “they made 
their bed, let them lie in it”.  We hear that very often, but 
that is not the way of a compassionate country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Who are you hearing it from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite 
will have a chance to have a go at this as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member can criticize me all he wishes for making these 
points, but we have quite a number of women today, single mothers 
and others, who are living in poverty.  Single mothers in 
particular have more difficulty getting jobs, and the jobs they 
do get are very often low paying.  We hear that every day as our 
committee travels to various provinces.  The lack of adequate 
low-cost day care services for instance is a real problem for 
some single mothers because it hinders their ability to seek and 
get employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fully 92% of single mothers in Canada under the age of 25 live 
below the poverty line.  That is a damning statistic. Getting 
single mothers out of poverty through education is very 
difficult.  It is increasingly difficult as a result of provinces 
cutting off social assistance to single parents enrolled in 
post-secondary education.  Every day we hear from single mothers 
who want to get out of the situations they are in but find it 
very difficult because the provinces have a tendency to cut off 
social assistance payments to a single mom who wants to get 
involved in post-secondary education.  We perpetuate the problem 
by doing that instead of doing all we can to try to get these 
people off the welfare rolls, into a post-secondary education 
system and back—

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he was very sincere when he spoke of poverty and single 
moms and children in terms of the Canadian experience. As he was 
speaking I was thinking that some of that sincerity is a little 
diluted when we start to think about the hon. member's party and 
former leader Mr. Mulroney and the kinds of things they did 
during their tenure in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I think of the high employment insurance premiums. 
I think of the very high unemployment rate.  I think of the kinds 
of things that were put in place that exacerbated the problem and 
the $42 billion deficit.  This was the legacy that the Tory party 
left to us to clean up. The hon. member with some sincerity is 
trying to make his points but that sincerity is somewhat diluted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on the government side have been very consistent in trying to 
do the right thing in this all important area.  We have worked 
very hard on this to ensure that we do the right thing for young 
people and for poor people wherever they may live in Canada.  We 
have worked very hard. For example, there is the child tax credit 
and other income tax measures that we put in place to ensure that 
lower income people no longer have to pay taxes.  Those are but 
just a few tangible examples of what the government has done in 
this very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used to be the chairman of the Waterloo Regional Police.  When 
it comes to issues like poverty there are measures that 
communities, educational systems and groups throughout various 
parts of Canada need to do and pull together. There are justice 
and economic issues.  Measures need to be put in place in a 
co-operative way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was my experience in my former role as chairman of the 
Waterloo Regional Police that if we spend a dollar now we will 
save $7 later.  If we bring those kinds of measures into focus it 
will especially assist our young people who need that very 
important first start in life in terms of where they go and how 
they extend through their lifetime the kinds of things that are 
important to them and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member for St. John's East agree with me that an 
investment of a dollar now for our young people is important?  As 
an investment it will ensure that we save $7 dollars later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Madam Speaker, we would fools not to 
agree with the hon. gentleman that moneys invested today in youth 
and in society in general will certainly pay dividends in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about governments past and the fact that 
we are all to blame for the child poverty issue and the issue of 
poverty in Canada. I could not agree more.  Members will never 
hear me defend any government, whether it is federal or 
provincial, on adequately addressing the poverty issue over the 
last 10 or 15 years in particular.  They certainly have not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out to the hon. member that the number of children 
living in poverty was actually going down right up until 1984. 
Since 1984 the problem has become more acute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can all blame governments past, the Mulroney government, the 
Trudeau government, or the current government for where we stand 
today on child poverty, but I do not think we solve the issue in 
that way.  The numbers of people who have been forced on to the 
welfare rolls because of the EI policies the government has 
adopted is very evident.

the member opposite had to say.  The one thing about it is yes, 
Canada is a great place to live.  Studies show that Canada is the 
greatest place to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has put $11.5 billion into health, $15 million 
into cancer research, millions into breast cancer research and 
millions into diabetes research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am fairly new in the House, the fact is I do remember 
the years when the Mulroney government was in power and ran up a 
budget deficit of $43 billion.  It was in power for nine years. 
Imagine if it had been in power from 1983 to 1999, another six 
years.  That averages about $7 billion a year.  The deficit would 
probably be in the $70 billion range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has paid down about $30-odd billion in 
our deficit as far as debt load. I am very much interested in 
whether the member opposite is interested in having a balanced

Mulroney government was in power? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the problem is quite 
clear.  We see some of the stumbling blocks that members throw up 
in dealing with this problem.  They keep playing politics with 
people in poverty and that is not what the poor want.  They do 
not want members criticizing each other for policies past and 
present.  They want members to make a commitment to deal with the 
problem in a real and very substantive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes it is very important to have a balanced budget.  We all know 
that.  Through that we can bring in policies to eliminate poverty 
in this country.  However, the government has not done that.  The 
budget is balanced and the government again has made no 
commitment to the poor, except to appoint a minister for the 
homeless and not give the minister the resources she needs to 
deal with the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the hon. member some statistics that were passed 
along to me by Statistics Canada.  Back in 1987 the average 
amount of expenditure for a Canadian family was $33,000.  The 
average income was $45,000.  In 1987 a family had a $12,000 
surplus of disposable income that they could use to help their 
children.  Families needed that money.  In 1997 expenditures for 
a family were $42,000 while the income was $41,900.  This means 
that the average family is $100 in the hole instead of having a 
$12,000 surplus as they did back in 1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we have balanced the budget, but at what cost?  We have 
balanced the budget on the backs of the poor.  We have balanced 
the budget on the backs of the working poor.  The government has 
to come to grips with that.

the day before yesterday in the debate on the Budget 
Implementation Act, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remarks of the Bloc Quebecois members were all over the map,

</I></B></P><P align=left>The pessimistic view of the Bloc members has only one purpose, 
that of promoting Quebec's separation from the rest of Canada, 
even though over 80% of those who pay their salaries want to 
remain in Canada.  These same people said in the latest 
referendum that Quebec's separation was a matter for Quebec only 
without a trace of embarrassment at raising the subject daily 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is something else. 
While it is true that the population of Quebec is comprised 
primarily of francophones, this is no reason to try, as the Bloc 
is doing, to turn them into the victims of some sort of 
machination, because Quebecers can stand up for themselves and 
with other Canadians build a country that is good to live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Francophones have always occupied their rightful place in

culture.  They will always have to be vigilant, not only in 
protecting them but in promoting them, and they are working at 
it remarkably.

that they do not need to separate from Canada to enjoy their 
fair share.

paranoia. 
Instead of proposing to Quebecers a major challenge such as to 
continue to work to be competitive in Canada and in the rest of

Quebec.

Quebec's separation from the rest of Canada is essential to its

</I></B></P><P align=left>While they are talking about separation, the sovereignists are 
forcing municipalities and school boards to merge, which is an 
obvious contradiction. In short, the Bloc Quebecois is stuck, it 
is unable to propose solutions other than to impoverish Quebec 
from a political, economical and cultural point of view, at the 
expense of the one million francophones living outside the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Frontenac—Mégantic had the nerve to say that there 
are two Ministers of Agriculture and that it is one too many. 
Let me give a quick example of what the federal Minister of 
Agriculture has done for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our province accounts for 24% of the overall population but 48% 
of the milk quotas. Among other measures, the federal government 
recently put in place a special assistance program for farmers 
who find themselves in difficult situations. This initiative 
complements the Quebec program, whose objective is to help the 
agricultural industry with problems relating to livestock 
production, seeds, and so on. Under its initiative, the 
Government of Canada will provide about $900 million. That 
amount could reach $1.5 billion if the provinces are interested 
in taking part in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to put our government's philosophy and initiative in 
their proper perspective. Let me give you a more realistic and 
accurate view of our last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to point out to the members of the Bloc that 
the structure has evolved in such a way that the Americans no 
longer have a hold over our economy. Quebec's economy is made up 
of thousands of entrepreneurs who invest in the various regions 
of the province, with the help and support of both levels of 
government, that have developed and implemented policies and 
programs, taking into account the needs of regional and local 
stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what sovereignists are saying, it is very much in 
Quebec's interest to be a full fledged member of the Canadian 
federation. In fact, sovereignists lack perspective and have a 
selective memory. The Liberal government remembers vividly that, 
in 1993, Canada had a huge deficit of $42 billion, which we have 
eliminated with the great co-operation of Canadians, who had to 
make big sacrifices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But today, the new context created by the federal government's 
budget surplus, by the creation of 1.6 million jobs in Canada 
and by a thriving economy has restored the confidence of 
Quebecers. Their renewed confidence is also due to the fact that 
the government has been able to do things that were beneficial 
to them.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confidence in the Canadian economy has been restored because we 
were able to create the conditions for investment and economic 
growth, which means, among other things, that unemployment has 
fallen from 11.4% to 7.8% in 1999. This economic recovery has 
also led to lower interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As indicated recently by the federal government, the Government 
of Quebec will receive about $7.4 billion in new transfers this 
year and over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sum represents 34% of all new federal transfers, whereas 
the population of Quebec represents 24% of the Canadian 
population. 
This is not bad, in terms of help and support for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our economic and budget choice was actually an easy one to make. 
Our government deliberately chose to no longer mortgage Quebec's 
and Canada's future. It was committed to a balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998-99, we balanced the books for the first time, and even 
had a surplus. This marks the first time since 1951-52 that 
Canada has recorded two balanced budgets or surpluses, back to 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One last statistic: in 1995-96, when the debt to GDP ratio was at 
its peak, 36 cents out of every revenue dollar collected by the 
federal government went to interest on the debt. Last year, this 
amount dropped to 27 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not have enough time to list the many positive actions by 
our government, especially the support and magnificent work by 
several federal departments during the floods in the Saguenay 
and during the ice storm, which hit Quebec especially hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that the Premier of Quebec, Lucien Bouchard, 
was handing out $70 cheques to ice storm victims, even though 
70% of this amount, or 63$, came from the federal government. 
The cheques were emblazoned with the fleur de lys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic and budget priorities of our government are well 
known and shared by a majority of Canadians: strengthen our 
universal health care system; provide tax relief; fight child 
poverty, and invest in a more productive economy and a better 
standard of living by expanding access to knowledge, research 
and innovation. 
These are measures we took in the most recent budgets, and we 
will continue to promote them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, my message is one of optimism.  It is one of 
pride in being a member of the Liberal team, whose primary 
concern is to do everything possible to improve the quality of 
life of Quebecers in Canada, the best country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My message is also one of pride in representing the people in 
the riding of Beauce who put their trust in me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Beauce has an unemployment rate of about 4%, the 
lowest or the second lowest in the country. My constituents' 
priority, and ours, is to work and to improve the quality of 
life in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, my constituents have given me a mandate that is 
straightforward and complicated at the same time.  Not only have 
they asked me to represent them well in the House of Commons, 
but they have also asked me to protect their interests and make 
sure that their region, like all regions in Quebec, gets its 
fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their trust encourages me to redouble my efforts, for our 
children and the generations to come, for Beauce, for Quebec, 
and for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Did the hon. member for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not call my colleague on 
the dispute between the government and my colleagues of the Bloc 
Quebecois on the referendum question. Like many others, even in 
the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, my region, I and my fellow citizens 
do not waken up at night thinking about the date of the next 
referendum.  We have a lot of other priorities at the moment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are basic concepts we do not want to let drag on and waste 
our time debating, but I would like to call my colleague on the 
subject of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time a member of the Conservative Party rises, they raise 
the figure of the $42 billion deficit, but they always fail to 
say that this deficit had been accumulated with the $200 billion 
in debts the previous government had left us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not going to change history, but it would be interesting 
to compare the two governments.  We would see that there was no 
shame in being Conservative for nine years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essential issue is taxes. 
The big topic of conversation at the moment is that a lot of 
people are thinking of moving for tax reasons.  It costs a 
fortune to live in the Province of Quebec, because our tax 
system is utterly regressive.  I think the federal government 
must also have a more progressive policy on taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the analysis done by economists Ferland and Laferrière, 14 
federal measures are prejudicial.  I would like the opinion of 
my colleague from Beauce on that.  Is it usual for a government 
to withdraw all the benefits from free trade, $22 billion from 
the GST and tens of billions of dollars from the surplus in the 
employment insurance fund, while overtaxing by some $30 billion 
at a time when people have no more money in their pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot afford to just say “Wait for the next budget”.  For 
families earning between $25,000 and $70,000 a year, it is a 
disgrace to live in Canada and in Quebec at the present time, 
for tax reasons.  They have nothing left of their pay cheques. 
They wonder how they can arrange things differently so that they 
have a little bit more left in their pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are, of course, some provinces that are better off than 
others at this time, like Alberta and Ontario.  Their premiers 
decided to say “Yes, we are going to work at decreasing the 
deficit, but with moderation.  We are also going to look at the 
taxation system”. They know it is a key to reviving the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague from Beauce whether he does not 
find it unreasonable to keep on pocketing people's money as the 
Liberals are doing, to create what are almost hidden funds, to 
have a taxation system that is hideously complex. 
People cannot figure out what is going on any more, but there is 
one thing they do know.  The bottom line is: their net salaries 
continue to get smaller. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are examples of this.  There are typical cases that have 
been referred to in reports.  People get pay raises that cost 
them money.  Something must be done.  We must not say “Wait for 
the next budget”.  Administrative corrections need to be made. 
It is nothing complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a single-parent family with an income of $31,000 a year gets a 
$1,000 increase in income, which costs it $1,056, including a 
$260 drop in the child tax benefit, we do not need to wait for 
the next budget in order to remedy this.  The Minister of 
Finance merely needs to send a note to his deputy minister 
indicating “This needs fixing.  It is not right”.  There are 14 
different elements that have negative effects on Canadian 
families, Quebec families in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that my colleague from Beauce is doing his best to 
represent his fellow citizens well, as did his predecessor.  I 
would like to have his opinion on the taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I agree with the hon. 
member for Chicoutimi that Quebecers are, unfortunately, the 
most heavily taxed people in North America. We must absolutely 
work to help people regain confidence, and I hope that the 
Quebec government will do its share in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Chicoutimi also said that we must not only 
remember the $42 billion deficit that we inherited, but also 
recognize what was done before that. I agree, but we must not 
think either that the previous government does not have any 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have begun to lower taxes. We increased the child tax 
benefit. But, we must be cautious. 
Canadians have made huge sacrifices to allow us to achieve 
fiscal balance. Today, we have succeeded and all Canadians are 
pleased to see that tax reductions have begun and will continue, 
at least as far as the Government of Canada is concerned. We 
hope that the Quebec government will do like its Ontario 
counterpart and that Quebecers will stop being the most heavily 
taxed people in North America.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I will conclude by telling the member for Chicoutimi, 
who is also well aware of what is happening and who works hard 
for his constituents, that we do not need to think constantly 
about separation. What people want is to work and to have the 
best quality of life while remaining in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise to speak to Bill C-71.  This is the third time that 
I rise to speak to this bill.  I rise to speak because I feel 
strongly about what is happening in our country, especially in 
the past couple of years when we have seen taxes going up, our 
financial house not being in order and the burden that ordinary 
Canadian taxpayers are carrying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a small businessman and an accountant.  In the last 
10 years that I have been a businessman there is just one area 
where I could not control the cost which dug into my profit, and 
that one area was government taxation.  Government fees, 
government taxation, UI, EI, all kinds of taxes, from the cities 
to the provincial governments to the federal government, have 
been hampering the growth of small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This started with the Conservative government.  Now the Liberal 
government is claiming that it is working well to bring its 
financial house in order.  That is not what I hear from Canadians 
who are coming into my office. That is not right.  Despite the 
claim made by the federal government that it has been reducing 
taxes, that it has balanced the budget and that good times are 
around the corner, those who walk into my office cannot vote for 
that.  They cannot say that good times are around the corner 
because their take-home pay is still going down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is their take-home pay going down?  Costs are going up, 
rents are going up and service fees are coming in.  With all of 
these things they just cannot seem to make ends meet.  How can 
this government stand and say that happy times are here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we see a new debate going on.  Businesses have finally 
started speaking out.  They are saying that enough is enough.  We 
hear Nortel talking about losing the brightest people in Canada. 
We spend money to train them and then we lose them to other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have free trade with the U.S.A.  Now we have free trade with 
Chile.  We have free trade with Israel.  As we go on we will have 
more and more free trade, which gives Canadians the opportunity 
to go to other countries where there are better conditions and 
better take-home pay.  They will do that and we will lose them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am on the subject about losing our brightest, I want to 
talk about something that is very dear to me, the student debt. 
Let us talk about that for a little while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past decade the average Canadian university tuition has 
risen by 119%.  That is a substantial increase.  However, 
transfer payments for post-secondary education have already been 
sliced by 18%.  The government has sliced this money, part of 
which would have been used by the provinces for student loans. 
Now the Liberal government is coming up with a band-aid solution. 
The government has created the millennium scholarship fund which 
will only address 300,000 students. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I read a press release in which the government said that 
it had come to an agreement with the Government of Ontario.  The 
Government of Ontario will be administering Canada student loans. 
From a cost and efficiency perspective I think that is great. It 
is a good initiative on the part of the federal government. 
However, that does not address the main issue of the high cost of 
tuition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the University of Calgary for example.  This 
university has charged more and more for tuition fees because it 
does not have funds coming from the provincial government any 
more. The federal government has refused to meet its obligations 
despite the fact that it talks about the great transfer of money 
it is giving to the provinces to address their educational needs 
for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at the dawn of the new millennium.  Is it not important 
that we look at what our students need?  Is it not important to 
ensure that Canada has an educational force that can challenge 
others and make Canada prosperous? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the international trade critic for my party. I have 
travelled around the world on behalf of Canada.  I have seen how 
competitive Canadians are.  We can rise to the challenge. What is 
curtailing us?  High taxes are curtailing Canadians.  Despite 
what the Liberals say, the facts speak for themselves.  More and 
more Canadians are leaving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday I pointed to an example which I will repeat today. I 
visited an institution in Toronto where they are teaching high 
tech to students.  I was told that IBM hired six students and 
took them to the U.S.A.  We trained them and we lost them.  The 
reason is high taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee yesterday the Minister for International Trade sent 
his message out to the government.  I hope the minister is 
listening to this.  He sent a very subtle message to the 
government; he was afraid he might get slapped.  His chain was 
yanked.  He said there is a need to reduce the gap in taxation 
between the U.S. and Canada since we are losing our brightest to 
the United States.  The minister has admitted there is a need. Of 
course he had to say the politically correct thing so his chain 
would not be yanked.  The minister said that the Prime Minister 
and the finance minister were working toward this. When will they 
work toward it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of education is rising.  I have repeated this many 
times in this House.  I have two daughters attending university 
and I know firsthand that the cost of education is going up and 
up and up. And what is happening?  A millennium fund, a legacy of 
the Prime Minister, but that legacy is not going to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Where is your leader? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, a member from British 
Columbia is talking about my leader while I am talking about 
taxes. Let us talk about taxes for a change. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have problems.  We have a problem with education. 
Post-secondary education is a problem.  Small business people are 
facing problems.  CPP premiums have gone up.  Of course the 
government claims it has reduced the EI. In the overall taxation 
problem people do not see any hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has stated that the underground economy has 
increased. I do not agree with the underground economy.  When the 
government provides services we have to pay for those services. 
Why is there an underground economy?  For the simple reason that 
people feel they are not getting back what they have been paying 
to the government.  That is why there is an underground economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ours is a voluntary system.  We are supposed to declare what we 
earn.  In a voluntary system there must be trust, trust between 
the government in what it is doing and those who are paying.  If 
that trust is broken, we will get a situation where people will 
say that they will not voluntarily comply with it.  This is what 
is happening.  Over the past years the trust has been broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trust was broken when the Conservatives brought in the GST. 
The GST was supposed to be paid toward the debt but instead it 
went toward spending.  That was the start of the breaking of the 
trust between the Canadian public and the Canadian government. Up 
until now Canadians have not regained that confidence to pay 
taxes voluntarily. Canadians should pay their taxes.  They should 
not break the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as parliamentarians can tell the government that it is wrong, 
that it has not addressed the issue of what Canadians are saying. 
Everybody is tired. The burden on single parents raising 
children is so heavy yet the government refuses to recognize 
that. Canadians brought this issue up and now the government has 
a committee to address the issue.  Mothers at home have not been 
recognized.  Again the government said it would study this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of state for the status of women met a lady who had 
taken Canada to the United Nations. That lady had the impression 
that this government or the minister herself looked more 
favourably on women who went out to work and less favourably on 
those who stayed at home to raise their children.  I do not see 
the logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who want to stay home to raise their children are equally 
important to this society because they are raising the young. 
They are equally important as those who are working and who come 
home in the evening to raise their children.  It is a choice they 
have made. One choice is not better than the other.  They both 
have the same objective of raising good Canadian citizens.  But 
our current taxation system does not address that and this budget 
did not address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about health care.  I said on Monday that a 
constituent had phoned me.  She said that she was afraid of what 
was going to happen with health care.  She did not see that this 
government had addressed this issue.  Despite the fact that this 
government has said it is going to pour money back into health 
care and despite the fact that this government is going to give 
money to health care one time, it does not bring confidence.  The 
government has taken more since it came into power in 1993 than 
what it is putting back in.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Ontario is going into an election. The 
Progressive Conservative Party has come up with its platform for 
the election.  One of the points in its platform is it is going 
to uncouple its taxation system from the federal government. 
What does this do?  This is the second province to do that. 
Alberta has already given its intention to do that and now 
Ontario is going to do it.  Why?  Neither of those governments 
have any confidence and do not see that the federal government is 
doing enough to reduce taxes.  They want to get those taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons the provincial government was not initially 
reducing taxes was the fear that if it reduced taxes the federal 
government would increase taxes because it was tied into the 
system.  Now the provincial government is uncoupling so it can 
address the concerns of its own citizens.  It is uncoupling from 
the federal government so that it has the freedom to do what the 
federal government is refusing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other factor is both Alberta and Ontario have come up with 
tax reductions for their citizens.  Yet Alberta is in the same 
situation as the federal government where there is no operating 
deficit.  Why is the federal government unable to do that?  It 
will claim it has done something.  It will claim it has taken 
away the 3% surtax.  The surtax is for whom?  It is for those who 
earn high incomes.  They pay the 3% surtax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However even any relief that the government has put in this 
budget will not kick in this year.  It will kick in starting in 
the year 2000.  And the government claims it is giving Canadians 
tax relief now.  The Liberals say they are giving tax relief now. 
No.  Their own documents say when they are giving tax relief.  It 
is next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Do not give me indigestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  I will give the hon. member some 
tablets for his indigestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The central theme of what I have been saying is that the federal 
government will have to address the issue of tax relief.  It will 
have to address the issue of smaller government.  Get off our 
backs.  That is the bottom line.  That is what Canadians are 
saying.  Get off our backs.  Become efficient. We have had enough 
big government and enough high taxes.  Now it is time to stop. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I think the hon. member before he gets up to speak had 
better check the facts.  It was about 90% hot air, nothing on 
target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is a provincial responsibility.  The provinces spend 
the money, they set the costs.  That is who is responsible.  We 
give them money but we do not float it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the deficit, who got to the deficit?  It was one of our 
platforms and this government reduced the deficit.  This 
government put money against the debt.  This government will not 
borrow to lower taxes, not like the Ontario government that has 
had to borrow $2 billion to $3 billion, that has had to borrow 
money. There is one fundamental rule in public policy.  Do not 
borrow money to give tax cuts because we never get back on it. 
The provincial government is off track and it will be tough to 
get back on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has put money against the surplus.  No other 
government has hit its target in a more systematic, well planned 
fashion than this federal government.  It is getting praise 
around the world for the prudent approach to the finances of this 
country.

been put against the debt, and that is the right way to go.  We 
will continue to bring down the mountain of debt.  We did not put 
it there.  It was created over a number of years.  Slowly we will 
bring it down.  For every $10 billion we put against it we will 
probably save up to $1.5 billion in expenses, which will accrue 
to the revenue side for the next year because we will not have to

that just blew over from the other corner.  He just stood to ask 
anything.  He did not say a single word about what I was talking 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about deficit reduction.  The deficit was reduced on 
the backs of Canadians.  Government did not clean it up.  It was 
cleaned up by high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the Ontario Conservatives borrowing money.  Let 
me tell him this.  There is no Canadian law, but there is a law 
in Alberta that governments can no longer have deficits.  Do that 
over there and then we will talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about being praised around the world.  Let us ask the 
people who are leaving Canada to work in other parts of the world 
about this business of being praised around the world.  Where is 
this hot air coming from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about giving mothers a choice.  Yes, we should give 
them a choice.  But the government's tax system has created no 
choice for them.  That is the problem.  Even I agree that they 
should be given a choice, but the government has not done that. 
We know where this hot air is coming from.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
note that the member across the way said that it is simply 
against government policy to borrow in order to reduce taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague if, in his opinion, this has 
ever been done before.  Have Liberal governments in the past ever 
borrowed money?  Or has the member for Calgary East heard that at 
least 35% of Canadians are forced to borrow money to pay their 
federal taxes?  Has he heard those figures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
asking that question.  It is a good question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where did this deficit come from?  Was it not started by a 
Liberal government?  It initiated this business of deficit 
spending and the Tories followed.  It started over there.  Now 
the Conservative governments are bringing in legislation to stop 
deficit spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague talked about Canadians borrowing money.  I forgot 
that point.  He is absolutely right.  I have had people in my 
riding come to me and say that they had to borrow money to pay 
their taxes.  The tax burden on Canadians is pretty high.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
you to know that in no way did I intend to usurp your authority. 
I am well aware of the great influence you have on the House. I 
accept your leadership without question. If I had had the 
opportunity I would even have voted for you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, we now have to deal with less pleasant issues. 
I would ask government members to pay attention. We have many 
complaints about the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to stress again how important it is to vigorously fight 
poverty. I will benefit from the presence in the House of all my 
Bloc Quebecois colleagues, since I believe those who are the 
most sensitive to the issue are here today.  It is a quirk of 
scheduling. It was not planned, it just happened that way. I 
therefore feel all the more comfortable talking about this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, I went on a tour of Quebec to promote community 
reinvestment by banks. This idea is gathering a fair amount of 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some support from the Progressive Conservative Party. I 
have some support from the New Democratic Party. I know there is 
some fragile support among government members, but it is bound 
to get stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, in his report the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the President of the Treasury Board reviewed the whole issue 
of bank involvement in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1977, the United States have had the Community 
Reinvestment Act. It provides no constraint. It sets no quotas. 
It simply requires banks to become involved in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strength of the U.S. legislation, which appeals to a number 
of my colleagues—whom I thank for welcoming me in their 
region—is that it provides for a yearly assessment of what the 
banks are doing in underprivileged communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Banks can get involved in underprivileged communities in a 
variety of ways. 
They can do it by supporting community groups, by providing 
lower income people with a range of financial services at 
preferential rates and by making mortgage loans. All this is 
called community reinvestment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community reinvestment by the banks is a matter of balance since 
they make profits from the money deposited by individual 
investors. It has to do with the multiplier theory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canada needs a legislation to assess what the banks are 
doing in their communities, and that assessment should be made 
available to consumers. 
That is what made the success of the American formula. Once a 
year, in June, the assessment of the banks' involvement in the 
community is disclosed in what is appropriately called the 
disclosure process. Naturally, consumers are better informed 
when they have to make choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why the government never proposed anything 
similar in the budget or elsewhere over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to talk about poverty. I think members of the 
House are very sensitive to the issue of poverty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, on this side of the House, do see a paradox in having an 
increasingly rich society, which is able to produce and has 
gained access to export markets like never before, yet a society 
where the number of poor people has never been higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the National Council of Welfare estimates that one 
out of five Canadians lives in poverty. In certain communities, 
the ratio is two out of five, and among certain groups, 
particularly young people, it is three out of five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we talking about when we speak of poverty? We are 
talking about people who have to spend more than 55% of their 
income on basic necessities, like clothing, housing and food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleague, the member for Shefford, has embarked on an 
antipoverty fight—this the kind of word we should use when we 
talk about poverty—and she has suggested what could be part of 
the solution. Nobody thinks there can be one single solution to 
the problem of poverty. We all know we need a whole range of 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the hon. member for Shefford did suggest one idea that could 
be part of the solution and that got a great deal of attention 
in the House and a lot of support from the Bloc Quebecois, from 
me as the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, from the hon. member 
for Québec, who has also joined us in this fight, and from the 
hon. member for Laval East. 
We did not ask the government for a budgetary measure, but for 
something that could make a difference for underprivileged 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a spirit of honesty and camaraderie, we have asked the 
government to add social condition as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act, but not in the 
charter, because it is obvious we cannot reopen and amend it 
without new constitutional negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hard to believe as it may be, this despicable government has 
rejected the consensus reached by the main opposition parties. 
What would have been the impact of including social condition in 
the Canadian Human Rights Act? It would have given a remedy to 
all those who receive federal services, or who work in companies 
under federal jurisdiction. 
All those who have been victims of discrimination on the basis 
of their fortune or their wealth could have taken their case to 
a human rights tribunal to obtain redress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, Quebec has no choice but to become a country. 
It is a matter of time, of months, but Quebec will become a 
country as, indeed, the case should be for any nation. Quebec, 
which will be a sovereign country, has a lot of expertise in the 
area of human rights. Since 1977, the Quebec Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms forbids discrimination on that ground. With what 
result? It has allowed us to take three major steps forward in 
matters of law, in particular for single parents, who are often 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, a landlord refuses to rent an apartment to a 
single parent, on the ground that income may be inadequate, 
there can be a legal challenge. A human rights tribunal has 
ruled on this issue. Discrimination against a recipient of 
income security is not allowed. A landlord cannot refuse to rent 
an apartment to a recipient of income security in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an example of what lawmakers can do to support less 
fortunate people, who are often victims of discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a similar case regarding financial services. For 
instance, there is the case of a credit union near Quebec City, 
one I will not identify because it would not be relevant to my 
argument.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am always reluctant to 
rise on a point of order when a member is in the middle of his 
speech, but I find it somewhat difficult to sit here and listen 
to comments about the CRA and other matters that do not have 
anything to do with the particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that under your guidance you offer that kind of latitude, 
Mr. Speaker, but I wonder if you could ask the hon. member to 
speak to the bill rather than everything under the sun except the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance has asked through the Chair 
that members be relevant.  We do have a responsibility to be 
relevant when speaking to the bill.  I would ask the hon. member 
for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve to keep that in mind. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary may 
have had trouble concentrating. I remind him that we are talking 
about poverty here. We are talking about the budget. If the 
parliamentary secretary cannot see the link between the budget 
and poverty, he may not be fit to sit in the House of Commons. 
On this side of the House, we do see the link between poverty 
and the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's remark is totally uncalled for. He should remain 
seated and steer clear of such irrelevant comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I want to come back to the fact that we have 
asked the government several times to commit to an anti-poverty 
agenda. 
I think the government could have done a lot more with the 
budget surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House some examples. The government has more 
room to manoeuvre, because they literally stole from the 
provinces. We have to realize that. When we go over the budget, 
because we are debating its implementation today, we see a lot 
of measures taken in areas where the federal government has 
absolutely no right to interfere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the millennium scholarship fund. If government 
members could just look at the Constitution of Canada, they 
would have a hard time explaining how the federal government can 
interfere in education. And yet, that is what they are getting 
ready to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was decided that money could be made available, through a 
program called the millennium scholarship fund, for some of our 
fellow citizens who wanted to get a post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government making money available for this when it 
has absolutely no constitutional authority to do so? The federal 
government doesnot have the constitutional power to do so and, 
furthermore, since 1966, Quebec has benn offering the most 
generous loan and scholarship program in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government worries about training and says “We think 
that it is important for people to make a commitment to stay in 
school for at least 11, 12 or 13 years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is believed that men and women, in the 21st century, will 
change careers four or five times during their active life. So, 
they will be involved in a process of lifelong learning. Of 
course, the governments have the responsibility to give them 
access to the money that will allow them to acquire greater 
skills. However, it is not up to the federal government to give 
that money directly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has often asked the Minister of Human 
Resources Development to negotiate with the National Assembly, 
which is the only parliament Quebecers can truly identify with 
in America, to find a way to give them access to the money the 
federal government intends to invest in millennium scholarships. 
There has to be a single program, one managed by the Quebec 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the federal government listen? Of course not. It cannot shed 
its old attitude of interventionism and its lack of respect for 
provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on. I will address the whole issue of the 
Youth Employment Strategy. We all know that the Youth Employment 
Strategy deals with an area over which the federal government 
really has no jurisdiction. It is so true that, in the whole job 
training repatriation process leading to the manpower agreement 
concluded between Minister Harel and the federal minister 
responsible for human resources development, Minister Harel, on 
behalf of the government of Quebec, asked that the Youth 
Employment Strategy be included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Youth Employment Strategy is one of the tools available to 
the labour force to upgrade their skills on the job market. The 
federal government did not include it, which leaves us in a 
rather paradoxical situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The paradox comes from the government developing a program that 
does not make any sense because it is determined to interfere in 
areas like job training. This program does not make sense 
because it tells people that they cannot be unemployed, they 
cannot be studying and they cannot be on the job market in order 
to qualify for and participate in this program administered by 
the federal government under the Youth Employment Strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program is therefore geared toward a very specific clientele 
mainly comprised of dropouts. We certainly do not want to 
suggest that we should not help these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in my riding of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, there are 200 
community organisations. These are instrumental in making my 
riding such a great place to live. Very few organizations are 
interested in the Canadian Youth Strategy because they are not 
the clients mainly targeted by the strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program is ill-conceived. It does not make sense. It would 
make more sense to be able to ask that this program and the 
money spent on it be transferred to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also have much to say about the interference by the 
federal government in the field of health. The federal 
government's interference in this area is now a well-known fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian institutes for health research have been established. 
They will constitute virtual networks bringing together 
researchers and institutes to co-ordinate and target research 
efforts in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, the august backbenchers are going 
about their daily ritual of making noises barely loud enough to 
be heard in this civilized world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, I want to tell them that if they really want to help the 
Canadian government and their fellow citizens, they should add 
their voices to that of the Bloc in order to have the funds 
available for education and health transferred to the provinces. 
Under the Constitution, the provinces are primarily responsible 
for providing these services to our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to remind the House that there is 
another issue where we were entitled to expect the federal 
government to act, namely the Palais des congrès. Members know 
that Montreal is a hub in the tourist industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot hear what the obscure 
backbenchers are saying. Would you be so kind as to call them to 
order?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not asking them to come up with an idea, because that could 
be hard for them. However, all I am asking them is to pay 
attention a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec has pumped $159 million into the Palais 
des congrès to attract business tourists. We also know that the 
industry where the most jobs will be created in the coming years 
is the tourist industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the federal government do and what did it not do? It 
refused to support the initiative of the Quebec government and 
to inject the $69 million that we were entitled to expect. 
Did a member of parliament representing Quebec, a member of the 
Liberal caucus who represents Quebec voters, get involved in 
this issue where Quebec's interests were being trampled on? 
Certainly not. They all kept silent, as they all do when the 
time comes to defend Quebec's interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, there is the Bloc Quebecois. We will continue to 
defend Quebec's interests and we will continue to ask the 
federal government to inject $69 million, its share in the 
Palais des congrès project. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun—Saint-Henri, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
I hear my Bloc Quebecois colleague complain about the fact that 
the Canadian government is interfering in the area of health 
care while five minutes earlier he was asking the same 
government to get involved in his riding, I get totally 
confused. He wants us to help him in his riding. He wants us to 
invest in 200 non profit agencies in his riding, and five 
minutes later he accuses us of interfering in all of Quebec's 
affairs. I am totally confused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says we are not going to invest in the Palais des congrès, 
but if we do, he will say we are interfering in Quebec's 
affairs. It does not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes I wonder if the members of the Bloc Quebecois realize 
what they are asking us; they want us to get involved, but when 
we do, they say we are interfering in areas where we have no 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students in Quebec have trouble repaying their loans. We want to 
help them because their own government is not. Bloc members say 
“Give us the money. We will manage it”. Why are they not doing 
it? They do it after we offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always the same thing. Bloc members are constantly saying 
that the Canadian government, which tries to help every 
province, is interfering, but then they ask us to get involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the member is being pretty 
honest when he says he does not understand. It seems obvious to 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to remind him that Quebec sends $31 billion in 
taxes every year to the federal government. The member for 
Verdun—Saint-Henri has to be particularly out of touch with 
reality to say that Quebec does not help students. The 
Government of Quebec is the most generous government. It has 
been administering a loan and scholarship program since 1966. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government wants to make money available to help 
students pay their debts, it ought to do so through the Quebec 
Department of Education because, under the Constitution, 
education is a provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the member to rise in his place, if he has the 
courage, to tell us who, within the student community, agrees 
with the proposed formula. The student community is calling 
unanimously upon the federal government to make the millennium 
scholarship money available through the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there are 200 community organizations in 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve looking after our well-being. These 
organizations need money. It makes no sense at all that the 
youth strategy be managed by the federal government. It is 
ill conceived. It does not meet the needs of these community 
groups. It would be much more logical, in the context of the 
transfer of powers with regard to manpower training, if those 
funds were distributed by the Government of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the member will agree with my remarks because there is a 
consensus. If the member is listening to what the stakeholders 
in Quebec have to say, he will know that the Bloc Quebecois is 
saying the things those people want to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Raymond Lavigne:</B> Mr. Speaker, 
imagine, the Bloc member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve is calling for 
the youth strategy to be transferred to Quebec.  Job training 
has already been transferred, and all the papers have reported 
on the fiasco there has been in Quebec with that.  Now he is 
asking for transfer of the Youth Strategy to Quebec.  Frankly, I 
think the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve does not really 
realize what he is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing, there are as many volunteer organizations in my 
riding of Verdun—Saint Henri as in his riding.  Also, I am very 
proud of the fact that the Government of Canada is interfering 
in my Quebec riding. 
I am pleased to tell my colleague that, if the Youth Strategy, 
this wonderful program providing employment for students in the 
summer, is transferred, as far as job training is concerned, the 
not for profit organizations in my riding are anxious to get their 
hands on some funding for job training in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I knew we could count on the 
Liberal Party to stick it to Quebec, to always be there when it 
is time to run Quebec down.  I know that the hon. member is one 
of a long line that has always done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, all stakeholders in the workforce, the Conseil du 
patronat, the unions, the bodies concerned with job training, 
have expressed the wish that the Government of Quebec play the 
lead role in training, since it is normal for things to be that 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it true that, during the first year of implementation of 
these programs, there were adjustments that needed to be done, 
things to be re-examined?  Of course we are aware of that, 
but what I am saying is that if the hon. member for 
Verdun—Saint-Henri thinks it is a fiasco that manpower training 
programs were transferred to Quebec, it is because he is 
prepared to deny the interests of Quebec. It is unworthy of a 
member of parliament from Quebec to hold such a view.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it has been an interesting morning listening to the 
debate.  I am sure that it is a healthy debate, but my blood 
pressure rises once in a while according to the statements and 
arguments I have heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know we are debating Bill C-71, the budget implementation 
act.  This omnibus bill will implement programs from the 1999 
budget.  The first part of the bill includes an increase in the 
CHST for the purpose of health care funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make no mistake.  A shell game is being played.  In 1993 
when the Liberals took office the CHST was $18.8 billion. The 
measures in the most recent budget restore it to $14.5 billion, 
which is still $4.3 billion per year less than when the Liberals 
took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the pattern where the government guts health care and 
then a few years later tries to create the illusion that it is 
the defender of health care by throwing money back into the pot. 
At the end of the day we are getting less health care than when 
the Liberals took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These tactics have been used for years by federal governments 
that think the public is easily fooled by the shell game.  The 
public is more aware than the Liberals think it is.  The public 
is not being fooled.  It knows the Liberals are removing $3 from 
the system for every $1 they put back in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the 1999 budget came down it amounted to a Liberal apology 
for their reckless gutting of the health care system.  The 
government tried to regain some support by putting money back 
into the system, but Canadians realize that they have never paid 
so much for so little as they have under this government. 
There were 188,000 Canadians on waiting lists for health care 
services who would not accept this Liberal apology.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at my own community I see a tremendous number of 
people going to the U.S. for easily accessed CT scans and health 
care services, I wonder what the government is thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nurses are on strike.  Nurses are demanding that they get some 
more help.  They are overloaded.  Nurses are going to the U.S. 
When we look at the nurses going to the U.S., they are not the 40 
and 50 year old nurses who are established.  They are the younger 
trained nurses, the brain drain, the people who are leaving the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same for doctors.  They are leaving for the U.S., not 
just because of better pay but because of less taxes and more 
opportunities to practise their expertise.  If it were not for 
South African doctors emigrating to Canada, we would be in a 
terrible mess as far as the health care system is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget shows that the Liberal Party is still not 
interested in listening to Canadians.  Instead of providing tax 
relief, the government chooses to spend.  The budget announced 
$8.5 billion in cumulative new spending initiatives over the next 
three fiscal years.  The budget did not contain any significant 
debt or tax relief measures that would increase disposable income 
or create investment opportunities for entrepreneurs.  This is 
despite mounting pressure from Canadians to lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past few weeks we have been faced with the spectacle of 
large firms operating in Canada threatening to pick up and move 
south because they are no longer willing to contend with the high 
taxes and the high cost of doing business under the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The voices of these CEOs join the chorus of thousands of 
Canadians who have been trying to tell the government the same 
thing for years.  However, the Liberals are ignoring the message 
just like the Conservatives did in 1993, and we remember what the 
results were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Do you put your tax cuts on your VISA or 
MasterCard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  I see my hon. friends across the 
way are listening and I appreciate that.  That is the only way we 
will get a few things done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We noted yesterday on television the Premier of Ontario 
beginning an election based on the jobs he created.  I was always 
under the impression that it was all due to the Liberal 
government.  All of a sudden we hear a premier saying that 
because of his reductions and fiscal responsibility there are 
585,000 new jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually the events of the past few weeks have shown Canadians 
how confused the Liberals are on the issue of tax cuts and 
productivity.  In fact they are all over the map.  Some cabinet 
ministers suggest the country needs deep tax cuts to compete with 
the U.S.  Some even seem to recognize that high Canadian taxes 
are driving away investment in Canada and are making it difficult 
to build businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least some of these cabinet ministers seem to understand that 
a policy shift is required, but the Prime Minister has been quick 
to reign them in.  I suppose he does not want Canadians to get 
the idea that they actually deserve tax breaks.  If they are 
given a little finger, the Prime Minister is afraid they might 
sudden ask for a hand.  Then we would have a real problem because 
it would come out of the pockets of taxpayers and into the 
community for investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has been quick to squelch any break out of 
common sense.  Canadians want less taxes and smaller government, 
and he is giving them the opposite.  Instead of the tax cuts that 
everybody wants, we get increased taxes and less health care 
under a Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For good measure the budget also perpetuates discrimination 
against single income families in the tax code by requiring them 
to pay more tax than their dual income counterparts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been pointed out that the government overspends its 
budget every year.  Last year it went $3 billion over budget. 
This year it is about $7.6 billion.  It does this to ensure there 
is not enough left in the coffers to start giving Canadians tax 
relief.  It is a sneaky strategy, but the government has proven 
that it is quite willing to cook the books a little in order to 
maintain its strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's legacy will be its lack of foresight and its 
stubborn refusal to listen to people who know how to make the 
country better and more productive.   Whether they are everyday 
Canadians or industry experts, this is evidenced by the 
government's refusal to target money where it would be most 
beneficial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our treasury board critic uncovered some startling examples of 
misspent money by the government.  They include thousands of 
dollars spent on golf balls for a government department and 
hundreds of thousands of dollars on silverware and china for 
bureaucrats.  I included these examples in my most recent 
householder, and my constituents could not believe that their tax 
dollars were being wasted like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is painfully obvious that the government cannot keep a lid on 
the out of control spending of its departments.  The government 
spends money on wasteful things and keeps money away from the 
areas where it could benefit the economy.  There is no better 
example than the agriculture sector.  Everyone is familiar with

Congressional Medal of Honour.  He was decorated by both the 
American and Canadian governments, commissioned in the field and 
wounded in action.

the effects of his wounds for his entire life.  Allan or Phooey,

violence prevention strategy that leaves action to other levels 
of government or community groups with no commitment of 
resources.

action to prevent sexual assault amounts to tolerance of gender 
inequality.  Canadian women are tired of platitudes from this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, all members of the House were encouraged today to learn 
that the members of the G-8, including Russia, have agreed to a 
seven point plan to bring peace to Yugoslavia. The plan is 
reported to include the deployment of an armed international 
peacekeeping force in which the Russians would participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Prime Minister what role is Canada expected to play in 
the implementation of this plan? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for asking this 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking earlier with the Minister of Foreign Affairs who 
started to work on this compromise while he was in Moscow.  I 
would like to report to the House that he played a very important 
role in the drafting of this resolution.  Our role is not defined 
as yet.  We have to move hoping to have a resolution of the 
security council on that so that the force can be deployed under 
the authority of the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to see that the Russians are part of this 
agreement and that the G-7 ministers have agreed.  It is a very 
good sign of progress.  I hope now that the isolation of 
Milosevic will be so clear that he will realize he has to permit 
the Kosovars to go home as soon as possible so that the bombing 
can stop. 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, nothing comes for free in this world and presumably the 
Russians did not agree to participate in this G-8 plan without 
asking for something in return from the G-8 members. For example, 
it is well known that the Russians have been asking for $10 
billion and more in assistance from the IMF and other economic 
and trade assistance from the west to help a faltering economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Prime Minister tell us what commitments the G-8 made to 
Russia to secure its involvement and what those commitments will 
cost? 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I really do not know why the Leader of the Opposition is 
throwing a canard like that.  I think that the Russians want to 
have peace in Yugoslavia, and they want to participate with the 
G-8 to find a political and diplomatic solution to this conflict 
that we all hope will stop soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know of any quid pro quo for them to sign.  They are 
determined, like other countries of the G-8, to have a diplomatic 
solution.  And they did not ask a price for that.  Their reward 
will be the same as ours.  It will be peace. 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Canada has already committed 800 Canadian troops to a 
peacekeeping mission in the Balkans.  Originally the plan was for 
these troops to work with a British brigade as part of a NATO led 
peacekeeping mission.  Now they will presumably be deployed under 
a UN mandate which will include both civic administration as well 
as peacekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are our Canadian troops properly prepared and equipped for any 
changes in role which the implementation of this new plan may 
include? 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the answer is yes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canada should do everything possible to make peace a reality in 
Kosovo.  That will inevitably mean committing a sizeable Canadian 
military contingent to the region. I am concerned however that we 
may not have the resources to extend any such commitment beyond 
the current 800 soldiers who have just been deployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the defence minister considering the expansion of Canada's 
current commitment beyond what we have already sent there? 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there has not been any request to that 
effect but certainly if there is, then of course we would have a 
very close look at it.  There is nothing in the G-8 terms today 
that would change the picture in terms of the 800 peacekeepers we 
have sent over there.  They can certainly play a very useful role 
under the G-8 formula for a solution to this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
our military planners talk of double tours of duty which reveal 
just how strapped the Canadian forces are for personnel. Our 
soldiers are already overtasked and they are overworked in 
Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the defence minister assure the House that any further 
commitment to an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo will 
not include troops who are currently serving in Bosnia? 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are no plans to do that in the 
immediate future.  We do have a formula for people coming back 
from peacekeeping duties to spend some time back here at home 
before they can be deployed into another theatre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member talking about taking somebody directly from Bosnia 
to Kosovo?  No, we are not looking at that prospect at all.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the number we came up with, 800, and the roles that we 
are asking them to play in this peacekeeping are to bear in mind 
the fact that we want them to come back home after a six month 
period of time when they can be reunited with their families.  We 
have taken all of that into consideration.  That is all part of 
the quality of life that we want to improve for our Canadian 
troops.

Mr. Speaker, the RCMP desperately needs proper funding to fight 
organized crime and sex offenders.  This requires greater 
staffing at forensic laboratories and the inclusion of a DNA 
databank in the CPIC.  This databank addition will cost up to $38 
million in the first five years.  Our police forces need this 
technology, yet the government refuses to commit sufficient money 
to accomplish the necessary upgrades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the public interest and the necessity to provide the RCMP

<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must raise a point of order with 
regard to the language used in this House. A few minutes ago, I 
informed the Bloc Quebecois whip accordingly, because it 
concerns words that were used by his leader and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that we may not be able to deal with this issue 
immediately, but I want to raise it nonetheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to submit to you that two expressions were used earlier 
which are not appropriate in this House. 
First, you will understand that it is unacceptable to refer to a 
parliamentarian as a “Canadien français de service”, a token 
French Canadian. I simply want to point this out without fanfare 
because I am a French Canadian myself and I am sure, Mr. 
Speaker, that you will understand what I mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second expression refers to something that is clearly 
mentioned in Beauchesne's list of unparliamentary expressions. 
It was used during oral question period. The term collabo, or 
collaborationist, was used in reference to the Prime Minister. A 
collabo was a sympathizer of the Nazi regime in France, during 
World War II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Mr. Speaker, under Beauchesne's rules, which were 
established by your predecessors, citation 489 provides that the 
word Nazi is unacceptable. That ruling was made on February 
22, 1962. 
One of your predecessors also ruled, on June 25, 1964, that 
Canadian Mussolini, which refers to another form of nazism, is 
also unacceptable in reference to a parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just heard a third expression relating to nazism or to Nazi 
sympathizers in reference to a parliamentarian. I submit 
that it is no more acceptable in this House than the other two 
expressions that were deemed unparliamentary many years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. government House leader did not name any 
member in particular. He heard these words. He knows where they 
came from. I would ask him who used them, and perhaps to think 
about it.

I will wait for the government House leader to identify who said 
what, but in the meantime I would ask him to note that the 
member for Bourassa referred to members of the Bloc Quebecois as 
collabos de Parizeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The member for Bourassa is said to have used the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not afraid 
to call a spade a spade. If the member says he heard things, he 
must have heard them, but if he wants us to identify every 
member who called somebody names as the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot and most members who are here did, we can do 
it. But we should not start playing that kind of game, we could 
be here a long time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Today, during Oral Question Period there was 
what I would call a lot of noise. Words such as emmerdant and

other words than those in the House of Commons, surely. Once it 
starts on one side, the other one follows. I would ask all 
members to be very judicious in their choice of words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If indeed such words were used—I asked the hon. leader of the

any member in particular—I would ask all members to please 
refrain from using them in the House of Commons from now on. 
Sometimes, even, members get very loud.

it sit there.  However, we come here every day for question 
period and it is up to us to conduct ourselves in such a way that

</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party have been after the government since 1993 
to develop some foresight, identify some of the inevitable 
changes to agriculture and develop a plan to prepare our industry 
to meet these challenges head on and safeguard our farmers. 
Instead we got foot-dragging and inaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pushed the government on its 1993 red book promise to 
decrease input costs and implement a whole farm income 
stabilization program.  However, like so many Liberal promises, 
it was forgotten on election night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past fall the government even denied that an income crisis 
existed in agriculture and pointed to the NISA program as a 
suitable safety net for any disaster. 
Farmers know that NISA is just not designed for the type of 
crisis we experienced. By the time the Liberals acknowledged 
their mistake, it not only cost farmers severely but we lost a 
whole bunch of young farmers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals stalled in coming up with a program and when they 
finally did come up with something, it was totally inadequate. 
They went through the motions of listening to people in the 
industry.  Then they came up with something nobody asked for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AIDA program is poorly designed, costly to apply for and 
will not target the producers who need the compensation the most. 
What is more, when it was announced, the key details of the plan 
were missing.  The government had enough time to study the 
problem and consult but it launched its program with no consensus 
with the provinces or farmers on how to implement it. It did not 
do its homework.  It is widely recognized as a failure.  It is 
not bankable, it is not providing relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many farmers in my riding are not even bothering to fill out the 
application because it will not benefit them.  The accountants 
tell them the cost of completing the form is going to be more 
than they will obtain from the AIDA program.  That is how much 
Liberals care about westerners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the comparison when foreign governments were overfishing 
in Canadian waters.  The Liberal minister at that time chased 
those foreign boats across the high seas and even fired a few 
guns.  But when foreign governments attack our Canadian farmers 
with tens of billions of dollars in unfair subsidies, we get 
inaction and useless rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Liberals struck a committee to travel in the west 
to try to understand why westerners will not vote for them.  They 
do not understand that the answer lies in their own record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This lack of foresight is so evident in our trade negotiations. 
One of the reasons for the agriculture income crisis is that the 
Liberal government dropped the ball in the last round of 
international trade negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our negotiators agreed to a 15% reduction in subsidies to 
farmers, which is what everyone else was supposed to follow, but 
we reduced our subsidies by 85%. While the U.S. maintained 24% of 
its subsidies in a green box program, Canada only maintained 8%. 
Today European subsidies are providing farmers with an average of 
$175 an acre to grow a crop plus a $2 per bushel export subsidy 
in the event of a surplus. We created an unlevel playing field 
that is financially breaking every farmer in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just a lack of anticipation and planning and this 
Liberal government has to take responsibility for it.  That is 
why farmers will not vote Liberal.  Farmers have no money left to 
tax.  I heard the hon. member for Medicine Hat so appropriately 
recite that poem about taxation and it fits perfectly the bill of 
the western farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole, the government's high tax policy has undermined 
the productivity of the Canadian economy which in turn has 
reduced our standard of living. We have seen devastating results 
from the wrong-headed policies of this Liberal government and the 
Tories before it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1970 Canada ranked number four in the world in terms of per 
capita income.  In 1995 after 25 years of overtaxation and 
overspending our per capita income global rating fell to 12. 
Next year the average Canadian family will be paying $5,000 more 
in taxes than they were in 1993, and they were already overtaxed

</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the current government seems unwilling or unable 
to meet this challenge.  The bill we are speaking to today is a 
prime example of how the government continues to overspend and 
still not reduce taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard a lot of complaints today about taxation and 
overspending.  A lot of blame has been pointed in different 
directions, at provincial governments and federal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are getting to the point where we will finally have to blame 
Christopher Columbus for all the problems. The impression is that 
he was a Liberal.  Why was Christopher Columbus accused of being 
a Liberal?  When he started off from Spain, he did not know where 
he was going; when he got to North America, he did not know where 
he was and he did it on borrowed money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe that is where the fault lies because we do not seem to 
understand in this House that it lies with previous federal 
governments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is with a sense of duty that I rise in this House today to 
speak to Bill C-71. I am not doing it with pleasure because the 
measures contained in the budget being implemented through this 
bill are not very positive, particularly for Quebec, but I feel 
it is my job and my duty, as parliamentarian, to express my 
views on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not much has changed since the tabling of the budget in this 
House, since the budget debate in this House and since the 
beginning of the debate on the bill before us today. 
It makes us wonder if anyone in government is paying any 
attention to the views expressed here by parliamentarians from 
Canada and Quebec, which views reflect the concerns, fears and 
expectations of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, on the night the budget was tabled, I brought 
together in my riding office a number of socio-economic 
stakeholders from my riding to hear their preliminary reactions. 
Then, not wanting to limit this exercise to preliminary 
reactions, I invited these people to share with me, in writing, 
their concerns, their expectations and what caught their 
attention in the federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to thank the socio-economic stakeholders 
who went to the trouble of spending a few hours in my riding 
office to listen to the budget speech and share their views with 
me on the impact of the budget's content. I also wish to thank 
socio-economic stakeholders who later went to the trouble of 
sending us their comments and suggestions on the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may, I would like to list the following people: 
representatives of the Voluntary Self-Help Centre of 
Saint-Amable; representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry of Varennes and of L'Envolée, the 
Voluntary Action Centre of Sainte-Julie, among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, I would like to express some concerns I have 
been told of. After that, I will make my own personal comments, 
which are mostly based not only on my personal perception and my 
own analysis of the federal budget and on my political 
expertise, but also on the analysis done by my fellow citizens 
which have expressed their own views, namely through 
socioeconomic stakeholders who took part in the consultations in 
my riding.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We noted, among other things, the lack of measures and funds to 
support the community. We are well aware that the budget cuts 
made by the Liberal government since its election in 1993 have 
had a severe impact on provincial budgets, since there have been 
cuts to transfers for health, social programs and post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, provinces were also forced to make cuts. 
Finally, a part of the social mission of the Canadian state and 
the Quebec state has been passed on to community organizations 
in our respective communities, without giving them, as a 
counterpart, any financial or material or human resources that 
would have allowed them to cope with the increased workload 
governments forced on them because of federal cuts to provincial 
transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some concerns have also been expressed regarding the increase in 
the estimates for national defence. 
Some would argue that the living conditions of our military 
personnel made it necessary to index the estimates, to increase 
them substantially. It is amazing to see the government coming 
back after years of drastic cuts, particularly in the defence 
budget, and saying “our military personnel have atrocious living 
conditions and something has to be done to improve their 
standard of living”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the national defence budget had not been cut so drastically, 
perhaps the government would not have had to increase it again a 
few years later. There seems to be some inconsistency in what 
the government says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shall now make a few comments, if I may, on the measures 
announced in the budget for transfers to the provinces. As far 
as health care is concerned, I would like to read part of an 
article which speaks for itself. This article, written by Manon 
Cornellier, was published in <I>Le Devoir</I> Saturday, March 4, 1995. 
I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Ottawa is not planning on spreading the social program money 
based only on the demographic weight of each province” said 
Minister Marcel Massé during an interview. “It would be the 
worst possible situation for Quebec, so much so that it makes 
absolutely no sense to me that this could be the solution” said 
the minister. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also another interesting article that appeared as well 
on March 4, 1995, this time in <I>La Presse.</I> It was written by 
Philippe Dubuisson. I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new formula is supposed to be established for the distribution 
of federal funds between the provinces. The Minister of Finance, 
Jean Campeau, said the worst case scenario would be the 
distribution of social transfer payments on a per capita 
basis...But the federal minister, Marcel Massé, clearly 
indicated this formula would not be used, because it would 
penalize poorer provinces, to the benefit of Ontario, Alberta 
and British Columbia. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of these very clear and precise assurances given by the 
minister, we would have believed the government would maintain 
this position and would not have changed the formula to 
calculate social transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, without warning, the government decided, during the 
months following this fine statement from the minister, to 
change the formula in such a way as to adapt at least 50% of 
provincial transfers on a per capita basis, to calculate them 
according to population. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new formula was to be established over a period of 5 years. 
Provincial governments, including of course Quebec, prepared 
their budgets according to these announcements and to this 
policy the federal government had put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the last budget, the Minister of Finance suddenly 
announced he was unilaterally changing the formula. 
The government has announced that, instead of 50%, all of the 
social transfers will now be granted on an equal per capita 
basis and that not only will the new formula be applied to 100% 
of the transfers, but the transition will be made over three 
years instead of five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally unacceptable to Quebec, especially since the 
provinces that stand to benefit from the federal government's 
generosity are the ones identified four years ago by the 
President of the Treasury Board as the ones that would benefit 
from this new formula, namely Ontario, Alberta and B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to point out that, under this new formula, the have 
provinces of Canada will get the following amounts in addition 
to the transfers they would have normally received. Ontario will 
get close to a $1 billion increase in transfers, B.C. almost 
$400 million, and Alberta some $300 million a year, while Quebec, 
the second most populated province of Canada, will get a mere 
$150 million increase in transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally unacceptable. We saw the consequences yesterday 
in the budget brought down by the Government of Ontario. 
It is obvious that all the benefits coming from the federal 
government allowed the Ontario government to further reduce its 
taxes, thereby widening the existing gap between the current 
taxation levels in Quebec and Ontario. In turn, this will 
accentuate the difference in the rate of economic development 
between the two provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the best of cases, we could have understood the decision to 
use the per capita formula for health and education. But how can 
one explain the use of the same formula for welfare? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the transfer levels for welfare should have 
been based on needs, not on the number of inhabitants in each 
province. 
The number of welfare recipients should have been taken into 
account in the calculation of the transfer payments. But even in 
this respect, the federal government chose to use the per capita 
formula, putting Quebec at a great disadvantage because, as we 
know, Quebec has a proportionately higher number of welfare 
recipients than Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would have us believe that a transfer payment of $1.4 
billion, which is supposed to compensate for the current 
shortfall due to the new calculation formula, is a good deal for 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comparison is biased. They are comparing apples and oranges. 
First, richer provinces like Ontario, Alberta and BC, will 
receive these additional amounts every year, while the $1.4 
billion will not be a recurring payment. It will be paid only 
once, this year. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT68"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT68"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1535

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, it should be pointed out that this $1.4 billion is not 
a gift. It is only an adjustment on amounts owed to Quebec in 
the last few years. These amounts were owed to the Government of 
Quebec anyway, but so far the government has not been able to 
rely on this money to fulfil its obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years later, the federal government pays up and says “This 
is compensation for money given to the more affluent provinces”. 
It is not compensation, it is money owed by the federal 
government. 
This shows, beyond any comparison, that Quebec is maintained in 
a state of economic subordination within this federal system, 
where economic development programs are, of course, far more 
generous for provinces such as Ontario than they are for Quebec; 
the federal government is generous with Quebec only when it 
comes to social welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the per capita question. If we were to apply 
the same logic to structuring programs, to wealth-creating 
programs, to economic development programs, to job-creating 
programs, we would have a completely different picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec, with almost 25% of Canada's population, receives only 
15% to 17% of federal government research and development 
spending, goods and services procurement, and capital assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had Quebec received its fair share of productive spending, it 
would probably not be receiving equalization payments, but 
making them to the have-not provinces.  Whence my earlier 
conclusion that Quebec is obviously being kept in a state of 
economic dependence within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now wish to address the issue of health. 
Among the blatant illusions held out by the Minister of 
Finance's last budget, the one about health was certainly, to my 
way of thinking, the biggest and the most insidious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the public is hard hit by the major cuts to the health 
care system resulting from the federal government's cuts to 
provincial transfer payments.  By the way, 80% of the cuts made 
in Quebec's health care system by the Government of Quebec were 
a direct result of cuts in provincial transfer payments by the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is therefore only too delighted at the announcement, 
or the illusion being held out, that more money is going to be 
put into the health care system. 
And this is where the problem lies, because the budget in fact 
does not reinvest a cent in the health network.  In fact, they 
announced, nobody dreamt it, an additional $11.5 billion in 
health transfers to the provinces over five years, including $2 
billion in 1999-00 and $9 billion between now and 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This increase in transfers the federal government is dangling 
before the provinces is nothing more than a reduction in the 
amount of the cuts planned.  Instead of absorbing cuts of $42 
billion between 1994 and 2003, the provinces will have only $33 
billion drawn off.  And they are expected to be grateful for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, this announcement of $2 billion for all of Canada 
in 1999-00, is barely the amount Quebec alone is deprived of 
annually and barely a third of the $6.3 billion the provinces 
had sought annually from the federal government in order to 
nullify the effects of its cuts. However, the government 
remained deaf to these requests.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has chosen to accumulate huge surpluses, which it hides in 
its budget activities, on the backs of the particularly 
disadvantaged, the sick, the unemployed, the workers and the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a lazy government that has made others carry its 
responsibilities.  Barely 11% of federal cuts were made in its 
own operating programs and budgets.  The rest were imposed on 
transfers to the provinces and on employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget, which the bill before us is to implement, is 
discriminatory, unacceptable and unfair to the public, and we 
must oppose it vigorously.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively and I 
have again come to the same conclusion:  Bloc members continually 
pit one against the other and continue to pit Quebec against the 
rest of Canada.  That is their mission.  Since that is why they 
are here, what else can one expect? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also talked about how, when we moved to the equal per 
capita formula, Ontario somehow benefited more than Quebec and 
that B.C. and Alberta somehow benefited more than Quebec.  I 
point out to the hon. member that Quebec did in fact balance its 
provincial budget when it received a $1.4 billion increase in 
equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the hon. member that the province of Quebec 
also benefited from an increase in equalization payments.  The 
province of Quebec receives 34% of transfers from the federal 
government.  It has, as the hon. member mentioned in his speech, 
just under 25% of the population.  One has some difficulty 
understanding how a Bloc member can continue to stand up and say 
that somehow the rest of Canada is being so unfair to the 
province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked why we had moved to the equal per capita? Is the hon. 
member actually saying that in the eyes of the federal 
government—and there are a number of people sitting in the 
gallery today—some Canadians are more equal than others 
depending upon which province they live in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We inherited a system which was a cap on cap.  When we were able 
to find the resources, we moved to an equal per capita so that 
every Canadian, regardless of what province they lived in, would 
receive an equal amount of money in transfers that go to the 
provinces for health care services and education.  I do not 
understand how the hon. member can say that we are being unfair 
to Quebec because we are moving to an equal per capita system for 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also talked about economic dependency.  Has the hon. 
member ever thought that perhaps the economic dependency that he 
is talking about is really triggered by the consistent push by 
the Bloc for separation?  That underlying theme does have an 
impact on Quebec's economic development each and every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the bottom line is that they have nothing to add to the 
debate so they will just pit the rest of Canada against Quebec 
and say, “oh, my God, we are being unfair again”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament, he should at least have the decency 
to say that there are things the federal government offers to the 
province of Quebec and to all Canadians, regardless of where they 
live, that are of benefit.  There is a reason to be part of this 
great country and that is to ensure that we all move into the 
next millennium in a way that we are able to prosper together. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the parliamentary secretary might have benefited from listening 
to my presentation, since it contained a number of the responses 
he is seeking.  I will, however, be pleased to remind him of a 
number of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, yes, of course, the Bloc Quebecois is a 
sovereignist party, because we consider, and have numerous 
occasions to demonstrate, that the federal regime penalizes and 
disadvantages Quebec, and that Quebec would have a better chance 
to develop if it were not part of the Canadian federation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Quebec and Canada would be in a far better position to 
look to their own development, in partnership with each other, 
if they agreed to acknowledge that they are indeed two distinct 
countries, completely different one from the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our mission in the meantime, however, also involves defending 
the interests of Quebecers to the best of our ability.  I cannot 
therefore accept the argument put forth by the parliamentary 
secretary that we are here for the sole purpose of denigrating 
everything the federal government might do. 
There is no doubt that the recent budget, which provides that 
the transfer payments will now be calculated on a per capita 
basis, is totally unacceptable and detrimental to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not I nor the Bloc Quebecois saying that, it is the 
President of the Treasury Board. I will quote him again, since 
the parliamentary secretary did not listen. In 1995, the 
President of the Treasury Board said “This would be the worst 
possible situation for Quebec. It would be so bad that, in my 
opinion, it does not make sense that this could be the 
solution”. After all, it is not the sovereignists who decided 
that. Yet, this is the solution chosen by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where were the Liberal ministers and members from Quebec when 
this per capita formula for transfers to the provinces was 
adopted at Quebec's expense? What did these people do? Why did 
they remain silent, instead of protecting the interests of the 
Quebecers who elected them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate the hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes, who 
found the right words to describe an unfair situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that our fellow Quebecers who listened to him 
will share his views. Why is it that we, sovereignists, really 
want to have our own country, while they do not want us to leave 
this country? The government claims that it gives a lot and that 
it is fair. As for us, we say that something is not working. 
Even in the budget, one can see that the regions are not getting 
anything. The government collects a lot of money from the 
unemployed, but it does not give them back that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my colleague. 
What would he call a situation like this, where the poor are 
getting poorer, where 1.5 million children do not have enough to 
eat, and where the government keeps saying that everything is 
just fine? What would the hon. member call such a situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Matapédia—Matane for his excellent question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would tend to call it blindness. They refuse to see reality as 
it is, to acknowledge that this formula puts Quebec at a 
disadvantage, so much so that Liberal members of Quebec have 
voted for the budget and will probably vote for the bill we are 
now debating. In doing so they will go against what the 
President of the Treasury Board said four years ago about that 
formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the secretary parliamentary trot out the rhetoric that 
the government has been spouting in recent months, saying, for 
instance, that without the $1.4 billion, Quebec could not have 
balanced its budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to say at the outset that without the cuts the government 
put in place two, three and even four years ago, the Quebec 
government would have balanced its budget and eliminated its 
deficit. The federal government, by its unfair reduction of 
provincial transfers, delayed by four years fiscal balance in 
Quebec. This was my first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I believe I clearly explained earlier that the $1.4 
billion is in no way a gift to Quebec. This money was owed to 
Quebec according to the federal government's own calculations. 
The federal government had not paid this amount and waited until 
this year to do so. Therefore, that payment is in no way 
exceptional. This was money Quebec was supposed to have in any 
case to draw up its budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, I mention to the parliamentary secretary, for his 
own personal information, that for this year the Government of 
Quebec announced a surplus of $2.9 billion in its budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that even without the $1.4 billion in equalization 
payments the Canadian government brags about giving Quebec, 
which allegedly allowed it to balance its budget, the government 
of Quebec would have reached a balanced budget om any case, in 
spite of all the obstacles put in its way by the federal 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to make some remarks on Bill C-71, an act to implement 
certain provisions of the budget.  Throughout the debate so far, 
and this includes what I have heard in my riding, one clear theme 
has emerged: if we want tax reform, vote Reform.  That is the 
first message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a few minutes to talk about the government's no 
relief tax policies as shown in Bill C-71 and the effects they are 
having on Canadians.  I want 
to talk about Canadians who live in the Prince Albert riding, not 
Canadians in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are having difficulty retaining our youth and our talent.  I 
recognize that they are not always the same, that talent is 
talent at every age but youth is confined to youth.  This 
phenomenon affects our ability to engage in entrepreneurship and 
takes away our young people with talent, older people who have 
been trained in the university system, in the arts and 
technologies, and our business people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are leaving Canada.  Patriotism and pride are not 
enough to keep them.  Patriotism and pride do not feed them or 
their children.  They do not pay the mortgage.  They do not make 
the car payments.  They do not pay for fuel and they do not pay 
the taxes.  People are voting with their feet and with their 
moving vans.  That is what is happening in the country under 
the Liberal government and its high tax policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person may well ask who are the beneficiaries of the high 
policy.  It is the foreign recruiters and moving companies.  Very 
few other people, if any, are benefiting from high taxes aside 
from possibly tax collectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk about the negative effect high taxes are 
having on the protection and maintenance of health care and 
social services not only in Canada but in Saskatchewan in 
particular.  In that regard I have a letter that I wrote to my 
constituents which has been copied by another hon. member of the 
House.  It shows the effect of high taxes on Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the Liberals calling this budget?  They are calling it 
the health reinvestment budget or the health budget, but as usual 
their numbers do not add up.  We can just take a look at what the 
Liberal government's so-called reinvestment in health care 
amounts to in this budget as evidenced in the details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 when the Liberals took power the Canada health and 
social transfer was $1,453 per taxpayer.  When we take into 
account the latest budget the amount will be $1,005.  That is 
quite a decrease, $448 to be exact or a 31% drop compared with 
1993.  In 1993 it was $18.8 billion in total.  This restores it 
to $14.5 billion, which is still $4.3 billion less than when the 
Liberals came into power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put this into further context, we should not forget the six 
years of bracket creep when people had inflationary raises.  Also 
inflation reduces the power of those who have not even managed to 
get a so-called inflationary increase in their wages.  We begin 
to see the effects this is having on individual Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals will be putting back $11.5 billion over the next 
five years.  Big deal.  They are taking three dollars from the 
system for every dollar they put back in.  The hon. member for 
Macleod illustrated this very effectively with a blood bag and a 
syringe to show how much less is in that blood bank after the 
Liberal budget of this spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will raise the income threshold at which the 
Canada child tax benefit begins to be phased out by $9,590 from 
its current level of $25,921.  When it was announced in the 1998 
budget and implemented in July, replacing it with the working 
implement supplement, the new Canada child tax benefit began 
clawing back benefits at lower levels of income than the existing 
system. 
When it was announced in 1998 the clawback began when a family's 
after tax income exceeded $25,921.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What effects are Liberal high tax policies having on Canadians 
with no tax relief in sight?  Let me give one example that 
happened to me recently.  I had a request from a family who 
wanted to see me in my office.  In came a young father, his wife 
and their little child.  What did they say?  The man was 
completely mad; he  was really upset.  The wife was near tears 
and the child was just plain cute and did not know what she was 
growing up into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are both working trying to put their lives together and to 
maintain a lifestyle that is suitable for a married family. It 
turns out with two incomes they are unable to make ends meet. 
They are looking at possibly losing their car.  If he loses his 
car, he loses his job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was he complaining about?  He was not complaining about the 
gross amount of his salary.  He was complaining about high taxes, 
high Canada pension plan premiums and high employment insurance 
premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance surplus was $19.1 billion at the end of 
1998.  The public accounts indicate that the surplus is 
considerably larger.  We know there is nothing less than that in 
the account. The premiums were reduced all the way from $2.70 per 
$100 of insurable earnings to $2.55 per $100 of insurable 
earnings. These are nickels and dimes.  These people are going 
under and they are crying out for relief from those kinds of 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan contribution rate increased to 7% from 
6.4% in January 1999, which is an annual increase of $1.4 billion 
taken out of the pockets of Canadian taxpayers, whether they are 
business owners and their businesses are having to pay their 
portion or people who are actually on the frontline doing the 
work.  The Canada pension plan rate has increased every year 
during the Liberal tenure.  It started at 5% in 1993.  By the end 
of 2003 it will rise to 9.9%, which is a 98% increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal income tax increased through bracket creep. It was 
never eliminated and it was not mitigated in this budget. We will 
see another $900 million taken out of the pockets of Canadians 
through bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax pain is causing the brain drain.  What good is it for 
the government to promise good health care when the effect that 
high taxes have over time is to actually diminish the tax base 
required to support the health care and social services Canadians 
desire? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to turn to how high taxes contribute to an overall 
depleting effect on our tax base.  It does this by driving away 
our youth and our talent.  That is a sad reality.  John Roth, 
chief executive officer at Nortel, stated just last week: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxation is testing the allegiance of some of Canada's best and 
brightest. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That results in a reduced tax base.  Peter Foster in yesterday's 
<I>Financial Post</I> wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes must come down if we want long term revenues generated by 
economic activity to increase. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister not know this?  Surely he must.  Maybe 
he just does not care.  We wonder what his answer would be.  He 
seems to think that high taxes are part of the Canadian way of 
life. If he really thinks that, he is living in a dream and it is 
not the Canadian dream.  The rest of them are living in a 
nightmare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister might think that high taxes are just part of 
the Canadian way of life, but he knows they cannot keep 
increasing.  The tolerance threshold has been reached and 
surpassed this year.  The government continues to ignore the 
actual effects of high taxes on society as we began to see in the 
past few years.  We are watching our youth and our talent go 
elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who travel back and forth to western Canada or other 
parts of Canada talk to young people who have been recruited by 
foreign firms.  They are going to find out what improvements are 
available to them in other tax regimes and they are not looking 
back.  They are not only going south.  They are going in other 
directions. 
I want to paraphrase a letter that was written to my 
constituents, and borrowed by another member.  The so-called 
brain drain phenomenon is created by high taxes and is a growing 
cross-generational problem.  Many Canadians think of the brain 
drain primarily in terms of the younger generation who are 
heading south to more favourable tax and employment conditions. 
However, events taking place in northeast Saskatchewan this month 
highlight a new reality.  The brain drain is not limited to 
youth.  It is a serious problem that crosses generational 
boundaries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider first the recent commentary from influential Canadian 
entrepreneurs Paul Desmarais and Jim Pattison concerning the 
insidious effects the high taxation policies of successive 
Liberal governments, including the Mulroney Conservatives, are 
starting to have on our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Montreal's Paul Desmarais calls Canadian taxes exorbitant and a 
drain of potential income for Canada.  “When the government is 
too greedy”, he says, “people find other solutions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jim Pattison, also a self-made billionaire from Vancouver, calls 
high taxes the number one issue for every senior executive in the 
country.  Although he remains in Canada out of a sense of 
loyalty, he says he does not blame those who leave in favour of 
lower taxes and a stronger dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could argue that the opinions of wealthy businessmen are 
irrelevant to the debate over taxation of the broad Canadian 
population.  However, it is not only boomer billionaires are who 
are speaking out, people at all income levels are raising their 
voices in protest, including those whom we assume are the meat 
and potato beneficiaries of our current tax system, our 
professionals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fact was reinforced to me as I prepared to sponsor a forum 
on health care in my riding involving my colleague, the member 
for Macleod, who is the Reform Party's health critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of conversations with physicians, other health 
care professionals and concerned constituents, I was surprised at 
the interest shown in discussing, not health care, but the havoc 
the Liberal government tax policy is wreaking on our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter and subsequent telephone conversation, one doctor, 
whose name is being withheld at his request, was invited to 
discuss health care.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a physician working in this country for 24 years, I now 
discover that I have no alternative but to leave this 
country...over the past five years I have seen friends and 
colleagues leave this country in disgust due to the brutal levels 
of personal income taxes...I now pay 54% in taxes and 
contributions to government...and could not afford to ever retire 
if I remain in this country...it is obvious that the governments 
of the day have no interest in meaningfully reducing personal 
income taxes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say that he and at least two of his colleagues 
were planning to move within the next few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This poses a further, more immediate problem.  Who will practice 
medicine in Saskatchewan?  How can Saskatchewan, already facing a 
shortage of rural doctors, ensure a quality health care system 
when its doctors say they are being taxed out of the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brain drain is neither a phenomenon of youth nor a minor 
issue. It is a symptom of stress and the predictable result of a 
bad tax system.  We must take it seriously by providing 
sustainable tax relief or suffer the crippling long term effects 
into the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I see from this is that the doctor was not even looking for 
more money.   He was not looking for better working conditions or 
a new place to go.  He was not asking for a new hospital, a new 
office or new operating equipment.  He wanted to live a life 
commensurate with his actual income which is taxed to the point 
where it is not the income he thought he would have and not 
enough for him to retire on without being required to work the 
rest of his life to try to turn his practice over to someone 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social science has identified at least one fundamental 
characteristic of human motivation and that is that humans are 
motivated to avoid pain.  If one is to be motivated to avoid pain 
then one moves away from it.  If the Canadian tax system is 
causing taxpayers pain they will move away from the tax system, 
and that is to other countries where the tax regime is not so 
onerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to understand why our youth and talent are leaving 
Canada for the U.S. and, I might add, for other places.  It is to 
avoid the pain of paying high taxes here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither loyalty to Canada, nor our good lifestyle, nor the 
natural beauty of our country is enough to keep them if they 
cannot make a living.  That is a base need of all people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention that we are paying a lot more but getting 
a lot less.  It is the impact that taxes are having on services. 
We see this dismal aspect in the budget every time we think about 
the services that Canadians are getting for the taxes that they 
are paying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out, despite the increase to the health and social 
transfer, which was not very much, we should remember it was the 
Liberals who gutted and savaged these things.  We have to 
question their priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about an issue that arose in my riding as a 
result of what the government would call tax cuts or tax savings, 
which I think is poor spending.  The government will open a joint 
office with the Saskatchewan government, ostensibly to save 
money.  This office will serve a very large rural area with a lot 
of aboriginal people who use that as their service base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will no longer have a federal presence in the town I come 
from, which has a population of around 5,000 people.   To go from 
there to the next town where there is an employment insurance 
office takes one hour each way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people come into town to use the services, to buy their 
groceries, to visit the doctor, to visit the dentist, to visit 
the lawyer, to do their dry cleaner and maybe even their laundry. 
Whatever services they needed they could get in that town.  All 
of a sudden, those who most need employment insurance services 
will be forced to drive at least another hour one way to access 
those services.  That means those Canadians who may now be off 
the government's tax roll, thank goodness, are all of a sudden 
having to pay their own way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to wonder what the net benefit will be of this. 
Businesses in my home town will be losing business because these 
people will drive right by.  There is another negative effect of 
the system, but do they get their tax dollars back?  Nothing 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the government find creative ways to spend the money it 
says it is saving?   We will now have two people driving out a 
couple of times a week to sit in an office.  They will both 
probably need to have laptops because desktop computers no longer 
do the job.  We all know laptops are more expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will probably need a vehicle to drive.  I have heard a 
rumour, but I would not doubt it, that they will be driving a 
Jeep Cherokee to get there.  They will be paid overtime for 
travel.  As the weather in northeast Saskatchewan is notoriously 
unpredictable, more often than not, they will have to stay 
overnight, in which case they will probably be paid right through 
the night.  They will be on overtime for the rest of the week. 
They will have their hotel and meals bills paid.  What kind of a 
saving is that going to be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, I think we are definitely paying more.  We keep on 
paying more and we keep on getting less under this regime.  It is 
so frustrating for the people in my riding.  I had to say these 
things on their behalf because they have had it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young family that came into my office to express their 
despair at the situation in which they find themselves, both 
working, paying for child care, paying high taxes, paying high 
employment insurance premiums and paying high Canada pension plan 
premiums, where do they find themselves?  They are going to lose 
everything because this Liberal government is simply continuing 
to collect taxes and Canadians are getting fewer and fewer 
services for the money they are putting in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last two things they asked me was how they could get 
politically involved and how they could fight the system.  I gave 
them a name and it sure was not the name of the Liberal organizer 
in my riding. I do not think they would have wanted it even if I 
had given it to them.  They agree with what I said when I started 
at the top of my speech if Canadians want tax reform, vote 
Reform.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The theory of responsible government is at the heart and soul of 
how democracy functions.  It is at the heart and soul of our 
parliamentary system.  It is the foundation of Canada.  The 
government is democratically elected and it is expected to fulfil 
its mandate on behalf of all the people in the country.  Members 
of parliament are elected as democratic representatives of all 
constituents.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the old days there were feudal lords and robber barons but 
democracy changed that.  It is thanks to democracy that Canada is 
year after year chosen as one of the better countries in the 
world in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member of parliament for Ottawa—Vanier, I happen to 
represent some of the very richest people in Canada and some of 
the poorest people in Canada.  What I am going to say may be more 
popular with one group than the other, but upon reflection they 
will hopefully all agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several corporate leaders in the past few weeks have somehow 
come to the conclusion that the government should ignore the 
democratic mandate on which it was elected.  They have this 
notion that they set the political agenda and the fiscal agenda 
of the governments.  Some have even tried issuing veiled threats 
to coerce the Government of Canada into providing lower tax rates 
for high income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Absolutely corporate leaders have an important role to play in 
consulting with the government and making their views heard. 
However, in this country it is one person, one vote and not the 
size of our chequebook that determines our democratic rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of responsible government also means conducting responsible 
debate.  That means playing straight up with the basic facts. The 
Business Council on National Issues, the BCNI, purports to speak 
on behalf of the chief executive officers of Canada's 150 largest 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago the president of the BCNI criticized the Minister 
of Finance saying “enough is enough” and added, “what we are 
asking the minister to do is to demonstrate his commitment to the 
importance of bringing down personal taxes as a priority”.  What 
an absurdly unfair comment for such a business leader to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has already provided tax relief in this 
and in last year's budget.  We have taken 600,000 poor Canadians 
off the tax rolls altogether.  Families trying to raise two kids 
on $30,000 will no longer have to pay income tax.  Families with 
incomes of $45,000 will have their taxes reduced by at least 10% 
this year alone.  Middle to high income earners, and yes, even 
every millionaire in the country, has had their 3% surtax removed 
in this year's budget.  The government has made reducing taxes a 
priority.  It is just that we have been responsible about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In considering the BCNI's call for lower tax rates, I will point 
out some facts.  The average compensation for CEOs of Canada's 
top 100 companies was $3.4 million last year.  That was up 26% 
from the year before; a 26% increase in one year.  I am not 
begrudging those people what they have earned.  That would be up 
to their shareholders.  I merely mention it to keep things in 
perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are thousands of public servants in my riding whose pay 
was frozen while the government attacked and eventually 
eliminated the federal deficit, as we said we would do.  These 
public servants have now received pay increases averaging 2% to 
3% after years of being frozen.  Not a 26% increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public servants, who are so often criticized, know that their 
sacrifices have made a huge difference.  They know that the 
Government of Canada balanced the books.  They know that the cost 
of borrowing in Canada is far lower today than it has been for 
years.  It is even lower than in the United States.  They know 
that inflation has been virtually wiped out.  They know that we 
have put the recession far behind us.  They know that Canada 
creates jobs at a healthier clip than most of the European 
democracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government received its second majority in June 1997, 
it made a contract with the people.  That is what the principle 
of responsibility is all about.  It contracted to devote half of 
the budget surpluses to debt reduction and tax relief and half to 
pressing social needs like child poverty, health care, education 
and investments in research for our collective long term benefit. 
That was the principal mandate on which we were elected.  As a 
responsible government we must fulfill that mandate.  That is 
responsible government in its traditional form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also responsible government in the sense of acting 
responsibly for the future.  What certain corporate leaders seem 
to be suggesting is that we should ignore everything else and 
give them a tax break. I suppose the Minister of Finance could 
have acted differently.  He could have borrowed to pay for tax 
cuts. However, the Minister of Finance said “No, we will not do 
that. We will provide tax relief the responsible way after we 
have eliminated the deficit”.  That is exactly what we have 
done.

which was built up during the lifetime of every adult alive in 
the country, a debt which costs Canadian taxpayers in excess of 
$40 billion annually in interest charges.  The only responsible 
course of action is to continue to take chunks of any budgetary 
surplus and pay off some of that debt, as we said we would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must reduce the debt. We have no right to pass that debt 
untouched to our grandchildren. To do so would be to exercise 
greed today at the expense of our kids tomorrow. As citizens and 
as parliamentarians we cannot wash our hands of our 
responsibility in this matter.  I do not often agree with 
columnist Andrew Coyne of the <I>National Post</I> who said of the 
growing call for irresponsible tax cuts, “I suppose we ought to 
be ashamed of ourselves”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debt reduction is structural and its benefits permanent.  People 
who became wealthy over the last 30 years as the country 
accumulated debt ought to understand that reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On team Canada missions abroad, business leaders rightly talk 
about Canadian values.  They talk about safe streets, our health 
care, our ability to sustain linguistic duality, our ethnic 
diversity, our public infrastructure, our transportation and 
communications systems, our commitment to the elderly, our 
commitment to human rights, our commitment to fairness.  They 
point out that Canada is not a polarized society with unseemly 
disparities of wealth or incomes.  They point out that this is 
why Canada is a safe place to invest.  They are right when they 
say that abroad.  I would just like to hear them say it more 
often at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To talk of Canada and the United States strictly in terms of tax 
rates is to imply that our nations, our values, our cultures are 
otherwise interchangeable.  I would suggest that if people really 
believe that, they should try to get elected to parliament on 
that platform.  If the president of BCNI really believes that, he 
should try to get elected on that platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has balanced fiscal prudence and the upgrading 
of social programs at the same time.  We have balanced debt 
reduction with tax relief. The tax relief has gone for the most 
part to the people in our country with the least money who needed 
it more.  If someone thinks that people with the most money 
should be the first ones to get tax cuts, let them run for 
parliament on that platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the governor of the Bank of Canada indicated a few days ago, 
Canada is on the right course and tax differences with the United 
States are not the cause of Canada's problems.  If someone thinks 
that the governor of the Bank of Canada is wrong, let them run 
for parliament on that platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsible government means representing all the citizens who 
live in Canada.  Responsible government also means protecting the 
interest of Canadians who have yet to attain the age where they 
too can participate in the election of their government. 
Responsible government means balancing the interest of taxpayers 
with the interest of the common good.  For all of us that is what 
the 1999 budget achieves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member shares my disquiet about the recent 
comments from one particular corporation operating in this city. 
I am referring to Nortel. I am old enough to remember that Nortel 
was once Northern Telecommunications which was a Canadian crown 
corporation.  In his comments he talked about the wealth that has 
been generated for individuals over the last 30 years.  I wonder 
if the present board of directors of Nortel appreciate that the 
investments that were made by Canadian taxpayers and the Canadian 
public over the years have helped to put Nortel in the position 
that it is in today.  The wealth that it is generating has come 
from the public and in fact there is some obligation that is owed 
back to this country.  Would the hon. member care to comment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that 
the enviable position of Nortel today is due in part to the 
benefits from government programs in the past.  It is due in part 
to the benefits of government purchases of the systems and 
equipment which that company produces.  It is due in great part 
to the benefits of having a well educated labour force to draw 
upon. 
All of those conditions have been created with public support.

are carrying is to not act in a responsible manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government campaigned on applying half of the surpluses to 
debt and tax relief and half to social and economic programs that 
were very much needed. Over the course of our mandate it is my 
fondest hope that we will achieve that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From listening to some of the comments of some of our corporate 
leaders, they would forgo too rapidly the benefits of spending 
some money in some very needed areas such as health care as we 
did in the last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here representing a riding that has some of the richest 
people and some of the poorest people in the country.  I would 
not be comfortable with myself if I had not made the comments I 
made today. To not take care and reduce the debt somewhat would 
be irresponsible.  I would not be prepared to support such a 
notion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to pose some questions to the member opposite and point out 
some facts about this budget, about what it has done to Canadians 
and about what this government has done to Canadians since it 
came to power in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he would like to talk a little about bracket creep 
and the amount of money that has been taken out of Canadians' 
pockets, out of the pockets of families.  That has hindered 
families from making ends meet.  Each Canadian taxpayer is paying 
$2,000 more in taxes now than they did in 1993.  Canadian 
taxpayers overall will pay $42.1 billion more in 1999 than they 
did in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of disposable income should be hard to argue. Between 
1993 and 1997 disposable income for Canadians fell by over 
$2,000.  That is right out of the pockets of every Canadian.  It 
takes food off the table and clothes off of kids' backs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he not agree that Canadian taxpayers are getting $448 less 
each in health care dollars from this federal government than 
they got in 1993?  Overall the health care budget is $4.3 billion 
less.  There are almost 200,000 people in this country on waiting 
lists for health care.  We get calls every day, as I am sure the 
member does, from people who are waiting for health care.  There 
are 200,000 people in Canada waiting for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member like to comment on some of those issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly would like 
to comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budgets of this year and last year propose essentially to 
provide some relief that does away with the phenomena of tax 
bracket creep mentioned by the member opposite.  I will not get 
into a precise number argument because we could be at it all day. 
The cuts over the next three years are certainly more substantial 
than the bracket creep the member mentions.  If he did his 
homework he would have to agree with that. There is real tax 
relief in this budget after bracket creep, as he mentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little perplexed with the attitude of some of the members 
opposite who do not seem to care about the level of debt we have 
accumulated over the past decades. We should be serious about 
tackling that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member is serious, then he should be applauding this 
government's success in eliminating a $42 billion deficit in less 
than five years, for the first time in three decades paying off 
some debt and therefore reducing on a permanent basis some of the 
carrying charges.  He should be applauding the government for not 
having borrowed money to effect tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very responsible approach to government. That is what 
this government has done and continues to do in its budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is my duty to 
inform the House that we have now arrived at the point in our 
debate at which there are 10 minutes for debate with no questions 
and no comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to be here in the House today to speak 
on the budget and Bill C-71, an act to implement provisions of 
the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will hear different comments over the course of the day in 
regard to the budget, the value of the budget, $150 billion or 
whatever it is, $130 billion last year.  These kinds of figures 
are thrown around but to average Canadians sitting in their 
homes, in their small businesses or on their farms, we are 
talking about figures that they find very hard to comprehend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even I find it hard to comprehend some of these gigantic figures 
we deal with in the House.  These figures are backed up by the 
work, sweat and toil of all Canadians who provide this parliament 
with the money we are budgeting and spending.  It is absolutely 
incumbent upon us to do that wisely and to get our priorities 
straight when we go about spending the money we collect from 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of how much in taxes we should be taking from the 
people is probably one of the predominant questions we are 
dealing with in this day and age.  The consensus around the 
country and certainly in Manitoba and my riding of 
Selkirk—Interlake is that too much money is being taken away 
from taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Forgive me, but I 
must interrupt the hon. member.  It seems we made a little 
mistake and got a little ahead of ourselves.  In fact, there is 
another hour in this debate before we get to the 10 minute 
portion of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Selkirk—Interlake does have a full slot. He 
will have 20 minutes with 10 minutes for questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for those 
words on the progress of this debate and how it will be carried 
out and when it will end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly in talking about the time to debate these issues, the 
more time the better.  The more fully they are explored by all 
parties and the more ideas that come in, the greater the benefit 
is to the government of the day as to where its priorities should 
lie and how it should handle the money taken from the taxpaying 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier on, an hon. member discussed a figure from the past.  I 
believe it was the fellow who discovered America, Columbus.  The 
member suggested that he was kind of lost.  He related that to 
the government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is more like Dr. Livingstone in Africa.  It is a 
government that is wandering around in the bush, in the forest 
and the jungle, not really knowing which way is out.  The only 
way the government is able to survive is to have a gigantic 
increased flow of taxes.  By having this gigantic increase in 
taxes, it can wander around the jungle and continue to survive. 
Hopefully at some future date, which could be referred to as 
election day, someone from the Reform Party would come along and 
show the government the way out of the jungle.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, we will talk about the jungle of taxation in this 
budget.  It is not unlike a jungle because it is very difficult 
to comprehend the whole thing at once.  I will touch on some of 
the highlights.  We will see where the budget has some strengths 
and where it has some weaknesses that could have been improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its is expected to be a balanced budget, something that is 
absolutely vital to any small business and to any government.  We 
never learned in the past the lesson that we have to pay our 
bills, that if we borrow money we have to pay it back.  The 
situation we find ourselves in now is having a balanced budget 
and having to pay it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget was balanced on the backs of Canadians.  There is 
only one taxpayer, the average Canadian who earns an income in 
the business world or on the farm.  The balanced budget indicates 
an underlying surplus of some $3 billion for 1998-99.  By 
subtracting the $3 billion contingency fund, the budget balance, 
the surplus, is expected to be zero for this year and future 
years.  There is some dispute in the financial world between the 
finance minister and the private sector.  The two do not seem to 
jive.  One is saying there is a budget surplus while the other is 
saying in essence that it is barely a balanced budget at zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the high spending levels of the government we cannot stand 
any bit of a downturn in the Canadian economy.  The surplus of 
funds which keeps the government in operation would start to dry 
up and be much smaller.  Without a corresponding reduction in 
spending we would end up borrowing and going deeper into debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time to start reducing spending is not once the downturn 
comes.  The time to start spending reductions is when we have a 
vibrant, strong economy.  One of the big failings of the budget 
is the big reductions in spending that should be happening.  The 
government would still end up with more tax dollars to spend 
because it is going from roughly a $130 billion to a $156 billion 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of thinking is what we in the opposition parties are 
trying to put across to the government to ensure that it looks at 
it, not as a high spending money grows on trees type government 
but as some prudent common sense average citizen would handle his 
or her business affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget announced $7.7 billion in cumulative tax reductions 
over the next three years which sounds good.  Excluding the 
employment insurance rate reduction of $1.54 billion in 
1999-2000, $2.81 billion in 2000-01 and $3.4 billion in 2001-02, 
in reality taxes will increase by just over $2 billion in the 
next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always get interviewed in my home riding after a budget comes 
out.  People ask me if it is a good budget for them or a poor 
budget.  My advice to them is always very simple.  When a budget 
is in place and has been implemented for six months or a year 
they should keep track of their paycheques to see if at the end 
of the day they have more money.  That is the bottom line for the 
average Canadian.  The figures being thrown around by the 
government often do not tell the whole story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about how some of this budget money is used.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk for a moment about the millennium 
scholarship fund which was raised at an agriculture committee 
meeting I attended this morning.  Five deans and presidents of 
universities gave presentations.  They talked of more funding for 
research and more funding for the operations of their 
universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took the liberty of asking one of the presenters if the $2.5 
billion that will go into these scholarships was the best way to 
move that money into the education system. Having good graces, 
these people did not criticize the government straight out and 
say that this was about the worst way we could fund education. 
However they certainly made it well known that their wishes, 
their desires, their way of funding education, would be to have 
that $2.5 billion go directly to the universities for all 
students to have an opportunity to get the highest possible 
levels of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good example of the priorization being right, that money 
is needed in education, but the vehicle by which the government 
decided to do it was wrong.  I assessed it on behalf of my 
constituents.  By giving the money directly to universities the 
government would not receive the accolades and the votes it would 
get from buying individual voters, individual people who would 
receive these scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More or less if you vote for me we will give you a scholarship. 
It would not be that direct, but the suggestion would be that the 
government had done something great for the person getting a 
scholarship and he or she should feel indebted to the government 
and vote the right way the next time.  That is a very poor way. I 
felt a bit reinforced in my thinking on this subject by these 
university professors and leaders in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about priorizing spending, once again a lot of the 
spending that is not being properly priorized should be rethought 
by the government.  Agriculture is one area that could use some 
additional spending by the federal government.  The reason I say 
that is not so much that it should give subsidies straight to 
farmers, but the priorization of spending on agriculture should 
have greater emphasis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that agriculture creates tremendous wealth for the 
country by bringing in hard offshore currency.  Many internal 
domestic industries simply recirculate cash inside the country. 
When we see something that is a real big export dollar earner, 
that sector deserves strong government support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take away the $900 million AIDA package we end up with 
government support of agriculture to the tune of $600 million or 
certainly less than $700 million from the federal government. 
That is insufficient for such an important industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will ask for ideas on where to find some of that money.  I 
do not intend to go through everything today, but certainly CBC 
television is one area that could be handled very well by the 
private sector. 
As Canadians we spend a lot of money on it every year.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a bit of gun control in terms of handguns but we do not 
to spend upward of $1 billion over the next year to register 
lawfully possessed private property like rifles and shotguns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ranch and have a hired man.  I will have to pay not only for 
me to have all these permits but I will have to pay for his 
training.  That adds an absolutely unnecessary cost on to a 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rural development secretariat working in the health care 
field, which I raised in committee and bears repeating again in 
public, is trying to find doctors for remote areas and that sort 
of thing.  In each province across the country the health care 
system is working very hard and spending millions of dollars to 
find doctors for remote areas.  We are wasting money duplicating 
what is a provincial responsibility.  They are doing the best job 
that can be done.  This is something that could be repriorized by 
the government and the money used for something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transitional jobs fund is one of those programs which has 
good projects and bad ones.  A small remote town in my riding 
received a health care facility which was partially paid for by 
money from the jobs fund.  People no longer have to travel close 
to 100 miles to visit relatives who have Alzheimer's disease, for 
instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The structure of the program is like the structure of the 
millennium scholarship fund.  It has a built-in opportunity for 
the government of the day to abuse it.  I think we saw some of 
this abuse with regard to hotels in Montreal having a strong 
connection to the government and to the Prime Minister himself. 
According to my last accounting some $1 million went into that 
particular transitional jobs fund project, which I can only refer 
to as a patronage, slush fund type payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a final comment to make on where money could be saved 
rather than wasted.  Newspapers indicated today and yesterday 
that $83,000 had been paid for an assistant to the justice 
minister to deal with the CHST, the Canada health and social 
transfers system.  The government should repriorize its spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada health and social transfers have been cut drastically 
over past years.  With the government's announcement in the past 
budget we see that money has been put back into the health and 
social transfers.  That will only bring it up to the 1993 level 
of funding, which is clearly insufficient for the health care 
needs of today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I encourage people to contact their members of 
parliament and ask them for more details on the budget, on the 
funding, on the spending and on the priorities.  It must get 
message out to Canadians on what the budget is about.  In 
closing, I can only say that by having an informed Canadian 
public we can have better government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to the 1999 budget and to address some 
of the concerns which the government has failed to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal issue that I want to address is that there has not 
been meaningful, broad based tax reduction, which the country 
desperately needs to grow our economy in order that we can be 
more competitive and, yes, more productive.  As has been pointed 
out in the last number of days and weeks, Canada indeed has a 
productivity problem, which is largely due to the fact that our 
society is overtaxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may come as a shock to Liberal members that personal income 
tax as a percentage of our gross domestic product is 18% higher 
in Canada than in the United States.  Corporate taxes are 17% 
higher than they are in the United States.  And we wonder why 
growth in our economy is stifled compared to what we see in the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another price that this country pays for its high tax 
regime.  More and more often our best and our brightest, the best 
young minds that we have in the country, are faced with a 
shocking fact.  They are likely to finish an undergraduate degree 
owing $25,000 to $30,000.  They are faced with decisions. Where 
do they seek opportunity?  Where will they get paid more?  Where 
will they get taxed less?  Where can they have the best quality 
of life? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to say that I still believe the best quality of 
life is found within the borders of this great country that we 
call Canada.  However, we are going to lose more of our best and 
our brightest if we do not provide them with a tax regime which 
makes it competitive enough for them to stay here.  I am saying, 
quite simply, that we need to lower taxes to end the brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out what small business has pointed out 
time and time again.  I would like to refer to a document from 
the Canadian Federation of Independent Business which indicates 
where small business feels their concerns were missed in terms of 
the excessive, extraordinary payroll taxes that we pay in this 
country.  This government takes in over $6 billion more annually 
through the EI fund than the program actually consumes.  That 
money belongs in the pockets of the Canadian taxpayers.  It is 
plain and simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFIB also indicated where the concerns of the younger 
generation have been missed.  As a younger person and a younger 
member of the House, I can say that the younger generation is 
very concerned about this.  We have a $600 billion national debt 
which has been run up over the last 30 years. Now we are asking 
the younger generation to bear the burden of that debt.  We owe 
it as parliamentarians on all sides of the House to make prudent 
investments to begin to pay down the national debt.  It is our 
moral obligation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other reasons for us to pay down the debt.  As long as 
we have an enormous debt, as we do today, we will pay over $45 
billion annually to service the debt.  We will always be 
threatened with high taxes.  We can never lower taxes unless we 
eliminate the causes of high taxes, and the principal cause is 
the national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need broad based tax reduction. 
Government members stand in question period, day in and day out, 
and say “We have lowered taxes”.  I know people who are capable 
of lowering taxes.  If there has been any growth in this country 
over the last decade it has been largely due to our export driven 
economy.  Why is that?  Where did that growth come from? It came 
from the free trade agreement of 1988, which was expanded by the 
NAFTA in 1993, which the Liberal Party opposed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government likes to take credit for balancing the budget.  I 
would like to make it very clear that it was the Canadian 
taxpayers who made sacrifice upon sacrifice in the last number of 
years to get our fiscal house in order.  It has been quite an 
ordeal.  It has been a 15-year work in progress.  I applaud 
Canadian taxpayers because they made the sacrifices to balance 
the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting our fiscal house in order and once again having growth 
in the economy of this country is largely due to the Ontario 
government of Mike Harris.  Since its election in 1995 it has 
lowered taxes and has made a commitment to balance its budget by 
the year 2001.  If Mike Harris and Ernie Eves had not started the 
economic engine of this country again, that being the province of 
Ontario, nobody would have balanced the budget, not even this 
finance minister.  That is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out where the real fiscal leadership 
in this country came from.  From the political perspective, it 
clearly came from the provinces, first and foremost.  I know it 
hurts, but it was the Progressive Conservative Government of the 
province of Alberta, led by Ralph Klein, which made a very firm 
commitment to pay down the debt because it believed it was wrong 
to burden the younger generation with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gary Filmon, the Progressive Conservative Premier of Manitoba, 
also brought forward initiatives to balance the budget.  He is 
the senior statesman of the provincial premiers in terms of the 
balanced budget legislation that he brought forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again it comes down to the growth that has been created by the 
province of Ontario, which has been driven by the export sector 
and the lower tax regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to pay tribute to the government which was in 
power between 1984 and 1993 in terms of the tax reform which it 
initiated.  If it was so wrong, why has the government not 
changed it?  If free trade was so wrong, why has the government 
not changed it?  Mr. Speaker, I know that you know the answer, 
being the very learned gentleman that you are.  The reason the 
government has not changed it is simply because it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is imperative that we take some initiatives to 
invest in the future of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a sin for the government to get its fiscal house in order 
by hacking transfer payments by more than 30%.  Those transfers 
pay for our priority programs, such as health care, 
post-secondary education and social services.  The government is 
not going to do anything.  It is passing the burden of the 
problems to the provinces.  I am very happy to say that the 
provinces met the challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some investments to be made.  I want to highlight one 
priority, the student debt level.  It is a sin for an 
undergraduate to finish a degree today with a debt of $25,000 to 
$30,000.  Why is that?  Because the government slashed transfer 
payments by over 30%— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  It was 35%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  It was actually 35%, the learned member 
from St. John's East has pointed out to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one investment that the government needs to make it 
is to ensure that we put more money into post-secondary education 
so that our best and our brightest can go to school.  I have 
talked to the member from Compton—Stanstead about this on 
numerous occasions and I know that he shares the same sentiment. 
He is very fearful that some of our best and brightest will 
choose to not even go to university.  I am extremely concerned 
about that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no plan, in terms of health care, to attract 
doctors or nurses; nor does it have a visionary concept to 
attract doctors to rural Canada.  That is very important to the 
residents in my riding of Fundy—Royal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government takes credit for putting money back into health 
care through the transfer payments, the CHST.  However, the 
province of New Brunswick was getting less money.  It was getting 
$11 million less because of the 1998 budget.  This year it is 
actually getting a little more.  The government is playing a bit 
of a shell game with our health care dollars.  I find that to be 
a travesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will sum up by indicating what this government missed in the 
1999 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should have been a prudent, serious commitment to paying 
down the $600 billion national debt.  It should have sent a 
signal to Canadians that it was the right step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should have provided Canadians with the broad based tax 
relief which they rightfully deserve.  Doing that would have 
given our economy the injection it needs so that we could become 
the country we know we can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ensure that the government puts money into priority 
programs, not silly programs like the transitional jobs fund.  We 
need to put money into priority spending areas, such as health 
care.  I am particularly concerned about rural health care.  We 
also have to ensure that our best and brightest have access to 
affordable post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the environment critic for our party, I would point out that 
the finance minister is a former environment critic, yet the 
environment department is still one of the most underfunded 
departments in this government.  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To set the record straight, it was the provincial governments 
which actually provided the political leadership in terms of 
fiscal responsibility, primarily the Progressive Conservative 
governments of Manitoba, Ontario and Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to pay tribute to the people on the front lines of 
this debt and deficit debate, the Canadian taxpayers who 
sacrificed to get the job done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to ask a question of the member.  It is nice to see him in the 
House today, wound up like he is.  I sit on the environment 
committee with him and this is quite unusual.  He must be 
speaking from the heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an accumulated debt in this country of $580 billion.  In 
the projections of this government for the next three years that 
will not go down one nickel.  If it says that it is paying down 
the debt, it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What part of the national debt should be paid down first, the 
part this government ran up or the part his government ran up? 
Should we use the GST money to do that?  When his government was 
selling the GST it said that it would use that money to pay down 
the debt.  I would like him to explain what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my honour to have the 
opportunity to address such a very constructive question.  I know 
that was the intent of my hon. friend from the environment 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First we have to look at the GST, which is a tax itself.  No one 
likes taxes, but the GST was a replacement tax for a hidden 
federal manufacturing tax.  It was a good thing to do, according 
to this government.  Otherwise, it would have changed it.  It was 
such a good thing that the minister of heritage decided to run 
twice on the very same issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the national debt and which part of the debt we 
should pay down, we need to take a very serious look at the debt 
issue itself.  There is a partisan swing there, but the overall 
impression is this.  The past government lowered the debt as a 
percentage of GDP.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be quite honest, more should have been done and more needed 
to be done.  We need to continue to use our export driven 
economy, our access to the American market to keep our economy 
growing and pay down the debt in a very serious deliberate way so 
Canadians know we are making investments in that.  We have a 
moral obligation to do it.  We have a reason to do it from a 
productivity perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be very pleased to answer any questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my hon. friend and colleague from the environment 
committee for his interest in this particular issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
cannot help but object to the member's comments welcoming debate 
on paying down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague for Lethbridge has pointed out, the 
cumulative debt stands at $580 billion which has saddled this 
country into low productivity.  Year after year after year 
Michael Wilson and Brian Mulroney told us that this debt was 
going to go. I remember it well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984 Mr. Mulroney campaigned and indicated that we were $170 
billion in debt courtesy of the Liberal Party and this was going 
to sink us under a whole margin of debt.  Mr. Mulroney's 
government was going to fix this when it took office.  From 1984 
to 1993 the Mulroney government ran up the debt from $170 billion 
to approximately $450 billion.  The Liberals continued on and ran 
it up to $580 billion. It was the Reform Party coming over the 
horizon and saying that if things did not change we would take 
over this place that caused the Liberal Party and that rump down 
at the far end, the Progressive Conservative Party, to change 
their minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says he wants to enter into a debate about the 
national debt.  Let us remember what two parties created the 
national debt. It was the Reform Party that came here and caused 
them to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about the GST replacing a hidden tax.  The 
manufacturers sales tax did not affect me much as a consumer but 
the GST hits me in the pocket every time I go to the cash 
register.  People do not like it.  It was brought in over the 
protestations of every Canadian.  The Liberals kept it even 
though they promised to get rid of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know what the member is going to do about the GST and 
high taxes. There are $40 billion in interest payments every year 
because of the national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to 
respond to my hon. colleague's question.  I want to set the 
record straight on a couple of issues as well. Let us think this 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1987 the Reform Party was formed. Its members would have us 
believe that they wanted to get our fiscal house in order because 
they were worried about the direction in which the country was 
going. There is a little bit of history. As a younger person I 
find it very uncomfortable lecturing some of the more senior 
members in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984 the deficit was approximately $40 billion.  In 1987 the 
deficit was around $17 billion or $21 billion.  The government 
was headed in a much more prudent fiscal direction in that 
regard.  That was the Progressive Conservative government of the 
day.  For Reform members to say that they became a party because 
they were concerned about the fiscal element within this country 
is a faux pas.  I am very sad to say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Reform decided to become a party it was headed in a 
positive direction.  Instead of encouraging the government and 
jumping on side to make investments, Reform decided to have a 
party to split the right.  Now Reform is saying perhaps it was 
not a good thing to do and we should all cuddle up and try it all 
over again.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about very serious issues.  The partisanship is 
not important.  What is important is we have a $600 billion 
national debt.  We have the capacity to show the Canadian 
taxpayer that we are serious in addressing it and that we want to 
pay down the debt with very measurable targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the commitment Canadians want to hear, not the partisan 
rhetoric.  They want to hear that we want to pay down the 
national debt in a very real way in terms of our debt to GDP 
ratio and in a very real way as compared to EU nations. That is 
what we want to do.  We want to make that commitment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Tories do not have any credibility when they talk 
about debt and deficit.  They have left a record debt and a 
record deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member used the example of Mike Harris.  For the 
record, under Mike Harris we have sent thousands and thousands of 
nurses out of the province of Ontario.  We have slashed spending 
on education and research.  We have slashed the social programs. 
If the hon. member is going to hold that person up as an example 
of the kind of government he aspires to, I can only say that he 
is dead wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was hoping we would have 
a question that would be a little difficult. This one is a bit of 
a lame duck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, the reason the province of Ontario had to make 
some tough decisions on health care and education was that this 
government cut transfer payments for health care and education by 
over 35%.  Whoops, I guess the hon. member actually forgot that. 
What Mike Harris has been able to do by growing the economy of 
Ontario, and I can point out growing the economy of this country, 
is the government of Mike Harris is investing more in health 
care, more in education than ever before by any government that 
has ever governed the province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next time hopefully I will get a tougher question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know 
there are a couple more members who would like to participate in 
the debate. If you would please indicate when 10 minutes are up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair is of the 
opinion that there are not any members other than yourself who 
have indicated their desire to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Palliser has 20 minutes for debate, plus 10 
minutes questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today 
to talk about the implementation of the 1999 budget.  I want to 
make several points, but since it has been dubbed the health care 
budget I will start with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps just as an aside to the member for Fundy—Royal, and I 
do not want to get into a big debate about this, but the record 
will show that the first provincial government that eliminated 
its deficit was not Mr. Klein's in Alberta or Mr. Filmon's in 
Manitoba.  It was in fact the Romanow government in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All across Canada the years of federal neglect and cutbacks have 
taken their toll.  The fact that the Liberal government felt 
compelled to come up with a health budget is a credit to the 
thousands of Canadians, some of whom may be actually watching, 
who have written, or faxed or phoned their members of parliament 
in recent months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not forget on this side of the House that the government 
only a few months before the introduction of the budget refused 
to admit that the health system needed an infusion or a 
transfusion of cash.  It is only with constant public and 
political pressure together with a relentless stream of 
individual horror stories that the government was forced to put 
some money back into our ailing health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is striking about this budget when we strip away the hype 
is that it really does not offer very much at all.  It is really 
a lesson in underachievement.  It may abet the Liberals' 
political crisis but it does not come close to solving the larger 
health care crisis.  If there was ever an opportunity to have 
taken dramatic steps to set things right, we had it in this 
budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deficit was gone and there appeared to be enough surplus 
money to make a difference, but by holding back, Canadians will 
actually have to wait for several more years before the money 
that has gone out of the system is put back into our health care 
system.  I remind the House that the Liberals with the 
introduction of the Canada health and social transfer back in 
1995 cut more than $21.5 billion out of health and social 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than half of that $21.5 billion was in the health care 
funding. This year the budget put back only $2 billion, not quite 
the cause for celebration that some on the other side would have 
us believe.  Members of the government keep repeating $11.5 
billion. We heard it this afternoon.  That is what they want us 
and Canadians to remember about the budget. What they want us to 
forget is that the $11.5 billion is spread out over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets worse.  We do not get the ongoing benefit of that $11.5 
billion because it is not cumulative.  By the end of the next 
five years only $2.5 billion will have been permanently added to 
the transfer, $15 billion per year, up from the current $12.5 
billion.  It is like a wage bonus instead of a wage increase.  It 
is a one time fix that leaves us no further ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, the federal share of health spending is not 
going to change significantly either.  When medicare began, the 
federal-provincial ratio rate was 50:50 funding.  When the 
Liberals came to power in 1993 the federal share had dropped all 
the way to 18%.  Now it is down to about 11%.  In the next five 
years it is going to go up only 1.5% to about 12.5%.  How much 
clout will 12.5% buy us when some provinces would like to slide 
into a two tier American style health care system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our look at the federal budget has helped us realize that much 
work lies ahead for all Canadians who care about our public 
health care system.  New Democrats certainly do.  We cannot count 
on the government.  It is now obvious that only continued public 
pressure will keep the government from backsliding on its 
commitment to health care.  Will next year's budget just be 
another corporate affair? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some conversation in this debate about the 
previous prime minister.  It was interesting to see not long ago 
that Mr. Mulroney was congratulating the current Prime Minister 
for his success in implementing the Progressive Conservative 
agenda for Canada.  I remember the former prime minister used to 
say that in 20 years we would not recognize this country.  After 
nine years of Mr. Mulroney and now six years of the Liberal 
administration we do scarcely recognize our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw it again today in the House of Commons during question 
period.  The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance gave us 
happy talk about all the good things that are happening across 
the country, how the dollar is strengthening, the deficit has 
been eliminated, and the debt is being managed.  That is not what 
they are saying behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I read an economic summary of a report written for 
the use of federal deputy ministers.  This report discovered what 
most of us already know from our very personal and family 
experiences.  That is that the average income of Canadian 
households has declined in the 1990s.  In fact in 1996 family 
income was a full 6% less than it was seven years previously. 
This is the legacy of the government: falling incomes, rising 
uncertainty, and fear about the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may ask why this is happening.  The report I referred to 
says that this decline was mainly due to loss in market income, 
in other words, income from employment.  Remember this was a 
report done for deputy ministers of the government.  The authors 
warned of their growing fear that after 15 to 20 years, income 
inequality is now very much on the rise.  The stage is set for a 
growing gap between the affluent and the poor in our society. 
There is plenty of evidence around to suggest that it is already 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to tell the House of Commons or the folks who live 
in many Canadian cities of the homelessness and the lack of 
affordable housing and the crisis proportions this has resulted 
in.  What I found most interesting in talking with an economist 
about this recently was the observation that if it had not been 
for Canada's social programs, the decline in household income 
would have been much greater than it was between the 1989 and 
1996 period.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were not for programs such as health care and social 
assistance, as wounded as these programs currently are, the 
inequality among the rich and other Canadians would be much 
greater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time this economist told me that there have been 
what he calls massive increases in the economic insecurity being 
experienced by Canadians because of deliberate cutbacks the 
government had made to employment insurance, health care and 
other programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know, for example, that if they lose their jobs it is 
difficult if not next to impossible for them these days to get 
employment insurance.  That is not the way it used to be, but 
that is the way it is now since the government has changed the 
rules so severely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is under attack, as I have said, and people know 
that if they get sick they have to pay for many of the services 
that used to be provided from tax revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to employment insurance as it is now known, or 
unemployment insurance as it used to be known, the government has 
raided the employment insurance fund.  It was at $26 billion at 
the end of March.  The government has placed the surplus in the 
employment insurance fund as a nest egg to spend as it pleases, 
rather than provide adequate benefits to workers, increase the 
benefits, or help more people to utilize the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the city of Regina where I live only one unemployed person in 
five is now eligible or actually receiving any form of employment 
insurance.  In fact, the two cities of Regina and Ottawa share 
the distinction of having the lowest percentage of unemployed 
receiving employment insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clearly a deliberate government policy.  The result is 
insecurity and hardship for thousands of individuals and 
families, and the loss of millions of dollars to small businesses 
that the unemployed can no longer afford to patronize by 
purchasing groceries, gas or children's clothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These policies are callous and unacceptable.  People do matter. 
They pay into employment insurance and when they lose their jobs 
it has to be there for them.  Our caucus has made this issue a 
priority and we will push hard for improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked in the House in recent days about Bill C-78.  I 
believe it was before the committee today.  It is another $30 
billion tax grab that the government wishes to take out of the 
pension plans.  Last week we heard the parliamentary secretary 
talk about the fact that the government was responsible for 
losses and therefore should enjoy the benefits of the surplus. He 
said in his response that the government had dipped into the plan 
by some $13 billion, which therefore justified it being able to 
take out $30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply do not buy that.  We have talked to the retirees.  We 
have talked to the current employees.  They are not saying that 
the $30 billion all belongs to them, but they are saying that it 
needs to be shared.  That is a message the government is not 
interested in hearing whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On homelessness, Canadians know only too well that the 
government has done little or nothing for the homeless in our 
country and very little for the poor.  The United Nations last 
fall published an in depth study which was not at all flattering 
to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it was referred to earlier that the United Nations has 
said that Canada is the best country in the world in which to 
live, this study said that in addressing budget deficits the 
federal government had not paid attention to adverse effects for 
the population in general.  In other words, the government had 
balanced its books on the backs of ordinary families and those 
hurt most were those most at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee says that homelessness in Canada is an area of 
grave concern.  The report states that it is of grave concern 
that little or no progress has been made to improve the lot of 
aboriginal peoples, especially in the areas of housing, 
unemployment and safe drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world's poor is also worthy of some attention in this budget 
address.  The Liberal government has demonstrated a lack of 
concern for the poor not only in this country but the most 
vulnerable in many other countries.  The budget introduced in 
February provided only a modest increase of $50 million for 
development assistance.  This amounts to a mere 0.2% of our gross 
domestic product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1960s a more generous Liberal government set a target of 
0.7% of GDP. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are providing about one-third of what we actually promised 
more than 30 years ago in developmental assistance to the third 
world, despite the fact that Canada remains one of the richest 
countries in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stephen Lewis, a former Canadian High Commissioner to the United 
Nations and a social justice advocate at the international level, 
said last year the fact that Canada was not meeting even this 
modest 0.7% of its GDP was an international tragedy.  This 
overseas development assistance, according to Mr. Lewis, is used 
for health systems, nutrition, education, water and sanitation, 
the things we cannot get private sector investment to undertake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along much the same line, I was disappointed that the finance 
minister was silent in the budget about any commitment to forgive 
the debt owed to our government by some of the world's poorest 
countries.   Many thousands of Canadians are involved in the 
Jubilee 2000 campaign to cancel the bilateral debt owed to Canada 
by 50 of the world's poorest countries.  These countries are so 
indebted that they will probably never be able to repay us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our gesture in forgiving that debt would have both generous and 
symbolic importance.  Leaders of the Jubilee 2000 campaign met 
with the minister last fall.  They felt he was sympathetic.  They 
came away encouraged, but they and the poorest of the world's 
poor came up empty handed when the budget came down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we are very concerned about the direction the 
country is going in.  We will be watching vigilantly human 
development and continuing to ensure that Canadians are protected 
against sickness, against unemployment and against poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are certainly in favour of creating wealth but we want to see 
that wealth shared in a fair and equitable manner.  Too many of 
the Liberal government's policies in Ottawa are both callous and 
unacceptable.  People matter and we on this side of the House are 
prepared to work with Canadians to fight for things that matter 
most to them and to their families.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very carefully to the hon. member. I know one of his concerns is 
agriculture. He talked a lot about social housing and health 
care, but I would also have liked him to deal with agriculture. 
I have a question for him on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals came to power, the Department of Agriculture 
had a $2.2 billion budget. For fiscal 2001-02, it is forecast to 
be $1.1 billion, a cut and a shortfall in the order of 48%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, during the same period the government, through the 
Department of Agriculture, has started charging farmers fees in 
at least 42 areas where, previously, services were provided free 
of charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what the member thinks of this situation 
and how our farmers are going to be able to remain competitive 
in such an environment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member's comments are 
very accurate in terms of the drop in financing for agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a very real dilemma in agriculture, particularly on 
the prairies where grain prices and world commodity prices have 
dropped precipitously.  Input costs are going up.  We thought we 
got the government's attention last fall when it made a 
commitment toward an agricultural income disaster assistance 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan came into effect or the details were announced in 
February and they are not at all promising.  Most farmers with 
whom I have spoken feel that they will not benefit very much, if 
at all, from this AIDA program.

especially in recent years as we have begun to grapple with the 
debt and deficit and to improve our balance of payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture is now the seventh leading sector in Canada.  Yet I 
fear that we will throw out the goose that laid the golden egg by 
simply grabbing everything we can and leaving our farmers 
impoverished, to the point where many of them will have to walk 
away from their agricultural responsibilities or opportunities, 
those things which they love to do most, simply because the 
government is either unable or unwilling to give them the 
protection they need so that they can compete effectively with 
their counterparts, farmers, producers and ranchers in the United 
States and Europe and in other countries around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has raised a very important issue which the 
government will need to address in the days and months to come. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I see 
it is coming close to the end of the day.  Whether I want to 
start another speech or ask another question is a moot point so I 
will just ask a question at the moment of my hon. colleague who 
represents the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That party always seems to be more in favour of regulation and 
programs.  It always wants to come up with another way to help 
people through more taxes and more programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with the Budget Implementation Act.  The Minister 
of Finance is sitting on a bundle of cash augmented by $30 
billion the government will take out of the civil service pension 
plan.  Putting that aside, he is now sitting on substantial 
amounts of cash courtesy of Canadian taxpayers because taxes have 
not been cut yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the New Democratic Party, does the member for 
Palliser feel that we have some leeway with deciding whether we 
will reduce taxes or have more programs?  Is it more beneficial 
that we have tax relief for Canadians right across the board so 
everybody can start breathing more easily and have some money in 
their pockets to pay their bills?  Or, does he believe that we 
take it now that we have it and use it for some other program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we need a balanced 
approach, in answer to the member for St. Albert.  Certainly 
there are areas where we need tax relief.  I remember back to the 
Carter commission in the 1960s when we talked about tax reform. 
It has never happened in the last 30 odd years.  We do need that 
but we also need good social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say Canadians are a bit schizophrenic.  Some people say 
that Canada wants a Scandinavian social program paid on an 
American tax base.  We clearly cannot do that, but we need some 
direction from Canadians about which they want more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the House ready

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps we might start 
this debate by asking ourselves the following questions:  Why are 
we in this predicament?  Why does Canada have some 300 species 
which have been identified as being at risk? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the answer may be found in a study by Donald Ludwig, Ray 
Hilborn and Carl Walters recently produced at the University of 
British Columbia and entitled “Uncertainty, resource 
exploitation and conservation:  Lessons from history”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They conclude first that scientific certainty can rarely be 
achieved especially in answer to the question of how long our 
resources will last.  If we delay and wait for a definite answer, 
the only certainty will be to find that we are likely to run out 
or will run out of fish, forest, certain animals and plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their second conclusion is that humans are often motivated by 
greed in exploiting natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need therefore to act in a way that compensates for 
the two realities they have identified.  That is why we need 
endangered species legislation with certain characteristics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who should decide?  It seems to me that the role of scientists 
ought to be defined as to who would determine which species is 
threatened, vulnerable or endangered.  Scientists, therefore, 
would, through a special committee, have the power to determine 
which species need protection, and then find ways of ensuring the 
recovery of the species.  The scientists would work at arm's 
length from government.  Once they determine a species is in 
trouble, the procedure leading to protection would also be set 
into motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next question is:  How do we protect the living spaces of 
endangered species?  It seems quite clear by now that they must 
be protected.  It means that to protect a species at risk without 
protecting the land and water that the species depends on is not 
possible.  To protect an owl without also protecting the area 
that provides it with food and nesting material will not do.  It 
does little to protect a large carnivore like the polar bear, 
which has been listed as vulnerable since 1991, without ensuring 
its territory and ensuring that it is not devastated by human 
activities, including mining operations.  The same arguments 
apply for the many animals lower on the food chain, as well as 
plants, that are at risk in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How to proceed in the federal system is a difficult question to 
answer.  It is often said that strong legislation is not possible 
because we are a federation.  The possible answer to that is 
mirror legislation, which would work in the following way:  When 
a province decides to protect endangered species within its 
territories, it would ask the Government of Canada to sign an 
agreement that once that province has equivalent protections in 
place for the species, then the federal law would not be enforced 
in that particular province.  It would be a coming together 
between two jurisdictions with the same kind of approach for the 
purpose of protecting the endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach is necessary because species do not know the 
meaning of borders.  If their extinction is to be prevented, 
there cannot be a patchwork of protections from province to 
province with no protection at all in some, weak protection in 
others and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other reason we have to move with this particular type of 
legislation is our international commitments.  In 1992 in Rio, 
Canada was the first nation to sign the convention on biological 
diversity.  The Government of Canada made a commitment to 
conserve our biological heritage for future generations. Other 
countries are beginning to take note of our lack of progress on 
this front.  It has been seven years since we signed the 
convention and we still have no law protecting species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protecting species also means protecting a part of the global 
commons; the resources that belong to everybody, to the global 
community.  Therefore, when damage is done to one species, every 
other species somehow suffers and is affected by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people fear that an endangered species legislation would 
threaten private property.  There is no need to panic, because a 
solution can be found for this particular concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The emphasis should not be on what individuals can do to protect 
the global commons.  The emphasis should be on finding solutions 
and establishing roles for the individual and for the communities 
in order to arrive at a solution, rather than identifying the 
obstacles whereby we should not be acting.  When it comes to the 
issue of private property, the tendency has been to magnify that 
particular issue rather than in developing approaches that would, 
in the end, result in a solution to that particular problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of legislation is now becoming very urgent.  The 
Canadian public is certainly very keen.  It has responded very 
favourably to every initiative made by parliamentarians in 
alerting the government to the need for moving in this direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this bill will serve the purpose that it was originally 
intended to serve, namely to provide a benchmark for the 
Government of Canada to possibly adopt in its fullness so that we 
can have an effective piece of legislation that will be 
functioning properly in a federal system and that will be 
adequately removed from political pressures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be glad now to defer to my colleague from 
Lac-Saint-Louis. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
born on Mauritius, a small island in the Indian Ocean.  Before 
colonization, it had 29 species of fauna that were unique in the 
world.  Today, only three remain.  The other 26 have 
disappeared, including the legendary dodo. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three species left are the Mauritius kestrel, the echo 
parakeet and the pink pigeon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago, all that remained were nine of one species, 
three or four of the other, the kestrels, and 20 pink pigeons. 
The Durrell Foundation in New Jersey captured these three 
threatened species and raised them in captivity in New Jersey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, thanks to a conservation and recovery program, these three 
species are living in nature on Mauritius. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years ago I visited Mauritius where I was born. For the 
first time in my life, a long life so far, I was able to see a 
pair of kestrels myself. This was something I had heard of and 
read about in books and there it was in front of me.  I found it 
a very moving time because it was part of my natural heritage, 
something that as a kid I could not enjoy.  Today, thanks to the 
Durrell Foundation, we have managed to save the three species but 
twenty-six others have disappeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Learned people, like Professor Wilson of Harvard University, 
have counted the number of extinct species in this century alone 
at possibly one million.  Jacques Cousteau, the great explorer, 
told how, on visiting the Amazon, he thought of a beautiful 
cathedral going back into centuries or a magnificent library of 
the most precious books.  He wrote that losing the species in the 
Amazon was tantamount to a cathedral or a wonderful library of 
precious books burning to the ground because we can never replace 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I am extremely grateful to my colleague from 
Davenport for having brought this bill forward to protect what 
really makes species live: the habitat and the ecosystem. 
Without habitat and the ecosystem there are no species and 
species disappear.  If we clear cut there can be no birds and no 
wildlife because there is no place for them to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what has been happening.  We have been destroying the 
habitats and the ecosystems.  There are 300 species at risk in 
this wonderful country of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why this bill is so precious to us.  It gives us the 
ability to protect the habitat.  Let us protect the habitat and 
the species at risk right across Canada.  If we must, let us give 
equivalence to the provinces which have a prime right in many 
ways if they can show that they have equivalent legislation for 
them to act.  The bill also provides for automatic listing at 
arm's length of species at risk, another essential element of any 
such legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It hope these three elements will be found in any legislation 
that the government brings forward later on.  The bill is clear. 
It is strong.  It is logical.  It is going to prevent extinction 
by addressing the root causes of extinction; that is, habitat 
conservation and preservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will finish my speech with the same analogy I started with. On 
my own native island of Mauritius there is a little 375 acre 
island way out in the blue called Round Island.  Of all the 
places in the world, it was the one that contained the most 
species of plants and wildlife unique to any one place anywhere 
in the world.  They were innumerable on Round Island.  Today we 
can count them on the fingers of one hand.  The famous hurricane 
palm has only one specimen left in the world and it is on Round 
Island.  Thanks again to the Durrell Foundation, they are trying 
to preserve that unique tree, hoping that in the future they 
might reproduce it in larger numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen so many species in my own lifetime disappear from my 
eyes on this tropical island where there is so much wonderful 
wildlife.  I see it happening in Canada as we cut our forests and 
we toxify our streams and rivers.  We must stop it. This is why 
Bill C-441 is so important.  It sends a message, and sets a model 
for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate my colleague.  I think he has done us a great 
turn by bringing this bill before parliament so that it can serve 
as an example for possible legislation to follow.  This is my 
fondest wish.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to debate the merits of Bill C-441, an act 
respecting endangered species protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sponsor of the bill, the member for Davenport and the 
chairman of the Standing Committee on the Environment and 
Sustainable Development, is a learned man and a man committed to 
a cause.  He puts his heart and his soul into environmental 
protection and is not reluctant to speak out, even against his 
government many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there are times when I disagree with my colleague on the 
means that should be used to accomplish the end.  I come from a 
background that promotes smaller, less invasive government, a 
government that does not overwhelm its citizens with mind numbing 
layers of bureaucracy.  I am a firm believer in motivating people 
to take action through positive incentives, not through the 
threat of heavy handed government action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of these distinctions that the member for 
Davenport and I sit on opposite sides of the House.  However, I 
am grateful that when we have differences of opinion we can 
engage in a public debate and let our positions be judged on the 
merits of our arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wildlife is an intrinsic part of the Canadian identity.  From 
the days when native peoples roamed the lands to the days when 
the first European settlers arrived and today when Canadians 
spend over $11 billion in their nature pursuits, Canada's rugged 
beauty has captivated our souls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We value nature and its wildlife for many reasons.  We depend on 
a healthy environment for food and raw materials.  We value the 
medicinal and health benefits we receive.  A vibrant ecosystem 
cleans our air, purifies our water and nourishes our farm lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic spin-offs that come from recreational nature 
pursuits or from sustainable harvesting of our natural resources 
are a significant part of our national economy.  Most important, 
we believe that we are given the duty of stewardship by our 
creator.  We have a duty and an obligation to ensure that our 
environment is preserved for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This deep respect for nature and wildlife has created an 
international reputation of goodwill for Canada.  This respect 
led Canada to make international commitments to protect its 
biological diversity.  Canada was one of the first countries to 
ratify the UN Convention on Biological Diversity which committed 
Canada to a path of sustainable development.  This convention 
also committed Canada to pursue an agenda of sustainable 
development and bound Canada to develop or maintain necessary 
legislation and/or other regulatory provisions for the protection 
of threatened species and populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of being home to almost 20% of the world's wildlife, 
Canada is failing to live up to these international obligations. 
Canada's wildlife is only protected through a piecemeal approach 
of federal and provincial legislation.  This legislation while 
protecting some species does not adequately protect Canada's 
wildlife at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my role as the chief environment critic for the Reform Party 
I have repeatedly asked the government when it would be 
fulfilling its obligations by introducing responsible endangered 
species legislation.  Despite my efforts I still have no answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to a letter that I wrote in March 1998 the 
environment minister promised that she would be introducing 
endangered species legislation before the end of that year.  That 
target has passed and now the latest target date promised by the 
minister is quickly approaching.  The minister recently promised 
to introduce legislation before the summer recess, but it is 
doubtful that she will even meet that target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports developing responsible endangered 
species legislation.  It is even given specific mention in our 
blue book.  Members of our party realize the important role that 
the federal government can play in protecting our wildlife at 
risk.  We realize that the typical method of government 
intervention is outdated and ineffective.  The command and the 
control authority that the government so dearly clings to do more 
harm than good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One need only look to our southern neighbours to see the results 
of top down command and control, heavy handed government 
regulation.  The United States endangered species act has been a 
complete failure.  Billions of dollars have been spent on 
bureaucratic paper shuffling while not one endangered species has 
been delisted because of a successful recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hostile climate that this bill has created between private 
property owners and the federal government has done more harm to 
the cause of endangered species protection than having no 
legislation at all.  The complete disregard for private property 
rights and absence of any positive stewardship incentives have 
virtually destroyed any spirit of co-operation between the 
government and landowners.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government practice of seizing private lands without 
providing fair compensation has led to the so-called shoot, 
shovel and shut up syndrome where landowners would rather 
eliminate a resident endangered species on their land than run 
the risk of government seizure.  This is perhaps the most telling 
statistic of this law's complete failure to recover one single 
species despite spending over $13 billion since its inception in 
1973. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fear for the well-being of the country when I hear calls for 
Canada to develop legislation based on this draconian example. 
This is not the protection that Canada's wildlife at risk needs. 
Canadian endangered species legislation should be driven by those 
people who are intimately connected with Canada's wildlife. 
Instead of being driven by invasive government actions regulated 
by a far removed bureaucracy, a bureaucracy that has no idea of 
the subtle nuances of the local endangered species, protection 
should start on the ground with those who will be directly 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On crown lands means fish and wildlife officers, wildlife 
experts, conservation groups and land users.  “On private 
lands” means the farmers, ranchers and resource sector 
employees. These individuals should be our first line of defence. 
Stewardship of the land has a long tradition in Canada among 
those who depend on it for their livelihood.  These responsible 
land users realize that if they treat the land with respect it 
will continue to sustain them with its bounty and goodness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it has not been the tradition of the government to give 
the proper respect to private property landowners.  The last 
attempt by the Liberals to introduce endangered species 
legislation trampled the rights of landowners, granting the 
government the authority to arbitrarily seize lands without 
adequate compensation.  It ignored stewardship initiatives in 
favour of government programs.  It expected landowners to bear a 
disproportionate financial burden simply because they own the 
land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I see this tradition continued in the bill we are 
debating today.  The bill broadsides the rights of private 
property owners.  Although the act applies to all lands there is 
no mention made of compensation for affected landowners. It pits 
neighbour against neighbour, allowing endangered species 
protection actions to be launched without even waiting for an 
investigation.  If the government investigation clears an 
anonymously accused individual, the report does not require that 
the name of the accuser be made public, creating an environment 
of suspicion and hostility between neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In true Liberal fashion over half of the bill pertains to 
enforcement and punishment measures, while giving only cursory 
mention to recognizing private stewardship initiatives.  The bill 
is about control.  It is about giving unfettered power to the 
central government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Landowners should be our first line of defence in the fight to 
protect endangered species.  This means working with landowners 
instead of working against them.  It means including them in 
decisions affecting their lands.  It means educating them and 
assisting them in working with recovery plans.  It means offering 
them compensation if their land is affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsible landowners who display proper land management 
practices, who have actively sought to protect and nurture 
endangered species, deserve to be recognized.  Incentives can be 
used by the government to encourage and reward responsible 
stewardship practices.  Responsible legislation will recognize 
this need and will provide for a process where governments and 
landowners can reach a mutually compatible, voluntary contractual 
agreement that protects wildlife at risk and respects private 
property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time is short but I would like to close with a few comments 
that I hope the member and his minister take under advisement. 
Science should be kept above politics by all means. 
Recommendations for species at risk should be made by an 
independent body based on scientifically sound evidence. However, 
the final decision must rest with parliament, for it alone has a 
democratic mandate which entitles it to balance the competing 
interests of economic and environmental needs. Although the bill 
rejects the concept of balancing economic and environmental 
needs, we cannot have a healthy environment without a healthy 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and I think I can say above all, I ask the minister to 
bear this in mind as she develops her own legislation. 
Environmental policies which emanate from liberty are the most 
successful.  Our chosen environment is liberty and is the central 
organizing principle of Canada.  There is a direct and positive 
relationship between free market societies and the healthiness, 
cleanliness and safety of the environment.  Free people work to 
improve the environment and liberty is the energy behind 
environmental progress.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is almost identical to Bill C-65, which died on the 
Order Paper. Some changes were made regarding the role of 
provinces, but the bill still does not respect provincial 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to protect wildlife species at risk. 
It provides for the establishment of a list of designated 
species as well as a recovery process. 
The designation of species, the scientific criteria used to 
include a species on the list and the recovery plans will be 
among the responsibilities of the Committee on the Status of 
Endangered Wildlife in Canada, or COSEWIC. There will be a 
complete restructuring of this organization from its current 
form. It will be made up of nine members appointed by the 
Minister of the Environment, and they will be paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-441 will apply to the so-called federal species such as 
migratory birds and aquatic species. It also deals with 
transboundary species as well as all species found on federal 
lands, and their habitats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill prohibits anyone from killing, harming, disturbing, 
harassing, capturing or taking an individual of a species at 
risk as defined in the bill. Also, no person shall destroy its 
residence, its den or its nest. 
Those who contravene the act will face heavy fines and 
penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-441 directly threatens the provinces' jurisdiction in 
environmental matters. In fact, on the pretext of meeting the 
requirements of the international convention on biodiversity, the 
bill introduced by the hon. member for Davenport interferes in 
areas under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-441 does not respect the constitutional division of powers 
with regard to the environment because it is based on a much too 
broad interpretation of the definition of territory and because 
it does not respect the joint responsibility of the federal 
government and the provinces with regard to certain species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill gives the Minister of the Environment broad 
discretionary powers, in particular regarding appointment of the 
COSEWIC members, listing by COSEWIC of threatened or endangered 
species and the authority to implement or not recovery plans, 
etc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that even if there is an amendment to section 
5(3) regarding admission criteria, our concerns remain 
basically unanswered. The Minister of the Environment still has 
discretionary power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One fundamental fact we must remember is that, since 1989, 
Quebec has had legislation on this and that the legislation 
works well and has had good results. We should avoid creating 
more bureaucracy and useless duplication—I am sure the member for 
Davenport will agree on that—and we should also use our energy 
for what we believe is important, that is the fate of threatened 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, rather than allowing provinces to participate in the 
designation and recovery process of threatened or endangered 
species, excludes them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its preamble, the bill tries to demonstrate that the 
protection of biological diversity is a fundamental issue, so 
important that it is a national concern. Hence, the bill 
introduced by the member for Davenport tries to grant the 
federal government powers that would allow it to intefere in 
what is clearly provincial jurisdiction, by putting forward the 
necessity to abide by the biodiversity convention. The bill 
validates interference by federal government.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view, the federal government cannot justify such 
interference by putting forward the necessity to abide by a 
convention, because it is the provinces that have to implement 
the convention on their own territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to raise another point and that has to do with 
the definition of federal land. I have a problem with that, 
because the definition in the bill is much too general. 
It defines federal land as land, including any water, that 
belongs to Her Majesty, and the air above that land, the 
internal waters of Canada as determined by the Territorial Sea 
and Fishing Zones Act, including the seabed and subsoil below 
and the airspace above those waters, and any other lands that 
are set apart under the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will understand why I cannot subscribe to such a broad 
definition which implies that the seabed, the subsoil, and the 
airspace above internal fresh waters, which normally come under 
provincial jurisdiction, will be managed by Bill C-441. The 
definition of federal land refers to other legislative texts 
giving jurisdiction to the federal government over the fisheries 
and shipping on internal waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, this bill gives the federal government much greater 
and broader authority over everything connected with these 
lands, including the protection of endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to clarify by describing in greater detail the division 
of powers regarding the protection of the environment, 
especially wildlife, under the Constitution. As could be 
expected, the protection of wildlife and its habitat is not 
provided for in the Constitutional Act of 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, under this act, the provinces have jurisdiction over 
the management of public lands, they belong to the 
provinces—subsection 92(5), property and civil rights—subsection 
92(13), and generally all matters of a merely local or private 
nature—subsection 92(16). 
These powers are specific enough and broad enough to allow the 
provinces to legislate with regard to wildlife on provincial 
public lands as well as on private properties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of the term “federal species” is confusing because this 
notion does not take into account the territory where those 
species are found. Under Bill C-441, migratory birds are 
considered federal species, even though they have always been 
recognized as a joint responsibility of the federal government 
and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill states that, under the Constitution Act, 1867, the 
federal government has jurisdiction over sea coast and inland 
fisheries—section 91, paragraph 12—and may therefore appropriate 
any power with regard to the protection of fish, marine mammals 
and marine flora found in Canada's territorial sea and internal 
waters, including the subsoil below and the air above. Nothing 
less. Similarly, this bill gives the federal government 
jurisdiction over the habitat of migratory birds, whether the 
said habitat is on provincial land or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Combined with the definition of “federal land” and with section 
35, which deals with transboundary species, this is certainly 
one of the most questionable provisions of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the bill gives the federal government the power to intervene 
with wildlife species and their habitat, aquatic species and 
their habitat and migratory birds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have added a lot more things, but I can only 
congratulate the member for Davenport for having introduced this 
bill to the House.  I know how interested he is in everything 
that concerns the protection of species at risk and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois criticizes this bill primarily because it 
totally changes the rules of the game by not establishing a 
species' territory and confirms direct meddling in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise this evening to speak to Bill C-441, an act respecting the 
protection of wildlife species in Canada from extirpation or 
extinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the member for Davenport for an excellent 
bill.  His wisdom, vision and leadership are appreciated.  His 
efforts to improve the protection of the environment for this and 
future generations are evident in his position as chair of the 
House of Commons Standing Committee on the Environment and 
Sustainable Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us reflects the hon. member's vision.  Canadians 
can only hope that the environment minister's proposed species at 
risk legislation will be as well written to ensure the protection 
and recovery of species at risk in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have told the government to act.  The Prime Minister 
received a letter signed by 638 Canadian scientists, calling for 
specific action to be taken on the scientific listings of 
endangered species and the explicit need for national habitat 
protection for transboundary species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two letters from the scientific community, dated February 1997 
and October 1995, stated explicitly that one cannot protect 
species at risk without protecting their habitats, the places 
where species feed, breed, rear their young, and so on, which are 
critical to their survival and recovery.  The letters stated that 
habitats can be geographically dispersed and are not confined 
within political boundaries, but must each be effectively 
protected to ensure a species' well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the scientific listing of endangered species, the 
letter to the Prime Minister is quite pointed.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Identifying and listing species at risk is the foundation of 
endangered species protection.  Your government recognized this 
in its 1995 legislative proposal, and agreed that species at risk 
should be identified and listed by COSEWIC—an independent 
committee of scientists drawn mainly from government and 
academia—and that mandatory listing should follow COSEWIC's 
determinations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, your government has abandoned this principle in two 
ways.  First, the federal environment minister recently decided 
to strip most of COSEWIC's non-governmental scientists of their 
voting rights.  This change (which was made without public 
notice) weakens COSEWIC's independence by opening the door to 
political interference in species listings. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's letter also refers to this government's 
effort to give cabinet the power to override the scientifically 
based list of species at risk.  As I mentioned at the outset, we 
Canadians can only hope that the environment minister's proposed 
legislation will be on par with Bill C-441. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members to read the summary of this very sound 
legislation.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this enactment is to prevent Canadian wildlife 
species from becoming extirpated or extinct and to provide for 
the recovery of those that are extirpated, endangered or 
threatened as a result of human activity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a vision which has protection and recovery as its 
purpose.  We need a sincere, non-partisan approach to address the 
crisis that faces Canada's biodiversity today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill's preamble presents an outline for a working framework 
between all jurisdictions.  There is a specific reference to the 
conservation efforts of individual Canadians and communities that 
should be encouraged and supported and their interests should be 
considered in developing and implementing recovery measures. 
This is a specific reference to the role of citizens and 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a specific reference to the role of aboriginal 
people and of the wildlife management boards established under 
aboriginal land claims.  I thank the hon. member for his 
continued diligence in traditional aboriginal ecological 
knowledge and the important role that this presents for Canada 
and future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the interpretation section the definitions are good. 
The definition for residence is especially important, as it notes 
the basic facts that wildlife is mobile and is affected by 
seasons.  A bird does not spend its entire life in a nest and the 
caribou feed and calve in different areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prevention of species loss and species recovery provides the 
basis for this bill.  I do not believe the minister will be able 
to match this principle due to politics.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not seen the Prime Minister's leadership and vision for 
proactive environmental initiatives, so I fear there is a strong 
probability that these basic principles will be missing from the 
current government's legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-441 sets a standard for the responsibilities of ministers 
and the delegation of responsibilities between departments and 
jurisdictions to ensure this legislation works.  Consultations 
with stakeholders are ensured.  Funding requirements are outlined 
in section 9.  These references include specific management and 
fiscal responsibilities.  It is refreshing to see legislation 
where accountability for a minister's action is defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Davenport includes an excellent proposal for 
a specific Canadian endangered species conservation council. 
With specific reference to the Prime Minister, I hope the 
wildlife species listing process described in Bill C-441 will be 
included in whatever legislation the government assembles for 
this crucial issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basis for the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife 
in Canada, COSEWIC, would address the scientific, academic, 
non-governmental organizations and overall concerns for effective 
legislation.  This means effective protection, prevention and 
recovery.  Otherwise, why waste the trees to print a meaningless 
and toothless biased law? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the government is setting a dangerous 
precedent in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, CEPA, 
which is about to enter the House.  We can expect the government 
to throw out the democratic committee process once again with 
CEPA next week.  We fully expect industry bias and that the 
industry and natural resources ministers will overrule the 
environment and health ministers.  Canadians can only hope that 
this government will attempt to reverse the current trend toward 
environmental devolution and degradation with a well written 
endangered species act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed recovery and management plans are based on 
realistic terms.  They represent a conscientious approach that 
includes the necessity for public buy-in.  There is a requirement 
for landowners' needs and concerns to be addressed and 
considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the international stage Canada is falling behind.  It is well 
reported that our North American neighbours have effective 
endangered species legislation.  The United States has had this 
legislation for 25 years.  As signatories to the Rio biodiversity 
accord, Canadians can only expect that this government will 
finally act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read some comments from a publication I received while I 
was at the United Nations in New York recently: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, a grizzly bear can lumber across the border from the 
American state of Montana, where it is protected by law, and die 
quite legally in a hail of hunters' bullets in the Canadian 
province of Alberta.  Similarly, wetlands and forests critical to 
creatures like the whooping crane and the spotted owl enjoy 
virtually no protection in Canada, though they are rigorously 
policed by the U.S....which is why the American conservation 
groups...have gotten in on the issue...they are attempting to use 
a 30-year-old American fishing law to pressure Canada to conform 
to a 55-year-old convention on wildlife by passing a species law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mechanism they plan to use is the Pelly amendment to the 
Fisherman's Protective Act of 1967.  Their filing of a petition 
under this amendment would require the U.S. Secretary of the 
Interior to evaluate Canada's efforts to comply with 
international programs to protect endangered species. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only are Canadians knocking on this government's door, 
international neighbours and the world community is also looking 
at Canada to take leadership and to make a move on protecting our 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The publication sums up our current status, which is why Bill 
C-441 is necessary for the protection and recovery of species at 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for bringing a worthwhile bill into this 
House and I ask all members to vote in favour of it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I rise to speak to Bill C-441, an act to 
protect wildlife species in Canada from extinction.  Ninety-four 
per cent of Canadians, an overwhelming majority, support 
protection for endangered species.  Estimates of extinction range 
from two to three species a day to three to four species an hour.

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 Canada signed the International Convention on 
Biodiversity.  Under the terms of the convention Canada made a 
commitment to protect threatened species and habitats. Under 
article 8(k) it had to develop the necessary legislation to 
provide that protection.  Sadly, six years later we were without 
any legislation.  It is soon to be seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1996 Canada's 10 provinces and two territories and 
the federal government all signed a national accord for the 
protection of species at risk.  It committed each jurisdiction to 
establish an effective endangered species program.  To date, four 
Canadian provinces have laws in place that specifically protect 
species at risk.  They are Ontario, New Brunswick, Quebec and 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While only a few provinces currently have plans in place, most 
notably a federal plan remains outstanding.  We wonder why it is 
taking so long.  The solution is simple.  The federal government 
has to introduce a bill that identifies species needing help, 
that does not allow for them to be killed, that gives them a home 
and helps them recover. Bill C-441 proves it can be done.  Any 
bill introduced by the minister should follow its lead and 
achieve at least the following goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ideally a Canadian law should apply to all federal lands with 
complementary legislation from the provinces. It should have a 
specific listing of the species at risk and the habitat required 
for survival.  It should automatically prohibit the destruction 
of the species and its critical habitat.  It should require a 
recovery plan within one year for endangered species, two years 
for threatened species and three years for vulnerable species 
from the time of listing.  This will prevent what I call the 911 
approach to species protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we invest in the earlier years when species are vulnerable, 
we can actually protect them from entering the more costly stage 
when they become endangered and we may not have the resources or 
the time to address the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also must require protection for critical habitat and require 
the advance review of projects that may adversely affect the 
protection or recovery of an endangered or threatened species or 
its critical habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government already had a chance to put forward a 
bill that could have accomplished these basic goals. To date it 
has failed to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government introduced Bill C-65 during its past mandate but 
it was widely criticized for several key weaknesses.  It 
protected species on federal lands only.  It protected them from 
direct harm, or harm to the nest or den only, which was known as 
a residence.  The bill required recovery and management plans but 
never required them to be implemented. Cabinet, not scientists, 
was given the authority to list a species as endangered. That was 
a tragedy.  It required action only after the species had hit a 
crisis situation, again the famous 911 approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless the bill was sent to committee for a lengthy review 
process.  I know firsthand about lengthy review processes of a 
bill.  We just endured six months of reviewing the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill that returned from the committee was significantly 
stronger but it still had key weaknesses.  The bill still only 
covered federal lands and waters and cabinet still only did the 
listing of endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to many problems identified by both industry and 
environmental NGOs, Bill C-65 was allowed to die on the Order 
Paper at the dissolution of parliament in 1997.  Since then the 
Liberal government has been promising a new bill that will 
hopefully address these concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-441 certainly does.  It addresses the crucial weaknesses 
identified in Bill C-65 and meets all the ideal criteria for a 
new federal law. Although it has not been deemed votable, I can 
assure members that Bill C-441 is the standard against which any 
future federal legislation should be measured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of any endangered species legislation should be to 
create an atmosphere where the landowner will act in a way that 
positively contributes to habitat protection. 
Allow me to say it again.  The goal of any endangered species 
legislation should be to create an atmosphere where the landowner 
will act in a way that positively contributes to habitat 
protection so that existing endangered species are protected and 
future endangered species are prevented.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not necessarily mean taking over land management of 
private property.  If an endangered species is found on private 
land, then the landowner must be doing something right and should 
be encouraged to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Encouraging stewardship programs will create an atmosphere where 
the benefits of biodiversity are valued and recognized.  This is 
the approach the Canadian Nature Federation has taken.  It 
ensures that landowners, industry and environmental NGOs are 
actually advancing in a common cause the best, well balanced 
piece of legislation possible. The work that Sarah Dover has been 
doing on behalf of the Canadian Nature Federation and the 
coalition should indeed be acknowledged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation that recognizes the rights and responsibilities of 
landowners and resource users is the most effective way to 
achieve co-operation.  Without the co-operation of the provinces, 
landowners and resource users, the most stringent criteria of an 
effective endangered species act will be impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation should implement stewardship, including recognition 
and compensation programs across the country to ensure that 
landowners and resource users would consider land management 
practices that protect species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Critical to the success of the upcoming bill the government 
plans on introducing is it should not be restricted to the 
residence of a species.  It should include its core habitat. 
Survival of a species depends on its having a place to sleep, eat 
and breed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of Canadians want the federal government to 
implement strong endangered species legislation.  It will set a 
standard for the provinces to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information sharing is also critical.  It is essential to 
species recovery. Effective species recovery is not only dictated 
by limited resources but also by limited knowledge.  Endangered 
species protection legislation must focus on encouraging the use 
of information to protect species. Imperfect information can 
result in underestimating or overestimating the value of a 
habitat and will result in negative net benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information from the scientific community, traditional knowledge 
and landowner concerns must be considered when deciding how an 
endangered species will be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information sharing should also be used to alleviate the fears 
of landowners who will lose their property rights should they 
become involved in the recovery of a species.  The wildlife 
department must show that all of society will bear the cost of 
endangered species protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to ensure that we are rewarding stewardship 
activities.  It is far more effective than outright control of 
private property.  Simply purchasing land in most cases is not 
the most effective method of protecting species.  The economic 
benefit brought from the land is lost and other unforeseen 
problems can arise.  But there is a moral hazard in purchasing 
land because the landowner benefits while the rest of society 
pays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time remaining, I would like to outline some of the other 
initiatives which have been done around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>American legislation is known as command and control approach 
legislation.  It is largely ineffective and does not have the 
support of the resource users or landowners.  It does actually 
promote the shoot, shovel and smile approach which we do not 
necessarily want to advocate.  We want all of society to show 
leadership in protecting species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British legislation actually has some innovative approaches 
in terms of having land preservation or specific areas where a 
species is provided a core habitat.  It is something that should 
be included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, regardless of which plan the government decides 
to introduce, it is imperative that the legislation work.  The 
American law is strong but ineffective.  We do not want the same 
thing to happen in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I regret to interrupt the hon. member,

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate to hear the Reform Party expressing its lack 
of belief in the role of government and its belief in the fact 
that somehow society should find a way to solve its own problems 
by way of some mysterious activity which is not the result of the 
decision of society to govern itself by way of established rules

consequence the philosophy of the Reform Party.

intentioned as they may be, to come to some initiatives that 
would ensure protection of the species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was struck by the comments made by the hon. member from the 
Bloc Quebecois who spent much time describing the issue in terms 
of federal and provincial species.  This is an interesting 
political point of view and an interesting way of dividing the 
fauna surrounding us.  However the fact remains that birds and 
animals do not understand political jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not want to have a system whereby a bird landing on a 
provincial stone would be out of luck because the particular 
province did not have specific legislation to protect birds. 
However, if the same bird were to land on a federal stone it 
might have some degree of protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely this is not what the hon. member intended to imply as the 
ultimate consequence of her logic.  It seems to me that she is on 
a very dangerous slippery slope if she tries to judge legislation 
on the basis of jurisdiction that is of a political and human 
made nature and does not take into account the reality of the 
fact that animals move.  There are not only migratory birds that 
she generously attributes to federal jurisdiction.  There are 
also animals that do not respect provincial boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a consensus among all participants on the recognition 
of the absolute necessity of protecting habitat.  Habitat is the 
key to the legislation which ought to have some impact and ensure 
the protection of endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems we have a consensus that is rather encouraging.  I hope 
it will give the Government of Canada sufficient material on 
which to build interesting legislation.  It is quite obvious that 
without habitat there cannot be adequate protection of endangered 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this sense I hope the hour we have spent on this bill has 
been a productive one and one that can be used for the design of 
good and lasting legislation.
