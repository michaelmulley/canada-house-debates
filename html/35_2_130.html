	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (for Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved the second reading of, and 
concurrence in, amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-41, an 
act to amend the Divorce Act, the Family Orders and Agreements 
Enforcement Assistance Act, the Garnishment, Attachment and 
Pension Diversion Act and the Canada Shipping Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is with pleasure that I am before the House to discuss Bill C-41. 
The bill is before us again to approve the amendments made by the 
Senate. The bill received third reading in the House of Commons 
on November 18, 1996 with your support, and I ask all of you in 
this House to voice your support again today so we may begin 
working on implementing this legislation-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I remind the hon. parliamentary secretary 
that when he uses the word you it is to refer to the Chair rather than 
to all of his colleagues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> I ask the House through the Speaker to voice its 
support again today so that we can begin working on implementing 
this legislation which will modernize our child support system and 
protect the needs of children after divorce.
<P>
	This legislation confirms our promise to put children first, a 
promise we made when we announced the child support strategy. 
This strategy was announced in last year's budget by the finance 
minister. It includes child support guidelines, a change in the tax 
treatment of child support and the redirecting of all revenues that 
are generated from such change to poor children. It also improves 
the enforcement measures. All of these changes are expected to 
come into force on May 1, 1997.
<P>
	The child support reforms are a product of six years of 
collaboration with the provinces and territories through  the 
federal, provincial and territorial family law committee. For six 
years the provinces and the federal government worked closely 
together to pool research efforts and moneys to develop a child 
support formula suited to the Canadian context and based on solid 
economic research of family expenditures on children.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is also the product of extensive consultation with all 
stakeholder groups. At least three separate series of consultations 
were conducted and hundreds of submissions were received and 
reviewed. Over 8,000 copies of the federal, provincial and 
territorial family law committee's original report have been 
distributed across the country.
<P>
	All governments and groups have had a significant impact in 
some way on the guidelines. The result is that no one group is 
completely satisfied. Each group would have done a number of 
things differently had it had sole control of the project. However, 
most of them have put aside their own preferences in favour of the 
goal of national consistency and co-ordination.
<P>
	There is a clear recognition that these guidelines are a great 
improvement over the current system, and it is recognized by the 
courts and family law practitioners who are already-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A quorum count, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member is correct. There are not 20 
members in the House. Call in the members.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair sees 20 members now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> A point of order, Mr. Speaker. It does not fall within 
the standing orders or the House rules for a member of the Reform 
Party to stick his head in, call quorum and sneak out when there is 
not one Reform member sitting in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member will know, as well as the 
Chair, that we are not supposed to comment on the absence of 
members of any party from the House for longstanding reasons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not talk about the absence of 
members from the House but I will address my comments to the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois and the Liberal Party present.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8122"> 8122 </A></B>
<P>
	Most of the stakeholders have put aside their own preferences 
in favour of the goal of national consistency and co-ordination. 
There is a clear recognition that the guidelines that have been put 
in place are a great improvement over the current system. That 
is recognized by the courts and family law practitioners who are 
already using the draft guidelines on an advisory basis.
<P>
	Most provinces are now expected to implement these guidelines, 
learn from the experience and work together to improve them. The 
province of Quebec is the only province that has already passed 
legislation to introduce its own guidelines through regulatory 
process in order to coincide with the May 1 date.
<P>
	Bill C-41 will allow these guidelines to also apply to orders 
made under the Divorce Act. Without Bill C-41 there would be in 
Quebec two different systems for determining child support orders, 
one for separation and common law relationships and one for 
divorce.
<P>
	This bill is about children. It is about ensuring that their needs 
are met now and in the future. This bill will help parents come to an 
agreement more quickly on the issue of child support and thereby 
reduce conflict.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-41 also recognizes that some governments need 
to continue to focus on enforcement of support orders. New 
measures are introduced to assist the provinces and territories in 
this regard.
<P>
	We have also heard that there are issues other than child support 
on the minds of many Canadians. Custody and access were raised 
repeatedly throughout the study of the bill by both Houses. We are 
not ignoring this issue. We are simply completing the task started 
six years ago by the federal, provincial and territorial governments. 
The long awaited child support reforms, custody and access, was 
the subject of public consultation prepared by the department in 
1993. The officials of the justice department have already started to 
work on this issue through the federal, provincial and territorial law 
committee.
<P>
	To reaffirm our commitment to addressing this issue, the 
Minister of Justice has agreed to move that the government 
establish a joint House and Senate parliamentary review of custody 
and access. It is my hope that interested Canadians and 
stakeholders will take the opportunity to voice their concerns to the 
parliamentary committee.
<P>
	We will be making an important first step in finding solutions if 
we all work together. As you know, Mr. Speaker, two amendments 
were made to Bill C-41 by the standing Senate committee on social 
affairs, science and technology. That is why we have the bill before 
the House again today. I would like to comment on the impact of 
these amendments to the Divorce Act.
<P>
	First, some committee members had expressed concerns about 
the definition of child of the marriage in Bill C-41 which was 
introduced for the first time in  explicit reference to the pursuits of 
reasonable education-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Vancouver North.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask for a quorum 
count, please.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Yes, that is one of the joys of the 
Speaker's job.
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There now appears to be a quorum. The 
hon. parliamentary secretary.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Our intention in adding these words was to codify 
the existing case law which currently allows for child support to be 
ordered where children are over the age of majority, pursuing 
post-secondary education and where the parents have the ability to 
support them.
<P>
	However there were some concerns expressed by the senators 
that the addition of these new words could have been interpreted 
more broadly than the current case law. This was not acceptable to 
some people. As a compromise, the Minister of Justice agreed to 
remove the words ``pursuit of reasonable education'' so that the 
current case law will continue to apply. Through the words ``or 
other cause'' the courts will continue to have the discretion to 
award support for post-secondary education where the children 
have reached the age of majority and where parents have the 
financial ability.
<P>
	Second, Bill C-41 through the introduction of child support 
guidelines reaffirms the objective that both parents have a joint 
financial obligation to support their children. However the minister 
understood the concerns raised by some members of the committee 
that this objective was no longer apparent since it was removed 
from the act along with the other provisions which were part of the 
concept of broad discretion which is currently used in the 
determination of child support. This broad discretion concept 
defeated the objectives of the guidelines and as such we needed to 
remove it from the act.
<P>
	The minister has always supported the objective that both 
parents are financially responsible for the needs of their children. 
This obligation is included in the guidelines but to give it more 
importance the minister agreed that it be reintegrated in the act to 
ensure that any guidelines will respect that principle.
<P>
	The child support guidelines are not in this bill but will be 
introduced through the regulatory process. The provision on shared 
custody drew some attention of some senate committee members. 
They were concerned that it only applied to situations where both 
parents equally shared the custody of their children. Committee 
members suggested that the courts should be able to depart from  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8123"> 8123 </A></B>
<P>
the table of awards where both parents shared custody of children 
for 40 per cent of the time.
<P>
	It should be noted that this was the family law committee's 
original recommendation which had been changed at the request of 
many legal organizations across the country who were concerned 
that this would increase litigation on the more difficult issue of 
custody and access. We agreed to introduce the provision in the 
guidelines but we will monitor it closely as with any other 
provision in the guidelines.
<P>
	This legislation calls for a review by the Department of Justice to 
be placed before each House of Parliament within five years. Until 
then the Department of Justice will closely monitor the 
implementation of every provision with the provinces and 
territories through the implementation task force. It will also be 
seconded by an advisory committee which will provide specialized 
advice on issues as they arise. If changes to the guidelines are 
required, we will be able to bring them through relatively quickly 
given that the guidelines will be introduced through the regulatory 
process.
<P>
	We are still aiming to have this bill in effect by May 1, 1997 to 
coincide with the tax change. I urge all members of this House to 
again support this bill which will bring such improvement to the 
area of family law. For over 50 years the current system has been in 
place and it is time for a change. Six years of study and extensive 
review by the provinces and by all stakeholders working within the 
family law system have brought about the proposals that are being 
brought forward by the minister today.
<P>
	I wish to thank all of those who have been involved in improving 
this legislation and making it what it is. That being said, as was 
indicated, there will be a chance as the changes are implemented to 
review the bill on a continuous basis so that changes where 
appropriate can be made. But this is one step forward and another 
bit of progress by the Minister of Justice. We thank him for his 
efforts and we thank all those who have participated in this process.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome this 
opportunity to speak to Bill C-41, an opportunity we have had 
several times before. We are having a debate this morning because 
the Senate or should I say the other place, in parliamentary terms, 
wanted to introduce amendments. This means discussing the bill 
again.
<P>
	For the benefit of the public, I may recall that we went through 
the usual procedure: first reading, second reading, referral to the 
justice committee which considered the bill, and then third reading. 
Now once again, the other place wants to put in its two cents' worth 
and thus delay the proceedings.
<P>
	As a result, the Minister of Justice was obliged to suggest a 
compromise. Why? Because he hopes to see this entirely legitimate 
bill, which is basically sound and pursues entirely valid objectives, 
passed and implemented before the next election.
<P>
	This again raises the question of the usefulness and relevance of 
the other place. As we know, it is always one step behind. These 
people are not elected but appointed by the government when 
vacancies occur. Often at the beginning of a government's 
mandate, we have a situation where the former government's party 
has a majority in the other place. In this case, a few months ago the 
Conservative Party had a majority. And since the other place 
pursued the interests of the Conservative Party, this tended to delay 
the parliamentary process.
<P>
	It has been like this since the beginning of Confederation. When 
government is replaced, the party that was in power before is still 
able to delay implementation of legislation by resorting to all kinds 
of stratagems in the other place.
<P>
	Mind you, these people are not elected. In my riding, I always 
ask people the same question: ``Do you know the senator who 
represents you in Ottawa?'' I know who it is now. I do not think we 
can mention names, but she is getting to be known.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes we can.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> We can? I am referring to Mrs. Bacon. She does not 
live in the riding, but she bought a piece of property in the riding of 
Lévis to be eligible for an appointment to the Senate. Does anyone 
ever hear about this senator? This is par for the course in the other 
place.
<P>
	Even since the Bloc Quebecois came here, we have said that 
reforms are necessary. It just does not make sense. First, it costs a 
lot of money, more than $40 million annually, and second, it is 
increasingly obvious that this institution tries to delay the 
legislative process. Occasionally, but such cases are few and far 
between, we get some new legislation from the other place. But 
more often, as in this case, people who are opposed to a bill use the 
other place to delay its implementation, although because of the 
usual majority in Parliament, the bill is passed in any case, so the 
delay is only temporary.
<P>
	So duplication is at work here. I say that right away, because the 
compromise proposal is to have a joint committee of senators and 
members of the House of Commons consider the bill's provisions 
on child custody and visiting rights. I have nothing against the 
principle. But it is not, in our view, sufficient reason to vote against 
this bill. Members of the official opposition were among those who 
supported the bill because of its objectives. One of the main 
provisions of the bill is to exempt support payments from existing 
tax provisions.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8124"> 8124 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	As we know, this led to a war of almost historical proportions. 
The spouse who received the support payments was required to pay 
tax, while the one who made them did not. Often the children were 
the victims of this war of court orders and legal wranglings.
<P>
	I would like to call to mind a situation known to everyone, that 
Canada now has more poor children than when the Liberals came to 
power, and the numbers are still rising. One child in five is living 
under the poverty line. In 80 per cent or more of cases, the children 
living in extreme poverty are in single parent families. In most 
cases-and this must be said, though as a man I do not want to start 
a war of the sexes over this-women are the single parents who 
have to provide for their children. More and more often, 
unfortunately, these women have to do so under extremely difficult 
conditions. This is something that cannot be repeated too often.
<P>
	This bill makes it possible to avoid crises when taxation time 
comes around, but it does create some rather special situations. The 
bill is not entirely perfect because, under the Constitution, divorce 
comes under federal jurisdiction while, under the civil code, 
marriage in Quebec is a provincial matter under the Napoleonic 
code. That is one of the dimensions of the distinct society no one 
wants to recognize.
<P>
	So, people get married under provincial law and divorced under 
federal. This is a strange situation, a sort of complicated maze. In 
today's society, many couples decide not to marry but to live 
together as common-law couples, and there are various laws 
recognizing this situation. This is a very good thing, except that, in 
such cases, the matter of divorce and the guidelines suggested by 
the bill are under federal jurisdiction. If we take the case of 
individuals who are living common-law and have children, when 
problems involving separation arise, application of the guidelines 
is a purely provincial matter. You can see how things get very 
complicated at that point.
<P>
	I have just described the situations of two couples with children, 
one a married couple for whom the guidelines on support payments 
apply, the other a case of separation after the divorce, where the 
federal guidelines apply. In the case of a break up of a common law 
relationship where children are involved, support is exclusively a 
provincial matter, in the case of Quebec.
<P>
	Under an imperfect system like federalism, responsibilities are 
rather haphazardly distributed. I am not saying this because I am a 
sovereignist. It is a fact. The Quebec Civil Code governs questions 
of separation outside marriage.
<P>
	We could talk at length on this, but an analogy is called for. This 
is not the only case where this sort of situation prevails. The federal 
government has the annoying tendency to use the system's 
ambiguity  whenever it can to impose its guidelines in all sorts of 
areas on the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	By way of example, and only to illustrate the case and not to talk 
about it, let us consider the bill on tobacco. This bill concerns 
health, a provincial matter, but the federal government justifies its 
intervention in the field by pointing to infractions and sentences, 
which come under the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Bill C-41 concerns support, family law and other related matters. 
There is good reason the bill was introduced by the Minister of 
Justice. Once again the federal government is using the Criminal 
Code to justify its intervention. The Criminal Code is federal, but 
the Civil Code is provincial.
<P>
	It is a bit strange. We must admit that we should never have 
legislated in the area of support, separation or divorce. Ideally, in a 
society, there should be no need to legislate people into paying 
support. They should be able to do so themselves, because, if their 
children are involved, it is their responsibility.
<P>
	I will always find it, I would not say abnormal, but strange that, 
after living a period of time together-years-a couple breaks up 
and turns to the law to resolve their problems, because they are 
incapable of doing so themselves. It is too bad, really. It is a real 
shame to end up in this sort of situation. The ideal would be to have 
people recognize their responsibilities toward their children.
<P>
	It is sad for me to see people, mostly women but men also, walk 
into my riding office and complain about having been treated 
unfairly by the justice system on suppport issues. Sometimes they 
cannot afford to pay. It is a shame when, as is often the case, there 
is hatred where there used to be love and people seek revenge. I 
always find this unfortunate. The children who are brought into this 
world did not ask for it, but once there are here, we should provide 
for them.
<P>
	While we support the bill, I take this opportunity to deplore how 
little compassion this government has shown so far for the poor in 
our society. It is unfortunate that, this week again, the federal 
Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister commented on how 
good things are in Canada.
<P>
	No doubt, on Tuesday, the Minister of Finance will repeat again 
and again that his government successfully exceeded its federal 
deficit reduction targets. It has done so at the expense of the 
disadvantaged and the unemployed, and by cutting transfer 
payments to the provinces.
<P>
	When cuts are made in transfer payments, one has to know what 
that means. The cuts occur mainly in services to the children, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8125"> 8125 </A></B>
<P>
because they reduce transfers for social assistance, health and 
postsecondary education. In so doing, they are attacking our future.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Health spent several weeks this fall 
reviewing the whole issue of children's health. Experts told us 
repeatedly that the first three years of a child's life are crucial to the 
child's mental and physical development. Some even contended 
with great conviction that, often, juvenile delinquency problems 
encountered later in life stem from trouble at home in early 
childhood. Insecurity causes tension which promotes 
aggressiveness in these young people whose feeling of revolt is 
often expressed in aggressive ways. So, this is very important.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Repeated cuts in social programs will lead to a grim future. In 
spite of our concerns about Bill C-41, in spite of the federal 
government's paternalistic attitude in interfering in areas that 
should be under the authority of the provinces, in spite of the fact 
that guidelines were imposed that should normally be under 
provincial jurisdiction, and because this bill deals with the health 
of children and bettering their lives, children being the future of 
Quebec and Canada, this bill is an important bill. For these reasons, 
we from the Bloc, being the responsible members that we are, will 
be voting for this helpful bill, as imperfect as it may be.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the changes to the Divorce Act particularly as they impact 
the care and nurturing of children are important parts of a piece of 
legislation that affects all of society.
<P>
	Even if we as individuals are not touched directly by the terrible 
stresses and strains caused in a relationship by divorce, we in the 
greater society are affected profoundly by it. We are affected if 
people who have children do not look after their responsibilities as 
parents. We are affected because we as the greater society then 
have to step in to look after and nurture those children.
<P>
	We are affected by the consequences of divorce even if we are 
not involved in divorce ourselves because we know statistically 
that children who are nurtured in a two-parent home do better. That 
does not necessarily mean that single parents cannot nurture 
children, but the ideal is a two-parent home where the children are 
nurtured in an environment that is conducive to love, respect, a 
sense of family and a sense of community responsibility.
<P>
	That is not to say that there are not circumstances in which 
people will be raised in a single parent home where single parents, 
female or male, are heroic in their responsibilities and in their 
ability to raise children to become citizens of the first order.
<P>
	Having said that, we know statistically that children who are 
reared in a two-parent home have far less propensity to get 
involved in crime and do better in school.
<P>
	Our legislation should speak to two particular objectives. It 
should speak to what we can do as a society to encourage families 
to stay together. Then, if in the unfortunate circumstance we find 
ourselves, myself included, in the throes of divorce, how can we 
make divorce least disruptive? How can we keep as many lawyers 
as possible out of it? How can we ensure that both parents, even 
though they have divorced, do not divorce the kids? How can we 
make the best of a bad situation?
<P>
	The first objective is what we can do as a society to ensure the 
problems do not happen in the first place. We know that many 
divorces result from family distress brought on by financial 
problems. Obviously there are other reasons but we all know that a 
family under financial stress is far more likely to have other 
problems crop up than a family not under financial stress. What can 
we do as a government to address this problem? The first we can do 
is nurture families. We can make it possible for families to look 
after and nurture their own children. The way we can do that is to 
provide tax relief to families initially. We can say as a society that 
our future is encompassed in our children, our grandchildren and 
their children. Everything we do as legislators should be focused to 
that end.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	We will be talking about the seniors benefit later today. I am 
absolutely amazed that as a nation we have decided to have a 
guaranteed annual income for seniors. That is what the seniors 
benefit is all about. All seniors will have tax free annual income 
after the year 2000 of $11,430 whether or not they need it. Then it 
will be taxed back very quickly for those who do not need it. That is 
another story.
<P>
	If we as a society can afford to have a guaranteed annual income 
for seniors, why can we not have a guaranteed annual income or a 
negative income tax for children? Children are the future of the 
country. We as a society will get a far better bang for the buck and a 
return on our investment if we do everything we possibly can to 
nurture children. That means we should do what we can to take the 
financial load off families and to keep the stresses in families to an 
absolute minimum to make it possible for them to nurture their 
children.
<P>
	We know that is the ideal and we know that is not the 
circumstance. We know families take in a whole spectrum of 
different models. Whether or not one person likes it does not have 
anything to do with it. As a society we must firmly focus our 
interests on children.
<P>
	How do we go about protecting children in the case of divorce 
and the circumstances that lead up to divorce? We say in our 
legislation that when a couple decides to divorce it might be in 
society's best interest to get involved in conflict resolution right off 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8126"> 8126 </A></B>
<P>
the bat. Rather than each party going to their lawyers and having a 
couple of barracudas working at it to see who is going to get more 
from the other, we could have some conflict resolution. They have 
made the decision to split up and on how they can best achieve this 
with the least possible damage to the children. The part of the 
legislation that envisions this is highly laudable and highly 
supportable.
<P>
	We appreciate there are cases that involve spousal abuse. There 
is no reason whatsoever for a spouse who is being abused to stick 
around for a split second. This raises a whole new set of questions. 
Why is it always the female and the children, the abused, who have 
to leave the domicile and go to a shelter? It does not make any 
sense to me.
<P>
	The reason is that we have to protect the rights of the abuser. 
Again the victims are being penalized and the abuser is not. We 
cannot just haul the abuser off to jail, keep him there and tell him 
that he cannot go anywhere near those people or abuse them. We 
usually have to take the mother and the children and put them in a 
safe spot, hopefully.
<P>
	We are now in a situation where we as legislators have 
determined that we will do everything we can to prevent the 
break-up from happening in the first place. We know this is the 
ideal. We know it will not happen in every circumstance but we 
should be working toward the ideal.
<P>
	That means we have to take financial pressure off families 
through tax relief focused directly at them. How on earth can we be 
concerned about tax relief and subsidizing Bombardier and other 
major corporations when we do not subsidize and nurture our 
children and make it possible for them to have a future? It does not 
make any sense. It is so completely wrongheaded that it defies 
reality.
<P>
	Now we come to the point where families are splitting up come 
hell or high water; it is going to happen. This is not a holier than 
thou speech. I have been in the middle of it. I know about what I 
speak. Whose responsibility is it to look after the children who are 
involved? Is it the state's responsibility or is it the parents' 
responsibility?
<P>
	When any of us decide to have children those children become 
our responsibility, our family responsibility, period. The only time 
the state should be involved is when the parents are unable to look 
after their responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	How do we go about making it easier or palatable for families to 
look after their responsibilities? First, we do not say that one 
person is right and the other is wrong. We do not say that either the 
male is 100 per cent wrong or the female is 100 per cent wrong and 
we will put one or the other into debtor's prison. We will make it 
impossible for one or the other ever to have another life.
<P>
	It seems to me that we should go right into a position of joint 
custody and joint responsibility. We know there are situations 
where we will not have that. We know there are situations where 
one partner, usually it is men, flee from whatever the 
responsibilities are.
<P>
	Again, we are addressing this legislation to the ideal. Our society 
has inculcated a culture where people intuitively know and 
automatically understand that, when they get married, when 
divorce or separation is envisioned down the road, their further 
responsibility is to nurture, protect and look after their children in a 
manner that is harmonious as it can possibly be. They know they 
should put marital problems behind them so that their children do 
not suffer further.
<P>
	In my experience the number one problem that people have 
brought to me relates to access to children. It is not paying 
maintenance. It is paying maintenance and not having access to the 
children. That is what drives people crazy. It is kind of the chicken 
or egg situation.
<P>
	Fathers or mothers who are non-custodial should have access to 
their children in a default co-parenting situation even if they split 
up. It cannot be said that maintenance and access are not 
inextricably linked because they are. If I or anyone else has a 
commitment to make a maintenance payment to his ex and does not 
do it, then obviously the ex will be enraged. The ex will be figuring 
out how to can get back at me.
<P>
	The only way to get back is through the children. Situations 
come up where maintenance payments are made, but for whatever 
reason, the custodial spouse makes it impossible for the 
non-custodial spouse to have his or her regular visitation. It breaks 
the link with those children. Somehow we need to ensure that, 
when maintenance payments are to be made, they are made but it 
does not exacerbate the already difficult situation caused by the 
divorce.
<P>
	It can be done in many ways. However, if the state has an 
involvement, it seems to me that when a custody or maintenance 
payment is made, it could be put into the general revenue and come 
back from the federal treasury to the individual who will receive it. 
If it can be done for GST rebates, why can it not be done for other 
things?
<P>
	The whole idea is to somehow mitigate or lower the potential 
avenues for distress, for disharmony and fighting between the two. 
Remember, our eye is on nurturing the children. It is not getting 
even.
<P>
	If we could, as a society, somehow inculcate the sense of 
responsibility so that people intuitively say: ``I know we have 
broken up, but having broken up, we will be both responsible for 
nurturing our children''. It is really none of the state's business why 
a marriage breaks up but having broken up, the default position on 
maintenance is 50:50.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8127"> 8127 </A></B>
<P>
	That means the cost of raising and nurturing the children is 
50:50. The tax circumstance is 50:50. I do not know why it has 
to go all one way or all the other. Why is it not possible, in a 
maintenance payment, for the person making the payment to pay 
50 per cent of the tax and the person who is getting it pays 50 
per cent of the tax. They are partners. It took both of them to create 
those children. It took both of them to get married in the first place 
and it took both of them to break up the marriage in the second 
place. Why can they not just go further and automatically have 
it that the default position is a joint responsibility?
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	I know that is the ideal. I know there are all kinds of 
circumstances where that is not necessarily going to happen. 
However, it does not have to mean that legislation cannot be 
framed for the ideal and the other problems cannot be dealt with as 
they arise.
<P>
	I would like to address one more issue in this debate and that is 
the role of the Senate. In particular, I would like to recognize the 
role of Senator Anne Cools in this debate. When this legislation 
first went through the House Reform members were saying 
essentially what we are saying now, that the legislation is well 
intentioned but it certainly has some huge problems and these are 
of such major consequence that the bill should be changed.
<P>
	It is government legislation so there are winners and losers. This 
is legislation that speaks to the future of our country and how we 
raise and nurture our children and how we accept responsibility for 
our children.
<P>
	We were not able to change a comma, a period. As hon. members 
know, if the government is set on what it is going to do, the 
opposition has absolutely no role in it. As a matter of fact, I will 
take it one step further. If the cabinet or the Prime Minister or 
persons surrounding the Prime Minister want to go in a particular 
direction, that is way we are going to go. There will be no changes 
whatsoever.
<P>
	This is not a democracy. This is really an place where, if you are 
lucky, you may have some influence and might be able to change 
something.
<P>
	When Senator Anne Cools saw the legislation, she was able to do 
in the Senate, because of the precarious position of its majority, 
what we could not do in the House of Commons and that was to 
force the government to make some modifications which will 
greatly enhance this bill.
<P>
	It is incumbent on the official opposition, ourselves and other 
people in opposition to recognize the courage that Senator Anne 
Cools has shown in standing up to the government machine. It 
means that she becomes the person in the room from which there 
emanates a faint odour. It is not a very comfortable position to be 
in.
<P>
	I think democracy is made better when it is tested. Leadership is 
made better when it is tested. On this and other legislation Senator 
Anne Cools has shown the resolve and the fortitude to test the 
government when it needed to be tested and when it was impossible 
because of the way this House works for the opposition to be able 
to test it. It has had to come through one of its own members in the 
Senate who has the strength of character to stand up against the 
government machine.
<P>
	This legislation will come back. The deal is done. It will be 
debated here. It will become law in its somewhat redefined and 
changed form. It is better than it was but it still does not recognize 
the primary problem in family law and that is that family law 
should not be of an adversarial nature. The family court should be 
unified. It is not the same as criminal law. It should not be 
adversarial. We should be going into conflict resolution and doing 
everything we possibly can to nurture the children of the future in 
as harmonious a circumstance as we can.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to direct some comments to the my hon. 
colleague's brief remarks on such important legislation.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	Having met with a lot of parents who have gone through a 
divorce where children were involved, I have often equated that 
unfortunate development in people's lives to the loss of a child. 
However, our court system today promotes a very adversarial 
environment and it affects the children of divorce. I believe the 
hon. member said that the primary focus has to be on the 
well-being of the children, the unintended victims of marriage 
breakdown and divorce.
<P>
	I have endeavoured to address this issue and the greater issue of 
co-parenting and access to children. It is assumed that while a 
marriage is intact that both parents are good parents. That is the 
assumption of society. It is the assumption that both parents are 
worthy of raising their children. However, on the breakdown of a 
marriage somehow that assumption is thrown out the window.
<P>
	I have introduced private member's Bill C-242 which calls on 
the government to introduce a system of joint custody in all cases, 
except where it can be shown that it is not in the best interests of the 
child or in the case of documented evidence of abuse or neglect 
which would preclude joint custody. I believe this would go a long 
way toward removing the adversarial approach in our court system. 
I would like my hon. colleague to comment on that.

``Another headline, another murder, another statistic, another

the victim is an old friend, she was like an adopted sister, not 
another faceless victim-No, it's true you won't remember Lynn

will announce who that will be. It will be future seniors, the 
disabled, widows and the working poor. This is nothing short of 
outrageous.
<P>
	In a cruel and mean act, the Liberals will cut pension benefits to 
widows and the disabled. Pension exemptions will no longer be 
fully indexed, which will hit low income workers. The poor will 
pay more yet receive fewer pension benefits.
<P>
	One can tell a great deal about a society as to how it provides for 
its elderly, its poor and its disabled. To introduce this regressive

<P>

<HR>

<P>
	The youth employment strategy is the result of consultations 
with youth, educators, parents and the private sector to determine 
how best to serve the needs of Canada's young people in today's 
newer and new economy. Each of us recognizes that youth 
unemployment is unacceptably high and that there is nothing as 
frustrating as wasted potential.
<P>
	The strategy consolidates over $2 billion in new and existing 
funding for programs and services that young people need to make 
the transition from education to our workplace. One of the 
strategy's highlights is the new internship programs that will 
provide work experience to young people in the crucial areas of 
science and technology, the environment, international trade and

government and paid over $2.3 billion to their shareholders, the 
people of Canada. Unions, businesses and the general public own 
over 90 per cent of bank shares. Since most bank shares are owned 
by the people, when banks make a profit, the people profit.
<P>
	Banks have recently introduced initiatives such as implementing 
a code of conduct, offering alternative dispute resolution and 
appointing both internal and national ombudsmen.

Saturday, February 15 is National Flag of Canada Day. The

was promoted throughout the year by the Canadian Heritage One in 
a Million Flag Challenge.
<P>
	I have also taken an interest in acknowledging this newfound 
tradition as I am searching for a song to commemorate the pride 
and glory of our Canadian flag. Over the last few months I have 
issued a challenge to students and artists in my constituency to 
compose new lyrics to the ``Maple Leaf Forever'' that reflect the 
significance of our Canadian symbol.
<P>
	On the occasion of this year's flag day celebration, I would like 
to issue the same challenge to all Canadians to come up with a song 
that will capture true Canadian sentiment.
<P>
	We have been represented by the red and white maple leaf since 
1965. I feel the best way to honour this symbol would be to 
accompany it with a musical tribute.

government members talking about how they were unaware of the 
full consequences of Bill C-41. One suggested that they should just 
acknowledge their mistakes and accept the amendments.
<P>
	This is quite typical of how the Liberals have managed this 
Parliament. They just accept the notion that their cabinet ministers 
create perfect legislation so they put their brains in neutral. 
Independent thought is not welcome in the Liberal caucus.

<P>
	Right now Canada's student loans can be a problem, not only for 
those trying to pay them off but also for those charged with trying 
to collect on defaulted loans. We can address this situation and 
acknowledge the realities faced by graduating students by 
establishing an income contingent loan repayment plan. This is

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there will be no objections to the tabling of a document 
from National Defence. For once, something is forthcoming and 
we are extremely pleased. One down, at least.
<P>
	Today, in Quebec City, Montreal, Rimouski, Chicoutimi, 
Sept-Iles, Matane and Moncton, CBC audiences and staff are 
demonstrating to remind the government of its promise to provide 
the CBC with stable funding.
<P>
	Another coalition, the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, has 
pointed out that the government's $10 million to CBC radio fulfils 
only 3 per cent of its promises, while laying the CBC's 
independence open to question.
<P>
	My question is to the government as a whole. How can the 
government explain that it has imposed cuts $14 million higher 
than what the Reform Party proposed in their taxpayers' budget? 
How can the government claim to be defending culture, when it has 
pulled $414 million from CBC and found millions for publicity 
schemes of all kinds, from kites to flags to who knows what?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Government of Canada is committed, as the minister said again 
last week, to long term funding for the CBC. All departments of our 
government have undergone cuts, and the CBC is no exception.
<P>
	The hon. member across the way knows very well that the CBC 
will be the only government agency to be exempt from cuts for the 
next five years, so its funding will be stable in the long term.
<P>
	What is more, the CBC will receive some $900 million annually 
from the public purse. That is nothing to sneeze at. It is a 
considerable amount and one that is ensured for the long term, of 
course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it seems to me that I heard that already sometime in 1993, 
regarding 1993-94. That is a recycled promise.
<P>
	The Friends of Canadian Broadcasting; the mayor of Quebec 
City, Jean-Paul Lallier; Tony Manera, who resigned from the 
presidency of the CBC because of this government's policies; 
Pierre Juneau, another former CBC president; Margaret Atwood; 
Pierre Berton; Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte, and many others 
question the government's true intentions toward the CBC.
<P>
	Why has the government opted to weaken an independent 
institution, and to transfer funds into agencies which are not 
answerable to government, such as the cable production fund?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when the hon. member claims that this fund is not answerable to 
government, he is surely aware that part of this fund will go to the 
CBC. He cannot be unaware of this. I believe that his accusation is 
totally off the mark.
<P>
	Second, he is also surely aware that the government is 
committed, I repeat, to long term funding for the CBC, to the tune 
of some $900 million annually-$800 million in special credits, 
plus part of the fund-as I have just indicated.
<P>
	Finally, the government has again just recently announced 
additional funding, over and above the amounts I have just referred 
to, for Radio Canada International.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is an old ruse, taking everything away and then giving 
a little bit back. Then they can say: ``See how generous we are. 
Look at what we have just given you''.
<P>
	They have played the same game with transfer payments. They 
cut something like $1.3 billion, and then they come along with 
$215 million. This is a government that is an expert at giving out 
trifling amounts.
<P>
	Is the government aware that the recycling of old promises from 
the dead book, to which the Prime Minister does not even refer any 
more, is just the old shell game, for this same government has, 
since 1993, chopped the CBC budget like no other government has 
ever dared do?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I believe the Bloc Quebecois and their friends in Quebec are in a 
very poor position to give any sermons on this matter. 
Radio-Québec has also cut its staff by close to 50 per cent.
<P>

<P>
	Let us also keep in mind the words of the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata. On March 16, 1995, she said, and I 
quote: ``If any cuts are needed, there are big ones to be made at 
CBC''.
<P>
	No such big cuts were made, and we have ensured that there is 
long term funding, after making some cuts, of course, which were 
required. But, contrary to the Bloc Quebecois, we have not made, 
nor do we intend to make, big ones.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
should remember that the cuts the hon. member suggested were to 
be made at headquarters, not in the lower echelons. The 
government understood the message perfectly. It cut $414 million 
and 4,000 jobs. That is what happened.
<P>
	My question is directed to the government, to anyone who can 
answer. After the Minister of Canadian Heritage, we now have the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs on the national unity bandwagon. With 
his new rules for awarding grants, from now on the minister will 
only fund projects that will promote Canadian unity abroad.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> The Minister of National 
Defence says hear, hear, but what he is saying is ``get out'' to 
Quebec culture and Quebec artists. That is what it means.
<P>
	Since this funding policy is discriminatory and antidemocratic, 
will the minister, so as to refrain from all political interference, 
remove this criterion from the objectives of the foreign affairs 
cultural relations program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
how typical of a member of the Bloc to think that promoting 
Canada abroad is undemocratic. That is what the hon. member 
opposite said.
<P>
	I would urge him to think about what he said. I am sure the hon. 
member knows perfectly well, as we all do, that promoting 
Canadian culture includes promoting Quebec culture and, of 
course, this is also a cause all Canadians, I believe, should fully 
support.
<P>
	If the reverse occurred, I am sure all members and taxpayers in 
this country would see this as totally inappropriate. The role of the 
Government of Canada is to promote Canada. That is clear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
may remind the minister that is not what they said on the Canadian 
heritage committee to, for instance, Marie Laberge and our Quebec 
film makers when they accused them of making anti-Canadian 
films.
<P>
	The government should set its sights a little higher and allocate 
money for promoting culture abroad on the basis of the quality of 
the works and projects submitted by the artists and not in terms of 
the political propaganda sought by this government.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member did not ask a question. However, I would like to 
comment on what he said.
<P>
	The hon. member is apparently suggesting to the members of 
this House that it is totally correct and appropriate, in his view, for 
the government to subsidize or otherwise advance money to artists 
who are sending messages that do not support Canadian unity and 
that proposals supporting Canadian unity would be unacceptable to 
him. I have trouble understanding the hon. member's logic.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the defence 
minister is trying to rewrite history in the Somalia scandal. 
Yesterday he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is no one in Canada who believes that there was or there is today a cover-up 
of a murder.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister's arrogance knows no bounds. Does he think that 
documents shredded themselves? Why does he think the Somalia 
inquiry wanted to hear from Bob Fowler, Kim Campbell and John 
Anderson?
<P>
	How can the minister possibly claim that no one tried to cover up 
the beating, torture and murder of Shidane Arone?
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there have been 
a number of results where people have paid a significant price as a 
result of judicial processes arising out of the shootings and the 
beating of Somalian citizens.
<P>
	What I said yesterday and what I am sure the hon. member 
knows I said is that Canadians who are interested in this matter 
know what happened on the ground in Somalia when these 
incidents occurred that resulted in the death of Somalian citizens.
<P>
	I also went on to say-and the hon. member does not make 
reference to it-what happened subsequent to that. Not just the 
courts martial and the fact that individuals who were directly 
involved in the killings and the torture were dealt with, but it was 
totally unacceptable how the institution and the organization 
reacted subsequent to those incidents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8134"> 8134 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why we are taking very dramatic action to try to develop 
systems and procedures to ensure that when any intolerable or 
unacceptable incident occurs there is a proper and appropriate 
response by the Department of National Defence and by the 
Canadian forces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the minister 
does not say is that he is shutting down the inquiry, thus covering 
up what happened at the top. That is what Canadians are saying the 
problem is.
<P>
	We know the documents were hidden, shredded or altered. 
Military police were misled and senior officers and bureaucrats 
tried to intimidate cabinet ministers and keep the Canadian public 
in the dark.
<P>
	If that was not an attempt to cover up a murder I do not know 
what was. There was a murder. There was a cover-up and this 
government is trying to cover up that cover-up by shutting down 
the inquiry.
<P>
	Why is the government so afraid of the truth? Why will it not let 
the Somalia inquiry get to the bottom of the murder cover-up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are dealing 
with an extremely serious and complex situation.
<P>
	If the hon. member is suggesting the incidents that occurred on 
the ground are unknown or were covered up, he should know, as do 
most Canadians who are interested in the matter, exactly what 
happened. It has been written about in books. It has been reported 
in news coverage. It has been discussed at the Somalia inquiry.
<P>
	Somalian citizens were shot. A Somalian citizen was tortured to 
death. Murders occurred. Action was taken through the military 
justice system to deal with those issues. That is well known.
<P>
	It is totally unacceptable to Canadians and we must at some 
point come to grips with it. The government is prepared to ensure 
that what happened subsequent to the murders and the torture not 
ever be repeated in the Department of National Defence or in the 
Canadian forces.
<P>
	The hon. gentleman refers to a number of allegations of 
shredding and of attempts to disguise what had taken place and to 
cover up, to use his term. That is what happened after the murders 
were very much made aware of, when the murderers or the people 
involved in the act that resulted in the death of Somalian citizens 
were dealt with.
<P>
	We have always said-and I continue to assure my hon. 
friend-that the government is absolutely committed to cleaning 
up a system that did not respond appropriately to the murders and 
the torture that occurred in Somalia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister only 
goes so far. As soon as we start moving up the ladder we shut it 
down. That is the point and he is missing that point.
<P>
	When the defence minister said yesterday that there is no one in 
Canada who believes there was a cover-up, did he actually expect 
Canadians to believe that? Does he not understand the gravity of 
what is happening or that he will never get the military reformed if 
he does not deal with the whole situation at this point?
<P>
	In my office we are hearing from Canadians. They are concerned 
about the cover-up and now the whitewash of the cover-up. Will the 
minister stop blustering, come clean with the Canadian people and 
let the inquiry get to the truth?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we also are 
getting calls. I received a call at my office from a gentleman in 
Smiths Falls who said that he supports what we are doing in 
bringing the Somalia inquiry to a conclusion.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	He also said that he had been talking to some people in the hon. 
member's party who said there should be an inquiry into why the 
Somalia inquiry was closed. If an inquiry was not appointed to do 
that, there should be another one appointed into why there was not 
a second commission appointed, because apparently Reformers are 
into inquiries these days.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	In response to a decision throwing out the transfer of flights from 
Mirabel to Dorval, the Minister of Transport once again insisted 
that ADM, a local administration, was responsible for managing 
the Montreal airports and not the federal Department of Transport. 
For almost a year now, the federal government has been hiding 
behind ADM to avoid public consultation and to avoid committing 
itself in this matter where its record for the past 30 years has been 
pitiful.
<P>
	Is the minister aware today that his inaction and irresponsibility 
are leading us once again to a standoff in the matter of the Montreal 
airports?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is well aware that the policy on the 
airports gives  local authorities the opportunity to reach important 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8135"> 8135 </A></B>
<P>
decisions regarding airports specifically and the regions where they 
are located.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Transport said, in response to a 
question, that the intent of his policy was to enable local authorities 
to make these decisions. The court expressed a different opinion, 
and the authority is the one before the courts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind the minister that the federal government is 
the tenant in this contract, and that the judge himself appealed to 
the federal government to act and to assume its responsibilities.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the minister is saying he still does not 
want to resolve a problem the federal government created through 
its own inaction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I think that even the hon. member understands there is a 
problem in a number of airports in Canada. Does he think a central 
government should make all these decisions? Or can a local 
authority resolve the problems of a given region? Is it not better 
placed to make these decisions?

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister 
of National Defence recently quoted from a document. I would ask 
that he table that document in the House.
<P>
	Yesterday the defence minister stated in the House that there was 
no cover-up of the murder in Somalia. Let me remind him that his 
department shredded documents, intimidated witnesses, withheld 
truthful information from the military police and withheld 
evidence.
<P>
	This points to a cover-up but we will never know the truth 
because the government is covering up the cover-up by shutting 
down the inquiry.
<P>
	When the defence minister says that there is no cover-up, how 
does he know? Does he have evidence or facts to base that on? Or, 
is he just politically interfering with the inquiry once again?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously we 
would not want to interfere in the work of this inquiry. The hon. 
member knows we are very conscious of our responsibility of not 
interfering in any judicial or quasi-judicial process.
<P>
	The government has decisions to make. I want to say to my hon. 
friend it is true that yesterday I referred to a document during 
question period. I have subsequently tabled that document with the 
Chair prior to the commencement of question period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Today's letter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> I hear the other member saying there are other 
letters or today's letter. Just to make sure there is no 
misunderstanding, that is one letter among several sent by the 
commissioners of the inquiry to the government asking for 
extension of time.
<P>
	To be fair and rather than to quote from the documents and add to 
more confusion in the hon. member's mind, I would prefer when it 
is appropriate to also table the three other letters that were sent 
from the commission to the government requesting extensions of 
time and explaining how they function. I will be happy to do that 
for the edification of the member and his colleagues.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. minister may table the 
documents during question period with a page.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
referring to the letter he quoted from today. I asked him if he would 
table that document.
<P>
	The minister stated in the House yesterday that there was no 
cover-up of the murder. Does he wish to withdraw that statement? 
He is drawing conclusions about events before the commission 
even produces its report. This is political interference with a 
judicial inquiry. Either the minister has evidence that he has not 
made public or he is interfering with the inquiry. Which is it? Is the 
minister interfering or hiding evidence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as to the first 
part of the question I would like to be able to comply with my hon. 
friend's request that I table a phone call but it is tough to do that. I 
made it clear that I had received a phone call this morning and I 
simply indicated to the hon. member what the conversation was 
about.
<P>
	Going to the second part of his question and discussing the 
specific issue of whether or not Canadians understand what 
happened on the ground in Somalia, the Somalia commission of 
inquiry has been going on now for nearly two years. It has heard 
over 100 witnesses. There have been hundreds of thousands of 
documents presented to the commission for its review.
<P>
	There have been courts martial. There have been appeals of 
those courts martial. There are people who are and who have been 
clearly identified as having been involved in the specific incidents 
that occurred on the ground in Somalia.
<P>
	What I have said and what I repeat is that Canadians who are 
interested in knowing what happened in those incidents are fully 
aware of what took place with respect to the murders by shooting or 
by torture.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8136"> 8136 </A></B>
<P>
	What I have also tried to explain-and I will continue to try 
to do this-is that subsequent to those incidents occurring many, 
many things took place which were unacceptable, which are 
intolerable and which cannot be allowed to be repeated.
<P>
	We are moving to try to correct those problems and those kinds 
of approaches. The hon. member and his party would like to have it 
go on until 1998, 1999 or maybe the year 2000. He can accuse us of 
many things but he will not be able to make it stick that we are 
going to procrastinate on as important an issue as what we are 
facing in this particular situation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of National 
Defence.
<P>
	The former director of the military police testified before the 
Somalia inquiry that, on three separate occasions, the current Chief 
of Defence Staff, who was the third top ranking officer of the 
armed forces at the time of the events in Somalia, refused to have 
the military police investigate the suspicious death of a Somali, on 
March 4, 1993, in attempt to cover up the circumstances.
<P>
	In light of the troubling and contradictory testimony of the Chief 
of Defence Staff and the former director of military police, could 
the minister tell us if he continues to support the current Chief of 
Defence Staff in spite of the fact that he was at the heart of the 
Somalia scandal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I always have 
been bery careful not to comment on testimony heard by the 
inquiry.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to evidence given by a person who 
appeared before the inquiry. I will let the inquiry draw the 
appropriate conclusions after it has heard not only the person the 
hon. member referred to, but also Admiral Murray, who is the 
Acting Chief of Defence Staff at this time.
<P>
	Of course, with all we have managed to accomplish since my 
appointment to National Defence, it is essential that those who hold 
positions in the Canadian Forces have the support of the Minister 
of National Defence, and that is the case for Admiral Murray.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would point out that the exact same thing was said 
about General Boyle. History is repeating itself.
<P>
	Since, when he appointed Vice-Admiral Murray as Chief of 
Defence Staff, the minister knew about his involvement in the 
events in Somalia and since he made sure the inquiry will not be 
able to determine whether or not there was a cover-up, how can 
Quebecers and Canadians be sure of the vice-admiral's integrity?
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Vice-Admiral 
Murray has testified before the inquiry. He gave evidence for 
several days.
<P>
	I have no doubt that, at some point between now and June 30, the 
inquiry will be able to table a report based on all the evidence and 
information before it. This is one of the reasons the government 
saw fit, after granting three extensions, to ask the inquiry to wrap 
up its hearings by June 30, so that we can obtain its findings and 
recommendations on a number of matters that have been under 
investigation for almost two years now, two years during which 
more than 100 witnesses were heard.
<P>
	No decision will be made on the evidence given by one witness 
or another until the inquiry has presented its findings.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the defence minister tried to blame the murder 
cover-up on the Somalia commission by quoting very selectively 
from a letter that he tabled only this morning.
<P>
	What the minister did not tell the House is how the letter proves 
that the minister knew his decision to shut down the inquiry would 
hide the truth and protect Liberal friends like Bob Fowler.
<P>
	Canadians want to know who the minister is protecting and why 
he is afraid of the truth.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is one thing to 
allege that someone is afraid of the truth. It is another thing to 
demonstrate that one is less than familiar with the facts.
<P>
	The gentleman to whom my hon. friend alludes, the current 
ambassador for Canada to the United Nations, was appointed to the 
position of deputy minister at the Department of National Defence 
during the previous administration's term of office. That individual 
retained the confidence of that government after the minister of 
national defence who was in office at the time of these incidents 
occurring became the Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member should be a little bit more careful with how he 
describes friendships of individuals and with whom they were, at 
least at one time, passing acquaintances if not friends.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this Liberal government is guilty of political interference 
in its own judicial inquiry, an inquiry that is supposed to be 
independent.
<P>
	The Liberals have broken their own promises to find the truth. 
They have betrayed the trust of the  commissioners they appointed 
and they have betrayed the trust of the men and women of the 
Canadian Armed Forces who expect justice to be done at the top, 
not just at the bottom. The minister knew his decision would bury 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8137"> 8137 </A></B>
<P>
the truth but Canadians will not let him. Again, why is he afraid of 
the truth coming out?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
mid-September the hon. leader of the Reform Party asked the 
Prime Minister of Canada to ensure, to guarantee-to use the exact 
word-that the results of the Somalia inquiry be made available 
before a federal election. He did not talk about the truth. He did not 
talk about friends of the government. He did not talk about getting 
to the bottom of everything. He simply said ``to guarantee that the 
commission respond and report before the election''.
<P>
	Is the hon. member suggesting that we should be telling the 
commissioners of the inquiry who they should call? That would be 
political interference. They have had an agenda for two years to 
call whatever roster of witnesses they wish. They had an 
opportunity to set their work plan in whatever manner they wish. 
Now after two years and $25 million the government decided it was 
time, after three extensions of their mandate, to make sure that it 
had a report by June 30.

ministers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, we can say that there are 
ministers here. The Hyundai plant in Bromont has been shut down 
for a few years. Business leaders and stakeholders, including the 
Société de développement régional, the SODER, still do not know 
about the company's plans regarding this important plant which 
employed over 800 people. In January, the Prime Minister visited 
South Korea, where Hyundai's head office is located.
<P>
	Could someone tell me if, during Team Canada's trip, the Prime 
Minister asked Hyundai's top executives about their intentions 
regarding the disused plant in Bromont?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, it seems that all the Bloc members who are here will ask 
questions. As regards the Hyundai plant, the hon. member knows 
full well that we co-operated with other levels of government to 
find a way to revive this plant.
<P>
	Hyundai decided to close that plant. The company repaid the 
money that had been invested by the governments, pursuant to the 
agreement signed by the government and Hyundai. As for us, and I 
believe it is also the case for the Quebec government, these 
amounts were paid back under the bilateral agreement between the 
federal and Quebec governments.
<P>
	We will try, together, to find a way to bring jobs back to 
Bromont.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, unless I am 
mistaken, the Prime Minister did not meet anyone regarding this 
issue, during his trip.
<P>
	Since the member for Brome-Missisquoi, who is responsible 
for Bromont, does not look after the concerns of his constituents, 
will the Prime Minister, or the minister who answered my first 
question, since he has some authority, pledge to ask Hyundai's 
executives about the future of the Bromont plant, through Canada's 
trade commission in South Korea?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I hear a lot more about Bromont from the member for 
Brome-Missisquoi than I do from Bloc members.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He is a very good member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> He is indeed a very good member. He understands 
something Bloc members do not understand. It is not Hyundai that 
will save the plant it used to operate. Hyundai has made its 
decision.
<P>
	There may be other possibilities for that plant, but the solution 
will not come from Hyundai.

According to a recent report of the Canadian Human Rights

Public Service of Canada agrees that it must reflect the 
composition of the public it serves. I regret that it may not be the 
same in all the governments in Canada but the Public Service of 
Canada does want to reflect the composition of the population.
<P>
	In doing this, in the last few years we have increased by 50 per 
cent the relative representation of visible minority groups. 
Treasury Board has even put together a program called the special 
measures initiatives program. This program has been supporting a 
series of innovative activities to assist visible minorities, including 
recruitment programs, initiatives to upgrade skills and promote 
marketability, and career development training to prepare 
individuals for senior positions. In this area the Public Service of 
Canada has clearly been doing its job.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday the 
defence minister said clearly in this House that there was no 
cover-up of the murder in Somalia.
<P>
	I would like to give the defence minister the opportunity of 
either withdrawing that statement or telling the House and the 
Canadian people how he knows there was no cover-up of the 
murder in Somalia.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I assume that 
we are speaking about the incidents in Somalia that occurred in 
early 1993 for which individuals have been charged and for which 
individuals have been found responsible. The names of the Somalia 
citizens who were killed are known to Canadians and to the hon. 
gentleman if he is interested in finding out. The incidents have 
been described, reviewed, investigated and the subject of judicial 
proceedings.
<P>
	What I said yesterday, and what I believe the Canadian people 
understand very well, is that what happened in Somalia was 
absolutely unacceptable. Two years later Canadians know that what 
happened subsequent to those incidents in Somalia, how the 
military justice system responded, how the military investigative 
capability was not up to snuff, was also intolerable.
<P>
	We believe that Canadians expect us to do something about it 
and that is what we are going to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the defence 
minister has not answered the question. He made a clear statement 
of fact yesterday that there was no cover-up of the murder of the 
teenager in Somalia and yet that is the very reason that the inquiry 
was called in the first place.
<P>
	I ask the minister one more time: Is he prepared to tell the House 
the facts on which he based the statement that there was no 
cover-up of the murder in Somalia or is he going to leave us with 
the conclusion that he is making an erroneous statement in the 
House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want 
the hon. member to spend a sleepless weekend worrying about 
whether or not I understand, and that Canadians understand, what 
happened with respect to the murders in Somalia.
<P>
	What I said yesterday is that every Canadian who really wants to 
get a clear understanding of what took place in Somalia knows who 
pulled the trigger. Everybody in Canada knows exactly what 
happened on the ground in Somalia to the extent that it can be 
determined after two years of work by the commission, military 
investigations, the courts martial and everything else that took 
place.
<P>
	The hon. member cannot distinguish between the problems that 
occurred, the incidents that resulted in death and the difficulties 
that the system had and the inappropriate responses that took place 
subsequent to those events. I think he should give Canadians more 
credit for understanding this than he has so far. Canadians know-

<P>
	If the CRTC gives in to Bell Canada's demands, business 
customers in small communities will pay between $44 and $54 a 
month for telephone service, while in larger centres the bill will be 
about $10 less.

ensure that telecommunications and telephone services essential to 
the competitiveness of businesses are just as affordable for SMBs

Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I believe the member knows that the CRTC is in the 
process of examining issues related to the affordability of 
telephone services.
<P>
	I think this is a very important question. One of the objectives of 
our information highway policy was that all Canadians should have 
affordable access to telephone services. But I think the member 
also knows that some very important changes are taking place in 
the  telecommunications sector. There are new services, using 
advanced technology, and all Canadians would like to receive

responsibility with that of the CRTC.
<P>
	I would point out that the basic issue here is that we have put in 
place a system of competition that has already resulted in a 
substantial reduction in long distance rates, thus benefiting all 
SMBs. This system has made it possible to set up competitive 
services not just for Canadian businesses, but also with respect to 
American businesses. Here in Canada, we will receive modern and

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the finance minister.
<P>
	Anyone who has signed a paycheque understands that payroll 
taxes are a disincentive to hiring. Employment insurance, workers' 
compensation and the proposed new Canada pension plan premium 
of nearly 10 per cent means payroll taxes will be almost 20 per cent 
of earnings. Then the victim pays income tax and then the GST. No 
wonder Canadians are tax poor.
<P>
	How can the government create an economic climate conducive 
to job growth, particularly for first time job applicants, when 
payroll taxes make it more cost effective to pay overtime or to 
utilize part time contract employees?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member ought to know that as a result  of the actions of the 
government, employment insurance premiums will be down by 
$1.7 billion. That is money which will be put back into the hands of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I want to thank the hon. member for giving me the opportunity to 
elaborate on this. He said there should be incentives for first time 
hiring. The hon. member may have forgotten that in the last budget 
we brought in a measure that forgave employment insurance 
premiums for all small and medium sized businesses. Some 
900,000 businesses across the country will be able to employ 
young Canadians without having to pay the premiums.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians understand intuitively when a finance minister 
rises to speak that his hand goes into their pockets at the same time.
<P>
	Employment insurance premiums currently take in over $5 
billion more than is paid out in benefits. It is nothing more than a 
federal payroll surtax. Canada pension plan premiums will be 
increased 69 per cent because the plan is seriously flawed.
<P>
	To limit job killing regressive payroll taxes, will the government 
limit increases in Canada pension plan premiums to a 
corresponding reduction in employment insurance premiums?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps the hon. member did not notice that my hand went into my 
own pocket.
<P>
	Reform is advocating a $3.5 billion cut in the CHST. It is 
advocating cuts in equalization. It is saying that it wants to 
withdraw moneys currently given to Canadians, in particular 
middle income Canadians. It wants to take it away from them. Our 
goal is to maintain the services that Canadians require for their 
livelihood.

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am tabling draft legislation to establish the Canada Pension Plan 
Investment Board and to amend the Canada pension plan, the Old 
Age Security Act, and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADAPENSIONPLAN">CANADA PENSION PLAN</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today it is my privilege to table draft legislation that secures the 
future of the Canada pension plan. These measures are the result of 
the review of the Canada pension plan which the federal and 
provincial governments have conducted over the past year.
<P>
	As joint stewards with the provinces, we are obliged to do all we 
can to make sure that the plan is there for Canadians, those who 
retire and those workers who become disabled during their careers. 
We believe that Canadians should be able to count on Canada 
pension plan benefits and that is why we have worked so hard to 
make sure that they can.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The problems facing the CPP are fundamental. The chief actuary 
of the plan has shown that, without changes, the CPP fund will run 
out of money in less than 20 years. Without changes, contribution 
rates would have to increase from under 6 per cent today to over 14 
per cent to cover escalating costs.
<P>
	In other words, younger generations would have to pay more 
than twice as much as now-and get no more for it. This is not fair. 
This is not affordable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The problem, quite simply, is that the Canada pension plan, as it 
is now, is not sustainable in the longer term at costs which are fair 
to future generations of Canadians. This has led some to say that 
we should dismantle the CPP.
<P>
	Let me say unequivocally that neither the federal government 
nor the provinces believe that anyone would be well served by that. 
Nor do Canadians. They told us during the public consultations that 
we and the provinces held across the country last spring that they 
want the Canada pension plan preserved.
<P>
	Canadians asked their government: first, to preserve it; second, 
to strengthen its financing; third, to improve the fund's investment 
practices and reduce its costs. In other words, they said not tinker 
with the CPP. Make sure it is there for us. That is exactly what we 
have done.
<P>
	The options we have considered in the course of our review 
required difficult choices, but we have come up with a strong and 
balanced package that will ensure the Canada pension plan is there 
when Canadians need it. We have done this in a way that has 
preserved a number of important features Canadians asked us 
specifically to protect.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	All retired pensioners or anyone over the age of 65 as of 
December 31, 1997 are not affected by the proposed changes. 
Anyone currently receiving disability benefits, survivor benefits or 
combined benefits is also not affected. All benefits under the 
Canada pension plan will remain fully indexed to inflation. The 
ages of retirement, early, normal or late, remain unchanged.
<P>
	Let me outline what has been done. The agreement makes a 
fundamental change in the financing of the plan. It would move 
from pay as you go to fuller funding to build a much larger reserve. 
The fund now is equivalent in value to about two years of benefits 
and is declining. With fuller funding, it will grow to about five 
years of benefits. It will be invested in a diversified portfolio of 
securities to earn higher returns and to help pay for benefits as 
Canada's population ages.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians also told us to stop giving governments exclusive 
access to CPP funds. We have done that. Governments have agreed 
to limit their access and to pay interest at market rates. Canadians 
told us we should not allow contribution rates to go over 10 per 
cent. We heard them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Contribution rates will rise over the next six years to 9.9 per cent 
and remain steady thereafter. This is far less than the projected rate 
of over 14 per cent that the chief actuary said would have been 
required if these changes had not been made.
<P>
	Several measures have made it possible to keep contribution 
rates to 9.9 per cent. Let me mention a number of them. The year's 
basic exemption, the first $3,500 of earnings on which no CPP 
contributions are paid, will remain at the current level. Retirement 
pensions will be calculated on the five year average of the year's 
maximum pensionable earnings at the time of retirement instead of 
the three year average. The administration of disability benefits is 
being improved to ensure that benefits go only to those who are 
eligible under the legislation.
<P>
	Retirement pensions for disability beneficiaries will be based on 
maximum pensionable earnings at the time of disablement and then 
indexed to age 65 by prices instead of wages.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8141"> 8141 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	New rules will be used to calculate combined pensions for 
people receiving both disability and survivor benefits, or 
retirement and survivor benefits. The death benefit will provide 6 
months of retirement pension to a maximum of $2,500.
<P>
	A stronger labour force attachment text will be required to obtain 
disability coverage-contributions will be required in 4 out of the 
last 6 years prior to claiming benefits.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These proposed changes are moderate and balanced. They will 
slow the growth of escalating costs. However, Canadians told us to 
go easy on changes to benefits and we have.
<P>
	Finally, Canadians told us to treat them like members of a 
pension plan. We are going to do that. Public accountability will be 
strengthened. Canadians will receive annual reports on their CPP 
accounts as soon as possible and federal-provincial reviews will be 
required every three years rather than every five years.
<P>
	With the exception of a small additional increase in the 
contribution rate for 1997, these proposed changes will come into 
effect in 1998 once legislation is passed.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The changes to secure the CPP are supported by the federal 
government and the provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and 
Alberta and the Northwest Territories.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We regret that we were unable to get unanimous support, and 
that two provinces felt they were unable to join the agreement. 
However, the requirement to achieve the support of two-thirds of 
the provinces with two-thirds of the population has been met.
<P>
	It is fair to say that all the options to secure the CPP had a fair 
hearing. Some were introduced, however, after the public 
consultations were over. The door is open to those ideas, along with 
several important issues that were beyond the scope of this review.
<P>
	Let me emphasize, our first goal was to assure the fundamental 
security of the Canada pension plan and we have done that. This is 
something with which governments have failed to come to grips for 
over a decade.
<P>
	We are now in a position to begin discussing other issues and we 
will do so as soon as possible. They include adding mandatory 
credit splitting during marriage, reviewing survivor benefits to 
make sure that they reflect changing realities in today's families, 
looking at the work  to retirement transition, including the 
possibility of providing partial CPP pensions during that period. 
We will look at British Columbia's proposal to expand CPP 
coverage up the income scale.
<P>
	Canada's retirement income system is not alone in facing 
challenges from an aging population and increasing longevity. 
However, almost no other industrialized country in the world has 
done as much as Canada has to come to grips with these problems.
<P>
	The government promised to make the retirement income 
system secure for Canadians. We are well on the way to doing it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The CPP is one of the three pillars of our retirement income 
system. Old age security and the guaranteed income supplement 
also provide public pensions for seniors. We have taken action to 
make these programs secure and sustainable as well.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The new seniors benefit announced in the 1996 budget will 
consolidate the OAS and the GIS into one benefit, beginning in the 
year 2001. This new benefit is designed to help those most in need 
and will protect low and modest income Canadians.
<P>
	The third pillar is tax assisted savings for retirement such as 
registered pension plans or registered retirement savings plans. We 
will continue to provide generous incentives for Canadians to save 
for their own retirement years.
<P>
	In summary, all three pillars of Canada's retirement income 
system are being placed on a secure and a sustainable footing. 
Canadians can rest assured that the pension system, as they know 
it, can be counted on by them and by generations to come.
<P>
	I would like to thank my colleague for his work on this file.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure, speaking on behalf of my colleagues 
and the Bloc Quebecois, to respond today to the draft legislation to 
amend the Canada pension plan that was just introduced by the 
minister.
<P>
	On the whole,, we welcome this announcement although, as 
usual, there are some aspects that give us cause for concern. We are 
very much aware, as the chief actuary of the plan has said, that the 
problems facing the CPP are fundamental and that without 
changes, the CPP fund will run out of money in less than 20 years. 
Without changes, contribution rates would have to increase from 6 
per cent to 14 per cent.
<P>
	I would like to go over briefly most of the measures contained in 
this draft legislation and comment accordingly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8142"> 8142 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the measures being proposed, the first one, is that anyone 
currently receiving survivor, disability or combined benefits and 
anyone over the age of 65 as of December 31 is not affected by 
the proposed changes. This is, of course, a pre-election measure, 
and we realize the minister does not want to give anyone the 
impression they will be affected immediately. However, those in 
the plan later on will be affected.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	The second measure is that all benefits under the CPP will 
remain fully indexed to inflation. This is very good news. In this 
respect, the federal government is following Quebec's example. In 
fact, Quebec agrees with the federal government on this score. 
Only two provinces do not.
<P>
	Every time Quebec has managed to defend its interests 
satisfactorily-we saw this in the harmonization of the GST, and 
we see it again today in this draft legislation-Quebec has always 
been among the first to agree with measures that support the 
interests of our citizens.
<P>
	Measure number three is that the ages of retirement-normal, 
early or late-remain unchanged. There is no problem here, of 
course. The fund now is equivalent in value to about two years of 
benefits. With fuller funding, it will grow to about five years of 
benefits, and we agree with the minister that this will guarantee the 
system's viability.
<P>
	Contribution rates will rise over the next six years to 9.9 per cent 
in 2003 and remain steady thereafter. This is another measure 
which, we believe, guarantees the system's viability in the long 
term. The basic exemption, the first $3,500 of earnings on which no 
CPP contributions are paid, will remain at the current level. There 
is no problem here either.
<P>
	Retirement pensions will be calculated on the five-year average 
of the year's maximum pensionable earnings instead of the 
three-year average. Some criticism here. This represents a small 
loss for beneficiaries, since the five-year average will usually be 
slightly less than the three-year average.
<P>
	Another measure is the improvement of the administration of 
disability benefits. In a recent report, the auditor general was 
critical of the way these benefits were administered and pointed to 
Quebec as an example of what should be done. Quebec was right 
again. We applaud the decision of the Minister of Finance to do 
things the right way. However, we will have to wait and see how 
this works out in the bill.
<P>
	Another measure is that disability benefits will be indexed by 
prices instead of wages. Here again, we have a complaint. This 
penalizes beneficiaries to some extent, because prices tend not to 
change as quickly as wages.
<P>
	New rules will be used to calculate combined pensions for 
people receiving both disability and survivor benefits or retirement 
and survivor benefits. This is very bad news.
<P>
	Let us take the example of a woman receiving benefits after the 
death of her husband and who then becomes disabled. She is 
therefore entitled to disability benefits. Under the current plan, she 
receives both benefits. Under the new rules, there will be a limit on 
the amount she can receive. In real terms, it could mean she would 
receive $800 a month instead of $1,200. It seems unfair to penalize 
people who are in such unfortunate situations this way.
<P>
	Death benefits will be equivalent to six months of pension or 
$2,500, whichever is less. At first glance, that does not seem to 
pose a problem.
<P>
	More active participation will also be required. Eligibility for 
disability benefits will require a person to have contributed during 
four of the six years preceding an application for benefits. Another 
downer. We will have to see what the witnesses before the Standing 
Committee on Finance have to say about the consequences of this 
measure. At first glance, it looks like a good number of 
contributors will be dropped from the plan and will thus have paid 
for naught.
<P>
	Canadians will also be receiving an annual statement from the 
Canada Pension Plan. This of course is a good idea. Canadians and 
Quebecers should always be given a statement of what happens in 
their files.
<P>
	A federal-provincial examination will be conducted every three 
years instead of every five. We also agree with this measure.
<P>
	As the minister pointed out, there are three pillars to the 
Canadian retirement income system: the Canada Pension Plan, the 
Old Age Security together with the Guaranteed Income 
Supplement, and the tax incentives for retirement savings, namely 
RRSPs.
<P>
	Where the rub lies is with the second pillar. The Bloc Quebecois 
will vigorously oppose the proposal to replace these two benefits 
with a single benefit for seniors in 2001.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	The finance minister's proposal discourages saving by 
penalizing Quebecers and Canadians who have put money away for 
their old age, because the benefit will be reduced by an amount 
proportionate to their retirement income.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois promised to battle the federal government 
on this every inch of the way, provided of course that Quebec is 
still part of Canada in 2002.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois' position on the third pillar, RRSPs, is 
outlined in the analysis of personal tax expenditures released by the 
Bloc in early February. We think it is not fair to Quebecers and 
Canadians for a  $1,000 investment in an RRSP to generate $313 in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8143"> 8143 </A></B>
<P>
federal tax savings for those who earn more than $100,000, while 
the same $1,000 investment in an RRSP will only generate a $175 
tax saving for someone earning $30,000 or less.
<P>
	As an alternative to the RRSP tax deduction, we have proposed a 
$268 across-the-board tax credit; this is the only fair and equitable 
way to encourage all taxpayers to save for their retirement.
<P>
	This pretty well sums up for now our reaction to the tabling of 
this draft bill. Naturally, we will follow it as it goes through all the 
different stages and will gladly offer comments along the way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today Canadians from coast to coast must be feeling a 
terrible chill as the shadow of the most regressive tax increase ever 
to hit our country has just been announced by the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	Today the government announced the fact that it is going to be 
increasing the current Canada pension plan payroll tax from 5.85 
per cent of earnings to 9.9 per cent. This is a huge increase in 
personal taxes, taxes that come out at the payroll, taxes that come 
out before income taxes are paid, taxes that come out even before 
Canadians get a chance to pay the GST. No matter how we slice it, 
this is a tax increase to Canadians.
<P>
	If this were a pension plan, as people understand or contemplate 
pension plans, it may not be that bad, people providing for their 
future, but that is not what it is. For example, today if you pay 5.8 
per cent of your salary in order to get a pension of $8,724.90 which 
is the maximum Canada pension plan, you would get $8,724.96 in 
pension. After the changes are made, you and your employer will 
have the opportunity to pay $3,193.36 to get the same $8,000. You 
are paying $3,200 a year to get approximately $9,000 in pension.
<P>
	Does that make any sense? This is RRSP season. If the 
government were selling mutual funds, and the government said to 
each individual taxpayer: ``We have this great new plan. This new 
plan means that you and your employer will get to pay $3,200 a 
year in premiums and for that you will receive about $9,000 a 
year'', the taxpayer would laugh because it does not make any 
sense at all. That is the basic problem with this plan. It does not 
give to the person who owns the plan and puts the money into the 
plan, the individual Canadian, a balanced, decent and honest return 
on their invested money.
<P>
	The government has said it is conscious of the negative impact 
that payroll taxes have on jobs. This is a historical fact. It is on 
record. The government has said and has evidenced that in 
recognition of that, it will reduce the employment insurance 
premiums by the magnificent sum of 10 cents per $100 of earned 
income.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	To put the increase into context, this increase in payroll taxes is 
$4.10 per $100 of income. So the government giveth and the 
government taketh away. When the government taketh away, is it 
balanced? I think not. And there again is the problem. Canadians 
are taxed to death. We cannot look at any individual tax alone. We 
have to look at the cumulative effect on our economy. The tax grab 
is an anchor that sucks the lifeblood out of our economy.
<P>
	When the payroll taxes go up for the individual and for the 
employer-as they will in this circumstance, after six years the tax 
will go up to $651.90 each-where does that money come from? 
The employer says: ``We have been contributing $1,889.56 per 
employee annually but now we have to contribute $3,193.36. 
Where are we going to get that money? Can we raise our prices? No 
we cannot''. We live in a competitive world. It shrinks profit. The 
shrunk profit means there is less money to reinvest in our economy. 
What does that mean? It means fewer jobs.
<P>
	If we want to see what is going to happen to our economy as a 
direct result of this tax grab because of the fact that we have 
mismanaged the pension funds over the last 36 years, just watch the 
unemployment rate rise after this kicks in. What is going to 
happen? Businesses are going to do the only thing they can do in 
order to get by. They are going to lay off staff because there is no 
other way to get money. How can businesses survive when a 
government thinks of them as a bottomless pit of resources? It just 
does not happen.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite used to be a highly placed member of 
the Toronto Dominion Bank. The Toronto Dominion Bank is going 
to look at all of those businesses and say: ``Gosh, you have 100 
employees. Do you realize you are going to have to come up with 
some $90,000 a year more just to cover the Canada pension plan 
premiums? Where are you going to get that money? More money 
will have to be injected into your business''.
<P>
	They businesses are going to say: ``But wait a minute. We cannot 
automatically assume that business is going to increase so the only 
thing we can do is lay people off or not hire them''. That is the 
problem with this. We must inculcuate a sense of fiscal 
responsibility within all governments.
<P>
	When the government says to someone that it is investing this 
money on his behalf, I ask hon. members and I ask Canadians, what 
person in their right mind would ask a government that is $600 
billion in debt to be his investment adviser? Only a government 
that is $600 billion in debt could say with a straight face to 
Canadians: ``Give us $3,200 of your money each year and we will 
invest it for you. For that, after your retirement, you will get almost 
$9,000 a year''. Give me a break.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8144"> 8144 </A></B>
<P>
	Anybody investing in even the most moderate RRSP would 
know that a privately managed investment plan would return more 
than double the same amount over the same period of time. How 
can the government possibly look Canadians in the face and say 
that this is a good deal? It is not a good deal. It is a tragedy.
<P>
	It is a tragedy for all Canadians because once again the 
government instead of facing reality is saying: ``We can get 
ourselves out of this problem by increasing taxes''. Every time you 
increase taxes, you poke another hole in the lifeboat of the 
economy. It makes it harder to keep our national finances in shape.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	We as a government and governments all over the country have 
fiduciary responsibility to our children and to their children to live 
within our means. That does not mean sucking money out of the 
country by means of a payroll surtax to lend to other governments 
at below market rates and make ourselves look better today at the 
expense of future generations.
<P>
	The government has no reason to be pleased about this tax 
increase which will negatively influence employment. It will be 
terribly detrimental to the employment of young Canadians, 
especially the most vulnerable young Canadians, those trying to get 
into the workforce for the first time.
<P>
	There is no excuse for the fiscal mismanagement of our country, 
our pension plans and our money which has brought us to the 
situation we are in today.

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for indicating 
that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate on Bill 
C-41, which, as was mentioned earlier, has been sent back to us by 
the Upper Chamber, the Senate, where it was amended, after 
having been passed by the House of Commons a few months ago.
<P>
	We therefore find ourselves once again in the situation that has 
arisen on several occasions during this Parliament of having to go 
back over debates we have already had because senators, more 
often than not for lack of enough to keep them busy, decide to 
review a bill and make amendments to it.
<P>
	In this case, three amendments were proposed by members of the 
Upper Chamber and I will come back to them during my speech.
<P>
	I would like to take a few minutes to deplore the state of affairs I 
have just described. The House of Commons is made up of 
representatives from throughout Canada, who have been elected by 
their respective constituents to represent them in this House and to 
introduce and pass bills meeting the needs and aspirations of the 
public.
<P>
	The nature of our parliamentary system is such that another 
Chamber, the Upper Chamber, or the Senate, whose members are 
not elected, may, for all sorts of reasons, more often than not 
partisan, hold up the legislative process by intervening to amend 
bills, thus delaying their implementation, often with unfortunate 
and even disastrous consequences for many members of the public.
<P>
	We must speak out against this meddling by representatives of 
the Senate who are, I repeat, not elected. They have been appointed 
by various governments. We know how senators get to the Upper 
Chamber. In the great majority of cases, they were selected for 
purely partisan reasons. There are exceptions, of course, and most 
senators are men and women who have served the Liberal or 
Conservative parties at some time in the past-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Or both.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, BQ):</B> -and 
which continue to serve one or the other of these parties, or as my 
colleague from Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup has just pointed 
out, both, more often than not. These people, who totally lack the 
legitimacy of having been elected, hinder things at every turn.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I referred to the comment my hon. colleague for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup made earlier, and I will take this 
opportunity to call attention to his efforts regarding the 
uselessness, not the usefulness, of the Upper House. My colleague 
was the spark behind a petition tabled in this House after doing the 
rounds of Quebec. You will recall that in excess of 30,000 of our 
fellow citizens called for total abolition of the Senate.
<P>
	In the years since 1993, every chance it gets, the Bloc Quebecois 
has initiated this debate, or taken part in debates calling for the 
abolition of the Upper Chamber. In reference to the very option of 
the Bloc Quebecois and the reason for its existence, that is Quebec 
sovereignty, we feel that the Upper Chamber is not the only thing 
that is superfluous. So is our presence here in the House of 
Commons
<P>
	We therefore hope that, as soon as possible, a new country will 
appear on the North American scene, a country to be called 
Quebec, which will be able to establish good relationships with its 
neighbours, not just to the south, but to the east and west as well. 
Then, we will be able to concentrate on debates focussed on finding 
solutions, instead of wasting time discussing the uselessness of the 
Upper Chamber and, more often than not, having to do as we are 
today, pick up again on something that they have decided to 
demolish.
<P>
	Since we are talking about the Senate and its purpose in life, 
although more often than not, what it does in the legislative sphere 
is pretty useless, the Senate does have a purpose. As I said, it is a 
kind of Club Med for former Liberal and Conservative party 
organizers which allows them to travel all over the world at 
government and taxpayers' expense.
<P>
	It also allows organizers with the Liberal Party or the 
Conservative Party to work full time on organizing and fundraising 
for their respective parties. In the case of the Conservative Party, if 
it had not been for the presence of  Conservative senators in the 
other place during the past three years, not much would have 
happened on the political or organizing side in the party, since here 
in the House, it has only two members, including the hon. member 
for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8147"> 8147 </A></B>
<P>
Sherbrooke, whose salary is largely paid by the taxpayers of 
Sherbrooke so he can act as director general of the Conservative 
Party.
<P>
	And more often than not, the hon. member is not in the House, 
because he is too busy rebuilding a party which in any case will 
disappear in the next election. And the same applies to a large 
number of senators whom I will not identify, since everyone knows 
who I mean.
<P>
	The fact remains that Bill C-41 is extremely important for all 
families with children which, for various reasons, have to separate. 
These children do not only suffer the emotional shock of separation 
but also suffer economically as a result of a decision made without 
their consent and often without consulting them. I repeat, they 
suffer the impact of such decisions, justified though they may be.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-41 is an attempt to deal with a problem that has been 
severely criticized by many people across Canada and especially in 
Quebec. The government wanted to deal with a problem that came 
before the Supreme Court with the Thibaudeau case, and the 
court's decision is well known, because as a result, support 
payments paid by a spouse are still deducted from that person's 
taxable income and added to the income of the person receiving 
them on behalf of the children, an important point.
<P>
	I do not have the statistics before me, but from memory I would 
say that over 90 per cent of the time women are the ones receiving 
support for children in their care and the ones obliged to add this 
support to their income.
<P>
	Their former husband, who has often faded into the woodwork or 
is hard to locate, often fails in his responsibility. When he does 
fulfil his responsibility, he gets a tax deduction, whereas his former 
wife, who has custody of the children, has an increase in her 
income and is obliged to pay tax on much of the child support.
<P>
	This is unfair. Bill C-41 wants to put an end to this. When the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice spoke in the 
House, he repeated what the representatives of the Liberal 
government had said, and what had been said of course by the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois. In Quebec, we have been aware of 
this situation for a number of years and, as we have in many areas, 
come up with solutions that are not only original but fulfil the 
needs and expectations of those concerned. I am speaking 
obviously of the guidelines that will be given to accommodate the 
establishment of the support payment.
<P>
	In Quebec, we have already set a number of criteria. The federal 
government can do the same. The bill  provides that the 
government may order that provincial criteria apply. This would 
avoid a double standard in the distribution and calculation of 
support payments.
<P>
	My colleague from Lévis mentioned this earlier. In the case of 
divorce, federal law obviously applies, because divorce is under 
federal jurisdiction. In the case of separation, the Civil Code will 
apply as it does to marriage. As we have said on many occasions, 
the situation is a bit of a paradox, but nevertheless not unlike the 
constitutional issue. Whereas marriage, or union, comes under 
Quebec law, divorce or the break-up of the union is under federal 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	This is the very thing we have been trying to explain to our 
colleagues across the way for decades, and we seem to be having a 
bit of a problem getting the message across.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Coming back to the bill per se, Bill C-41 provides an opportunity 
to include the criteria established by the provinces. The Bloc 
Quebecois spoke out publicly against this. It is not that we 
disagree, on the contrary; we insisted that the criteria established 
by Quebec or any other province should take precedence over those 
established by the federal government. We feel there is no need for 
the kind of paternalistic attitude the federal government displays 
more often than not in different areas in the name of imposing 
national standards.
<P>
	As I indicated at the beginning of my speech, the Senate made 
three amendments. The first one provides for the establishment of a 
joint committee of the House and the Senate on child custody and 
access. The Bloc is opposed to this amendment for a very logical 
reason. We believe the Senate should not interfere in any way with 
the preparation or consideration of this bill. There is no need for a 
committee on child custody and access.
<P>
	For this provision to make its way into the bill, it has to have 
been approved by the government through its justice minister. The 
Bloc Quebecois will make sure to sit on this committee to defend 
the views of our party of course, but also those of the people of 
Quebec.
<P>
	Another Senate amendment would lift the legal obligation to pay 
for the children's education until they turn 25 and let the courts 
decide instead. The Bloc Quebecois agrees with this amendment. 
In Quebec, this issue was settled by jurisprudence following an 
interpretation of the civil code. For us, it is a matter of fact. We 
certainly have no objection to the inclusion of this provision in the 
bill.
<P>
	Finally, the third amendment made by the Upper House would 
have both parents provide for the child instead of just the parent 
paying alimony. Again, the official opposition agrees with this 
amendment. The problem was raised in committee by Bloc 
members. Furthermore, in its own guidelines, the Government of 
Quebec looks at the income of both parents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8148"> 8148 </A></B>
<P>
	That is the position of the Bloc Quebecois on the Senate 
amendments. I will conclude my remarks by saying a few words 
about the need, in this kind of debate, to focus on those we are 
most concerned about, and I am talking about children of course. 
It was with our children in mind that we wanted to settle this 
matter.
<P>
	It is important to point out that the child support we are talking 
about in discussing the determination of the amount and the need 
for it to be fair and equitable is the support paid to ensure what I 
would call the optimal development of the children, and not to 
support the spouse.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	As I said at the beginning of my speech, children have no 
business paying for the decisions made by their parents, even if 
these decisions are warranted to ensure the well-being of the 
children as well as the adults.
<P>
	In other words, we must make sure every precaution is taken not 
to penalize the children, who already have to deal with the 
emotional trauma of separation.
<P>
	I do hope that, this time, the House will pass this bill, with 
amendments, so that it can be implemented as soon as possible.

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order for clarification.
<P>
	I want to explain a matter very briefly. Often in this House, 
whether in question period or in debate, we can totally and 
unintentionally provide information or give a response that is not 
entirely accurate.
<P>
	As I was leaving the House I was reminded by members of the 
press that today in question period I had referred to incidents in 
Somalia, to which I have referred many times, as shootings, as 
killings and as murder, as has been suggested by questions and 
responses.
<P>
	I want to apologize to the House and to my colleagues if in any 
way I mislead anyone by linking the two incidents in Somalia in the 
sense that I said ``that Canadians are fully aware of what took place 
with respect to the murders by shooting or by torture''. The torture 
death obviously is a totally separate incident from the shootings of 
the two Somali citizens and that shooting resulted in the death of 
one of them.
<P>
	As I recall to the best of my information, on two instances in 
question period today I spoke of murders, in the plural. Obviously 
there is one incident that can be described appropriately as a 
murder. The shooting that resulted in the killing of a Somali citizen 
is another  matter. I did not want under any circumstances to leave 
that kind of impression with my colleagues or with anyone else 
who is following this matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If it is to make a comment on what has 
just been said I will hear the hon. member. However, I do not think 
that is normally what is expected when somebody gets up and 
makes a statement such as the one just made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if it 
is permissible I would ask for a further point of clarification from 
the hon. minister. Is he telling the House that the death of the two 
civilians, which has been described in some accounts as execution 
style, were not murders? Is this what he is telling the House?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This is debate. It is not a question and 
answer period. However, in these very serious circumstances if the 
minister wishes to say something further I will be happy to hear it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you and the House very much 
for your indulgence. I think it is a question that needs to be 
addressed.
<P>
	The reason that I came back at the very first opportunity to 
clarify this is because I do not believe that any of us can draw 
conclusions with respect to the nature of the incident. What the 
judicial proceedings have demonstrated is that in one instance there 
was a death that has been described and was determined as murder.
<P>
	The other incident which involved a shooting and killing of a 
Somali citizen is still a question that needs to be resolved. That is 
why I want to make sure that I was not speaking of murders, in the 
plural, but making sure that I was as accurate as possible for the 
benefit of the House and for all of my colleagues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of 
order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We are not going to turn this into a 
question and answer period. This can be done better in question 
period. Is it a separate point of order or more on the same point of 
order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is on the same point of order but it 
would be for clarification purposes.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	In question period he made a comment which he now feels needs 
to be clarified. He has clarified it and I understand his clarification. 
However, why can we not have further clarification of what he has 
now said and submitted to the House because there is a difference.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8149"> 8149 </A></B>
<P>
	In one case he knows it was murder. In the other case he is 
unsure, but yet he has invoked closure on the hearings. Why has 
he invoked closure on the hearings when he does not have all the 
answers?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Hon. members are trying to develop a 
new procedure where we have questions and answers after anyone 
comes in to clarify something they said during question period. I do 
not think we have anything in our standing orders to cover this.
<P>
	We will return to the order of business which is before the 
House.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion in relation to the 
amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-41, an act to amend the 
Divorce Act, the Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement 
Assistance Act, the Garnishment, Attachment and Pension 
Diversion Act and the Canada Shipping Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be brief because I see that one of my colleagues 
would also like to direct a comment or a question to the hon. 
member from the Bloc who just spoke.
<P>
	I am a bit puzzled by comments he made during his presentation. 
Near the end he spoke about the three amendments which the 
Senate put forward with respect to this legislation. He indicated the 
Bloc will be opposing what he listed as the first amendment which 
is the promise to strike a joint committee to look at the whole issue 
of custody, access and visitation rights.
<P>
	All of us know that the debate on Bill C-41 has been somewhat 
lengthy. A lot of people have spoken about its flaws and its 
ineffectiveness in addressing certain issues of parenting which are 
so vitally important to the majority of Canadians.
<P>
	I wonder why the Bloc, other than perhaps animosity toward the 
other place, would oppose a joint committee to look at such a 
critical area pertaining to parenting.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thought I had answered that question, but I thank the 
hon. member for asking me to clarify my point. It is very simple: 
we are opposed to the Senate getting involved in this matter. We do 
not object to the fact that a committee should follow up on these 
issues.
<P>
	On the contrary, I pointed out that, while we do not think the 
proposed formula, that is the establishment of a joint committee of 
the House and the Senate, is the appropriate solution, we certainly 
intend to take part in  the work of that committee and to state our 
point of view, in the best interests of our fellow citizens.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased that the member has now said the Bloc is willing to talk 
about the joint committee.
<P>
	I want to question the member about the abolition of the upper 
House. He seemed very bitter about the upper House, when in fact 
it is one of the few occasions when it is actually doing its job, 
which is to look at legislation that has passed here with a sober 
second thought to find out if it is really fair.
<P>
	Thank goodness there is a very close balance between Tories and 
Liberals in that House right now because it has enabled some 
common sense to come out of it. They sent the legislation back here 
so that we could have a better look at it.
<P>
	Instead of scrapping the Senate and the whole country being held 
hostage to this place, does he not think it would be better to have an 
elected Senate which would have equal representation from each 
province? In that way we could have a truly representative House 
of sober second thought.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, again, it seems to me I answered that question. First, I 
want to express my surprise at hearing the Reform Party member 
rave about the Conservative and Liberal representation in the 
Senate. It seems to me he should hope instead that some Reform 
senators would be present, as was the case previously.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	We, Bloc Quebecois members, say that the Senate is a 
completely useless institution in our parliamentary process. 
Moreover, in my speech I made reference to our party's political 
option, which is known throughout Quebec, since we were elected 
by discussing it openly. Once Quebec achieves sovereignty, the 
issue of whether the Senate is useful or not will become moot. The 
Senate will simply disappear.
<P>
	Once this happens, our Canadian friends can certainly choose 
whatever institutions they wish to have, through whatever process 
they select. If they want an elected Senate because it would better 
meet their concerns and expectations, we will certainly not object. 
We will take note of that, and we will watch the implementation of 
such a measure. We, Bloc Quebecois members, have absolutely no 
use for the Senate, now or in the future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak to the Senate amendments 
to Bill C-41, which amends the Divorce Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8150"> 8150 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill has received a certain amount of notoriety and 
attention in the media over the last week or two because of the 
work of one senator in particular. As my colleague from North 
Vancouver just said, the Senate became a House of sober, second 
thought. The impression seems to have been left that this House 
did not adequately debate and take a good look at the bill. That 
is simply not true.
<P>
	Although that seems to be the perception of the public, and 
perpetuated by the media, in reality this bill was before the House 
on a number of occasions. I spoke to it twice, at second reading and 
at report stage, when both opposition parties brought forward a 
number of amendments which would have improved the bill.
<P>
	It is a bit ironic that Senator Anne Cools picked up on this when 
the bill came before the Senate. She also brought forward 
amendments, which people in the other place are entitled to do. We 
applaud their efforts to try to better the legislation that comes 
before them. After all, that is why the Senate is there.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague from North Vancouver just stated, this is 
one example that clearly demonstrates that the Senate can actually 
accomplish a lot, especially in the present situation with such a 
close balance of power existing in the upper chamber between the 
Conservatives and the Liberals. This is an example where the 
Senate can actually accomplish a lot, where it has a lot of power to 
force change to a piece of legislation.
<P>
	It is also ironic that while this could be used as an example of the 
power of the upper chamber, conversely it also indicates the 
powerlessness of this Chamber. The amendments that eventually 
came from the Senate that we are debating today are essentially the 
same amendments that were brought in by the Reform Party of 
Canada and the Bloc Quebecois when the House dealt with this 
legislation.
<P>
	As I indicated, I had the privilege to speak to this bill twice, once 
on October 3, 1996 and again quite extensively on November 4, 
1996 when the bill was in this Chamber for report stage.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	We brought forward four amendments. The first would have 
established an order of priority so that the court would look first at 
the needs of the child and the non-custodial parent's ability to pay 
and then at the applicable guidelines for child support. As the bill is 
written and still exists, the court only looks to the guidelines. We 
see that as a real flaw in the bill and one that has not been addressed 
by the Senate amendments.
<P>
	The second amendment we brought forward is that the 
guidelines established under the bill should take into consideration 
the needs of the child and the ability of the parent to pay.
<P>
	The third amendment would extend the period from 30 to 50 
days for a non-custodial spouse to react to the receipt of notice that 
his or her passport may be suspended or federal licence withdrawn 
for non-payment of support. This is a real concern in that a 
situation could develop because of this legislation whereby a 
non-custodial parent due to an error, and in these days of 
technology computer errors happen all the time, could arrive at a 
port or airport planning to leave the country perhaps for 
employment overseas only to find their passport had been revoked.
<P>
	In cases where there has been a legitimate error, by the time the 
individual could go through the appeal process they could perhaps 
have lost their job. How would this be beneficial to the child that 
the legislation is supposedly being put in place to help support? 
This is a very real concern.
<P>
	We put forward another amendment dealing with the same issue 
that would extend the period from 10 to 20 days for deeming that a 
person has received notice that the passport may be suspended or a 
license revoked for the same purpose. A little more advance notice 
might prevent a tragic situation when a person could conceivably 
lose their employment and their ability to support their children 
because of some error.
<P>
	We have no problem where an individual has gone through the 
process and it is obvious the non-custodial parent is intent on not 
abiding by their responsibilities for the support of the children, that 
the law treats it as a very serious offence. With the garnishment of 
wages provision the bill provides that the children are properly 
cared for and supported.
<P>
	However, to go to the extent of revoking passports, the bill goes 
a bit too far as there certainly could be some errors in the future. 
When they come to light they could prove to be quite tragic in the 
sense of loss of income for support of the very children the bill was 
designed to assist.
<P>
	Another area I want to get into is custody and access which the 
bill does not deal with. We have said on many occasions when the 
bill was before the House and when speaking on this issue outside 
the House that the bill deals with the monetary aspect of child 
support but completely misses the boat by not dealing with custody 
and access and co-parenting. It does not promote an enhanced 
environment for co-parenting.
<P>
	As mentioned in the debate earlier today, the problem many of us 
see in the whole area of divorce and what happens to the family is 
that the divorce process seems to build a sense of adversity 
between the two parents. The very system promotes adversity 
rather than trying to arrive at a more amicable conclusion to the 
divorce. We have said that while the overall purpose of Bill C-41 is 
quite admirable, it is very lacking in this area.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8151"> 8151 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	While I am speaking on this issue, it reminds me that I 
introduced private members' Bill C-242 in the House of Commons 
on March 20 last year. The bill would give joint custody in all cases 
of divorce except where it could be shown to the court that it was in 
the best interests of the child or children to have sole custody 
awarded to one parent. Obviously there are cases where there is 
abuse, neglect or a very real reluctance on the part of one parent to 
assume the responsibilities, however I would suggest that those 
cases are a very small exception in the vast majority of cases.
<P>
	I have talked to a lot of divorced parents in my riding of Prince 
George-Peace River and across the country about these types of 
issues. In the vast majority of cases, both parents are trying to 
operate in the best interests of the children. They want to continue 
to be loving and caring parents after the divorce just as they were 
when the marriage was intact.
<P>
	I noted in an earlier speech that according to a 1995 study by the 
U.S. Bureau of Statistics, non-custodial parents with visitation and 
joint custody were much more likely to pay support. Seventy-nine 
per cent of those with access paid support, while only 59 per cent of 
those without access paid.
<P>
	We cannot separate the issue of financial support from the issue 
of custody, visitation and access to the children. The two go hand in 
hand. We cannot separate the two because statistics clearly show 
that when there is greater access, there is also a greater willingness 
on the part of the non-custodial parent, on the part of the other 
parent, in most cases the father, to comply with support 
requirements. This is an area where the government could enact 
legislation that would support families rather than furthering the 
adversity that we have presently.
<P>
	A May 19, 1992 study by the Canadian Research Institute for 
Law and the Family found that almost 75 per cent of non-custodial 
parents reported problems in visiting their children. This shows 
that access and visitation rights in Canada are not working and it 
results in many problems, including as I said, non-compliance in 
child support.
<P>
	That is why when I was looking at this situation I opted to go 
with moving toward joint custody, which many of the states in the 
United States have adopted. It is not the total answer and I 
recognize that. I talked with many groups, such as the umbrella 
group FACT, Fathers are Capable Too, that was here about a week 
and a half ago. They had a number of speakers and held a press 
conference downstairs in this very building. They brought forward 
a lot of points on this legislation and on this issue which the 
government would certainly do well to listen to and pay heed to.
<P>
	As one of my colleagues said earlier, we have to look at this 
issue as a family issue and a support issue. Why is  it that both 
parents are assumed by society, by the communities and by the 
justice system to be loving, caring parents when the marriage is 
intact? We assume that unless it is proven otherwise. Yet it seems 
that once the marriage breaks down and the parents are separated, 
the system supports the sense of adversity between the parents. It 
gives certain rights and powers to one that do not go to the other. In 
1992 Canadian courts awarded joint custody only 16 per cent of the 
time. Sole custody is awarded to mothers approximately 72 per 
cent of the time and to fathers only 12 per cent of the time.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	In some instances where sole custody is awarded to one parent or 
the other, the parents themselves can arrive at a reasonable 
solution, a solution which is in the best interests of the children as 
far as visitation, holidays and access to those children go. It is in 
the best interests of those children and I certainly applaud those 
parents who are able to do that.
<P>
	However those statistics would indicate to me that there is a 
problem out there. The problem is that in many cases, the children 
are used as pawns. They are the innocent victims. That is my great 
concern.
<P>
	I do not want to come down on the side of the custodial parent 
versus the non-custodial parent or vice versa. I do not want to come 
down on the side of fathers versus mothers. I want to come down 
on the side of the children.
<P>
	As a loving, caring parent of three children, I cannot understand, 
I cannot fathom nor can I see anything worse than the loss of a 
child. In cases where the marriage breaks down and one parent 
wants to continue to be that loving, caring parent and wants to build 
a lifetime relationship with his or her child and is denied that 
access, it is an indescribable horror for both the parent and the 
child. Because of that separation, the bond between the parent and 
child as the young person grows and reaches maturity will never 
exist. This will affect everything that will happen to the child and 
will certainly be an ongoing anguish for the parent.
<P>
	Therefore, even with the amendments from the Senate, it is my 
judgment that this bill does very little. It fails to meet the very real 
need of so many families. We are failing the Canadian people on 
this very important issue.
<P>
	I only look to the future in the hope that following the next 
election we will have a Reform government in this country that will 
properly address this issue and so many other issues. We will bring 
forward legislation that truly does support the whole family.
<P>
	When we deal with the Divorce Act, the focus has to be what is 
best for the children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for Prince George-Peace  River for 
his remarks which I found very thoughtful. I realize he considered 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8152"> 8152 </A></B>
<P>
them very carefully. I would like to raise a point with my colleague 
that was raised several times in the House.
<P>
	I think we have all agreed that this bill has come back from the 
Senate with improvements through the amendments that have been 
added. My Reform Party colleagues on several occasions 
mentioned that this was the Senate doing good work. They credited 
the fact that it was a Liberal senator who, because of the equal 
number of seats in the Senate, was able to answer the concerns 
about the bill and to pressure for changes which resulted in 
improvements. All in the House feel there have been improvements 
here.
<P>
	I note that the member for North Vancouver used the occasion of 
this debate to suggest that while the Senate is doing its job in this 
instance, it would be better if the Senate were an elected Senate. I 
submit to my Reform Party colleagues that if the Senate were an 
elected Senate the even balance that has permitted this event to 
occur, a Liberal senator ensuring that amendments are made, would 
not exist. An elected Senate would be an unbalanced Senate. If it 
reflected the balance in the House of Commons the Liberals would 
be in great majority and there would be no opportunity for the kind 
of result we have here.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Does the member for Prince George-Peace River 
not agree that the current method of producing senators-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I ask members to address 
their comments through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not 
clear. Was the hon. member finished with his comments and 
question?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He was interrupted by the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the particular question because it gives me a chance to 
talk, very briefly admittedly, about the whole need for democratic 
reform in Parliament.
<P>
	The problem with the hon. member's comments is the 
presumption that were the upper Chamber an elected body people 
would vote for their senators in the same fashion as they would 
vote for their members of Parliament. From what we see in other 
parliaments and republics around the world it is not always the case 
the same party that holds the majority in the lower Chamber holds 
the majority in the upper Chamber.
<P>
	The presumption is that there are no free votes in this place. The 
basis of the member's comment is that there are no free votes; they 
will simply vote along party lines. Yet in this case Liberal Senator 
Anne Cools stood up to the pressure from this justice minister, 
stood up to the pressure from the government, and did not allow 
this piece of legislation to be fast tracked through the upper 
Chamber. That is what took place. She stood up to the pressure and 
forced through the amendments we were unable to force through in 
this Chamber.
<P>
	This Chamber does not allow free expression and free votes in 
the House. There are no free votes in the House. The very basis of 
the comments made by the hon. member across the way allude to 
that fact.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I recently had a letter from a constituent in my riding of 
Kootenay West-Revelstoke who was concerned about the issue 
the hon. member for Prince George-Peace River brought forth, 
that is denial of access of the non-custodial parent.
<P>
	This individual was very concerned having over the years paid 
thousands upon thousands of dollars which he was required to pay. 
He paid each time on time with honour and yet was denied access. 
There is nothing in the system to address that. It is a very important 
point.
<P>
	My hon. colleague addressed it very well as he always does 
when he speaks. Would he make a few comments on why such a 
common sense provision has met with such resistance by the 
government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
reason common sense provisions do not prevail with the 
government across the way is that there is no common sense over 
there.
<P>
	If common sense was the guiding motive for legislation in the 
House we would have a lot less legislation. A lot of the bills that 
have been brought before the House over the past three years have 
done very little in the eyes of the citizens out there in the real world 
who might be watching the debate today.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	At one point I commented that a party running for election to the 
House of Commons could very well win a substantive majority if it 
ran on a platform of repealing useless laws and legislation rather 
than bringing in inconsequential, ineffective legislation like the 
government has done over the last three years.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
motion?
<P>

IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (for the Minister for International </B><B>Trade)</B> 
moved that Bill C-81, an act to implement the Canada-Chile Free 
Trade Agreement and related agreements, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
debate a very important piece of legislation for all Canadians. The 
legislation would solidify the good trading relationship Canada has 
had with Chile.
<P>
	Bill C-81 is enabling legislation for the Canada-Chile Free Trade 
Agreement. It is an important milestone for us because it broadens 
the access to Canadian products and services under a free trade 
regime into Latin American and South American countries.
<P>
	As most people in the House and in the country are aware, 
Canada has a very proud and strong tradition of being very 
competitive in international markets.
<P>
	I come from Atlantic Canada which has a history of trade. Many 
times I have said in the past that up until 1867 when we were 
merely a British colony places like Nova Scotia did a great deal of 
trade. The reason Nova Scotia did so well in the 1800s is that the 
culture of the people in Atlantic Canada was to look abroad.
<P>
	The port of Halifax, the finest natural port in the world, used to 
be chock full of ships plying their trade. I am told one could almost 
walk from the shores of Dartmouth to the shores of Halifax on a 
good summer day. Ships from all over the world were coming into 
the port of Halifax in the 1850s and 1860s to trade with the world. 
They would not just trade with central or upper Canada. They 
would trade with the New England states. They traded a great deal 
with Latin America, with the Caribbean, with Europe and with the 
rest of the world.
<P>
	In 1867 with the formation of Canada and the various regimes 
and nation states that were being put in place protectionism became 
the name of the game. For well over 120 years we saw countries 
like Canada looking more and more inward and putting up barriers 
to trade to protect their industries and markets.
<P>
	In the last decade there has been an explosion in trade 
deregulation. If we look around the globe we see the  emergence of 
different trade groups like the European Union and the Mercosur 
block in South America. In North America we initially had the free 
trade deal with the United States which was then extended to 
Mexico and was known as the NAFTA.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Great debates took place in Canada on whether or not this nation 
was up to the challenge of competing globally and of removing the 
tariff and non-tariff barriers to its own markets, on whether or not 
we had the wherewithal as an entrepreneurial class of Canadians to 
still be competitive, to have growth in our industries and jobs, and 
to create wealth.
<P>
	Maybe the verdict is out but I think the verdict in on free trade. 
After two recessions, one in the early eighties and the other in the 
early nineties, Canadian industries are among the must competitive 
in the entire world.
<P>
	In my job as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
International Trade I deal with some of the most successful 
competitive companies with the best practices in the world. They 
are Canadian companies in almost every sector: mining, natural 
resources, telecommunications and infrastructure. They are 
renowned around the world for the way in which they do their 
business, the quality of the product and the timeliness of delivery 
of their service.
<P>
	In the last few years we have seen the Canadian industrial 
infrastructure take advantage of the reduction in tariffs and the 
introduction of free trade in the NAFTA. We continue to penetrate 
the toughest market in the world, the American market.
<P>
	The statistics are important. At the risk of sounding boastful I 
would like to repeat them. Canada, this great country of ours with 
30 million people, does $1 billion a day in two-way trade with the 
United States of America. We ship $550 million in goods and 
services south of the border and we get $450 million back. For 
every working day of every month in Canada, Canada does over $1 
billion in two-way trade. This is a small country with 30 million 
people and we do over $1 billion every working day.
<P>
	If anybody out there questions whether or not Canadian 
industries are up to the challenge of free trade and can compete in 
international markets and keep their own markets the answer is yes.
<P>
	Canada leads G-7 countries in terms of the percentage of GDP 
coming from trade. It is approaching 39 per cent. It boggles the 
mind that Canadian industry has been as competitive as it has been. 
Most of the nearly 700,000 jobs created since the government came 
to power have been created in industries that have expanded their 
export performance. They have gone out. They have competed. 
They have penetrated markets. They have created jobs and wealth 
for Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8154"> 8154 </A></B>
<P>
	What does it mean in terms of jobs created in international 
trade? How do they relate? They relate in a very real manner. For 
every $1 billion in exports from Canadian industry there are 
11,000 jobs maintained or created in the Canadian economy. These 
are not the traditional McJobs at $5 per hour. These jobs are in 
the high tech sector. These are jobs for scientists, researchers and 
professionals. These jobs create real wealth and prosperity across 
the country.
<P>
	Places like Atlantic Canada where I come from have benefited a 
great deal. It has taken us a little longer to twist our minds around 
to the fact that we once again can be competitive and that we are no 
longer bridled and collared by just the domestic marketplace and 
the regulatory regimes that go with it.
<P>
	Increasingly we see ships from around the world once again 
making the port of Halifax and the port of Saint John, New 
Brunswick, part of their international ports of call. We see the jobs 
that come with that. We see more and more people from around the 
world looking at places like Atlantic Canada because of its 
strategic location, because of its natural resources and because of 
its history of entrepreneurship and trade. Increasingly we are 
seeing these individuals looking at places like Atlantic Canada and 
the ports in the province of Quebec and in British Columbia as 
places where they want to invest dollars.
<P>
	The recent history of free trade has been extremely successful. 
About a year ago we decided we would not wait for the United 
States which had decided not to give fast track authority to its 
president to pursue trade liberalization or free trade negotiations 
with Chile. We as a government made a strategic decision to follow 
an independent forum and an independent trade policy. It was in 
our best interest, because we knew how competitive our industry 
was, to extend our free trade negotiations to our friends to the 
south. We found a willing partner in the great nation of Chile. Chile 
said: ``We also want to become a partner in free trade with Canada. 
We believe there is a tremendous amount we can do together''. The 
negotiations began in January 1996. In less than one year, on 
November 18, 1996 the Prime Minister of Canada and the 
President of Chile initialled the free trade deal between Canada and 
Chile.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	It is a very important deal. It showed the world that Canada was 
not just going to talk about free trade. It showed Canada was going 
to pursue opportunities wherever they existed so Canadian 
companies could have access to foreign markets. It showed that we 
were not afraid to allow foreign companies access to the Canadian 
marketplace because we were absolutely convinced of the 
competitiveness of our industry and our entrepreneurs.
<P>
	What has this deal done for us? Some people would ask why we 
would go with Chile, that we do not really have a lot of trade with
<P>
that country. We do have a lot of trade. We have about $700 million 
a year in trade. More important is the recognition that we invest 
about $7 billion in Chile. Canada is the second largest investor in 
Chile. It is important for us. It gives us a window on that market in 
South America.
<P>
	This is a good deal for Canada. It is a deal that has good support 
around the House of Commons. It immediately reduces the import 
duty for about 75 per cent of the goods that Canada exports to 
Chile. For the rest of the goods, by and large with one or two 
exceptions, over the next five years a zero tariff will be applied.
<P>
	The deal also allows us to do a couple of other things which I 
will cover quickly. It gives us a very good dispute settlement 
mechanism which is similar to the deal we have with the United 
States. On trade remedies, where I will draw the line, we have 
agreed in this deal that there is no room in a free trade association 
for anti-dumping laws to be applied. This is a great victory for 
Canada. This deal is a great victory for the people of Chile.
<P>
	I look forward to support from all members of the House to have 
this speedily passed at second reading and referred to a committee 
so that on June 2 this free trade deal will come in force for the 
benefit of all people of Canada and Chile.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I have engaged in 
some discussions with representatives of the official opposition 
and the Reform Party. There is unanimous support for this 
legislation. I know the sitting has been extended until two o'clock.
<P>
	Could we have unanimous consent that there would not be any 
questions or comments to any of the interveners, that we would still 
have a member from each of the two parties, the Bloc Quebecois 
and the Reform Party speak, and then we would put the question.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I see there is no consent to that so let 
me try this. While there would be questions and comments if 
people chose to have them, that a member of the Bloc would speak 
and then a member of the Reform Party. At that time you would put 
the question. Effectively, you would not see the clock at two 
o'clock.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, we would be in agreement, but on 
condition that each party be limited to 10 minutes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Subject to the wrinkle added, is there 
consent from the Reform Party to that?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8155"> 8155 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought we had discussed that we 
would allow one question on the Liberal member's speech and 
then after that no more questions, just finish the speeches if they 
wanted.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We have added a second wrinkle. There 
will be one question to the hon. parliamentary secretary and then 10 
minutes to each of the parties. Agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
listening to the speech of the hon. member for Dartmouth, I do not 
think he is a Liberal. He spoke of all the virtues and strengths and 
benefits of a free trade agreement, of the North American free trade 
agreement and this wonderful agreement with Chile. My goodness, 
he sounds like an entrepreneur and a free enterpriser if I ever heard 
one.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	He also spoke of the advantages of Halifax. With his forward 
vision I am surprised that the Liberal Party under John Turner was 
against free trade. We hear these great sounding speeches from 
Liberal members which is quite an about face, but I might add a 
welcomed about face. However, I take exception to the reference in 
his speech about the NAFTA in terms of the dispute mechanism 
settlement.
<P>
	When the Liberals ran in the last election their three big issues 
were jobs, jobs, jobs; get rid of the GST and renegotiating NAFTA. 
We all know that they did not renegotiate NAFTA. They signed it 
the way it was presented.
<P>
	They made the mistake of not sticking to their original principles 
and by not adhering to their commitment to hold the agreement up 
until there was a satisfactory dispute settlement mechanism. That 
has really cost this country severely. It has caused a severe problem 
in international trade and trade with our partners because the 
Americans are taking advantage of us very chance they get. We 
would not have the dispute over softwood lumber. It would have 
been settled. Settlements would be a lot faster if there was a proper 
dispute settlement mechanism in place in the NAFTA.
<P>
	Based on the comments in his speech that he feels this is a good 
deal with Chile because it is the same as the one Canada has with 
the States, I submit we are not happy with the one with the United 
States. It is causing some problems. I would like clarification of 
that kind of double talk.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member needs a lot of 
clarification if he misunderstands that the Liberal Party has always 
been the traditional party of free trade. It was not the Tory Party, it 
has never been. The hon. member laughs, but if he looks at some of 
the most important trade liberalization moves that have been  taken 
since 1867, they were taken by the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	What he does not want to understand is that when the Liberal 
Party of Canada goes forward with trade liberalization, it does not 
succumb to the wishes of the United States. We stand firm for the 
rights of Canadian industry. We have done it under NAFTA. We 
have done it under the FTA and we have done it with Chile.
<P>
	Finally, the hon. member has asked a very important question. 
He alluded to the fact that the dispute settlement mechanism under 
NAFTA simply does not work. I would like to sit down and show 
my hon. colleague that the dispute settlement mechanism has 
worked very well. Of the disputes that have gone full term, Canada 
has won over 90 per cent of them. I believe the deal we have 
negotiated has protected Canadian industries.
<P>
	With respect to the promises made in the election campaign 
about NAFTA, working groups have been established to look at a 
subsidies code as well as at anti-dumping. Those reports are going 
to be the subject of negotiations and discussions at the next NAFTA 
commission. If he is still around when those are discussed we will 
be edified with the results of those negotiations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-81, an act to implement the 
Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
	It was at the Summit of the Americas held in Miami in late 1994 
that the decision was made to allow Chile into NAFTA. One year 
later, following complications in its negotiations with the US, the 
Chilean government decided to break off talks.
<P>
	Canada and Chile then looked into the possibility of bilateral 
negotiations on an interim agreement. This agreement would 
eventually pave the way for Chile's accession to NAFTA.
<P>
	Negotiations with a view to such an agreement took place 
between January and November 1996, and the Canada-Chile Free 
Trade Agreement, signed in December 1996, will take effect June 
2, 1997. It is an interim agreement, one purpose of which is to 
facilitate the accession of Chile to NAFTA, probably around the 
year 2000.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	First of all, I will tell you the Bloc Quebecois is pleased that this 
agreement has been signed, and it is with an open mind that we 
prepare to welcome our Chilean friends into the vast North 
American free trade zone.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is obviously in favour of the principle of 
free trade. I would point out that this has been the traditional 
position of the Quebec government. Furthermore, we were strongly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8156"> 8156 </A></B>
<P>
in support of the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the 
United States.  Let us remember that this was one of the primary 
issues in the 1988 federal election campaign in Quebec.
<P>
	Similarly, we also supported extending the FTA, which later 
became the NAFTA, as well as the Canada-Israel Free Trade 
Agreement.
<P>
	In reiterating the sovereignists' strong position on free trade, I 
cannot help thinking about the last election campaign of the Liberal 
Party, the party forming the government today.
<P>
	I was listening earlier to the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister for International Trade as he boasted-we have a more 
colourful expression for it-that they have been in favour of free 
trade since 1867. I would encourage the parliamentary secretary to 
take another look at his history books.
<P>
	At the time, the Liberals were strongly opposed to the free trade 
treaty with the United States. In the infamous red book, the 
Liberals promised, on page 24-the parliamentary secretary does 
not need to take a history course, all he has to do is read the red 
book-that ``a liberal government will renegotiate the 
Canada-United-States Free Trade Agreement and NAFTA''.
<P>
	It just happens that this is another one of their broken promises. 
Today, a few years after they came to power, the Liberals seem to 
have miraculously converted to free trade.
<P>
	Indeed, once elected, the Liberal Party decided to change its tune 
and is now finding the Free Trade Agreement quite acceptable. It 
likes its purpose, content, and wording so much that instead of 
making changes to it, the current government used it as a model to 
draft the Canada-Chili Free Trade Agreement, and rightly so.
<P>
	Of course, since the purpose of the Canada-Chili Free Trade 
Agreement is ultimately for Chili to join NAFTA, it was 
appropriate to include dispositions similar in many respects. 
However, I believe that since it is on a smaller scale, with less of an 
impact on both partners, it would have been possible to include 
certain elements, if only to put its feasibility to the test. I refer 
mainly to parallel agreements.
<P>
	As was the case with NAFTA, parallel agreements on the 
environment and labour standards are attached to the Canada-Chili 
Free Trade Agreement. I believe the government could have taken 
this opportunity to include environmental and labour standards 
within the agreement.
<P>
	The government should have done everything in its power to 
raise the labour standards and thus increase protection for Chilean 
workers. I will, once again, quote the red book where the Liberals 
said: ``Future trading arrangements will be shaped not only by 
economic considerations but also by social concerns''.
<P>
	The Liberal government could have included a clause on respect 
for human rights and democratic principles. In any case, the 
government must not forget that, over and above trade and 
commercial interests, it bears some responsibilities both on the 
national and the international scene.
<P>
	On the question of human rights, I want to emphasize that the 
Bloc Quebecois considers that respect for fundamental rights is a 
top priority and that such a principle should always be part of any 
agreement like the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
	Trade must go on, free trade must be encouraged, but not at the 
expense of our responsibilities as individuals and as members of 
the global community.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade feels that the protection of 
human rights has no place in a free trade agreement, but the free 
trade agreement between Israel and the European Union contains 
an interesting clause in this regard.
<P>
	It says: ``The relations between the parties, as well as all the 
provisions in this agreement, are based on respect for human rights 
and the democratic principles that underlie their domestic and 
international policies and constitute an essential part of this 
agreement''.
<P>
	As I have said repeatedly in this House, respect for human rights 
will not come about automatically, either in isolation or through 
trade. I now take this opportunity to applaud the Quebec 
government for subscribing to an unknown part of NAFTA this 
week: the North American Agreement on Labour Cooperation.
<P>
	This agreement will now allow the filing of complaints against 
businesses in the United States or in Mexico which do not respect 
certain basic principles relating to their employees' working 
conditions. Apart from Quebec, Manitoba and Alberta are the only 
provinces to have signed this agreement.
<P>
	I will conclude by welcoming a new economic partner of Quebec 
and Canada. The institutionalization of closer political and 
economic ties with Chile, through this bilateral agreement, and 
possibly in the longer term, through its accession to NAFTA, is 
promising.
<P>
	For many Quebecers and Canadians, Chile is now associated 
with democracy, political stability and economic success. What a 
change for a country that, for a long time, reminded us more of 
authoritarianism and human rights violations. In less than a decade, 
Chile has been able to put itself in the forefront of a renewed, 
resolutely modern and promising continent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my party has agreed to 
this truncated form of debate because, like the government, we 
would like to see 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8157"> 8157 </A></B>
<P>
this bill get into  committee where it can be properly dealt with. We 
do support it in principle. There are a couple of stickers in it that 
are worthy of further discussion. We will get to them in committee 
and at third reading.
<P>
	As everyone here knows, the origins of this treaty were at the 
summit of the Americas in Miami in 1994 where the leaders of 
Canada, the U.S., Mexico and Chile announced their intention to 
pursue Chilean ascension to NAFTA.
<P>
	Chile looked rather briefly at this possibility however, since the 
Clinton administration was unable to convince the U.S. Congress 
to fast track a treaty to a pass or fail vote without amendment. Chile 
therefore backed away from the risk of entering into an agreement 
that could be further modified after it was signed.
<P>
	This treaty as everyone knows, although it will have bilateral 
advantages to Canada and to Chile, certainly is mostly about what 
the Department of Foreign Affairs likes to refer to as building 
bridges. The Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade sometimes calls the Canada-Chile FTA an interim bilateral 
free trade agreement because it is hoped that the agreement will 
ultimately lead to incorporating Chile into NAFTA, or FTAA as it 
is sometimes called now, a free trade agreement for the Americas.
<P>
	It appears that the U.S. Congress' stubborn refusal to fast track 
Chile's entry into NAFTA will be to our gain. Mexico already has 
an FTA with Chile and the Americans will eventually have to get 
on board through the free trade agreement for the Americas 
initiative.
<P>
	One of the advantages of leading by example is that we do get a 
head start. Chile has strong trade links throughout the southern 
hemisphere, in particular through its association with Mercosur, 
the common market between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and 
Uruguay. Chile is not a full member of that trading bloc. Therefore 
even though it has this easy access, it was able to give us certain 
considerations which are a little better than it is giving to its 
neighbours.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	For example our agricultural products will get much better 
treatment. Many Canadian companies are already finding that 
Chile is an excellent gateway or an open door to the other markets 
in Latin America.
<P>
	The deal in its immediate consequences provides Canadian 
exporters with significantly improved access to the Chilean market 
through the elimination of the 11 per cent duty on about 75 per cent 
of the goods which we ship into Chile. Since 80 per cent of Chilean 
exports into Canada are already duty free, it is reasonable to expect 
that the adjustment phase for the Canadian market will be very 
moderate.
<P>
	In the agricultural sector which is of particular concern to me 
Canadian durum wheat which accounts for 35 per  cent of Canadian 
agricultural exports to Chile will benefit from an immediate 
removal of the 11 per cent duty currently imposed. There is similar 
treatment slated for barley and pulse seeds.
<P>
	Duties on Canadian exports of a variety of processed agricultural 
products will be reduced to zero over five years. The exception for 
a long phase out period is for Chile's most sensitive product, 
milling wheat, but in 17 years that will be duty free as well. On the 
Canadian side we will phase out a limited number of tariffs over six 
years primarily for horticultural products. Canada's over quota 
most favoured nation tariffs for dairy, poultry and eggs are 
excluded from tariff elimination and will continue to be protected.
<P>
	However it is not all wine and roses. Some Canadian producers 
are afraid of the Chilean $15 a day average farm wage, cheap land 
and flexible government regulations, all of which lower the cost of 
production for Chilean agricultural goods. Fortunately most 
Canadian horticultural produce will be available during our 
summer and fall and Chilean produce will fill in the winter-spring 
gap of our growing season. So Canadian and Chilean producers 
will mostly complement each other rather than compete head to 
head.
<P>
	Apples however are another story. This is a very significant 
worry. B.C. fruit growers have expressed concerns about the six 
year phase out period of the FTA's anti-dumping regulations. 
Chilean apples have been entering Canada duty free for years with 
no problems apparent. However Canadian orchardists are uneasy 
over the precedent that the agreement sets when Chile eventually 
gets into the general NAFTA agreement for this reason: A few 
years back the price for red delicious apples was driven below the 
cost of production when Washington state growers dumped their 
product in the B.C. market. The Okanagan apple producers 
eventually won damages under the anti-dumping laws in the 
Canada-U.S. FTA.
<P>
	Should Chile eventually be admitted to NAFTA and the phasing 
out of anti-dumping regulations be extended to all NAFTA 
partners, Washington producers could dump their apples in Canada 
again and drive down domestic prices. So it is not Chile they are 
afraid of, it is the U.S.A. which is sitting in the wings watching 
this.
<P>
	We must be cautious. I hope that this will be addressed in 
committee. The only remaining recourse for Canadian growers in 
the scenario that I have outlined would be an appeal to the 
Canadian International Trade Tribunal, a safeguard action. The 
CITT could apply immediate tariffs on a temporary basis and 
probably for one season. It would be a mirror image of our never 
ending softwood lumber dispute, only in this case the plaintiffs 
would be north of the border instead of south of it.
<P>
	Let us proceed with a moderate degree of caution. In general, 
this treaty is a good deal for both Chile and Canada but like all 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8158"> 8158 </A></B>
<P>
treaties, it is not perfect and I would not want to see British 
Columbia apple growers sacrificed for the general benefit of our 
trade relations.

	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-249, an act to amend the Nuclear Liability Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill would amend the Nuclear 
Liability Act. Members may ask: What is the Nuclear Liability 
Act? The Nuclear Liability Act was passed in 1970 but was only 
proclaimed in 1976. Its purpose was to make operators of nuclear 
installations absolutely liable for damages, but at the same time it 
limited their liability for a particular incident to $75 million.
<P>
	When I say that it made them absolutely liable, I mean that it 
provided that victims of a nuclear accident would not have to prove 
negligence against the operators of a nuclear facility; they merely 
had to show that the damages to their person or to their property 
were caused by a breakdown or by an accident at the nuclear 
installation. Once they did that, the defendant was absolutely 
liable. However as I said, the liability was limited to a total of $75 
million for all claimants on any one particular incident.
<P>
	The Nuclear Liability Act also protects manufacturers of nuclear 
facilities and manufacturers of components for nuclear facilities, 
such as General Electric, Westinghouse and others. It protects them 
from any liability whatsoever. It does the same thing for the 
suppliers of fuel for nuclear installations. In other words, all 
damage claims by victims of a nuclear power accident must be 
channelled to the operators who are in turn limited to $75 million.
<P>
	The act also provides that where the damage exceeds $75 
million, the Government of Canada may decide to pay additional 
amounts, but that is not obligatory.
<P>
	It should be noted that all operators must be licensed under the 
Atomic Energy Control Act by the Atomic Energy Control Board. 
Of course the purpose of that is to screen out unreliable operators.
<P>
	Bill C-249 which is before the House today would do two things. 
First, it would increase the liability limit for operators from $75 
million to $500 million per damage incident. Second, it would 
oblige the government to pay damages when they went above $500 
million, subject to certain conditions.
<P>
	Why is this necessary? Why am I putting forward this bill? It is 
necessary because the liability limit of $75 million is totally out of 
date and inadequate.
<P>
	There are presently 23 nuclear installations in Canada situated in 
Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	If we were simply to adjust the $75 million maximum to 
compensate for inflation, the adjusted maximum calculated for 
1989 would be $279 million. As members know, it is now 1997 so 
with further inflation adjustment the maximum would be close to 
$500 million.
<P>
	Experience has now shown us that the original maximum was 
woefully too low. The 1986 Chernobyl breakdown resulted in $300 
billion of damages in Ukraine and Belarus. As a result of that 
accident 250,000 people had to be evacuated from their farms, 
villages and communities.
<P>
	Briefs to the Ontario Hydro hearings in 1990 demonstrated that a 
severe accident at the Darlington, Ontario installation would result 
in damages of $1 trillion. In 1990 the <I>Business Journal</I> stated that 
Ontario Hydro was not adequately insured for damage from 
accidents of this kind.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that Toronto is closer to Pickering than 
Kiev was to Chernobyl yet Kiev incurred approximately $100 
billion in damages in 1986. That is probably why the city of 
Toronto with Energy Probe and Rosalie Bertell went to court in 
1986 to have the Nuclear Liability Act declared unconstitutional.
<P>
	Unfortunately in 1996 after 10 years of legal wrangling they 
were obliged to drop their action. The principal opponents in that 
action were Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick Power.
<P>
	Some say that these changes are not necessary because Canadian 
installations are extremely safe. It may be correct that the Canadian 
safety record is a good one, and I congratulate the operators for 
that, but no one will argue that our system is fail safe. Not only do 
we have the examples of Chernobyl in 1986 and Three Mile Island 
in the United States in 1979, but in 1995 in this country there were 
786 unusual incidents recorded for Canadian installations and 391 
were formally reported to the Atomic Energy Control Board.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8159"> 8159 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1983 there was a serious accident at the Pickering 2 
installation less than 20 miles from Toronto. The two reactors were 
shut down for four years. A pressure tube had burst without 
warning in the in the very core of the reactor system. The 
replacement cost was $700 million.
<P>
	Ontario's nuclear facilities are not built to withstand the 
magnitude of earthquakes now anticipated in this region. An 
earthquake is considered the most likely cause of a severe accident 
to a nuclear power facility.
<P>
	The bill is also necessary because individuals in Canada cannot 
get personal or household insurance which will cover them for 
damages resulting from a nuclear facility accident. No insurance 
company will cover this risk for individuals. The insured has no 
coverage for radioactive contamination. I was shocked to learn that 
but that is the case. None of us can get an insurance policy which 
will cover us against these kinds of damages.
<P>
	Consequently the only recourse for individual damage claims 
from victims is the operators under this law. At present the 
operators are only liable up to $75 million. One can imagine what 
this would give to the citizens of greater Toronto if there was a 
Chernobyl type breakdown at Pickering or Darlington. One million 
people would get about $75 each.
<P>
	In the United States under the 1957 Price Anderson Act recent 
amendments require liability coverage of $160 million per reactor. 
Plus, in event of claims beyond that, a fund has been established 
which provides total coverage of up to $7 billion. Sweden has 
recently increased its liability in similar circumstances from $81 
million to $130 million per reactor, and Japan from $80 million to 
$240 million.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	If you were affected by a nuclear accident, Mr. Speaker, because 
the winds deposited radioactive fallout over your home, business, 
farm or workplace making them uninhabitable for tens or perhaps 
hundreds of years, think of what this would mean to you, quite 
apart from the knowledge that you and your loved ones might 
contract cancer or your offspring suffer genetic damage.
<P>
	Financially your means of livelihood could be wiped out and 
your property destroyed. You and your family could be ruined and 
there is no way to protect yourselves because insurance companies 
also fear a meltdown. Every insurance policy in Canada excludes 
coverage for nuclear accidents. No other industry has the freedom 
to destroy the health or property of innocent third parties who can 
neither insure themselves beforehand nor sue for compensation 
afterwards.
<P>
	In conclusion let me summarize. The Nuclear Liability Act in its 
present form is not adequate to compensate victims of a nuclear 
facility accident. Accidents have taken place before and can take 
place again. The law needs to be updated and revised. The act 
requires other amendments as well but I am not dealing with those  
today. For example, in the act there is a limitation that all claims 
must be made within 10 years. Now they realize that such claims 
for such damage only come to light much later than 10 years, such 
as damage to offspring or cancer and so on. There have been 
recommendations that claims be allowed up to 30 years but I am 
not dealing with that. I am not dealing with that today; I am simply 
saying that the act requires other amendments.
<P>
	I urge hon. members to send the bill to committee where 
witnesses could be heard and if necessary have the bill amended. I 
am extremely flexible on the details of the bill. If the evidence 
suggests that the liability should be higher than $500 million then 
change it. That is no problem. If the committee can find a better 
way of protecting citizens when the damage goes beyond $500 
million I am all in favour of improvements.
<P>
	On the other hand I cannot accept that this matter be ignored. 
Nuclear energy is too dangerous a substance. There is no perfect 
way to control it or its waste product. I would prefer that we stop 
using nuclear energy, but if that cannot or will not be done then at 
least let us make sure that any victims get fair and just 
compensation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce for 
introducing Bill C-249, an act to amend the Nuclear Liability Act.
<P>
	If I am not mistaken, the purpose of this bill is to increase to 
$500 million the maximum level of liability for which a private 
sector nuclear facility operator may be required to have insurance 
coverage. This level is currently set at $75 million. So, the cost of a 
nuclear disaster exceeding $75 million would be borne by the 
Crown if, of course, it agrees to meet that cost.
<P>
	Personally, I have no objection to increasing the insurance 
coverage required. I would even feel that $500 million is not 
enough.
<P>
	We only have to consider what happened last summer in the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region to realize that a figure like $500 
million is not nearly enough when disaster strikes.
<P>
	Another example more closely related to the nuclear industry is 
the Chernobyl disaster. Five hundred million dollars is not much 
considering the extent of a disaster such as Chernobyl. I am sure 
that accident cost billions of dollars, and I am not taking into 
account all the repercussions on the lives of the people affected.
<P>
	In a country like the USSR, at a time when human rights and 
individual rights did not count for much, officials were able to 
come through all right.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Let us imagine for a moment that such a disaster should occur in 
Canada. Let us consider the impact on people and estimate the 
costs of such an accident.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8160"> 8160 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not think Bill C-249 goes far enough. I agree that 
companies should have excellent insurance coverage, but is that 
the real problem?
<P>
	Some may think an insurance coverage of $1 billion is excessive. 
They think so because, collectively, we do not think we could 
experience such a disaster here. Personally, I am convinced we 
could.
<P>
	Since the beginning of nuclear power plants in Canada, a number 
of minor incidents have occurred. More recently, we have realized 
that certain components of our plants deteriorate faster than our 
engineers had expected. Moreover, those who run these plants in 
the public or parapublic sectors have only one goal: producing 
electricity at the lowest possible cost.
<P>
	Some of you may agree with me, but they do not think 
companies would push it to the point of jeopardizing public safety. 
Again, I am a bit more sceptical. Collectively, when we have 
examined this issue in committee or when other bills have been put 
before the House, we have realized that if public safety is a goal, it 
is not necessarily assured.
<P>
	In the nuclear industry, the situation is worse, because this form 
of energy is extremely difficult to control and a relative safety can 
be achieved only with the most advanced and carefully 
implemented technology.
<P>
	And I do mean relative safety. Also, $500 million in coverage 
does not seem like much for the following reason. If an accident 
were to occur in one of our plants in Quebec, in Ontario or in New 
Brunswick, it could mean massive population evacuations, and 
depending on the direction of the winds, it would not be surprising 
if our neighbours down south were affected.
<P>
	We know that several countries were affected by the fallout from 
the Chernobyl accident. Do you think that $500 million would be 
enough to deal with the problem? I do not think so. We would need 
to evacuate the whole population of some cities and towns, the 
sick, the elderly, the school children. Not to mention the 
unavoidable damages to the environment. The fallout could affect 
livestock, wildlife, the flora and all the food production over quite 
a large area. Add to that the destruction of whole service sectors in 
cities located near these facilities.
<P>
	Man still has much to learn about nuclear energy. An oil spill can 
be contained. With much effort, the environment can be restored 
within a few years, but following a nuclear accident, it will be 
thousands of years before the environment is back to normal.
<P>
	For example, such an accident in Canada would have a major 
impact on extensive forests, agricultural lands, and vast mining 
areas. Would 500 million years take care of it? In Ontario, with 
Ontario Hydro, in Quebec, with Hydro-Québec, in New Brunswick 
or elsewhere in Canada, I doubt any operator could deal with a 
major accident.
<P>
	The introduction of this bill is another opportunity for me to 
raise the question of the development of nuclear energy as a source 
of power. I really think that, in spite of the assurances they give us 
as taxpayers, the leaders of all the countries in the world have made 
decisions in too great a haste.
<P>
	We started to build nuclear generating stations without being 
assured of their total safety.
<P>
	To conclude, we support Bill C-249 but we are still sceptical that 
$500 million will be sufficient in the event of a major nuclear 
catastrophe.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the House on Bill 
C-249. I thank my colleague, the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, for bringing this important matter before 
the House.
<P>
	The hon. member has a long and distinguished history of service 
to Canadians. I commend him on his commitment to issues of 
public safety and well-being. This member is well known across 
the country for the good work he has done. He is especially well 
known in my part of the country.
<P>
	This proposed legislation is another example of my colleague's 
concern for Canadians and it deserves the careful attention of this 
House. As I understand it, Bill C-249 would achieve three 
objectives. First, it would increase the maximum level of a nuclear 
operator's liability for third party damage in the event of a nuclear 
accident. The hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce is proposing 
that nuclear operators be required to carry $500 million worth of 
liability insurance compared to the current requirement of $75 
million.
<P>
	By extension, Bill C-249 would increase the threshold at which 
the Nuclear Damage Claims Commission would be established and 
claims would be moved from the court system to the commission.
<P>
	Finally, the bill would require the minister to make liability 
payments once an order is issued by the commission. This 
addresses what some have criticized as unwarranted discretion on 
the part of the minister.
<P>
	I want to make it very clear that the government supports in 
principle the objective of increasing operator liability under the 
Nuclear Liability Act. We support a strengthened commitment to 
compensate victims of nuclear accidents. At the same time, we 
recognize that a number of other important changes need to be 
made to the act. I would like to take a few moments to explain why.
<P>
	The Nuclear Liability Act, as the hon. member said, was 
proclaimed in 1976. It establishes a comprehensive scheme for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8161"> 8161 </A></B>
<P>
compensating victims of injury and damage arising from nuclear 
accidents. Twenty years after its  proclamation, the act continues to 
uphold the principles that are important to a nuclear liability 
regime.
<P>
	It is important to note that in those 20 years the Nuclear Liability 
Act has not changed substantially. A full six years before it was 
proclaimed, the act was actually passed by Parliament in 1970. It is 
a quarter of a century old and in that time the nuclear industry has 
evolved dramatically. While there is clearly a need to increase 
liability levels in the act, this is only one of several modernizations 
that need to be made for the benefit of potential victims of a nuclear 
accident.
<P>
	In other words, the time has come for a comprehensive review of 
this act. Recent litigation that challenged the constitutionality of 
the act also highlighted the need for a comprehensive review. 
Although the Ontario Court, General Division, ruled in 1994 that 
the act is valid federal legislation, in 1996 an appeal of that 
decision was discontinued.
<P>
	We need to update and modernize the act to more fully meet our 
present domestic needs and also to reflect changes in the area of 
international nuclear liability. In addition to revising the 
compensation regime, we need to correct several technical 
problems that have been identified within the act.
<P>
	I am pleased to inform the House that such a comprehensive 
review is currently under way. A federal interdepartmental review 
committee has already developed a number of proposals to amend 
the act, and these proposals have been presented to key 
stakeholders, including operators of nuclear facilities, 
representatives of provincial ministries with responsibility for 
energy and emergency planning, and the Nuclear Insurance 
Association of Canada. Based on the feedback received during 
these preliminary discussions and on subsequent consultations, the 
review committee will recommend how to proceed.
<P>
	Hon. members should know that the stakeholders involved in 
these discussions have expressed strong support for a 
comprehensive review of the Nuclear Liability Act, one that will 
encompass all of the issues that need to be addressed. The outcome 
will be a package of amendments that will update, modernize and 
clarify the entire act.
<P>
	I want to assure the House that the improvements to the 
compensation regime as proposed in Bill C-249 are a key element 
of the review. This is the most important objective of the revision 
process. I agree with the hon. member that we need to review the 
current liability limit of $75 million. We must arrive at a liability 
level that reflects current realities. I think the limits should be 
raised, but I do not know whether that amount should be $500 
million or some other amount. We should approach the matter in a 
thoughtful way, assessing what funds might be available from 
whom, and in what form.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	The interdepartmental review committee is currently exploring 
options for securing higher levels of insurance from private 
insurers. This would increase funding for victims. The review 
committee is prepared to consider other forms of security, such as 
self-insurance, pooling arrangements and government 
compensation. If we examine all these sources, we may well come 
up with a $500 million fund. However, I am told that this is not an 
easy matter and certainly it is not clear that the private insurers can 
come up with these funds.
<P>
	Another issue we need to consider is the impact Bill C-249 will 
have on the federal government's liability under the reinsurance 
agreement that was signed with the Nuclear Insurance Association 
of Canada in 1976. Reinsurance enables insurance companies to 
undertake business that their limited capacity would not normally 
allow them to touch.
<P>
	This arrangement between the federal government and the NIAC 
provides for both additional insurance capacity and additional 
types of risk. Basically it ensures that the federal government will 
provide coverage for all the risks contemplated in the Nuclear 
Liability Act that are not covered by the operator's insurance up to 
that limit of $75 million.
<P>
	For example, some small reactors may be required by the 
Atomic Energy Control Board to carry only $500,000 in liability 
insurance. In that case, the remaining $74.5 million is guaranteed 
by the federal government through the reinsurance agreement. 
Increasing the maximum liability to $500 million would mean that 
the federal government could become liable for as much as $499.5 
million under this scenario. Any amendment to the liability limit 
clearly should be accompanied by changes to the reinsurance 
agreement.
<P>
	The interdepartmental review committee is addressing another 
issue, the limitation periods for claims arising from nuclear 
accidents. Under the current act, claims must be brought within 10 
years of the accident. However, some arguments favour extending 
the limitation period for claims related to personal injury or death.
<P>
	Other arguments favour relying more heavily on administrative 
systems, rather than the courts to deal with compensation. This 
could be achieved by amending the act to explicitly lower the 
threshold at which the Nuclear Damage Claims Commission is 
established. The result would be a more effective compensation 
scheme that minimizes hardships for victims of nuclear accidents.
<P>
	A number of other provisions of the Nuclear Liability Act need 
to be clarified or updated. For example, the definition of 
compensable nuclear damages should be reviewed. The current 
definition does not make explicit reference to environmental 
damage, preventive measures or economic losses. This is not 
consistent with evolving  international trends, nor with the growing 
public concern for the environment or with principles of fairness. 
The review will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8162"> 8162 </A></B>
<P>
address the need to revise the definition of nuclear damage to 
reflect these matters.
<P>
	As well, the rules and regulations governing the Nuclear 
Damage Claims Commission need to be elaborated. The criteria for 
the commission's membership could be broadened to permit 
people with a range of experience to participate.
<P>
	Another concern is that under the current act, the rules governing 
the commission's procedures can only be developed after the 
commission is established. It would seem to make sense to have 
this operating framework in place before an accident occurs, rather 
than after an accident when the development process may be 
rushed and may not be well thought out.
<P>
	As mentioned earlier, there are also a number of technical 
problems with the act. For example, the act lacks a preamble that 
would explain its purpose and objectives and describe a 
constitutional basis for the legislation. It has also been suggested 
that compensation amounts be included in regulations rather than 
in the act itself, since it is easier to amend regulations to take 
account of inflation or increased insurance capacity than it is to 
amend the act.
<P>
	There is also a perceived need to clarify and strengthen the 
relationship between the federal government and the Nuclear 
Insurance Association of Canada.
<P>
	In conclusion, I can offer my qualified support for Bill C-249. I 
acknowledge and agree with the objective of increasing liability 
limits under the Nuclear Liability Act. However, we need to 
establish a solid rationale for a new liability limit. As well, we need 
to identify where these funds come from and how this proposed 
change will affect the federal government's liability.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth. A senior colleague has given his place to 
him because he has to catch a plane.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in support of Bill C-249 because it 
gives me an opportunity to share with you an historic anecdote 
pertaining to Canada and Canada's role in nuclear energy that I do 
not think is very well known.
<P>
	During the second world war, Canada was very active in research 
in chemical and biological warfare weaponry at Suffield in Alberta 
near Medicine Hat. At that time the Canadians experimented with 
the dispersal of biological and chemical dust with the expectation 
that this would be the kind of weapon that would be used during the 
second world war by the Germans or possibly the Japanese. So the 
research was primarily directed at the developing countermeasures.
<P>
	However, by the end of the second world war because this 
research took place out in the prairies Canada became the number 
one nation with an expertise in the dispersal of small particulate 
matter over very large areas.
<P>
	What we are really talking about in Bill C-249, which is an act to 
amend the Nuclear Liability Act, is nuclear fallout. In the event of 
an accident occurring at a nuclear reactor there is the possibility of 
radioactive dust escaping into the atmosphere, polluting and 
irradiating large regions and causing serious consequences to the 
health of humans and animals.
<P>
	This is the same problem that existed in the late 1940s when at 
the onset of the cold war it was realized that the Soviet Union had 
developed an atomic bomb. My historic anecdote is for those of 
that generation who remember the early years of the cold war and 
the nuclear fallout scare. I think people in their fifties and sixties 
will remember that their parents were installing fallout shelters in 
their basements. They will remember that there were all kinds of 
maps and diagrams showing the effects of nuclear fallout.
<P>
	These maps and diagrams were produced mainly by the 
Americans and by the British showing the impact of a nuclear 
explosion on a city in the United States or in Europe were entirely 
the product of Canadian research in chemical and biological 
weapon dispersal.
<P>
	It is an interesting anecdote because as Canada was the second 
country in the world to develop nuclear capability, we have always 
had a responsibility to lead the world in issues pertaining to nuclear 
energy and certainly issues pertaining to nuclear safety.
<P>
	The Nuclear Liability Act addresses the possibility that a 
peacetime nuclear reactor will have a catastrophic accident and 
will pollute the atmosphere with down wind fallout in the same 
sense as a nuclear explosion. There is no doubt that in the event of 
such a catastrophe the provision for $75 million in damages is 
inadequate in every way for the kind of damage that would actually 
occur.
<P>
	Canadians studies done during the second world war and the 
immediate post-war period indicated that in the event of a nuclear 
bombing or a nuclear accident at a reactor the fallout could go 
down wind for as much as 30 miles on a widening, fan shape that 
could be a couple of miles wide at the outset to very wide at the 30 
mile limit.
<P>
	Since then as a result of the accidents that have occurred, in 
particular at Chernobyl, we have come to appreciate that when 
there is a nuclear fallout emergency, it very long term and long 
range. In fact the radioactivity from the Chernobyl accident has 
been detected all away around the world, so the fallout has come 
down.
<P>
	Therefore, it is high time, after 26 years, to upgrade Canada's 
nuclear liability legislation.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="8163"> 8163 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	Of the G-7 nations, Canada has the lowest at $75 million of 
nuclear liability in the event of an accident. In Great Britain and 
Germany the liability in the event of an accident is $550 million. In 
other countries in Europe there is an unlimited liability. In the 
United States the liability runs up to $13 billion.
<P>
	Therefore it seems clear that Canada needs at least to come up to 
the minimum level of liability as expressed by our European 
colleagues.
<P>
	It is certainly true there is a different situation occurring in 
Europe in the sense that the countries are small and there has been a 
need for international conventions in the event of an accident in 
one country that contaminates the territory of another country. 
There are conventions that provide for compensation across 
borders.
<P>
	Because of the vast spaces in Canada and the vast spaces in the 
United States, in the event of an accident of less than 1,000 kilotons 
only Canada and possibly the United States will be affected. It is 
not likely to affect other countries of the world. We do have an 
arrangement with the United States in the event of an accident in 
Canada or in the United States. Crossing the border there is a 
provision for liability payments if the lives and properties of 
citizens of our neighbouring country are affected.
<P>
	In the final analysis Bill C-249 addresses only one aspect of the 
Nuclear Liability Act. Obviously the act has to be upgraded and 
modernized in many aspects. Other colleagues have suggested 
some ways in which this can be done.
<P>
	By raising the liability threshold from $75 million to $500 
million at the very least we say to the operators of nuclear 
facilities, who in some instances are private operators, that they 
have a very high responsibility to ensure every level of safeguard is 
implemented in the operation of their nuclear establishments. This 
is the very least we can expect of both nuclear institutions that are 
privately run and those that are publicly run.
<P>
	It is with great pleasure that I support in principle and to the 
letter the intent of Bill C-249. The member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has done a great service to his country and 
to the House bringing the bill forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to address the House 
regarding Bill C-249, an act to amend the Nuclear Liability Act. 
The issues raised by the proposed legislation are important to all 
Canadians. It adds to our international standing as a responsible 
nuclear nation.
<P>
	It comes as no surprise to any of us that the bill was sponsored by 
the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. He has consistently 
shown foresight and wisdom in bringing matters of national 
concern before the House. I commend my hon. colleague for his 
commitment to his principles and to the parliamentary process.
<P>
	He and I were elected on the same day to the House. On many 
occasions we have been seatmates over the years. He has been 
consistent in his feelings and principles toward various issues that 
he has promoted.
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	As my colleagues before me have indicated, the government 
supports in principle the need to increase operator liability under 
the Nuclear Liability Act. However, we also bring to the attention 
of hon. members the need for a comprehensive review of the act to 
address a number of other concerns as well.
<P>
	I will take a few minutes to outline the rationale for the Nuclear 
Liability Act and the principles upon which it is based to 
underscore the importance of the act and the need to establish some 
broad based consensus on amendments.
<P>
	Canada is recognized as a pioneer and world leader in the 
development and use of nuclear power. I am pleased to note that we 
were among the first world nations to establish a liability regime 
geared specifically to the special circumstances of the nuclear 
energy sector. A distinct regime is needed for a number of reasons.
<P>
	As hon. members know, a strong nuclear industry brings 
tremendous economic and environmental benefits to Canada in 
spite of what we hear from the other side of the story almost 
constantly.
<P>
	If it had not been for the Candu reactors in Canada we would 
have had to purchase coal from Pennsylvania on a large scale to 
have coal burning furnaces to generate hydro electric power in 
industrialized Canada, and our environment would have suffered 
terribly as a result. The Candu reactor is one of the most clean, 
environmental sources of energy we could have. In particular 
Ontario would never have been industrialized to the extent it has if 
it had not been for the Candu reactors perfected in Canada.
<P>
	In order to encourage investment in nuclear facilities, however, 
it is necessary to limit operator liability in the unlikely event of an 
accident. Otherwise the financial risks are simply too great. This is 
as true today as it was 30 years ago when the Nuclear Liability Act 
was first presented. At the same time it is important to ensure that 
Canadians have access to compensation should they suffer injury or 
damages as a result of a nuclear accident.
<P>
	Canada's nuclear safety record is second to none in the world. 
The Atomic Energy Control Act and the Nuclear Liability Act 
provide a solid legislative framework for regulating the industry 
and have done so since day one. The former seeks to prevent and 
minimize nuclear accidents while the latter applies should an 
accident occur. However, unlikely as it may be, we must be 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8164"> 8164 </A></B>
<P>
prepared for the possibility of a serious nuclear accident that could 
result in significant third party damages.
<P>
	Candu reactors are the safest in the world because they have built 
in backup systems in the event that something goes wrong. It is 
because of the expense of building those safe reactors with those 
backup systems that they have sometimes been difficult to market 
in the world. Today countries are beginning to realize that the 
Candu reactor is not only safe but also very efficient.
<P>
	I mentioned before about the safety record in Canada being one 
of the best in the world.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	I want to make the point that AECL workers at Chalk River have 
a lower rate of cancer than the national average and across the 
country where there are no nuclear reactors or processors. It is 
because of the safety features built into the system. The employees 
are well protected. They are checked on a daily basis. If other 
industries in Canada put as much emphasis on safety factors in 
their industries as our nuclear industry has done, we would have a 
better record right across the board in industrialized Canada.
<P>
	The cobalt therapy unit for the treatment of cancer was brought 
in by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. Research and development 
produced that product. We have now sold it in dozens of countries 
all over the world.
<P>
	Radioisotopes are produced in Canadian reactors. They are used 
to sterilize medical instruments. They are used in all kinds of 
health checks, in checking patients out for various types of injuries 
and blood conditions. The result is that Canada has a very good 
nuclear health system.
<P>
	The results of the non-use of nuclear energy would have had a 
tremendous negative effect on the health of Canadians because of 
the environmental fallout of coal dust and fumes.
<P>
	Canada's involvement in the nuclear industry and in research 
and development has been for peaceful purposes. Every time 
people mention nuclear they think of war. They think of explosions 
and all kinds of other things. However, our work in the nuclear 
industry in Canada has been to produce energy to drive industry 
and promote jobs across the country. It has promoted a good 
environment and cheap energy. It has also been a tremendous asset 
to Canada's medical industry.
<P>
	It always bothers me when Chernobyl is thrown into these 
arguments. The Russian reactor is totally different from the 
Canadian reactor. The Russians built their reactors with no built-in 
systems to protect people. We did the very opposite here in Canada 
by building the Candu reactor. It is the safest reactor in the world 
and has all kinds of built-in systems to serve workers and 
Canadians at large.
<P>
	This is an industry we should positively promote. I totally agree 
with the hon. member that with this safety record we should be 
looking at greater insurance for the people in the areas of these 
developments.
