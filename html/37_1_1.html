Sunday, October 22, 2000, and writs having been issued and

to the House a letter from the administrative secretary to the

</I></B></P><P align=left> <B>The Clerk of the House:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 3, I 
invite Mr. Caccia, member for the electoral district of

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ELECTION OF SPEAKER 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left> <B>The Presiding Officer (Mr. Caccia):</B> Dear colleagues, I 
would like to begin by congratulating all of you on your success 
in last November's election.  As we know, getting used to the 
House is no easy matter, particularly if one is newly elected.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But as time goes along, the House starts to feel like home.  To 
all those in the class of 2000, I extend a hearty welcome. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having allegedly been around here for the past hundred years, a 
few observations might be in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know this is a place for debates, announcements, 
questions, petitions, a place where the public interest is 
pursued as seen from different perspectives and where we can also 
rise above partisanship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said that parliamentarians have a noble task to 
perform for they have the unique privilege of speaking for their 
electors, of engaging in the exploration of the long term and in 
anticipating the needs of generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians we have the confidence of those who elected 
us and an obligation to those who did not cast their vote for us. 
As parliamentarians we all have the special mandate to implement 
the commitments made in the election campaign by our respective 
parties.  As parliamentarians we all have an obligation to make 
this place productive, creative, relevant and meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the noble role assigned to the parliamentarian requires 
also that we treat this Chamber with care, gently and softly, 
respecting its rules and ensuring that the next generation of 
parliamentarians inherits an institution worthy of respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me note, as I did in 1997 when I had the honour to perform 
the same role, that the rules are silent on whether or not 
candidates for the position of Speaker can speak in the House 
before the vote is taken.  Obviously, such a rule would give 
interested Canadians an opportunity to hear and see the 
candidates, perhaps for the first time, as most likely would be 
the case for the 47 newly elected members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a rule, if adopted during the life of this 37th parliament, 
would become effective at the opening of the next Parliament of 
Canada.  In doing so, Canadians would finally see 
institutionalized in this event a greater degree of transparency 
and informed choice in keeping with the growing expectations the 
public has from this venerable and vibrant institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We shall now proceed with the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to the standing orders the House will now proceed to 
elect a Speaker.  The list of members who have withdrawn or are 
ineligible as candidates has been placed on each member's desk 
and is available at the table.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of members who are eligible as candidates has also been 
placed on each member's desk.  It is available at the table and 
has been placed in each polling station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the Clerk has unsealed the ballots, I will suggest a 
method of proceeding which will help to accelerate the voting 
process.

acknowledgements to the House for the great honour you have been 
pleased to confer upon  me in choosing me to be your Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those historic words, which are very historic because they 
have been used so often, I want to say how much I appreciate the 
kind support of all hon. members throughout the period from 
election day on November 27 to today. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past two months, I have had the opportunity to speak to 
a number of members by phone or in person.  It was a great 
experience to discuss the business of this House with you.  It 
was a pleasure for me to have the opportunity to speak with my 
colleagues in the House before, during and after the election. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have appreciated very much your kind words and your support 
today in the election.  I am very grateful that you have chosen 
me to be the Speaker of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to express my thanks to the electors of Kingston and 
the Islands who have on four occasions chosen me to be their 
representative in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great honour to be a member of parliament.  Those of you 
who are new in the House have now realized, I am sure, what a 
great experience it is.  I well remember my first day in the 
House in 1988 when Mr. Speaker Fraser was elected to be the 
Speaker of the House, on one ballot, frankly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realized then, sitting in my seat, that the House was complete 
because we had chosen a Speaker and we were then a House complete 
and ready to act as the House of Commons, which of course the law 
requires the House to do.  We have now done it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you for your support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to express my gratitude to the constituents of 
Kingston and the Islands for all they have done for me over the 
years I have represented them here in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many of you will discover, your constituents will be very 
kind to you.  You will have wonderful interaction with them.  You 
will get a lot of encouragement in all that you do in the House, 
of course assuming it is reasonable.  You will also enjoy 
interaction on a regular basis by phone and by correspondence. In 
particular, I hope new members will find the experience rich and 
rewarding.  I certainly have in my 12 years and I continue to 
find it so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pass on my gratitude to my family, who have 
worked for me in election campaigns in Kingston for the last 12 
years.  A number of them are here today. 
Perhaps you would permit me to indicate those who are here.  My 
mother, Peg Milliken, is sitting in the gallery.  With her are my 
sister Amanda and her husband Marc; my brother Bill and his wife 
Pat; my sister Catherine and her son Ben McIlquham; and my dad, 
John Milliken.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I want to say one other important thing. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker cannot do his job unless he has the ongoing support 
of the honourable members, not just some of them but all members 
of the House.  I am well aware that, from time to time, the 
Speaker will make a decision that will not be totally acceptable 
to one group or another in the House.  That is the nature of the 
House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the most part, even if the decision is one that some hon. 
members do not like on a particular day, I hope that you will 
continue to support the Speaker, because without your active 
support and co-operation it would be impossible for any Speaker 
to do his or her job in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to having a wonderful experience working with you 
in trying to make the House as great an institution as I believe 
the House of Commons is and always can be.  We will work together 
to make this 37th parliament a great parliament.  I look forward 
to the opportunity of working with each one of you to make that 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for all of us a great occasion on which to congratulate 
you.   You have had a lot of experience and have served the House 
of Commons for a long time.  I am told that when you were at the 
advanced age of eight you said that you wanted to be the Speaker 
of the House of Commons.  You have been a very persistent person 
and I congratulate you for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we will all be well served.  You have devoted many years 
to learning the rules and the friendships you have with everybody 
will help you.  You will be a very distinguished Speaker. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so, I wish you the best of luck.  I am sure that all members 
are pleased to have made a choice this afternoon.  We know we 
will be well served indeed with you in the Chair in years to 
come. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this occasion to congratulate everybody who offered to 
serve as Speaker. They are all very good people and they would 
have served us very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as we know, in an 
election only one can finish at the top and it is your fate 
today.  We know that the others would have been very good and we 
have to be grateful to them.  They all came to our caucus 
yesterday and made very good presentations.  It was a delight to 
listen to their views.  I was thinking about the difficulty that 
many of us would have today in the election, but now we have to 
turn the page. 
I want to thank them all for offering their services.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the House of Commons and democracy are all about. 
We put ideas forward, we do not always get our way, but we know 
that if we act in good faith and our ideas make sense, they will 
eventually be incorporated in House of Commons procedures and be 
part of the lives of all members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer you, Mr. Speaker of the House of Commons, my expressions 
of respect and my wishes for success. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, allow me to congratulate you first.  I am told you 
are thoughtful and studious, a man with a passion for the rules 
and procedures of parliament.  That is interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rest assured that the official opposition will support you, not 
necessarily in examining all the rules and procedures, but 
certainly in maintaining decorum and respect in this House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to note today, as you were dragged most 
unwillingly to the chair, how it was reflecting a centuries old 
reality that at many times it was a high risk position.  In fact, 
one could literally risk one's head depending on the decisions 
that were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, by a happy coincidence, you are comforted by the presence 
of Speakers from across the country who are in the galleries and 
whom I am sure you will be introducing.  I have met with each one 
of them and I can assure you that their hearts and heads appear 
to be in the right place.  I think that will also be your future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister indicated, the interesting work that took 
place in the caucuses was, I believe, somewhat historic. If you 
reflect back, as I am sure you could, it was Louis-Joseph 
Papineau who was elected as Speaker of the Assembly of Lower 
Canada in 1827.  When he presented himself for the formal 
ratification to the governor, the governor actually refused his 
ratification thinking that he would send him back to the assembly 
and the members would then show deference to the governor and 
change their view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it was a serious moment in history because the members 
said no. They said that it was up to the members to decide these 
things. Almost a year went by in which the activities of the 
assembly did not take place.  It was only then that the governor 
said yes, and that the vote and the will of the members took 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members, after the demonstration we have seen 
today of working together and voting freely, to show a similar 
resolve in some of the parliamentary obstacles that still lie 
ahead of us and to work together for the good of all Canadians on 
whose behalf we were sent here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations to you, Mr. Speaker.

<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would first like to offer my congratulations to you.  I know you 
have long dreamt of this.  It proves that tenacity has its 
rewards.  We will take note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like as well to congratulate those who put their name 
forward for this position today.  I think it is one of the 
important jobs of the House, permitting debate even when we do 
not share—especially when we do not share—the same ideas. 
As the English say: “To agree on how to disagree”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that you will direct our proceedings with an eye 
on both sides of the House.  I am announcing my intention to ask 
the National Film Board to begin preparations now for the sequel 
to <I>The Custodian of the Hill</I>.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too would 
like to congratulate you on your election as Speaker for this 
House, which will really be beginning tomorrow. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my party, I want to extend our hearty 
congratulations and express a vote of thanks to all members who 
put themselves forward in order to serve all members of the House 
in the role of Speaker.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure to congratulate the Speaker elected. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When parliament implemented the recommendation of the McGrath 
committee to establish the election of the Speaker by secret 
ballot, it was an important step forward.  It was an important 
symbol in establishing the non-partisan nature of the Speaker. 
It was also intended to be a step in the direction of important 
parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, all members share with you an interest in and 
responsibility for moving forward with other parliamentary 
reforms.  Providing the necessary leadership in this regard 
should not be your responsibility alone, but I do hope and 
genuinely believe that you will show such leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have been a serious student of parliamentary procedure.  In 
your role as Deputy Speaker you have always presided over this 
Chamber fairly, firmly, and with a twinkle in your eye.  I think 
that is important.  Unfortunately we are not quite as able to see 
the twinkle in the Speaker's eye today from this vantage point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to being very serious about the importance of the 
role and its non-partisan nature, the Speaker elected today 
genuinely loves this parliament, loves the role that has been 
bestowed upon him, and will discharge his obligations with a real 
sense of joy and fun that will benefit all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to just say one word to the Speaker's family members who 
are here.  Many think that graduating from Queen's University is 
the highest honour a family member could achieve.  In addition to 
having honoured your family by graduating from Queen's 
University, and having been four times elected to represent the 
people of Kingston and the Islands, you have today enjoyed the 
ultimate confidence of your peers in being elected to serve us, 
and thereby serve the people of Canada, in the role of Speaker of 
the 37th parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleagues I want to wish you bonne chance, 
félicitations et bonne santé.  Let the work begin. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary-Centre, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I 
extend my congratulations to you.  There is nothing 
extraordinary about the member for Kingston and the Islands 
playing such an important role in the life of parliament, nor is 
it the first time such a thing has happened.  Sir John A. 
Macdonald, as well as Flora MacDonald, have represented this 
riding.  It is a riding that has a strong tradition of service 
to the country and, today, you are part of that tradition. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also congratulate the other candidates who put their names 
forward.  I encouraged the members of my caucus not to put their 
names forward for this, and you are just fortunate, Mr. Speaker, 
that the hon. member for Saint John followed my advice on this 
occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, we all recognize your long interest in this institution. 
As the Prime Minister said, you were a student of this 
institution before you were a member here.  You understand the 
reason there is a parliament.  You understand the 
responsibilities of this institution.  You understand the 
importance of treating each member here as an individual with 
equal rights and equal responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as your constituents will be holding you to account for that 
view as we go forward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also all know that we are meeting at a time and electing a 
Speaker at a time when there is a declining respect for 
parliament and the profession of politics as a whole.  It is a 
responsibility upon all of us in the next four years to ensure 
that we change that pattern and re-establish a respect for this 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has to do with more than just comportment on the floor of 
the House.  It has to do with more than what might be called 
respect.  It also has to do with ensuring that this place becomes 
a House that has the power to determine the destiny of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons was established to have members of 
parliament with power, to have influence over affairs and a 
parliament with power to control the spending of government.  We 
are all equal here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great difference between a government and a 
parliament.  In a government there is a primus inter pares.  The 
Prime Minister is a leader among others but not here.  In the 
House of Commons we are all equal as members of parliament.  With 
the greatest of respect to you, we expect to be treated that way 
in the days to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons itself will consider changes in the rules 
and the regulations that need to be introduced.  We are counting 
upon you to ensure that the rules now in place are interpreted in 
a sense of fairness and equality and make the House earn the 
respect of the people of the country.  We all want to serve our 
country.  We know you do too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We congratulate you on your election today.  On behalf of my 
party we look forward to working very constructively with you in 
the interests of parliament and of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank all hon. members for their very kind 
comments. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my maiden speech, I forgot to thank all the other candidates 
from both sides of the House.  It was a pleasure to work 
with them during the election period. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that I think all of us enjoyed very cordial and 
pleasant relations during the campaign, if we can call it such, 
and particularly at the all candidates meetings yesterday and 
this morning when we made our presentations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all of them for being so graceful and pleasant 
colleagues in the election.
