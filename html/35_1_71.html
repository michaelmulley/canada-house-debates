Speaker, for the past several years the Solicitor General of 
Canada has recognized May 25 as Missing Children's Day in 
Canada.
<P>
	There were approximately 56,000 children reported missing 
in Canada last year. While most of these children returned home 
safely within 48 hours, many did not.
<P>
	The Missing Children's Society of Canada is a registered 
non-profit organization whose purpose is to search for runaway 
and abducted children.
<P>
	Working on the front lines in the search of missing children, 
May 25 truly has a special significance for the Missing 
Children's Society of Canada. It is a day of renewed hope, a day 
to remember. It also presents the greatest opportunity to provide 
awareness of this issue to Canadians in an effort to prevent 
another child from going missing.
<P>
	From Halifax to Victoria, mayors of Canadian cities are 
proclaiming the week as Missing Children's Week in their cities. 
I invite all members to join with me on behalf of the Missing 
Children's Society of Canada and the Reform Party of Canada to

encountered by VIA Rail in attempting to make it a real 
business.
<P>
	The recent revelation of VIA employees being paid for 28 
days when only 12 days have been worked is one stark example 
of the baggage that train line carries. Other examples are the 
inability of VIA to question bills submitted, non-negotiation of 
track rates and schedules dictated by freight trains.

introducing new legislation intended to protect our straddling 
fish stocks. However, on the very same day that the minister 
introduced the new legislation there were seven Cuban fishing 
vessels fishing within the 200-mile limit.
<P>
	As a result of the recent awarding of the fishery observer 
contract to Biorex, there were seven observers on site of which 
only three were experienced in monitoring this type of vessel. 
The other four observers did not have the experience to obtain 
the data DFO requires to effectively monitor their activities.
<P>
	While I commend the minister for the new legislation, I have 
to wonder how the minister can justify announcing the 
legislation when the awarding of the observer contract by his 
own department has taken away the only effective, trained and

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. In a speech 
yesterday to the Canadian American Business Council in 
Washington, the Minister of International Trade condemned the 
attitude of the United States with regard to a number of trade 
disputes with Canada, particularly disputes over softwood 
lumber, wheat, steel and pork. He even hinted at a possible 
cooling off of trade relations between the United States and 
Canada.
<P>
	In light of the warning issued by his minister in Washington, 
can the Prime Minister tell us what concrete action Canada plans 
to take to get the Americans to stop implementing measures that 
are incompatible with GATT and NAFTA rules and that have a 
considerable impact on several sectors of the Canadian and 
Quebec economies?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
fully support the action taken by the minister in question. It was 
important to get across to the Americans that we were not at all 
pleased with what was happening in certain areas. With respect 
to softwood lumber, the dispute settlement panels have ruled 
three times in our favour. Yet the Americans have always 
appealed, which is not a good thing. The same thing has 
occurred in the case of wheat. We are respecting the rules of the 
game and we want the Americans to do likewise.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	The minister, who I am confident has the support of all 
members of this House, wanted to make it clear to the 
Americans that we are prepared to play by the rules and that we 
hope the US will do likewise.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I also take note that the Prime Minister supports the 
position adopted by his minister yesterday.
<P>
	Does he agree with and does he subscribe to the harsh 
judgment of the Minister for International Trade to the effect 
that the fundamental problems on delaying the trade dispute 
between Canada and the States ``is that the administration of 
President Bill Clinton has an unclear commitment to free 
trade''?
<P>
	It is a strange position for a Liberal minister supposedly 
against free trade and now complaining about lack of 
enthusiasm from the American president.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
trade between Canada and the United States is huge. More than 
75 per cent of our trade is with it. It is normal that we have some 
difficulties from time to time.
<P>
	We have some cases at this time in which we are not happy 
with the slow movement of the Americans. We are respecting 
the rules and we expect them to respect the rules.
<P>
	In the softwood lumber it has been established clearly that we 
are following the rules. We are completely competitive. We are 
not doing anything against either the GATT or the NAFTA. Not 
only that, the tribunal ruled three times in our favour on it.
<P>
	On the question of wheat it is the same. We are selling wheat 
to them, for example durum wheat, for one reason: our wheat is 
better than theirs and American consumers know it. Seventeen 
senators in Congress said that they should not impose tariffs on 
Canadian wheat, but in the American system they are not as 
decisive as we can be in Canada. We have to put pressure there. 
That is exactly what the minister did yesterday in Washington 
and I am happy to see that he has the backing of the House.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, quite aside from his minister's bravado and his own 
lofty statements in this House, does the Prime Minister plan to 
speak directly to President Clinton in an effort to genuinely 
protect those sectors of the economy affected by the actions of 
the United States?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have discussed issues such as softwood lumber, the West Coast 
fishery and wheat on several occasions in the course of 
telephone conversations with the US President.
<P>
	Yesterday, the minister addressed an important gathering in 
Washington and delivered the Canadian government's message, 
namely that we want free trade with the US to continue and to 
this end, we will play by the rules, providing the Americans do 
so as well.

sharing problem in Canada and that the political structure is no 
longer adequate as it leads to costly and inefficient overlap and 
duplication?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Supreme Court ruled that telecommunications was an area of 
federal jurisdiction. So the government is only abiding by the 
Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	Will it be possible to make administrative arrangements to 
satisfy certain provinces which control some elements of the 
telephone service? I hope we will be able to do so but there is 
certainly no duplication in this area because the Supreme Court 
has recognized very clearly that telecommunications come 
under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	With respect to manpower, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is still discussing with the provincial governments 
at this time. We hope we will be able to make arrangements if 
necessary and I am glad to see that not only Quebec but also 
other provinces want better arrangements, and we hope to work 
out some kind of accommodation. Of course, what will be good 
for western Canada will also be good for Quebec and vice versa, 
and I hope that if everyone simply looks at the problem 
rationally instead of using it for political confrontation, we will 
be able to find a reasonable solution.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, can the 
Prime Minister explain in a satisfactory manner why his 
government and himself, who yesterday boasted of his 
determination to solve the unemployment problem, are still, 
after several months of negotiations, totally unable to sign with 
Quebec an agreement that would save $250 million a year in 
waste and better serve the jobless?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that the hon. 
member check his facts. We have done an analysis. The numbers 
he used are not correct. They were based upon an OECD study 
which had nothing to do with Canada itself. It was simply an 
averaging of all countries in the OECD regime that did not 
explicitly look at the facts as they relate to Canada.
<P>
	Therefore the facts presented are not exact. We have already 
communicated that to other governments and they understand 
the figures on duplication. At this very moment we are 
negotiating with the provinces a series of agreements to have 
single witness deliveries, to share locations, and to provide for 
joint sponsorship of programs.

federalism and the future of federalism in Canada is not solely a 
federal responsibility. The provinces have an integral role to 
play in the operation and preservation of the federal system, but 
last week a number of the western premiers expressed several 
concerns about how the national unity issue was being handled 
or not handled.
<P>
	Does the federal government intend to actively consult the 
provinces and involve them in a joint effort to strengthen and 
promote national unity over the next few months?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have no doubt that all premiers of Canada, including the premier 
of Quebec, want the country to remain together. I know when I 
met with them in December that we discussed that. They want to 
do what is needed to do that. Everybody agreed at that time that 
the best way was to provide good government and to look at the 
duplication that exists between levels of governments. Some 
western Canadian premiers made representation last week in 
different fields and we are looking into that.
<P>
	When there are two or three levels of government in a country 
there is always a conflict of jurisdiction. It is inevitable but it is 
a system that works very well for Canada.
<P>
	In countries like Great Britain and France in which there is 
only one level of government people want to have two or three 
levels to bring the government closer to the people. Everybody 
in Canada will recognize that with our federalism of today we 
have one of the most decentralized federation in the world, aside 
from perhaps Switzerland.
<P>
	There is always a constant battle for adjustment. It is the 
dynamism of our federalism. We can adapt because there is a lot 
of flexibility in our Constitution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question.
<P>
	Some of the premiers and many other Canadians want to be 
assured that the federal government is preparing a principal 
federalist response to the various problems and issues that 
Quebec's separation could create for Canada and the other 
provinces. These are problems and issues which the Prime 
Minister considers hypothetical and which he said yesterday the 
federal government does not want to think about for fear of 
being accused of accepting the inevitability of separatism.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4389"> 4389 </A></B>
<P>
	Who should be preparing the federalist response to these 
problems and issues if the federal government is not prepared 
to accept the responsibility?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
accept the responsibility. I said to everybody that talking 
Canada down like the hon. member is doing all the time by 
saying that nothing works in Canada is conducive to that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> In spite of the difficulties I 
always said that Canada is the best country. I am not down on 
Canada. It is the best way to convince everybody that Canada is 
still the best country in the world in which to live.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
each non-response from the government to this question just 
creates more uncertainty about the leadership for the 
advancement and promotion of federalism and where it is going 
to come from. Each non-response causes the national unity 
vacuum to grow.
<P>
	Does the government intend to provide the House with an 
opportunity to freely debate the federal response to Quebec's 
separatism before we recess for the summer?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member said he will table a paper very soon. However, 
if the intention of the leader of the Reform Party is to reopen the 
constitutional debate, my answer to that is no.
<P>
	Yesterday that was more or less the approach you took and on 
the second question you backed down. We will wait for your 
paper to see where you are.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I know that the right hon. Prime 
Minister will want to include me.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister continually blames the opposition and 
sovereigntists for all economic woes, for the poor labour market 
and the sorry state of the nation's finances. The finance 
minister's irresponsible statements, erroneous forecasts 
concerning the 1993-94 deficit and anemic budget have had a 
major, very negative, costly impact on the economy and on 
financing Canada's public debt.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not agree that the irresponsible 
statements of his Minister of Finance and his budget's lack of 
credibility are the real reasons that Canadian interest rates are 
higher than American rates and that since his budget was tabled, 
this differential has cost Quebecers and Canadians thousands of 
jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not agree that the Minister of Finance is  irresponsible. No 
minister takes his work more seriously than the Minister of 
Finance. No minister is more respected by the business 
community than the Minister of Finance. He has my full 
confidence.
<P>
	The hon. member knows very well that something within our 
control which can be done on financial markets now is to make 
our country politically stable, which would do a lot for its 
economic stability. We are not the ones creating political chaos 
in the land.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
does the Prime Minister not agree that instead of looking for 
scapegoats everywhere, he should look at his finance minister 
who, because of his weakness and lack of political courage, 
refuses to make real decisions to restore the nation's finances, 
create employment and give people confidence in the Canadian 
economy again?
<P>
	He is the real culprit, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
all indicators clearly show that the Canadian economy is now 
headed in the right direction.
<P>
	Since this government took office, consumer confidence has 
increased considerably. The number of unemployed people in 
Canada has gone down. I think that the budget presented in 
February was very, very well received by the financial 
community because they know that this Minister of Finance and 
this government have a very specific plan. We want to create 
jobs, that is our priority. To do so, we must reduce the deficit to 3 
per cent of gross national revenue within three years.
<P>
	We will keep this promise as we have kept other promises, and 
the financial community will indeed have confidence in Canada 
when we clearly establish this country's political stability.

the substantive action that he plans to take to ensure strict 
compliance with the international embargo on the part of the 
Dominican Republic?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America

Canada is doing everything it can to make sure sanctions stick.
<P>
	We were part of a UN mission that explored the Dominican 
Republic border in the last few days. We will be making a

everything it can to stop up the gaps in the sanctions net that 
exist at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, we recognize the 
great job that our peacekeepers and foreign missions are doing. 
However Canadians need some criteria to go on before we get 
involved in further actions on an ad hoc basis.

not preclude a discussion about how our peacekeeping efforts

<P>
	One of the warnings given to the minister in a confidential 
draft on the communications strategy regarding the social

<P>
	``UI cuts seen by the population as evidence that government 
wants to fight the deficit on the backs of the poor''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Under the circumstances, will the minister tell us if the delay 
in tabling his action plan is the result of a split among cabinet 
ministers regarding what is at stake, as suggested in a 
recommendation from the same report which proposes this 
strategy: ``-demonstrate Cabinet solidarity on socio-economic 
agenda''?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows over 
80 per cent of Canadians are very anxious to see major 
initiatives taken to reform and improve our social programs. 
That very strong support is also reflected in the cabinet and 
caucus on this side of the House.
<P>
	The only place where there are divisions, the only place where 
there is any opposition is in the source and background of the 
Bloc Quebecois. It is the only group in the country that does not 
want to see reform go ahead and we know why.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
does not have to listen to the advice of his civil servants. 
However, he must tell us if, and how, he can justify, given the 
current situation with respect to public finances, the wasting of 
more than one million dollars on a communications strategy 
designed to explain to the poorest how they will have to put up 
with cuts totalling billions of dollars.

reflect cabinet policies. I did see the document; it is a list of 
ideas for a presentation.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4391"> 4391 </A></B>
<P>
	Yesterday the minister admitted that the principle of 
accessibility in the Canada Health Act must recognize the 
importance of timeliness as well as affordability. She then 
suggested it was not her wish to cut health care payments to 
British Columbia but was forced to under the Canada Health 
Act.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Health explain why enforcement of 
unworkable sections of the Canada Health Act should take 
priority over the right of Canadians to accessible, timely health 
care?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
enforcement of the Canada Health Act is certainly very 
workable and it is done very quietly, very methodically, 
systematically and pragmatically.
<P>
	In this case we are guaranteeing that all Canadians, especially 
all residents of British Columbia, have access to a doctor 
regardless of whether they have money or not.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, two major 
problems confront Canadian health care today: affordability for 
the provinces and accessibility for individuals.
<P>
	By reducing payments to B.C. and threatening Alberta and 
other other provinces with similar penalties, the minister is 
making both these problems worse.
<P>
	When will the minister recognize that her enforcement of the 
Canada Health Act is actually making health care less accessible 
for Canadians? When will the minister admit the need for 
reforming totally the Canada Health Act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am quite happy to hear where the Reform Party really stands on a 
national health care system. It obviously is in favour of user 
fees. It obviously is, in this case, in favour of a two tier system, 
one for the rich and one for the poor.
<P>
	On this side of the House we believe in a national health care 
system where your needs are met, not your wants and not based 
on the size of your pocketbook.
<P>
	It is very important that all Canadians be reassured that in this 
time of very tight money, we are able to give predictability and 
stability to transfer payments in health and tell Canadians that 
we are here to guarantee they will be treated based on their 
needs.

Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. According to a study carried out for 
the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, unemployment 
cost the Canadian economy more than $109 billion in 1993 and 
governments alone absorbed $47 billion of the cost of 
unemployment. The  authors of the study are asking the 
government to put in place a pro-active employment policy.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that the timid employment recovery 
measures proposed by the government are not enough just to put 
1.5 million unemployed people back to work and reduce the 
intolerable cost of unemployment which is now $109 billion?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have that 
question from the hon. member because it points out, if nothing 
else does, how important it is that we undertake major reform 
initiatives to change many of our programs, the whole purpose 
of which is getting people back to work.
<P>
	I met with the director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives 
last week. We had a very good discussion about how we could 
help many of those who are presently using benefits to go back 
to work, to develop a system where we could give incentives for 
them to participate in the wide variety of activities in the private 
sector, the volunteer sector and the third sector.
<P>
	I agree totally with the hon. member that the number one 
purpose and objective of this House is to get people back to

colleagues and get them to back the kind of social reform we 
want to bring in.

among economic partners is essential to ensure employment 
recovery, does the minister not realize that his proposal for the 
reform of social programs is not on the right track, since it has 
not been able to generate such a consensus among economic 
partners and more specifically with the provinces?

that mandate from Canadians and we take that mandate very 
seriously.
<P>
	In all sincerity to the hon. member, he cannot complain about 
no consensus because we have not tabled a report yet. It is 
unfortunate that some of his colleagues in his own party are

<P>

Citizenship and Immigration, one of the first things I asked 
NGO representatives to do on a non-remunerative basis, on a 
very quick basis, was try to put together a report of 
recommendations on how we can better deal with the automatic 
review and the humanitarian and compassionate review under 
the immigration refugee board. There was concern because it 
lacked clarification and it lacked definition. I have accepted the 
premise of the report.
<P>
	Upon accepting the premise of the report I believe it is logical 
in the interim to allow those individuals since 1993 when the 
automatic review started to have a review of their cases to 
ensure that through that lack of clarity those individuals did 
receive a fair determination.
<P>
	That has absolutely nothing to do with those cases of 
criminality that do not deserve the compassion or the tolerance 
of our system.

<P>
	Will this minister admit that under his supervision the inland 
acceptance rate has shot up 12 per cent and that inland asylum 
seekers are jumping the queue and straining our ability to accept 
desperately needy refugees from abroad?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, this government's red book was 
very clear. It places a great deal of evidence on overseas 
selection. As the hon. member alludes to, it is cost efficient but 
more important goes precisely to the matter of those who are in 
the refugee camps who are true refugees.
<P>
	The reality of the 1980s and 1990s is that all over the world, 
not only Canada, these migrants are on the move. Refugees are 
no longer waiting in the camps for our visa officers and so they 
are coming to our country. That has necessitated the 
international community and all its member states to try and 
have an inland determination system. You cannot move the 
clock back and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4394"> 4394 </A></B>
<P>
pretend that in this day and age of technology and transportation 
people will not move.
<P>
	We are trying to make that system the best we can so that we 
can give sanctuary to the true refugee, and the false has no 
business applying as a refugee.

	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	On May 12 amendments to the Coastal Fisheries Protection 
Act received royal assent. This legislation will allow Canada to 
take action against foreign fishing vessels fishing contrary to 
conservation measures on the Grand Banks outside Canada's 
200-mile limit.
<P>
	Can the minister advise this House when and how we can 
expect to see this measure enforced?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the regulations to bring the new act into force were 
approved by cabinet this week and will come into effect the 
week of May 30.
<P>
	All stateless and all flag of convenience vessels are being 
notified of the new legislation. We are already receiving 
indications as a result of boardings that have taken place over 
the last few days that many of these vessels will leave 
voluntarily. We hope that all vessels will leave voluntarily 
because those that do not will be seized and charged under a new 
Canadian law.

	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
learned from a press release issued by the Public Service 
Alliance of Canada that the federal government has 
considerably increased its spending in several departments by 
using the services of outside contractors. Between 1984 and 
1992, contracting out increased by 207 per cent for National 
Health, 247 per cent for Supply and Services and a full 628 per 
cent for Customs and Excise Canada.
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	My question is for the President of the Treasury Board. How 
can the minister justify freezes and cuts in the public service, 
when contracting out has increased so phenomenally in recent 
years?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, of 
course those are actions which were taken by the past 
government. This government is reviewing the contracting 
procedures.
<P>
	Not all of the contracting out is for work that could be done by 
the public service. Where it could be done by the public service, 
we would want to examine that. We want to make sure the 
taxpayers' dollars are spent in the most efficient and effective 
way. If it can be done better in  house, fine. In some cases 
however, it would be justified to contract out.
<P>
	We are reviewing that matter. We will also ask the 
government operations committee to review that matter 
together with the Treasury Board.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	About three weeks ago a joint agriculture and transportation 
subcommittee met to deal with the issue of grain movement 
problems in Canada. The result of these meetings was a letter of 
recommendation presented to the ministers of transportation 
and agriculture.
<P>
	Why has there been no government action resulting from 
these recommendations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Transport and I have 
received the letter from the subcommittee on agriculture and 
transport.
<P>
	In addition to considering that letter ourselves at a 
departmental level, we referred the contents of that letter to a 
group of grains industry senior representatives at a meeting 
which I called in Winnipeg on May 16. All of the subject matter 
contained in the letter is now the subject of a variety of working 
groups being undertaken by the grains industry representatives 
together with government.
<P>
	I have asked those representatives to have a report to me no 
later than next Monday in terms of the type of actions which can 
be implemented quickly in this crop year. This is to make sure 
that our grain transportation difficulties are resolved as much as 
that is humanly possible and further to make sure that this 
country does not get into that kind of problem again in a future 
crop year.

<P>

<B><A NAME="4395"> 4395 </A></B>
<P>
	Today a report was released that indicated young families in 
this country are living in conditions of poverty not seen since 
the Depression.
<P>
	According to a departmental document leaked yesterday, the 
government is prepared to spend over $1 million on what can 
only be called self-promotion of the social policy review-not 
doing it, but promotion of the social policy review.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister if he would take those funds, 
over $1 million, and put them into job creation for these young 
families that are quickly sinking into poverty.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
question.
<P>
	There have been no million dollars assigned. That was partly a 
figment of imagination put forward by one of her colleagues. We 
have not made any decisions about any communications 
strategy or what it would cost.
<P>
	I think the hon. member would be the first one to acknowledge 
that in putting forward a number of proposals for reform of 
social programs we have to make every effort possible to have a 
wide range of Canadians involved. This includes young families 
who are very much affected by the economic conditions of 
today. That means we have to find ways of reaching out to them.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that one of our primary 
objectives and concerns is how we can improve the position of 
young families, especially the children of young families, which 
must be the concern of every Canadian. To do that we will reach 
out on a very broad based consultation using the committee of 
this Parliament to do that. We will provide the most resources 
possible to meet that very problem which was highlighted in the 
report.

	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America

today on the subject of Rwanda.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The massacres that have engulfed Rwanda since April 6 have 
already cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of children, 
women and men, while millions of others are streaming out of 
the area or country in terror.
<P>
	The needs of displaced families and those stranded in their 
urban homes are increasing as time goes on. Fresh food is not 
readily available. Stocks of medical supplies are rapidly being 
depleted. And the lack of clean water is complicating an already 
explosive situation.
<P>
	Sanitation and lack of access to clean water have been the 
most serious problems facing displaced people in urban areas in 
Rwanda and has also been a threat to the refugees in camps in 
Burundi and Tanzania.
<P>
	Health problems are also escalating, mainly respiratory 
infections, diarrhea and malaria, which have been traditional 
ailments in refugee camps.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Shortly after the Rwandan conflict broke out Canada assumed 
a leadership role. First of all, Canada's Department of National 
Defence operates the only relief flights going into Kigali. 
Second, CIDA has promptly responded to appeals by the Red 
Cross and international non-government organizations for 
emergency aid to assist those in desperate need.
<P>
	Canadian aid amounting to $4 million has already flowed into 
Rwanda through emergency organizations such as the 
International Committee of the Red Cross and Doctors Without 
Borders.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4396"> 4396 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition to this the UN peacekeeping forces in Rwanda 
are currently under the direction of a Canadian, Major-General 
Romeo Dallaire, who has requested and obtained an increase 
in UN troops and an enlarged mandate in order to protect 
humanitarian operations.
<P>
	Canada pressed the Security Council of the United Nations in 
order to have the UN more actively engaged in a search for a 
resolution of this disastrous conflict.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs has taken the initiative of 
asking for a special session of the UN Human Rights 
Commission. At this very moment this special session is 
addressing the situation in Rwanda on an urgent basis.
<P>
	After consultation with Canadian NGOs last week I am 
pleased to announce today on behalf of the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs that Canada will contribute $7.606 million in 
supplementary humanitarian assistance to the victims of this 
terrible conflict in Rwanda. This new contribution will be 
allocated as follows: $4.856 million, representing 64 per cent of 
the envelope, will go to nine Canadian non-governmental 
organizations operating in Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda and 
Zaire; the International Federation of Red Cross and Red 
Crescent Societies will receive $750,000 in Uganda and 
Tanzania; and the United Nations High Commission for 
Refugees will receive $2 million for its activities in Tanzania.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These CIDA funds will help fulfill basic needs like drinking 
water, sanitation, shelter and health care. Our aid workers and 
military personnel are doing their very best to maintain a lifeline 
to the victims of this tragedy. Canada is determined to continue 
to support their efforts through the UN system, the Red Cross 
movement and Canadian non governmental organizations 
operating in the region.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to those 
many Canadians who are part of the aid agencies, 
non-governmental organizations and peacekeeping forces in 
this region of Africa. Let us not forget that these women and men 
risk their lives every day in order to relieve the suffering of a 
truly tortured people.
<P>
	I would also like to give recognition on behalf of the 
Government of Canada to those countries that have most 
generously welcomed the growing numbers of refugees that 
stream across their borders every day.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to join all Canadians in praying that the 
many efforts currently undertaken by the international 
community will lead to resolution of the conflict in Rwanda and 
that a peaceful dialogue will assume its place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois welcomed the news today that the Canadian 
government has decided to provide additional  humanitarian aid 
for the victims of the conflict that is now raging in Rwanda.
<P>
	Only yesterday we urged the federal government to act as 
soon as possible on the resolution by the Security Council to 
reinforce the UN mission in Rwanda, and we welcome the 
additional contribution from CIDA announced this afternoon by 
the Secretary of State.
<P>
	The additional emergency aid comes at the right time. We are 
confident that the amounts committed by Canada will help 
Canadian non-governmental organizations in Tanzania, 
Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire, as well as the International 
Federation of Red Cross Societies and the Office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees, which are also active in Tanzania 
and Uganda.
<P>
	There is an escalating need for so many things. There is a 
shortage of food, drinking water and medical equipment. Public 
hygiene is a problem, as is the disease spreading through the 
refugee camps.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois wishes to take this opportunity to 
commend the courage and invaluable contribution of civilians 
and military personnel from Canada and Quebec who are 
working over there with relief organizations to alleviate the 
suffering and help meet these needs.
<P>
	Uganda has also requested the help of the international 
community to remove the thousands of corpses of Rwandans 
civilians which are rotting in Lake Victoria. A member of the 
government put it in the following terms, and I quote: ``The 
situation is horrible. Thousands of bodies are caught in the 
marshes surrounding the many islands in the lake, and we do not 
have the equipment to remove them''.
<P>
	Meanwhile, mortar attacks prevent relief organizations from 
getting food from the warehouses to feed the thousands of 
civilians living under UN protection.
<P>
	Today, according to a news release, two scheduled 
humanitarian flights were cancelled because a Canadian C-130 
was hit by a bullet. According to the same news release, 
UNICEF expects malnutrition to become a problem within the 
next two weeks.
<P>
	That is why last week, the UN Security Council authorized the 
deployment of an additional 5,500 peacekeepers. The UN 
mission in Rwanda will also be responsible for the safety and 
protection of displaced persons, refugees and civilians who are 
at risk, which will include the creation and maintenance, where 
possible, of secure humanitarian zones.
<P>
	Ghana, Ethiopia and Senegal have each committed 800 
soldiers. It is reported that they may not have the necessary 
equipment, including armoured vehicles, take their position 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4397"> 4397 </A></B>
<P>
between the opposing Rwandan forces which have been fighting 
since early April.
<P>
	As yet, there has been no response from the international 
community, so that the actual deployment of the peacekeepers 
may well take several weeks.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the killing continues, and according to the latest 
UN estimates, more than 500,000 people have died and 
hundreds of thousands are refugees.
<P>
	Will the Department of Foreign Affairs take part in 
reinforcing the UN mission in Rwanda? The Secretary of State 
did not answer that question today.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Canada has a very important role to play in Rwanda. CIDA's 
response to requests for emergency assistance by the UN and 
non-governmental organizations is part of that role, and we 
welcome that decision.
<P>
	Today, at an emergency meeting of the UN Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva, several countries are calling for 
punitive action against the perpetrators of the slaughter in 
Rwanda and for international action to put an end to the killing. 
We can only hope that peace will be restored as soon as possible 
in that country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Rwanda 
situation has opened the eyes of many across the world to the 
incredible obstacles that the international community must face 
in the days to come.
<P>
	The civil war in Rwanda is certainly of incredible concern to 
Canada. Our leadership role in international relief demonstrates 
our deep concern for the peoples of the world.
<P>
	Unfortunately we have witnessed the civil war become ten 
times worse in only the last few weeks. The estimated casualties 
have ranged from 500,000 dead, 500,000 wounded and two 
million refugees. The largest refugee camp in the world now 
exists in Tanzania where over 300,000 refugees are taking 
shelter from the massacres in Rwanda.
<P>
	The inability of the factions in Rwandan society to settle their 
differences and establish effective government is no longer an 
issue facing Rwanda alone, nor is it an issue solely for Africa. 
Rather, it is an issue for the international community and we 
must step up and face it.
<P>
	To some degree we have done this. Nearly every major world 
relief organization is operating either in Rwanda or in the 
neighbouring countries in order to assist the hundreds of 
thousands of refugees fleeing from this area.
<P>
	We have great respect for the individuals from all over the 
world who are there doing what they can to make a difference in 
this war torn place.
<P>
	We also hold in high esteem Canadians who operate the only 
flights going into Kigali. I can accurately say that we are all 
proud of the role Canada plays in relieving international 
tensions and handling international traumas.
<P>
	The position of CIDA on the forefront of this situation is 
highly respected and appreciated by many in the  international 
community. A comprehensive understanding of the role Canada 
is playing requires the study of our goals and methods in this 
region.
<P>
	It is clear that we all desire to see a country that could be 
united with political and economic stability.
<P>
	We must play a role in foreign countries. However, we must 
make the decision making process much more transparent. We 
cannot operate in an ad hoc arrangement and Canadians are 
demanding accountability when it comes to our decisions on 
programs like this, particularly with regard to aid.
<P>
	It is hard for me to really understand what is happening in 
Rwanda, as I was fortunate enough to visit this country; a rich 
country in terms of its natural scenery, its wild animals and, yes, 
its people. I will always remember those market scenes of 
people smiling and happy, trading their goods, everybody with a 
baby on their back. It is difficult to understand how that could 
change. I guess it really demonstrates how fragile all 
democracies or all types of situations are.
<P>
	In summary, I would applaud the statements that the secretary 
of state made. However, I would ask that we always remember 
the accountability. We must provide the criteria so that the 
people of Canada understand what we are doing in such aid 
projects as this.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADACOMMUNICATIONGROUP">CANADA COMMUNICATION GROUP</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier this day I released 
the audit report of the Canada Communication Group.
<P>
	As some hon. members may recall, I requested that an 
independent audit be conducted as a result of allegations made 
by suppliers, members of Parliament and concerned citizens on 
possible conflicts of interest in the contracting practices of the 
Canada Communication Group.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	After listening to suppliers, I decided to act quickly to get the 
facts out in the open. That is why Deloitte and Touche were 
asked in March to come in and examine the Canada 
Communication Group's contracting practices. This impressive 
audit was conducted in just six weeks.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4398"> 4398 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	It is clear from the audit report that the Canada 
Communication Group's role as both a supplier and a 
contracting agent results in an inherent structural conflict of 
interest.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The auditors have recommended, and I have accepted as I 
have accepted all of the recommendations which have been put 
forward, that the Canada Communication Group procurement 
activities be transferred to the supply operations group within 
Public Works and Government Services Canada. This transfer is 
to be completed by August 1 of this year.
<P>
	The decision to sever Canada Communication Group 
contracting arm from its service delivery component directly in 
my view addresses this finding of an inherent conflict of 
interest. The Canada Communication Group will continue to 
provide, however, a full range of services. However, the removal 
of the contracting activity eliminates both the potential for 
conflict of interest and a major irritant to suppliers across this 
country.
<P>
	As well there are well over 150 employees at the Canada 
Communication Group whose lives will be affected by this 
decision. All affected will become employees directly of Public 
Works and Government Services Canada.
<P>
	It must be noted that the auditors found the Canada 
Communication Group business practices to be consistent with 
its charter. Further, the auditors concluded that there was no 
evidence of illegal or fraudulent activities. The auditors also 
recommended that an advisory committee be established to look 
at the Canada Communication Group organizational status and 
its future evolution. This committee to be comprised of 
government and industry representatives will consult widely 
and extensively with all stakeholders in mapping out the future 
directions for the Canada Communication Group.
<P>
	Officials are now finalizing the mandate of the committee and 
I expect to be able to name the members in the next few weeks 
and to have the final report from the committee some time in the 
very near future.
<P>
	At the same time the Canada Communication Group in 
consultations with client departments, suppliers and central 
agencies is to develop and publish a policy and guidelines on 
conflict of interest. The advisory committee will review and 
approve the policy and determine how the policy is to be 
monitored for compliance.
<P>
	I do not think that one can talk candidly about the Canada 
Communication Group without acknowledging its status as a 
special operating agency. I already noted at the Standing 
Committee on Government Operations that the concept of a 
special operating agency is an important one but should be 
reviewed. I am looking at the issue of special operating agencies 
with my colleague from the Treasury Board. We need to 
re-examine the purpose of  special operating agencies and the 
type of government services which benefit most from being 
structured along those lines.
<P>
	I fully expect that the special operating model as structured by 
the former government will come under further scrutiny and 
reviews which are now presently under way.
<P>
	In closing, I want to assure all hon. members that their input 
on the review of future options for the Canada Communication 
Group will be welcomed. It is my hope and expectation that a 
full and frank discussion will evolve and that the Canada 
Communication Group and the Government of Canada will 
emerge even stronger as a result of this particular process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, I read the 
statement made by the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services concerning the Canada Communication 
Group. Some elements sound vague and raise some very serious 
concerns.
<P>
	As all stakeholders and certainly the minister himself knew, 
the outside firm Deloitte and Touche confirmed there was a 
conflict of interest in this special operating agency or SOA.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	The minister either did not keep his eyes open or did not have 
the ability to review this matter himself, since it was an outside 
firm that made him see the light. In any case, it may be better 
this way since this firm only took six weeks to write its report 
whereas the minister would surely have taken six or twelve 
months if not more to do the same.
<P>
	The first concern relates to the transfer of the Canada 
Communication Group's purchasing operations with all 150 
employees affected to the supply operations arm of the 
department. Should this transfer exercise not be subject to an 
extensive review to rationalize departmental staff and 
resources?
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois periodically asks for a comprehensive 
review of public expenditures. Would it not be appropriate to 
take advantage of this adjustment to streamline spending and cut 
the waste of public funds?
<P>
	Can the minister also assure us that the supply operations 
group within his department will be completely transparent and 
that the new status of the 150 employees will effectively stop 
any conflict of interest with the Canada Communication Group?
<P>
	The announcement by the minister that an advisory 
committee will be set up to examine the status of the Canada 
Communication Group does not come as a big surprise to us. 
The Liberals have become the undisputed champions of 
advisory committees. We wonder whether ministers need their 
own staff since they always rely on advisory committees. Do 
ministers of this government have the authority to analyze, 
consult and make decisions on their own? Can they do the job 
themselves?
<P>
	What guarantee do we have that this other advisory committee 
will not be made up of friends of the Liberals? On what basis and 
under what conditions will members of that committee be 
appointed? There are numerous concerns, Mr. Speaker.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4399"> 4399 </A></B>
<P>
	I suggest to the minister that all members of the Standing 
Committee on Government Operations should sit on that 
committee. The minister should use a committee which already 
exists and whose members are MPs elected by the public. 
Instead of doing your usual show, I ask you, when the committee 
does its work, to open the books, to provide all necessary 
information, to invite your civil servants and let them express 
their views, and to consult all those interested in this issue. In 
this way, we will be able to shed some light on the issue and 
propose new options through a transparent and open process, as 
is the public's wish.
<P>
	We are concerned by two other aspects in the minister's 
statement. While setting up an advisory committee, the minister 
is asking Communications Canada to develop and release a 
policy on conflicts of interest. Why is that not the committee's 
responsibility? Given its mandate, it is incumbent upon the 
committee to recommend such a policy. Again, more 
duplication of studies and consultation processes!
<P>
	Finally, the minister says that he is reviewing the whole issue 
of Special Operating Agencies, including Communications 
Canada. What a mess, Mr. Speaker. The minister is looking at 
SOAs, the advisory committee is looking at a SOA, and the SOA 
is looking at itself. As far as we are concerned, this is pure 
improvisation.
<P>
	Logic, intelligence, simplicity and common sense do not 
seem to be the forte of the minister responsible for SOAs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to respond on behalf of the Reform Party to the minister's 
statement.
<P>
	Before I do, however, I would like to mention that we did not 
get a copy of this report from his office until 90 minutes prior to 
this announcement. Since he knows that we are expected to 
respond directly after his statement in the House, and since his 
own party was scathing in its criticisms of such lack of 
information and lack of co-operation from the old government 
when it was in opposition, I would think that the minister would 
be particularly sensitive to the actions of his own people and 
would like to look into that in his own office.
<P>
	One can imagine the righteous indignation from the minister 
if he were on this side of the House while the government 
delayed the release of a potentially embarrassing report.
<P>
	In dealing with the audit report of the Canada Communication 
Group I will start by commending the minister for the quick 
turnaround in this audit. While we are happy that the 
government has moved on this issue, I  cannot help but wonder 
why the government needed an audit in the first place to 
determine that as both supplier and contractor, CCG was in a 
conflict position.  That appears to me, and I would hazard to say 
to most of the country, to be self-evident.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	This audit was moved up due to a series of complaints against 
CCG across the country from private sector companies that felt 
they were unable to compete fairly for government business. 
These are the types of rumours that have circulated about CCG 
in recent press clippings.
<P>
	First, there was a director general attempting to contract work 
to the private sector. CCG co-ordinates the bidding process. The 
winning bid selected by CCG is CCG. The agency comes in just 
below the lowest private sector bid. Understandably all sorts of 
questions about insider knowledge emerged.
<P>
	Second, CCG is one of the bidders for a substantial contract 
with the federal government and it wins with the lowest bid. 
Only afterward is it known that CCG had a small advantage over 
the other firms in that it did not feel the need to include its 
employees as labour because CCG did not have to pay them for 
the work on the specific project since they already had a federal 
salary.
<P>
	One area the minister did not address with any substance deals 
with the whole issue of special operating agencies or SOAs of 
which CCG is one. There has been much criticism that these 
SOAs create unfair competition for those wanting government 
contracts.
<P>
	More and more, companies are finding themselves facing off 
against SOAs for contracts within government and even outside 
government. Several national industry associations have said 
that they have been deluged with complaints from their 
members. Companies have complained that these SOAs receive 
insider information because of their privileged position within 
government that can assist them in winning contracts.
<P>
	Others complain it is not fair that SOAs, which are essentially 
subsidized by taxpayers' money, are allowed to bid against them 
in the first place. Still others complain that it is not fair that 
SOAs are winning contracts with universities and 
municipalities. Finally, some wonder if allowing government 
departments to compete for contracts internationally is such a 
good idea.
<P>
	A number of questions need to be answered with regard to 
SOAs, none of which the minister has addressed today. Are there 
any rules governing SOAs when they find themselves competing 
with the private sector? Each SOA runs according to a private 
agreement worked out between it and the department.
<P>
	Technically, when government departments offer to do work 
for another government department, the transaction does not fall 
in the category of contracting. It is called the provision of 
professional services according to one analyst. When SOAs 
aggressively seek out work that might have gone to public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4400"> 4400 </A></B>
<P>
tender, it is not competing  for contracts because all SOAs are 
still 100 per cent owned by their departments.
<P>
	Also the reason why SOAs such as CCG are bidding on 
contracts with municipalities and universities is they have 
literally interpreted the standard rule that work can be sought 
within government to include any level or institution of 
government. As for international contracts with foreign 
governments, government departments compete for these 
because they feel they as government often have the best chance 
of securing work.
<P>
	The whole issue of SOAs has not been adequately addressed 
today by the minister other than his tepid reference to another 
government study on conflict of interest and some new nebulous 
review by his department and the Treasury Board on the role of 
SOAs. This needs much more serious attention in our opinion.
<P>
	In reference to the auditor's report itself, the auditor has made 
five major recommendations respecting these conflicts of 
interest. However of greatest interest to our party is a 
recommendation that either CCG be privatized, given crown 
corporation status or retain its special operating agency status 
but with revised goals and targets.
<P>
	Our party has a bias toward privatization and in the case of 
CCG this option does bear exploring. In the interim, the minister 
has moved to put CCG's procurement arm under-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. Perhaps the member has 
forgotten during the week that he is only allowed to have as 
much time as the minister took in his statement. His time has 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Very briefly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is an important point of 
order. My colleague opposite made reference to the fact that he 
had not been provided the information well in advance. I want 
the House and you, Mr. Speaker, to understand that with the 
previous administration it was not uncommon.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. I do not need to hear further to 
that. It is certainly not a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> I have a point of order. I have something that I 
wish to add-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Please get to the point. The hon. 
minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I am allowed to complete my 
point of order, I will arrive at its final conclusion.
<P>
	A member of the Reform Party stated in the House that he did 
not have sufficient time to examine the statement which we 
provided 90 minutes in advance. Perhaps it is for this reason: the 
Reform Party demanded of my office that we hand deliver the 
report by ministerial car and driver so they could have full time 
to examine it.
<P>
	If that is not a bogus point by the hon. member, I do not know 
what is, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The House leader for the Reform Party 
and perhaps the member who was spoken of would wish to speak 
as well afterward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, these comments are totally 
unfounded. We have an agreement with the government that it 
will provide us with minister's statements in a reasonable time, 
which is more than 90 minutes. We have had an ongoing 
problem with having those statements received as agreed on 
previously.
<P>
	It is the minister's problem. It is not our problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, the point the House leader made is 
entirely true.
<P>
	Further, this audit that we are referring to, not so much the 
minister's statement, could have been sent out a lot earlier than 
it was. There is no reason in the world why it could not have been 
brought over at the beginning of the day.
<P>
	I categorically refute what the minister has said. There is 
absolutely no excuse for not getting this report before 90 
minutes before the minister's statement.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADASTUDENTFINANCIALASSISTANCEACT">CANADA STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from May 24 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-28, an act respecting the making of loans and the 
provision of other forms of financial assistance to students, to 
amend and provide for the repeal of the Canada Student Loans 
Act, and to amend one other act in consequence thereof, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to this bill this afternoon. I say that 
because it gives me an opportunity to address the House on a bill 
which affects the very group on whom we place great hope for 
our future, our youth.
<P>
	I am going to approach the bill from three advantage points: 
as a parent, as a women previously in pre-doctoral studies, and 
as an elected representative; but first let me set the stage in 
terms of our current employment scene because it is inextricably 
linked to the financial security of our students.
<P>
	It is alarming to know that Canada is described as a country of 
structural unemployment. This means that after each of the 
recessions experienced over the past 20 years unemployment 
has declined but overall has remained higher than before each of 
the recessions.
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund has placed the blame 
squarely on generous unemployment benefits which discourage 
job hunting; greater unionization,  centralized wage bargaining 
and high minimum wages which reduce labour market 
flexibility; and high non-wage costs which discourage hiring. 
These are the realities of our job market, not a promising set of 
circumstances by any stretch. Yet this is what awaits those with 
high hopes, those who graduate from our universities and 
colleges and enter this jobless market.
<P>
	The effects of this situation spill over into summer job 
opportunities, jobs which mean financial survival for most 
students. Recent figures show an alarming trend in summer 
employment opportunities. Current unemployment rates for 15 
to 24 year olds remain at 1993 figures, that is 18.1 per cent. This 
is up from 17.9 per cent in 1992, 14.5 per cent in 1991, and 10.5 
per cent in 1990. Students have expressed outrage and now many 
feel apathetic toward a system of diminishing options.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	This bill is not only timely. It is absolutely necessary to meet 
the needs of students in a recovery where there are few jobs, 
little choice and scarce money. Bill C-28 contains some positive 
elements and as a parent I commend the government for 
recognizing that our present system for educational funding is 
outdated.
<P>
	Like most families with children in university, mine had to 
find a balance between parental financial support and other 
sources to sustain a university education. Our children have 
worked part time to augment their costs and until they reached 
21 years of age this was a satisfactory arrangement. However it 
was our family's choice beyond that point that our children 
looked to extending that support network to include government 
student loans.
<P>
	It should be noted that it has become increasingly expensive 
to sustain a reasonable standard of living while attending 
university. Even with the combination of parental support, a part 
time job and a student's loan, financial worries remain a 
consideration and a burden to most students. Our children were 
no exception.
<P>
	I recognize like most Canadians that in 1994 our colleges and 
universities are in a state of crisis. Nobody agrees with this more 
than administrations, faculty, staff and students either attending 
or looking forward to attend university or college.
<P>
	Here are some examples of the problems that post-secondary 
institutions face today. Federal transfers to provinces fail to 
keep up with the rate of inflation. Tuition fee increases are 
inflexible and capped at low levels. There is an ever increasing 
demand by the public for access to institutions of higher 
learning. University and college staff unions are demanding and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4404"> 4404 </A></B>
<P>
winning continuing wage increases that are higher than those in 
the private sector.
<P>
	The Canada student loans program or CSLP is an important 
program. I am pleased the government recognizes that it needs 
reforming to make it more effective. However it is unfortunate 
that the government sees the CSLP as the only problem with 
Canada's post-secondary educational system.
<P>
	Any student loans program should preserve and enhance the 
quality and accessibility of post-secondary education, but Bill 
C-28 fails to do so to any meaningful extent. Despite significant 
changes in post-secondary education and its clientele, student 
assistance programs have remained relatively unchanged since 
coming into existence in 1964-65. Although joint studies of 
student aid needs have been undertaken on occasion they have 
not resulted in any formal agreement among federal and 
provincial governments for a new a comprehensive students 
assistance program.
<P>
	In the five-year period between 1988-89 and 1992-93 the 
university tuition fee price index for Canadians increased by 58 
per cent. This means that during that five-year period the 
adjusted cost increase to a Canadian student was 58 per cent. 
When one factors in the cost of living adjustment it is easy to see 
why students are clamouring so loudly about increased costs of 
education.
<P>
	During that same time period there was no commensurate 
increase in loans for students to access. Students were expected 
to pay substantially increased costs. Yet they were provided with 
no opportunity to access more funds. As a result more students 
took jobs to pay for their courses. The effect of this has been to 
increase the average length of study to five years for what was 
once a four-year degree program. Because the degree takes five 
years the student's gross costs increase. This means a student is 
required to access yet more loan support.
<P>
	In effect by allowing costs to increase in this manner without 
increasing access to loans, the government increases its cost to 
itself. When students are in the system longer they take up more 
resources. When their loans are larger they are more inclined to 
default given the repayment system of the past. Ultimately the 
decision not to increase student loans cost the government more 
than giving the loans would have done.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	The best proposal in the bill is to increase by 57 per cent the 
limit on the loans to students. Interestingly the increase to 57 per 
cent on loan limits was a recommendation made in a study 
commissioned by the department of the secretary of state in 
1990. However the study made 13 recommendations and this is 
only one of the 13 recommendations that the government is 
implementing. Even more intriguing, the government is 
choosing to implement some proposals that were not 
recommended by the study at all.
<P>
	The government says that it is interested in hearing 
constructive ideas to help it do its job. However it seems content 
to ignore constructive suggestions commissioned  by the 
government from independent non-political organizations and 
paid for by the taxpayers of Canada. It ignores them unless the 
ideas fit with its preplanned agendas. These are often developed 
in the back room with little attention paid to the realities facing 
Canadian families.
<P>
	One of the proposals in the legislation which does not come 
from the government study is a plan to provide grants to meet 
the exceptional cost of women students in doctoral studies. I 
should remind the House that the study of the secretary of state 
made no recommendations for any grant or loans to women in 
doctoral studies. For that matter, it made no recommendations 
for any grants or loans whatsoever that discriminate on the basis 
of gender.
<P>
	The wording of the legislation suggests that women have to 
endure more or exceptional costs as doctoral students. However 
I believe that women do not incur any more exceptional cost as 
doctoral students than men do. Many of us have families and 
mortgage considerations at this point in our careers. When I was 
a masters candidate and a Ph.D. candidate I did not incur any 
cost that would not have been equally carried by any of my male 
colleagues.
<P>
	The intent of the legislation must not be to redress exceptional 
costs that women face but to redress the fact that there are 
limited post-graduate opportunities for mid-career 
professionals in Canada. Our current programs are inflexible, 
lacking creativity, and most certainly do not respond to the 
private sector needs of advanced training and skills 
requirements.
<P>
	As well an attempt to redress the statistical difference in the 
larger numbers of male candidates over female candidates 
should not be accomplished in such a blatantly discriminatory 
fashion. The numbers of women in post-secondary institutions 
have been increasing steadily without violating the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. I do not understand why there is such 
focus on affirmative action tactics when in my view they are 
completely unnecessary.
<P>
	In fact the number of women enrolled full time at universities 
increased by 79 per cent between 1975 and 1990, while during 
the same time period the number of men increased by only 19 
per cent. Presently women constitute at least 50 per cent of full 
time students in both colleges and universities and 54 per cent of 
all part time university students. In 1990-91 women constituted 
55 per cent of students at the college level, 53 per cent of full 
time undergraduates, 45 per cent of masters graduates, and 34 
per cent of Ph.D. candidates.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4405"> 4405 </A></B>
<P>
	It is clear that women are very well represented in our 
colleges and universities. They have managed to do so without 
affirmative action. The implication that women are unable to 
compete adequately at the doctoral level without special 
assistance is quite unacceptable to me. I am sure this 
assumption is one that I and most women and men reject. There 
is ample evidence to suggest that women can compete fairly 
on an even playing field at the doctoral level in their studies.
<P>
	In 1975, 23.9 per cent of all doctoral students were women. In 
1993 the 35 per cent figure that I mentioned demonstrates this. 
This is an increase of 11.1 per cent in 18 years. It is a healthy 
increase. Yet we must do more to ensure that these numbers 
grow by ensuring opportunities for both men and women who 
reach this level of their academic careers.
<P>
	What is needed is a student assistance program that allocates 
funds to students on the basis of need. When need is the sole 
criterion, gender fails to be a consideration. Everyone may 
apply for a loan regardless of their gender. They must only be 
able to demonstrate a need for the loan.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	When this bill goes to committee I am certain the House will 
see the wisdom in removing such an uninspiring and 
discriminatory program and will include male doctoral students 
also.
<P>
	I stated earlier that I would also speak as an elected 
representative and offer helpful alternatives to deal with the 
crisis our students in post-secondary institutions are facing.
<P>
	The unemployment rate is still 11 per cent. The government 
seems content to undertake little action and to let it remain at 
that high level. It was reported in this weekend's <I>Financial Post</I> 
that the unemployment rate for 18 to 26-year olds is close to 18 
per cent. Given these staggering figures, it is clear that students 
will have problems getting jobs and repaying their loans.
<P>
	The Canadian Federation of Students, the Association of 
Universities and Colleges of Canada, and the federal 
government's commissioned study are all recommending 
income contingent repayment programs. This legislation only 
waves a hand in the direction of this recommendation by 
introducing pilot projects. It should put its fist firmly down and 
introduce the program in its entirety across the country.
<P>
	As well, the government has spoken of its commitment to 
quality education in Canada. It has a wonderful opportunity to 
show Canada the depth of its concern. It could make the transfer 
payments for education to the provinces indexed with the annual 
rate of inflation.
<P>
	What is also needed today is leadership that will establish a 
national standard of post-secondary education in a flexible 
environment. More and more Canadian businesses are 
introducing flexible work hours for their employees. What is 
needed in the educational system are  equally flexible study 
programs that meet the needs of professionals who are 
attempting to re-enter the post-secondary education system.
<P>
	What we need today in Canada is not a government that 
simply looks at short term solutions to problems. We need a 
government that cares enough to look to the future in order to 
provide solutions that will guarantee long term, high quality 
education in Canada. This government should appreciate all of 
the ideas shared in this debate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are 10 minutes for questions or 
comments. Is there any member wishing to do that? Resuming 
debate.
<P>
	Colleagues should know that we have now passed the five 
hours, therefore we have gone to 10-minute speeches with no 
questions or comments. I understand the member for North 
Vancouver has unanimous consent to speak for slightly longer 
than 10 minutes. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to 
be as brief as I can and I do thank the House for agreeing to 
extend my time.
<P>
	The present student loans program is a program under which 
the federal government-for which one can read 
taxpayers-pays interest on loans negotiated by students at the 
banks. In 1991-92 the cost was around $465 million, less about 
$110 million recovered on defaulted loans. The program 
assisted about 235,000 students.
<P>
	One of the improvements to the program which has been 
proposed by the Reform Party is the adoption of a repayment 
system similar to that already in place in Australia, Sweden and 
New Zealand. The repayment system would be income 
contingent and would work in conjunction with a more generous 
loan program.
<P>
	Such a change would recognize the need by students to have 
funding available for their education, but it would also ensure 
that taxpayers were repaid at a future time at a rate dependent 
upon the earning power of the student.
<P>
	A carefully instituted income contingent loan program would 
make university education more accessible. It would move more 
of the responsibility for the cost of university education on to 
the students themselves, albeit on a deferred basis.
<P>
	I have met some students who feel that society should bear the 
entire burden of their education costs with no loans and no 
repayment ever required. It would be nice if it were as easy as 
writing a cheque, but reality is now dictating a more prudent 
approach.
<P>
	For those members opposite who rolled their eyes skyward 
when I said that more responsibility for the cost of education 
should fall upon the students, I ask that they consider the ability 
of taxpayers to continue to foot the bill.

<P>
	Two of the countries I mentioned which have instituted the 
income contingent loan program, Sweden and New Zealand, 
have faced debt crises within the last decade. We should talk 
about these things before we are also forced into a situation 
where a cash crisis makes us make hasty decisions.
<P>
	I would like to quote from an editorial entitled: ``The 
universities we deserve'' which appeared in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
on July 27, 1993. It describes how an ICR loan program would 
work. To quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every university student would be offered a government sponsored loan. 
These loans would be available not only to poor students, but to anyone who 
wants help supporting themselves through university. After graduation, the 
student would begin paying the loan back, with collection taking place through 
the income tax system. And here is the key to ICR: repayment is income 
contingent. Everyone would pay back a set percentage of income, not a set 
amount. Those making a higher income would have to pay their loans off sooner 
than those making a lower income who would pay it off over a longer period of 
time. Combined with greater freedom for universities in setting tuition, ICR loans 
would make it possible for universities to charge a realistic price for their services 
without harming accessibility.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It would in fact make it easier for some people to go to university, by giving 
loans to the middle class who are not now considered to be poor enough to merit 
a Canada student loan. And ICR recipients could rest assured that the 
government would not, the minute they graduated, be breathing down their 
necks for payment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The current Canada student loan plan has a very high default 
rate. It is only available to people from low income families and 
has a tough repayment schedule regardless of post-graduation 
income. ICR would address these problems whilst also helping 
to deal with the funding crisis in the universities.
<P>
	The general thrust of Bill C-28 is good but it would be even 
better with the incorporation of an aggressive income 
contingent repayment scheme. I hope that government members 
will support an amendment along these lines at some stage.
<P>
	In 1991 the Smith Commission of Inquiry on Canadian 
University Education concluded that: ``A preoccupation with 
underfunding pervades every campus-.The effect is extremely 
negative''. Unfortunately, the solution to that funding problem 
is not going to come from the federal government. The deficit 
and debt burdens will prevent us from increasing allocations. 
Creative approaches are needed and Sweden, Australia and New 
Zealand have shown that income contingent repayment schemes 
can assist students and universities at a time when funding is a 
problem.
<P>
	A spinoff benefit for taxpayers would be the knowledge that 
defaults would be all but eliminated. Loans would be repaid over 
time and in a manner sensitive to the long term earning ability of 
the student.
<P>
	By 1992 defaults under the present Canada student loans 
program had reached almost one-third of the  student loans 
which were at repayment stage. The value of defaults 
accumulated on the books since 1964 has reached almost $1 
billion and there are significant costs to the taxpayers for the 
hiring of collection agencies to try to collect on these defaulted 
loans. The costs are currently reported to be in the range of 18 to 
29 per cent of the loans recovered.
<P>
	Enough is enough. Society is prepared to help students to pay 
for their education. In fact it wants to help students pay for their 
education, but some responsibility to repay those loans must be 
part of the contract. An income contingent repayment plan 
automatically deducting at source is the fairest and most 
efficient way to protect the interests of students, universities 
and taxpayers alike.
<P>
	It is a fact that individuals with university degrees have a 
considerably larger lifetime income than those whose highest 
level of education is high school. In fairness to the taxpayers 
who helped them get this higher education, students should be 
prepared to begin repaying their loans as soon as their income 
permits. This might sometimes mean that loans would not be 
fully repaid until students were into their 30s or even early 40s, 
but at least there would be assurance of eventual repayment 
without the need for collection agencies.
<P>
	One practical problem that must be overcome is the actual 
funding of an ICR program. Our cash strapped finance minister 
is not in any position to raise additional revenues or increase 
deficits, even for such a commendable cause. We again need to 
look for alternatives.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	We could continue to try to raise the necessary money through 
the commercial banks of course. Alternatively the lending 
program could raise funds through the issue of bonds. A stock 
exchange market for second-hand bonds could be subsequently 
developed, similar to the system used by the Student Loan 
Marketing Association of ``Sallie Maes'' in the United States.
<P>
	What an opportunity for parents, to invest in bonds which 
would be used to fund income contingent loan programs for 
students, an investment in the future with the knowledge that 
repayment would occur through automatic deductions at source. 
Students applying for loans would of course have to supply their 
social insurance numbers and their loan contracts would have to 
be registered with Revenue Canada.
<P>
	The ICR system is supported by the Association of 
Universities and Colleges of Canada. The system would remove 
the present interest exemption during attendance at college and 
university. This would result in worthwhile savings to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4407"> 4407 </A></B>
<P>
taxpayers without having any significant effect on student loan 
repayments.
<P>
	In 1987-88 the interest payments by government for students 
still at college amounted to over $150 million and collection 
costs that year were almost $11 million. The cost of exempted 
interest payments and collection procedures falls directly on to 
the taxpayers, but two-thirds of those taxpayers do not have 
post-secondary credentials. In other words, the present system 
places an unfair proportion of the cost of the present student 
loans program on a segment of taxpayers who receive no benefit 
in return for their generosity. It only seems fair that students 
who benefit should ultimately be responsible for the cost of the 
assistance they receive from the taxpayers.
<P>
	Subsidies in our society are usually justified on the basis of a 
social benefit of some sort, but in the case of student loans the 
recipient can expect to receive significant long term private 
benefits. While these private benefits are accruing the present 
loan subsidies represent a transfer of income from taxpayers 
who do not use higher education services for their families.
<P>
	The sighs and eye rolling on the opposite side of the House 
may be reaching epidemic proportions so I feel I should give an 
example of an income contingent loan payment plan.
<P>
	Let us say that when a student first graduates he or she does 
not immediately secure a long term job but settles for a 
temporary job at $12,000 a year, quite a low salary. The 
payments on the student loan would be 3 per cent of earnings, or 
$360 a year. That is just $30 a month, hardly likely to cause 
hardship.
<P>
	Let us say that as time passes the student secures a job earning 
$50,000 a year. The payments could increase to maybe 5 per cent 
per annum, or $2,500 per year. It is not an excessive amount but 
enough to get previous student loans paid off fairly quickly.
<P>
	If the student became unemployed, then payments would be 
deferred until his or her annual income rose above the preset 
threshold once again.
<P>
	Many students who oppose the ICR program do so because 
they do not like the idea that responsibility for loans should be 
more firmly placed upon individual students. They feel that 
society should pay the full shot. Unfortunately the reality is that 
the money is not available and unless we introduce programs 
like income contingent loans, there will be a continuing 
deterioration in funding levels for higher education.
<P>
	I might suggest that if the government wants to free up a little 
more money it would be well advised to take note of an item sent 
to me by Evelyn Leeburn of North Vancouver. It is a newspaper 
clipping which reads: ``Two Clayoquot protesters themselves 
facing contempt charges have won a $16,000 Canada Council 
grant to do a documentary on women at the anti-logging 
blockades''. What sort of nonsense is this? This money would be 
much better spent on higher education.
<P>
	In summary, I would like to say that Bill C-28 does improve 
the present situation, even though it fails to  show strong and 
decisive leadership in terms of ICR loans. I give the government 
credit for including clause 15, part (o) of the regulations, which 
provides for some experimentation with ICR. We in Reform 
hope that this will lead to a much larger scale ICR program in 
due course.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific)):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity today to 
speak to Bill C-28 dealing with the federal government's plan to 
reform its program of student assistance.
<P>
	In my role as Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific, I am well 
aware of the importance of post-secondary education to 
Canada's economic and social development in the global 
economy.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament I am aware of the crucial role that 
the Canada student loans program has played in ensuring 
accessibility to post-secondary education. At the same time, as 
a parent I recognize the need to modernize and improve the 
federal government's effort in this area.
<P>
	As we consider this bill we must learn from the flaws in the 
current system, for there are flaws. However, we must leave in 
tact and strengthen the four key principles which have provided 
the framework for the Canada student loans program over the 
years; namely, access to assistance for all students in financial 
need, emphasis on the responsibility of individual students to 
progress in their studies and to contribute to the cost of their 
education if they have the means, a balance between public and 
private sector roles in financing student aid, and a client centred 
approach to the delivery of student assistance programs based 
on federal-provincial collaboration.
<P>
	I would like to suggest a fifth principle, the need for 
flexibility to adjust to the dynamic learning environment and 
changing economic circumstances. As we have learned from 
past experience, change is inevitable.
<P>
	The student assistance program must be able to adapt to new 
realities. Therefore the bill has been drafted to allow flexibility 
to respond to the challenges of the future.
<P>
	Provinces are aware of the need for greater flexibility and 
have suggested how the federal and provincial programs may 
work together more efficiently by further streamlining the 
financing and administration of our activities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4408"> 4408 </A></B>
<P>
	Far from being an intrusion into an area of provincial 
jurisdiction, the Canada student loans program is a model of 
federal and provincial co-operation. Under this program the 
federal government has worked closely with provinces for 
almost 30 years to help equalize access to post-secondary 
education and training for students in need.
<P>
	I would also note that the Canada student financial assistance 
bill continues to provide for provinces to opt out of the federal 
program and receive compensation. While Quebec and the 
Northwest Territories have withdrawn from the program, other 
provinces have not.
<P>
	In fact, participating provinces have encouraged the federal 
government to continue to occupy this field and to expand its 
efforts in the area of student assistance.
<P>
	Enhanced assistance for needy students is the main reason for 
this bill. The maximum level of aid has been frozen for 10 years 
while costs have gone up by 57 per cent. We are acting now to 
restore a viable and efficient student aid program. Loan limits 
will be increased to the level they would have been without the 
10-year freeze. The full time loan limit will rise from $105 to 
$165 per week, and the part time limit will be increased from 
$2,500 to $4,000.
<P>
	Debt load will be controlled through the introduction of 
deferred grants. Interest relief will be expanded to include low 
income borrowers, and special opportunity grants will be 
established.
<P>
	Under the new financing arrangements, all eligible students 
will have access to loans and income sensitive terms in 
repayment. In total, the amount of aid to be provided over the 
next five years will be $2.5 billion more than over the last five 
years.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	Individual Canadians are willing to take responsibilities for 
their own futures by investing the time and money in 
post-secondary education and training to equip themselves with 
the knowledge and skills for success. This is apparent from the 
fact that Canadians are attending Canada's universities, 
community colleges and private schools in record numbers.
<P>
	The question that the government asked itself when 
considering how to reform the student assistance program was 
how can we help Canadians undertake the post-secondary 
studies they need.
<P>
	The answer came back from the students. Give them the right 
tools, they said. That is why we are proposing fundamental 
changes to the student loans program to provide more aid to 
students and to introduce new forms of non-repayable 
assistance.
<P>
	The flaws in the existing student aid programs have become 
increasingly evident in recent years. Every member of 
Parliament in this House has encountered students and former 
students who have had problems obtaining enough resources to 
study, or who have had difficulties in repaying their loans.
<P>
	The proposed legislation would address both of these 
problems by increasing aid to students and introducing 
measures to ease the repayment burden on graduates. The 
reform of the student assistance program will increase 
educational opportunities and accessibilities for young people 
and for mature students returning to school, including single 
parents on income support and unemployed older workers who 
require training. Unless we can meet the needs of all of these 
people we are denying them opportunities and we are denying 
Canada the benefit of their skills and energies.
<P>
	I would like to stress that the proposed act works for students 
with disabilities whose numbers in colleges and universities do 
not come close to reflecting the numbers in Canadian society. 
Students with disabilities confront many obstacles to full 
participation in Canada's economic mainstream. Learning 
should not be one of them. It is believed that fewer than 3 per 
cent of Canada's full time university and college students are 
persons with disabilities. This bill will deal effectively with 
those situations in which a barrier to post-secondary studies has 
been a lack of resources.
<P>
	In addition to the increased loans, under the new legislation 
students with permanent disabilities may qualify for special 
opportunity grants of up to $3,000 per year to help cover costs 
relating to special transportation, interpretation services and 
technical aids. As well, we will allow flexibility for students 
who because of their disability must take fewer courses and who 
require more time to complete their studies.
<P>
	This legislation will enable Canadians with disabilities to 
obtain the financing they need for the exceptional costs which 
they must incur to undertake their studies. Many of the 
challenges they face can be overcome with their ingenuity and 
perseverance and a little financial help from government.
<P>
	Similarly, this legislation will address the special needs of 
women who wish to pursue doctoral studies in non-traditional 
fields. Special opportunity grants of up to $3,000 per year will 
be available to help women who are taking doctoral degrees in 
fields of study such as the applied and physical sciences, 
mathematics and engineering. There will also be special 
opportunity grants of up to $1,200 annually for high need, part 
time students to assist them in pursuing their studies.
<P>
	The student financial assistance bill is an important step in 
our social security reform process. We are moving quickly in 
this area because the need is so great.
<P>
	To summarize, let me put the reforms provided for in this bill 
in human terms.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4409"> 4409 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us think about the students who are considering 
post-secondary studies who come into our constituency offices. 
What would the reform mean to them?
<P>
	First, because of the new need assessment process, the 
financial need will be determined based on up to date objective 
national data which will reflect cost variations across the 
country.
<P>
	Second, the maximum loans that they can expect to receive 
will be increased by 57 per cent to reflect current education 
costs.
<P>
	Third, there will be non-repayable grants assistance for 
students with disabilities, high need, part time students and 
women in certain doctoral studies.
<P>
	Fourth, students may be eligible for a deferred grant to help 
maintain manageable debt loads after graduation.
<P>
	Fifth, when the time comes to pay back their student loans, 
they will be dealing with a lending institution which views them 
not as problems but as long term customers. Lenders will have 
an incentive to keep student loans in good standing by providing 
better service and income sensitive repayment. Both the lender 
and the borrower will view the student loan as the first 
transaction a long and mutually beneficial business 
relationship.
<P>
	This is what the reforms provided for in the bill will mean to 
students. We are working to improve aspects of the social safety 
net but this legislation will help steer thousands of Canadians 
away from the safety net altogether.
<P>
	Canada must look to its people for growth and prosperity in 
the years ahead. The new Canada student financial assistance 
program addresses that reality in a creative and fair minded way.
<P>
	It will help individual Canadians meet the challenges ahead 
and build their futures in an atmosphere that encourages and 
supports their aspirations.
<P>
	Let me conclude by saying that I am proud to be able to 
support this bill and I hope it will receive early passage so that 
we will be able to get on with the job at hand of helping Canadian 
students look toward their futures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I noticed the hon. member in his 
presentation mentioned special funding for certain-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I do not think the member was here 
when it was announced that we are now past five hours, and so 
there are no questions or comments any more. It is strictly 
10-minute speeches.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Canada 
Student Loans Act and the activity of it has an impact on five 
basic segments in our society: the students, obviously; the 
parents and family members; the university or college boards; 
the teaching staff and administration of those institutions; and 
of course society at large, all Canadians through our economy.
<P>
	I would like to speak today specifically to the issue of the 
income sensitive repayment loans in this proposed legislation. 
Another title for that might be an income contingent loan 
repayment program.
<P>
	The reason I address this specifically is that the government 
has started to take a positive step and will form an element of 
where we must be going in terms of reforming our institutions 
for higher learning.
<P>
	What is an income sensitive repayment loan or income 
contingent loan repayment program? Simply put, it is a scheme 
for post-secondary education and it is designed to allow 
students to pay back their student loans over a period of time 
based on their annual income.
<P>
	Upon graduation, the student would begin to repay his or her 
student loan. The repayment of the loan, however, would link 
the repayment plan to a student's earnings or ability to pay.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	Exactly how it would work has been described earlier in the 
House, but in summary the income tax machinery could be used 
in monitoring and collecting student loans and in the 
implementation of an income contingency principle whereby 
students would pay back a set percentage of their income.
<P>
	I mentioned that a number of elements within society are 
impacted. Let us talk briefly about students. Our students are the 
future of Canada. It is their training that will be pulling our 
economy forward. Indeed the strength of our economy lies in 
society at large and within the education that society gains.
<P>
	However in doing some research for this presentation I took 
the time to contact some people at the East Kootenay 
Community College in my constituency. They wrote to me and 
gave an idea of some problems students are facing as they go 
through the present system. Perhaps I could make a very brief 
summary of some problems that faced the students on 
September 17 last year.
<P>
	Of the 300 loans that had been submitted to Victoria it is 
estimated that 100 students had not received the loans as at 
September 17, obviously the start of the calendar year. It is 
estimated that 25 per cent of the students who had received loans 
had the calculations of their awards done incorrectly. Many 
students were in the process of appealing or reassessing their 
loans because of application errors. The financial aid office of 
the community college had been issuing emergency loans and 
tuition and book deferrals to students who were waiting for their 
loan documents to arrive or had pending applications. At the end 
of the month, and they were looking forward, they expected that 
emergency moneys would have to be made available to the 
students. I have three children who are now in their 
mid-twenties and have been through this process with them. I 
know, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4410"> 4410 </A></B>
<P>
particularly at the start of a college or a university year, this 
could be very disconcerting. They had to look for emergency 
moneys.
<P>
	Approximately 25 per cent of those students who had not 
received the loans, believe it or not, had been referred to social 
services. The report says that because of uncertainties produced 
by the system, that is their applications went missing or they 
could not get access to information, many students were actually 
in panic. The report goes on and on. Clearly this is not 
acceptable to our future society and to the people who are there 
for training. That is the present situation.
<P>
	The second group of people currently impacted by the student 
loans are the supporters, the parents and the families of the 
students. Having been through the experience I can report that 
some calculations occur because the existing formula is 
absolutely bizarre and would create a financial drain the average 
family could simply not afford.
<P>
	The third would be university and college boards. They are 
dealing with the reality: as there is more and more of a squeeze 
on resources in Canada and our financial ability to pay, there is 
more and more of a shrinking of their ability to be able to fund 
these institutions. They have a strong sense of responsibility.
<P>
	The fourth area is the staff, be they teaching staff or the staff 
who support the functions that are happening in the college. It is 
rather interesting that the vast majority of people involved in the 
training and teaching of our children, our young people, are very 
dedicated. There seems to me to be something of an unreal level 
of expectation on the part of some staff in terms of funding; in 
other words the bottomless pit or the attitude that we have the 
ability in Canada to keep on digging the hole deeper and deeper.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe in the concept of an income sensitive repayment loan 
because of its inherent fairness to students. First off I believe 
that students should know it is society's responsibility to create 
opportunity. They should know that in our society there is no 
free lunch, that the money must come from somewhere, and that 
the government is simply redistributing funds it has taken from 
someone else. They should also know that as they gain their 
education it obviously opens more jobs for life. On the other 
hand it is not fair to saddle the students with an inability to be 
able to repay the loans as our present Canada Student Loans Act 
has done.
<P>
	Under income sensitive repayment loans the second segment 
is the people who are supporting these students. They would also 
be freed from the responsibilities or freed from the pressure that 
many of them are feeling at this time. In other words it would be 
the students' responsibility to negotiate and to repay. They 
would have the responsibility for these loans, thereby freeing up 
the families to the greatest extent possible. As I have indicated, 
in many situations as it presently stands families are saddled 
with responsibilities they simply cannot follow through on.
<P>
	For those people involved with the university and college 
boards there would be the ability to know what is coming, in 
other words to be able to deliver services. All Canadians will 
end up benefiting. The entire economy will end up benefiting as 
we gain a handle on the whole area of funding student loans and 
the ability to be able to train all Canadians.
<P>
	I believe in the income sensitive repayment loans and in the 
idea the Reform Party has put forward on the education voucher 
system. Basically the purpose of both these things is to 
accomplish what we need to accomplish, that is to train our 
young people but to lighten the necessity for further deficit 
spending. It has the potential to eliminate deficit spending. The 
Reform Party is noted for its commitment to reducing the deficit 
and ultimately getting the deficit to zero so we can start to work 
on the debt. At the same time the Reform Party is committed to 
student training.
<P>
	In summary I say that students do not want a handout; they 
want a hand up. Income sensitive repayment loans are an 
important part of the hand up process for students. Therefore I 
strongly encourage the government to move quickly to expand 
the proposed section in the new Canada Student Loans Act.

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (for the Minister of Finance)</B> 
moved that Bill C-27, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the 
Income Tax Application Rules, the Canada Pension Plan, the 
Canada Business Corporations Act, the Excise Tax Act, the 
Unemployment Insurance Act and certain related acts, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to begin 
debate on second reading of Bill C-27.
<P>
	The bill proposes to implement a number of amendments to 
the Income Tax Act and related statutes, most of which are 
technical in nature. The bill also contains draft legislation for a 
measure announced in the budget of February 1994 related to 
scientific research and experimental development, the SR and 
ED expenditures.
<P>
	With the exception of the one budget item the measures 
contained in the bill were announced by the previous 
government. They were included in a package of technical 
amendments that were released in August 1993 but never tabled 
in the House. That package consolidated a number of measures 
that had been released for public consultation in December 1992 
with draft legislation issued by press release during 1993. In a 
December 1993 press release the Minister of Finance confirmed 
the government's intention to table the legislation.
<P>
	As the amendments are mostly technical I will just spend a 
brief moment reviewing them and allowing the House to 
proceed with its business. It is very important to note that most 
of these measures are already in effect and have been so for 
some time. Many were said to be effective immediately when 
announced.
<P>
	This is a perfectly legitimate and normal practice in the 
House, especially for measures of a relieving nature that modify 
an anomaly under existing tax law. When simplifying the 
income tax treatment of automobile operating cost benefits, for 
example, it would be unreasonable to insist that taxpayers wait 
out the course of full legislative enactment for relief.
<P>
	Several of the amendments relate to retirement income plans 
including RRSPs and certain pensions. One set of measures, for 
example, is designed to ensure that a taxpayer's RRSP limit 
reflects in a fairer way the taxpayer's retirement savings under 
certain types of unregistered pension plans such as foreign 
pension plans.
<P>
	The legislation also modifies rules for RRSPs on death and 
enables the legal representative of a deceased person to pay an 
RRSP premium on that person's behalf up to 60 days after the 
end of the year of death.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This bill also proposes to simplify or clarify existing tax 
rules. I have already mentioned the tax treatment of automobile 
operating cost benefits. The amendments simplify the way in 
which these benefits are taxed by establishing a formula for 
calculating them. This is one change that is sure to please 
taxpayers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Another amendment will allow taxpayers to deduct interest on 
money that is borrowed to earn business income or certain types 
of investment income in situations where the property financed 
by the borrowing has been disposed of at a loss or become 
altogether valueless. Without this amendment such interest 
expenses would not be deductible in spite of their business 
nature and the hardship that could result.
<P>
	The legislation also provides relief to producers of calcium 
chloride and diamonds by treating these substances as minerals 
for income tax purposes. This gives producers access to income 
tax incentives for mining.
<P>
	Not every amendment in the legislation is relieving. One is 
designed to curtail a tax avoidance mechanism used by certain 
corporations with non-resident shareholders. This technique, 
commonly referred to as a cross-border purchase butterfly, is 
used to avoid tax on the sale of business assets. Our tax laws 
were not intended to provide special breaks for structuring 
corporate assets sales in this way and the amendment eliminates 
such undesirable tax advantages.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	There is also a measure which will give legislative force to the 
special capital tax, the so-called part VI tax, that has been 
payable by life insurance companies for taxation years ending 
after February 25, 1992.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, the bill contains a measure announced in the most 
recent federal budget, namely draft legislation requiring 
corporations claiming tax credits for scientific research and 
experimental development to identify expenditures in this area 
in their tax returns.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, the amendments in this bill represent technical 
improvements to our tax legislation, improvements that follow 
from the ongoing process of fine tuning the tax system in 
consultations with taxpayers. Most of the provisions are already 
in effect and many thousands of Canadians have relied on them 
in planning their affairs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4412"> 4412 </A></B>
<P>
	In short, this bill should be viewed as a matter of routine but 
important parliamentary housekeeping. Therefore I urge all 
members of the House to support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
remember, the very first bill I spoke to in this House have barely 
two pages long and contained but five clauses.
<P>
	Today, we have a bill 177 pages long containing no less than 
139 clauses. Of course, we are dealing in this case with the 
Income Tax Act; that makes a big difference. This goes to show 
how complex this act is and how hard it is to find one's way 
through.
<P>
	I will tell you this is a very technical document, a very 
technical bill indeed. I will spare you the details, naturally, so as 
to not to bore you with technicalities, but I would like to say a 
few words about the process before going any further.
<P>
	You know, there is always a risk associated with these 
omnibus bills where many subjects are dealt with at the same 
time. One gets the impression that a tiny clause, but one with 
tremendous impact could be hidden in a mass of provisions 
which are, on the whole, positive. It is like looking for a needle 
in a haystack and this is to some extent the viewpoint from 
which I have looked at this bill, especially considering it was 
initially sent almost at the last minute, leaving us very little time 
to work on it.
<P>
	Officials from the Department of Finance did come and 
explain it to us, but just the same, I got the impression things 
were going very fast. Furthermore, this is a bill originating for a 
large part from the previous government, with the exception of 
the last part concerning research and development and the 
definition of qualified expenditure.
<P>
	As for the rest of the measures, they had all been put in place 
by the former government but not yet translated into legislation. 
That is always somewhat of a problem of course, because the 
people who were in charge of analyzing and criticizing the bill at 
the time are now sitting on the government side. Often, after an 
election, the members who sit on the opposition side are not the 
ones who sat there when measures were introduced in the 
previous Parliament. This is the case in this instance.
<P>
	Some thought should be given to this process so that, when a 
Parliament is dissolved and an election is held, legislation like 
this is not left pending, even if, in all probability, it were to mean 
rushing the department to put into legal terms the effects of 
these measures or the latest budget. I think that there would be a 
way to improve the work of Parliament or in any case to make it 
a lot easier, to make it unnecessary for the government to pass 
the former government's bills and for the opposition to criticize 
measures which already apply anyway but are being made legal.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words about the Tax Act in general; it 
is extremely complex. Often the people whom  we want to help 
with changes to the Tax Act are hardly able to benefit from them 
because they are unaware of their existence. Often, the effects 
are weakened by other measures as well.
<P>
	Over time, the Tax Act becomes more and more complex and 
cumbersome. When we amend it, we should look at all the other 
sections, what should be changed as a result, and we end up with 
total confusion. Besides that, business people now have to deal 
with an increasingly burdensome tax as well, the goods and 
services tax which imposes a very heavy administrative burden 
with very complex regulations. This is hardly the way to 
stimulate entrepreneurship, and in fact, these measures have the 
reverse effect, because they just make it harder to understand all 
these mechanisms.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Of course, the people at the Department of National Revenue 
are experts in this field. The people at the Department of 
Finance work with these concepts every day. However, I think 
we should remember that people who are starting a business will 
have to spend a lot of time promoting their product and making 
their business a success. This is all very complex for these 
people. Of course they do consult tax experts and accountants, 
but why should it all be so complicated.
<P>
	Even when they consult these accountants and tax experts, 
they keep coming to our offices for clarification or for an 
interpretation of the act. They end up filing an appeal with the 
Tax Court of Canada, and the number of cases is increasing, 
which goes to show that the process is far too complex.
<P>
	Since the beginning of this Parliament and even since the Bloc 
was formed, we have been asking for a thorough tax reform, 
which is in everyone's interest. It would also involve 
simplifying the Income Tax Act. I think that a review of our tax 
system would necessarily mean simplifying the content of this 
legislation. Unfortunately, what we have here is merely a set of 
technical amendments, and there is an obvious reluctance to 
deal with the substance of the legislation.
<P>
	However, when I look at these 139 sections and 177 pages, it 
would not have taken much to do a thorough review. If we have 
to look at so many sections, why not look at them all? This could 
be done by a group of parliamentarians through existing 
committees or through a special committee. I am convinced that 
all parties in this House would be willing to appoint members to 
make a detailed study. It would prevent a lot of problems.
<P>
	Everything in society operates on the basis of social contracts. 
These are not written documents but the way we have agreed to 
operate as a society. The government spends money according to 
the options chosen by taxpayers and voters, and in so doing 
intervenes in the economy to prevent problems that might be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4413"> 4413 </A></B>
<P>
generated by a free economy operating without reference to a 
moral authority. So the government spends certain sums of 
money. It provides for individual insurance mechanisms.  It 
maintains a defence force and does a lot of other things.
<P>
	So there are a certain number of expenditures are necessary, 
but to make those expenditures, the government must first get 
the money. And today, this is becoming an increasingly serious 
problem. First of all, as far as spending is concerned, people are 
increasingly getting the impression that governments and their 
elected representatives do not necessarily spend money wisely, 
and that a lot of money is wasted. Consequently, this makes 
them highly suspicious about what they contribute to cover 
these expenditures. They know full well that they are the ones 
who are picking up the tab.
<P>
	The numbers involved here are staggering. This year, the 
government has brought in a budget of roughly $160 billion and 
is projecting revenues of $120 billion. Despite these $120 
billion, we are still $40 million short of a balanced budget. This 
shortfall could be made up with additional revenues resulting 
from the reduction of certain expenditures.
<P>
	It is extremely difficult to raise $120 billion in revenues when 
people have no confidence in the way this money is spent. 
People wonder if they are paying their fair share and whether 
some are paying more than others. Often, when analyses are 
conducted, the figures prove that this is the case. On examining 
the taxes paid by individuals and corporations from 1981 to 
1991, we see a trend emerging, namely that corporations are 
paying less tax while individuals are paying more.
<P>
	We hear it said every day. Everyone agrees that the middle 
class is being squeezed more and more. These are not merely 
words, the figures bear it out. We do not have to wait 10 or 20 
years for even more sophisticated analyses to tell us that the 
1980s were disastrous in terms of the redistribution of wealth. 
We have the figures right now to show that this was in fact the 
case. We must wake up to the truth that there is a great deal 
wrong with our taxation system. Instead of merely making 
minor technical adjustments to the Income Tax Act, the 
government should completely review the legislation. We have 
said as much from the beginning and we are prepared to 
co-operate in an exercise of this nature.
<P>
	Obviously, there are a number of proposals that we can make 
during the budget consultation process this fall. But again, 
hearings will be held, many groups will give testimony on 
various matters and it will be difficult to focus as much as we 
would want on the Income Tax Act per se, on tax measures and 
expenditures.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	When examining government expenditures, we must also 
look at tax expenditures. This is often overlooked. We examine 
government expenditures, we look at what is spent on defence 
and other areas but very little at what we give out in terms of tax 
credits, that is our tax expenditures.
<P>
	Recently, I read a Department of National Revenue 
publication on tax expenditures. In many cases data is  said to be 
unavailable and often information is aggregated or put together 
in a way that makes it extremely difficult to scrutinize. But 
before compiling it, information must first be gathered. For the 
sake of transparency, seeing that this government promised to be 
transparent during this Parliament, it would be interesting to 
examine tax expenditures in greater detail, to have more 
information available on the subject.
<P>
	Of course, time must always be allowed for compilation. That 
is understandable, but there is no reason not to carry out serious 
analyses using as base year the previous year or even an earlier 
one.
<P>
	So, as I said earlier, the way revenues are collected and spent, 
this social contract is crumbling, which causes a perception 
problem with regard to these revenues.
<P>
	If we look around us in our daily lives, we can see that people 
feel justified, I would even say perfectly justified for the most 
part, to make unrecorded transactions. Take the construction 
industry for example, the home renovation sector and others as 
well, the service sector in general and, more and more, the 
products sector where illegal transactions are supposedly more 
difficult. It is becoming more and more commonplace because 
people tell themselves: ``That money is misused, wasted 
anyway. I am paying more than my fair share. Why should I 
make the deliberate effort of giving all that money to people who 
squander it?''
<P>
	Perceptions can sometimes be correct, but they can also be 
false. To clarify the situation, the relevant information should be 
made available. We should tell people a little more about how 
we collect these revenues, how we want to proceed and how we 
will correct deficiencies in the current system. But not a word on 
the whole tax system has been said since the election. A few 
principles are outlined in the red book but there is little else.
<P>
	Because of this revenue problem, we see that we have a 
growing underground economy. Of course, depending on who 
does the analysis, whether at Statistics Canada, at a tax summit 
or somewhere else, experts cannot agree on an exact figure, on 
the percentage of the economy that is underground. But they all 
agree that it is a growing phenomenon. The most optimistic 
analysts say that the underground economy represents at least 
2.5 per cent of our economic activity level, while the most 
pessimistic put that figure at 15 to 20 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4414"> 4414 </A></B>
<P>
	Even if we take a figure in between, the lost revenues are still 
enormous. That is why we should tackle this problem seriously 
and with determination, of course, because it is quite an 
endeavour. We cannot afford a commission on taxation that will 
take five years to analyze the problems of five years ago, since 
its report would already be out of date because of all the things 
that happened in the meantime.
<P>
	Basic principles on tax reform have been established and 
analyzed in the past; they are still valid except that we would, of 
course, have to improve some technicalities behind all this.
<P>
	A few cases in point, Mr. Speaker. We have long said that 
family trusts that shelter large amounts from the tax man must 
be looked at very closely. I do not want to get into details 
because we will have the opportunity to debate family trusts in 
the finance committee in the fall, or we will at least look at this 
issue. In the meantime, it would be interesting to have the 
information. We are far from certain that the information 
required for a good debate will be available. It will be, once 
again, very difficult. We will argue and disagree on figures 
because they will not be available or because they will not be 
provided far enough in advance.
<P>
	As I know that the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of 
Finance is listening to me, I would like to ask him to supply us 
with data from the family trust study. How much did they cost? 
How much do they represent in lost or deferred taxes in the 
future for the government? It would be interesting to know these 
things.
<P>
	A real minimum tax on corporations has also been talked 
about for a long time. I remember asking the question to the 
Minister of Finance in this House and he told me that it already 
existed and that, if there was no minimum tax, he would be 
happy to introduce one. Upon checking, I learned that it is not so 
simple.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	The minimum tax is on capital. It can seem like a minimum 
tax except that there are all sorts of ways to reduce it or cancel it 
so that it is almost zero or even zero. There goes the concept of 
minimum tax then. Also, it applies only to those with assets or 
capital investment of $10 million or more. What happens to 
those who do not have that much in assets but who do a 
considerable amount of business?
<P>
	We could mention medium-sized businesses in general or big 
businesses with less in assets. This is an interesting problem to 
explore if we want to have a minimum tax. You do not have to be 
on the far left to advocate it. The Americans under Mr. Reagan 
had a minimum corporate tax after a commission investigated it; 
Mr. Reagan is not known as the greatest socialist in American 
history, but he decided to bring in a minimum corporate tax.
<P>
	Turning to the bill itself, I would like to tell you that we have 
no major objections because some of the measures are already in 
effect, as for registered savings  plans, for example, in order to 
improve what already existed or to correct deficiencies in the 
law. There are some more substantial things, but they are mainly 
very technical improvements to the Tax Act and measures to 
protect the department from misinterpretations of tax law.
<P>
	We will give our consent, we will endorse this bill, while 
reminding that we would like to take a much more thorough look 
at the whole tax system; tax measures should be considered 
sooner and care should be taken so that legislation is not passed 
from one Parliament to another or one session to another and 
slow to come before Parliament. It should be possible to have 
debates that are more current, in line with the new government's 
concern for openness and efficiency.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that we will support Bill C-27. We still 
insist that the department, the minister and the government 
review the whole tax system and the whole Tax Act in order to 
improve substantially what already exists and restore 
confidence in the way revenue is collected from taxpayers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
support Bill C-27. However, the bill shows that the Liberal 
Party still has nothing new to offer Canadians even after six 
months behind the wheel of this Chevy government. In fact 
many of the provisions date back to finance minister 
Mazankowski and the Mulroney era.
<P>
	During the election Canadians were promised change, new 
directions, ideas and initiatives. What they are receiving are 
rehashed housekeeping bills that have been kicked around since 
the Tory days, lumped together and packaged as new and 
improved.
<P>
	It is bills like this that show members of the Reform Party that 
the Liberals may have the people but they most certainly do not 
have the plan.
<P>
	The sheer size and complexity of this bill is symbolic of what 
is wrong with our entire taxation system. The title reads an act to 
amend the Income Tax Act, the Income Tax Application Rules, 
the Canada Pension Plan, the Canada Business Corporations 
Act, the Excise Tax Act, the Unemployment Insurance Act and 
certain related acts.
<P>
	The explanatory notes alone almost outnumber the 
amendments. Bill C-27 covers everything from the tax 
treatment of automobile operating costs to minerals in the 
mining industry. It is one inch thick. Once passed it will add 
more rules, regulations, subsections and pages to the overall 
complex, confusing and convoluting Income Tax Act.

	Let me read something from the Income Tax Act and see if 
we can understand it after we are finished. Section 23(1)

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to join with 
the House in thanking the member for that clarification.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I will be here for a year. 
The Income Tax Act has become nothing more than a job 
security program for tax accountants like my hon. colleague, tax 
lawyers and the bureaucracy.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act has lost its focus as a guideline for tax 
collection and governments now rely on it to dictate social 
policy. Recently I was at a Standing Committee on Finance 
meeting listening to witnesses on Bill C-17 which deals with the 
UIC program. The leader of the National Action Committee and 
the leader of the provincial Conservative Party of New 
Brunswick said that UIC and CAP are becoming more 
co-mingled and they reject the merging of UI and social 
assistance.
<P>
	In fact, one witness described UIC as an expensive social 
assistance program which for many is a mainstay of their annual 
income. The end result is a bureaucratic nightmare that does 
little to solve the problems that many people face. Look at the 
problems that have been created in the area of child support 
payments. The principles of taxation that are upheld within the 
act are not responsive to the changes that have occurred in our 
society.
<P>
	By continually amending the act, governments have buried its 
usefulness to the public in a bureaucratic quagmire. However 
just because the Income Tax Act has lost touch with reality does 
not mean that the government has to follow suit.
<P>
	I would like to try once again to bring the Chevy government 
up to speed on the reality of our current economic situation. 
Government overspending is the number one problem facing the 
country and can no longer be put on the back burner only to be 
reheated at election time.
<P>
	By adding $3 billion to current spending, by relying on the 
national infrastructure program solely as a means to kick start 
the economy, by gambling with low rate projections for interest 
rates, the government has embarked on a very dangerous, 
precarious and weak game plan for Canadians because all of the 
above adds to our problems, the deficit and the debt.
<P>
	Operating on borrowed money is nothing more than deferred 
taxation. This Chevy government, like older model cars, has 
remained as a big gas guzzler continuing the trend of spending 
more money than it takes in.
<P>
	As interest rates and payments go up, so too will the need for 
new sources of revenue. Instead of spending cuts and living 
within its means, the Liberal government is using the Income 
Tax Act to subtly squeeze out extra dollars from small groups in 
our society without alerting the majority of Canadians.
<P>
	The Department of National Revenue recently used 
unenforced rules. They were in the rules but it had not enforced 
them for three to four years. The department revoked the 
overseas tax credit which provides incentives for Canadian 
industries to go after foreign contracts. Not only were they 
eliminated, but it made the decision retroactive to 1993, 1992 
and for 1991. This is not fair to the businesses.
<P>
	We believe that the Income Tax Act should be simplified and 
used solely as a means to collect necessary revenues to fund 
government programs. Government can then decide the 
programs that are to be legislated and do so outside the Income 
Tax Act. Enough with the 2,400-plus page act. Let us move 
toward a simplified tax system that serves a simple and single 
purpose, to collect revenue. A Reform income tax system, a 
party that has vision and some ideas for the future, would 
implement a uniform rate to replace current graduated rates and 
introduce simplicity, a one page return that is understood by all 
taxpayers; equality, where people feel that everyone is treated 
the same; visibility, no more need for tax loopholes and 
incentives; effectiveness, because it would draw people back 
from the underground economy.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	The system would tax people in proportion to their income, 
family situation and ability to pay. There would be no longer a 
need for a federal consumption tax. No GST. I know some 
members opposite appreciate that philosophy because they have 
expressed it in the Standing Committee on Finance. Those are 
the bright Liberals.
<P>
	Here is how it could work. This is a one page system. On one 
side we have personal income and on the other side the 
corporate. Both sides, personal and corporate, pay the same 
relative share. That has a lot of merit. Personal tax and corporate 
tax 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4416"> 4416 </A></B>
<P>
would be set at a rate of 15 per cent or 20 per cent once it is 
determined how many dollars the federal government needs to 
pay for social and economic programs and the cost of 
maintaining this upscale size of government.
<P>
	If we really need 44,000 people in the Department of National 
Revenue and Taxation then we have to raise the money to pay for 
it. The initial rate would be revenue neutral but it is expected 
that with more people and corporations paying taxes, revenues 
will be higher and we could apply this surplus directly to the 
deficit and debt.
<P>
	I ask members of all parties to examine the idea. I know I am 
not the only one who believes that the income tax system can be 
simplified and that a uniform system of tax can work far more 
effectively than the current system. However, if we do not 
believe in the one simple philosophy that nobody likes taxes, 
and they always talk about a fair tax, but the only tax that is fair 
is if everybody pays the same. That is a little encouragement, a 
little inducement for the government to have the political will 
when it is considering the replacement for the GST. It should 
look at it and make sure it does not keep it complicated, 
confusing or convoluted. The only way it can do that is to tax 
everybody on everything the same and solve the problems that 
creates in other ways.
<P>
	Rather than making the Income Tax Act thicker with Bill 
C-27, I urge the government to show some initiative, make the 
changes that Canadians have demanded, scrap the Income Tax 
Act altogether. Just get rid of it.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> You like the humour, I hear, over on the other side 
of the House. It is the only way I can get attention around here.
<P>
	A flat system of taxation will lead to a lower overall tax rate, 
shared fairly by corporations and individuals, a simplified 
system, and finally create an opening for government to 
legislate social programs that are more in tune with the realities 
facing Canadians.
<P>
	I call on the Liberal government to make the major reforms 
that are needed in government spending, taxation and the 
bureaucracy. No more tinkering with legislation or nibbling at 
the deficit. If this Chevy government fails to make necessary 
reforms and respond to the changes that have occurred in this 
great country then it will meet the same fate as the previous 
government which, as we all know, was downsized from a big 
Cadillac to an obsolete Pinto.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, please excuse my haste. I am not 
known for that usually on these measures.
<P>
	I believe there is unanimous consent in the House to proceed 
to committee of the whole right now for consideration of clause 
by clause study of this bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>

<P>

<P>

whole on Bill C-27, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the

<P>
	On Clause 1:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you will see that there is 
unanimous consent to call all clauses of this bill as one group.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B> The House has heard the 
secretary of state. Is it the wish of the House to adopt as one 
group clauses 1 through 139?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Clauses 1 to 139 inclusive agreed to.)
<P>
	(Title agreed to.)
<P>
	(Bill reported and concurred in.)
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> When shall the bill be 
read a third time? By leave, now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that the 
bill be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, while we 
allowed the bill to pass through the committee stage without real 
debate I would like to echo the remarks of the previous speaker 
on two points. Number one, we are dealing with some 
amendments that were announced by press conference as far 
back as December 1992. That was a year and a half ago and the 
House has only be asked to deliberate these items today.
<P>
	The Reform Party would like to see some improvements in the 
way this government and this House are run. I think from now on 
any time we find material being brought to this House for our 
consent, 18 months after it has been introduced by press 
conferences no less, we would take an entirely different point of 
view.
<P>
	This House has the privilege of passing legislation. As far as 
the Income Tax Act is concerned, as we know, many people have 
made decisions based on these proposals that we are being asked 
to implement into law today. To go back and have that all 
changed would make it almost an impossible situation for the 
people of this country to try to figure out their taxes. Therefore 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4417"> 4417 </A></B>
<P>
let us put this government on notice now that this type of long 
delay will not be tolerated from now on.
<P>
	The other thing the previous speaker from the Reform Party 
said concerned the complexity of this document. The Income 
Tax Act is far too complex, far beyond the comprehension even 
of many tax experts and lawyers, far less the average Canadian 
on the street. When it comes to fairness in taxation not only 
should a tax be reasonable in amount but also a taxpayer should 
be able to understand on what basis he is being taxed.
<P>
	The way this Income Tax Act has become over the years is far 
beyond the comprehension of many Canadians as to how the 
government levies taxation in this country. This government 
would be well advised to simplify the Income Tax Act and take 
that as an ongoing project. No doubt at the speed at which it is 
introducing legislation in this new government it will take many 
years. We will leave that for another debate on another day.
<P>
	Another point I would like to mention is regarding the 
taxation of life insurance companies. I understand that their 
taxation may be a little different than others. One of the points 
that was made was that insurance companies pay an appropriate 
level of federal tax. I was a little taken back by the words 
``appropriate level of federal tax''.
<P>
	It seems this government and governments today have this 
idea that everybody who makes a dollar has to share it with the 
government, rather than the government saying it needs to 
collect revenues to pay for the services it delivers to Canadians. 
We have moved away from that. The fact is we are obligated to 
share a larger and larger share and now it is almost a majority 
share of what a person earns. It has to be taken by government in 
this country. That whole attitude I think is indicative of one of 
the reasons this country is in the financial mess it is today.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	One of the items in the bill is the simplification of income tax 
treatment of automobile operating costs. It took the government 
a whole year before it could rewrite the rules regarding the 
simplification of automobile costs. Even today under the new 
rules to ask somebody to understand the simplified rules is 
complex, except for one thing; namely, you can work on a very 
simple rule provided you give more than what would be your 
normal share to the government.
<P>
	If you are driving a company car and you use that for a small 
portion of your private travel, provided you pay taxes on half the 
cost of that automobile, even if you only use it for 10 per cent or 
20 per cent or 30 per cent of the time for private business, they 
will let you take a simple 50 per cent of the cost and pay taxes on 
that amount.
<P>
	It puts the onus on the taxpayer to keep the detailed method, 
otherwise he is being hosed by the government. This attitude 
again is endemic and goes back, as I said, to the life insurance 
company; pay your appropriate level of taxes, make sure you 
share your profits with us, and as far as taxpayers using 
automobiles is concerned, provided  you pay more than what 
you would otherwise do you can use a simple method of making 
your calculation.
<P>
	The whole system, the whole attitude toward payment of 
taxes, the collection of taxes by the government I think has to 
change.
<P>
	These are the concerns that we have. As I say, 12 to 18 months 
is far too long for legislation to be presented in this House.
<P>
	Taxpayers are expected to know the Income Tax Act, which is 
now beyond their comprehension. The other thing is that if you 
take a look at the Income Tax Act as published, remember it does 
not have many of these things that are being proposed today and 
passed into legislation today. Many of these things pertain to 
last year, 1993 tax returns. How is the taxpayer expected to 
know really how he is supposed to prepare his tax return for 
1993, which should have been filed by April 30, a month ago, 
when we are only setting the rules today? That is the type of 
situation that has to change.
<P>
	I will close there and hope that this government will take these 
points under advisement. Then we will not have to go through 
this process of 18 months after the fact approving legislation.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the third time and passed.)

	The House resumed, from April 18, 1994, consideration of the 
motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should permit Members of 
the House of Commons to fully represent their constituents' views on the 
government's legislative program and spending plans by adopting the position 
that the defeat of any government measure, including a spending measure, shall 
not automatically mean the defeat of the government unless followed by the 
adoption of a formal motion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to give the floor at this time to the hon. member for Beaver River 
and, with your permission, speak after her.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
appreciate this chance to speak to Motion No. 89 and I also 
appreciate my colleague's good will to let me get on to another 
function as soon as I am done.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to lend my wholehearted 
support to this private member's motion, Motion No. 89, put 
forward by my friend and colleague from Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
	This whole thing deals with the idea of free votes and I would 
like to preface my remarks by saying something that probably 
all of us in this House know, and that is that Canadians are 
seeking dynamic and constructive change in their political 
institutions. Canadians are asking for political representatives 
who will listen to them-it would be a marvellous change to 
have political people listen rather than talk all the time-who 
will consult with them, who will respond to them, and then will 
come to Parliament and represent their views.
<P>
	We in this 35th Parliament have the opportunity as well as the 
responsibility to examine the concerns expressed by Canadians. 
For example, we can determine the deficiencies in the way we do 
business in this institution and then seek to improve the process 
to bring about constructive change.
<P>
	The exercise of freer voting through relaxation of the 
confidence convention would be a great first step. Freer voting 
would be a progressive and constructive change in  the way we 
do business in this institution. Freer voting would encourage 
more consultation with constituents, thus strengthening the link 
between the individual representatives and their electors. Freer 
voting will allow ordinary members to demonstrate 
independence of thought and give them greater influence in 
committees and in the House.
<P>
	Members' views, particularly on the government side, will be 
given greater weight by cabinet and constituents will realize that 
they too have a stronger voice.
<P>
	Freer voting is only one of several sensible, pragmatic, 
progressive parliamentary reforms that this House should adopt 
to improve the quality of representative democracy in this 
country. We will serve Canadians well if we adopt this motion 
by my friend from Mission-Coquitlam during this Parliament.
<P>
	It is easy to say we are changing the standing orders, we are 
making all kinds of things different to make sure that members 
are better heard, and yet we hear stories already about the 
backbench blues from the government side, realizing that the 
way the system is set up right now we are not able to have 
backbenchers have real, solid, significant input to the whole 
political process, that cabinet makes all those decisions.
<P>
	Let us look at the historical perspective of it for a moment. I 
have attempted to do some modest reading on the evolution of 
parliamentary government in Canada to gain a better 
understanding of why ordinary members, particularly on the 
government side, have become so inconsequential in the 
development of legislation and have become trapped in the iron 
cage of party discipline.
<P>
	I was delighted to find that in the British House of Commons 
in the mid-19th century members acted in a highly 
individualistic way. Private bills were common, legislation 
introduced by cabinet members was often amended or defeated 
without the fall of the government. It would be so refreshing in 
this House to see that there was a vote taken and that cabinet 
members perhaps voted against something, or backbenchers 
voted against a cabinet member's legislation which would not 
mean the defeat of the government; it would just mean the defeat 
of that particular piece of legislation.
<P>
	Our Parliament is fashioned after the British parliamentary 
system and in the early days of our Parliament political parties 
were relatively loose associations of like minded people and it 
was not uncommon for members to vote against the party line. 
Party leaders spent much time seeking support for proposed 
legislation and there was continued dialogue between the party 
leadership and the backbench members. A political career was 
possible without the backing of a political party.
<P>
<B></B>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="4421"> 4421 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	If you go ahead to the present from the past you see how 
different things have become in this very Chamber. It is one 
thing to talk about the political institutions in Canada and about 
how things were way back then, but this is the same place we are 
standing in today and we realize how important it is for MPs in 
this day and age to be backed by a political party. It was not 
always this way.
<P>
	Political parties now have become the dominant actors in the 
political process. They provide the identity for candidates, the 
research and policy development process and they have the 
ability to raise taxpayer supported funds, necessary in large 
amounts today as we all know to fight an election campaign. 
Once elected an MP cannot function effectively without the 
support of a political party. Maybe there are things to be learned 
and gained from the past.
<P>
	This growth of political parties and their importance to 
aspiring or elected politicians has enabled them, the parties, to 
exercise strict discipline. Those who speak out against party 
policy or vote against the party line are disciplined. Witness the 
last Parliament, Mr. Speaker, in which you and I sat. At least 
four members were publicly disciplined or expelled by their 
parties.
<P>
	How well I remember the whole situation in 1990 when a 
couple of members crossed the floor. They had voted against the 
GST, the government line, and were banished from the caucus 
within 24 hours. I laugh always and say they were given the 
worst fate possible from the government: They had to sit beside 
the member for Beaver River in the very back row. How times 
change.
<P>
	The present situation is succinctly stated by C.E.S. Franks in 
his excellent work entitled <I>The Parliament of Canada</I>, 1989 
edition, page 110:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Disciplined parties are necessary for responsible government, but it is 
difficult to escape the conclusion that discipline is excessive at present. A 
terribly high price is paid both in terms of bringing Parliament into disrepute 
and in terms of restricting the contribution individual members can make in 
Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As I have come to know some of the members, certainly not 
all of them, I am impressed with the amount of individual talent 
and individual skill members possess in this House. It upsets me 
that we are not able to utilize that to the fullest because of the 
excessive party discipline.
<P>
	During the last 30 years there have been all kinds of studies, 
forums and committees on parliamentary reform. Many 
recommendations have been implemented concerning the use of 
Parliament's time, the timetable for business of the House, 
standing orders, rules of debate, et cetera. Several of them have 
discussed the confidence convention and the role of members.
<P>
	Rather than just tinkering with the standing orders or talking 
about generalities we should look at the most significant and 
specific of these. That of course is the special committee on 
reform. It was an all-party  committee chaired by the Hon. 
James McGrath which tabled its report in this house in 1985.
<P>
	The McGrath report stated that if members are to exert 
influence over policy making in committees or in the House 
itself, they will have to be able to demonstrate independence of 
thought. Again I say how refreshing that would be to see 
independence of thought in this place where individual members 
were able to have real input rather than for example, a 
government backbencher being told: ``That's fine, thank you. 
Cabinet will discuss it and make its decision''.
<P>
	They argued in the McGrath report that the only thing which 
stands in the way of the exercise of independence is the need for 
a change in attitude on the part of government. It was not the 
need for a change in fancy rules, the laws or the constitution of 
country, but just a change in the attitude of party leaders and 
private members.
<P>
	This change in attitude would lead to a reduction in party 
discipline. It would demonstrate that unquestioned obedience to 
the party line is not the only route to advancement in the party. 
Let me digress by saying that unquestioned obedience is 
expected in a German Shepherd, not in a member of Parliament. 
We need a change in attitude that would allow members to vote 
as their constituents wish which at times is against the wishes of 
the leadership without fear of reprimand or punishment.
<P>
	The McGrath committee made other recommendations which 
called for a change in attitude by the government and all 
members in this House from all sides.
<P>
	An important change was with respect to the election of the 
Speaker. The committee recommended that the Speaker cease to 
be appointed by the Prime Minister. Rather, he or she would be 
elected by secret ballot of the members. All of us in this House 
have experienced the positive change which was brought about. 
The Prime Minister of the day, the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney, 
allowed that change to take place.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	In this the 35th Parliament, we had one of the most exciting 
days of this entire parliamentary term when we saw the election 
of the Speaker for this House in January. Changes are possible 
and we are excited about that.
<P>
	My colleague's resolution is of similar scope. Modest in 
concept in what it proposes, it asks only for a change in attitude 
from all members in this House, all backbenchers, opposition 
parties, government, cabinet and the Prime Minister. A change 
in the attitude to the confidence convention and a change in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4422"> 4422 </A></B>
<P>
attitude to the independence of members are what we 
desperately need now. It is not a large request.
<P>
	Also relevant of course are the 1991 speech from the throne, 
and the 1991 constitutional proposals in the booklet entitled 
``Shaping Canada's Future Together'', which of course was the 
map work, design and the beginning of the proposals for the 
Charlottetown accord. They noted even though those proposals 
were defeated soundly there were good things in them. They 
noted that excessive party discipline and excessive partisanship 
are factors which erode the public's confidence in their 
representatives.
<P>
	The House management committee in its report of April 1993 
suggested there be some reform of party discipline and endorsed 
the idea of freeing up voting in the House: ``With few 
exceptions, motions proposed by the government should be 
considered as motions of confidence only when clearly 
identified as such by the government''.
<P>
	The issues have been identified and discussed many times. 
Solutions have also been identified and discussed. Let us in this 
35th Parliament take some action. Let us move ahead and adopt 
the motion in front of us.
<P>
	Finally, let me say that even the Liberal red book which was 
campaigned on in this past election talked about freeing up 
votes. It is going to be just marvellous to see the government 
support this motion. Hopefully it will not just be something in 
the red book, but will be something which is transferred into this 
green Chamber. The government and opposition parties will be 
able to say: ``We sat in that 35th Parliament of Canada where we 
made real substantive changes and reforms to the way politics 
are done in this country. We saw real parliamentary and 
democratic reform actually happening''. We look forward to 
that and we appreciate the government's support on this matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate on the motion standing before 
us which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should permit Members of 
the House of Commons to fully represent their constituents' views on the 
government's legislative program and spending plans by adopting the position 
that the defeat of any government measure, including a spending measure, shall 
not automatically mean the defeat of the government unless followed by the 
adoption of a formal motion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, the votable motion of the hon. member for 
Mission-Coquitlam suggests that members will be called upon 
to speak on the matter of confidence and thence, on the question 
of free votes.
<P>
	Moreover, I already rose to speak on the matter in conjunction 
with the debate on free votes and in keeping with what I said, I 
would like to make two observations at the outset. When I read 
the text, two things caught my attention and left me with some 
serious doubts as to the relevance of this motion.
<P>
	The motion starts off by saying that the government should 
permit Members of the House to fully represent  their 
constituents' views. One has to wonder why a member would 
not now be representing the interests of his constituents. What 
the motion is really saying is that a member who does not vote 
according to the party line is not representing the interests of his 
constituents.
<P>
	If we follow this logic, we can only conclude, first, that the 
election platforms of political parties do not have universal 
support and, second, that constituent views vary from one riding 
to the next.
<P>
	This view of political reality is absurd and purely fictional. 
Let us not forget that political party platforms are aimed at 
getting as many voters as possible to embrace the same ideology 
and to share the same social, economic and political vision of 
community organization, be it municipal or regional.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	It should also be noted that this perception of reality negates 
regional realities. For example, the electorate who voted for the 
Bloc Quebecois represents a regional entity that shares a certain 
geopolitical vision of that part of North America known as 
Quebec. How can a reality such as this be denied?
<P>
	The second part of the motion deals with the principle of 
confidence which underlies our parliamentary system and the 
concept of responsible government. In accordance with this 
principle, the party forming the majority in the House of 
Commons must be able to demonstrate that it enjoys the support 
of the majority of the members in the House.
<P>
	In a majority government situation, this is seldom a problem, 
except when the majority is very slim. In a Parliament with a 
government in command of a majority, the matter of confidence 
has really been settled by the electorate. Consider the last 
election. The province of Ontario enabled the Liberal Party of 
Canada to capture an overwhelming majority of seats in the 
House. Which means that the government party is strongly 
represented in this province.
<P>
	Why then should the scope of this principle be weakened, as 
the motion seems to want to do, if in a parliamentary system, the 
matter of confidence has only a minimal effect on the way in 
which House business is conducted? In view of these facts, the 
Bloc Quebecois has some difficulty understanding the relevance 
of such a motion and supporting it.
<P>
	Before touching more specifically on the Bloc's position with 
respect to Motion No. 89, I would like to draw the House's 
attention to a very timely observation made by the Standing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4423"> 4423 </A></B>
<P>
Committee on House Management which appeared in the 
committee's April 1993 report on parliamentary reform.
<P>
	The report stated the following, and I quote: ``Each party has 
to make its own decisions as to whether and when free votes are 
to be allowed-it is not up to the House, or to other parties. 
There is no single definition of what constitutes a `free vote': 
one can see it in terms of a Member's conscience, a Member's 
role in reflecting majority opinion in his or her riding, whether 
the Member's party caucus has taken a position or decision on 
the issue or not''.
<P>
	No, there is no single definition of what a free vote is and we 
cannot really have such a thing in the House of Commons. The 
political environment is changing and is never really the same 
from one election to the next. How could we have such a rule for 
a Canada which is so divided, where the very existence of a 
single nation is challenged by at least a fifth of the population? 
Under these circumstances, again, it is hard for us to support this 
motion.
<P>
	We have said many times that the Bloc Quebecois has no 
mandate at all from its constituents to reform federal 
institutions; its mandate is to defend Quebec's interests in the 
House of Commons according to parliamentary rules and 
traditions. We do not believe that having free votes in the House 
could be in Quebecers' interest, since we think that it could 
diminish the opposition's ability to call the government to 
account.
<P>
	Nevertheless, members of the Bloc Quebecois are fully aware 
of the value for democracy of having the citizens' 
representatives vote freely in the nation's legislative assembly. 
If anything gives backbenchers their freedom, it is free votes.
<P>
	Less party discipline is undoubtedly an effective way to 
increase a backbencher's autonomy. Having members vote 
freely in the House on a daily basis would necessarily involve a 
redistribution of political power in Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	Of course, we consider free votes for members of the House of 
Commons to be utopian and in the present Canadian context, we 
have trouble imagining a situation where all members could 
express their own political vision of their society, without any 
search for consensus or any reflection of regional reality.
<P>
	Nevertheless, let me say in closing that the election results of 
last October 25 are in a way the expression of a free vote by 
some two million Quebecers who, by electing 54 representatives 
from the Bloc Quebecois, stated their dissatisfaction with the 
old parties. We know that these voters have had it with the 
Canada-wide politics of the Liberal and Conservative parties 
and gave the Bloc Quebecois a mandate to achieve sovereignty 
for Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to participate 
in this debate on Motion M-89, which reads as follows: 
``That-the government should permit Members of the House of 
Commons-''
<P>
	I have a question to ask right away. We just had a vote in this 
House 15 minutes ago. The Reform Party voted as a group, as 
did the Bloc Quebecois. Which party had a free vote? It was the 
government and not the opposition. So the motion should be 
rephrased and say instead that the opposition should allow free 
votes. The government has already done so. The government 
made that promise in the last election campaign, and delivered 
on it in this House no more than 15 or 20 minutes ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bonin:</B> Another promise kept!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Another promise kept, as my hon. colleague 
from Nickel Belt so eloquently said.
<P>
	There is another problem. The motion goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-including a spending measure, shall not automatically mean the defeat of the 
government unless followed by the adoption of a formal motion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am sorry to disappoint those who tabled the motion but we 
have already made this change to our rules. It did not happen 
yesterday but on December 20, 1984. I realize that the Reform 
Party is a little behind sometimes. Nevertheless, the date was 
December 20, 1984, and this is what Beauchesne, sixth edition, 
page 49, has to say on this:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The determination of issue of confidence in the government is not a question 
of procedure or order, and does not involve the interpretive responsibilities of 
the Speaker. Following the recommendations of the Special Committee on 
Standing Orders and Procedure, as well as those of the Special Committee on the 
Reform of the House of Commons (December 20, 1984), the House removed 
references in the Standing Orders which described votable motions on allotted 
days as questions of confidence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would suggest this has existed informally from time 
immemorial, with the exception of opposition day motions and 
even in the case of opposition day motions since December 20, 
1984.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The members opposite know full well, I am sure, that the 
defeat of any bill does not automatically mean the defeat of the 
government. It is the motion of non-confidence and not the bill 
itself which has that effect; the rules are clear on this. So if the 
rules do not provide for such an automatic outcome, I am telling 
you that, in fact, the government or even the House already 
permits the kind of initiative proposed by the hon. member.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4424"> 4424 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is already permitted. There is no need to permit it; it is 
already there. Maybe we should say that we should continue to 
permit it. Would that not be a great idea? Why do we not say 
that?
<P>
	Before I conclude I want to bring another proposition to the 
attention of members of the House about having everything a 
free vote, if that is what some people are thinking. We must 
remember the history of this great country in that regard.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I see the hon. member for Bellechasse who is very 
knowledgeable about Canadian history. I am sure he knows that 
the 1837 rebellion in Upper Canada and Lower Canada was 
largely motivated by a desire for responsible government. What 
that means? It means that a government is defeated when it loses 
the confidence of the House. Our ancestors fought for this 
because it was the ultimate test of democracy when a 
government fell if it no longer had the confidence of the House. 
That was in 1837. Ironically, the British government had offered 
to give us responsible government at the time, but here in 
Canada we did not want it. It took until about 1848 for us to have 
what could be called responsible government in Canada. After 
1837, there was the Durham report, and then it took until 1848.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is interesting that notwithstanding everything we have said 
before today I hear members across saying that responsible 
government with a capital <I>r</I> as we know it in this country seems 
to be something of the past. I do not believe so.
<P>
	I believe the Prime Minister and his cabinet are there as 
ministers only so long as I and my colleagues around here allow 
them to remain the government of the country. Surely if there is 
any test of how democratic a country can be, that is it. All 
members of the House could one day withdraw confidence in the 
government and the government would cease to govern that very 
day.
<P>
	Let it never be said that backbenchers do not have power. That 
is not so. That has never been so, but let us not make this system 
into some sort of an institution where all of us will become 
political eunuchs. That would be wrong.
<P>
	Nevertheless, to conclude, I repeat that some things the 
member is asking, particularly to the effect that spending 
measures in a bill shall not automatically mean the defeat of 
government, is not the case now. It is permitted and we should 
continue to permit it. That being said, I move the following 
motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by inserting between the word ``should'' and the 
word ``permit'' the words ``continue to''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The amendment is 
deemed acceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I speak today 
in wholehearted support of the motion put forward by the 
member for Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
	The motion expresses the importance of having fewer votes in 
the House of Commons considered to be votes of confidence. 
This would ensure that the defeat of a government motion would 
not bring down the government, unless a separate vote of 
non-confidence was passed immediately following the initial 
vote.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	It is important to make the distinction between free votes and 
freer votes. Presently free votes occur when party leaders 
release their MPs from the party line and grant them permission 
to vote according to their conscience or their better judgment. 
However this may not necessarily be a vote for the majority of 
the constituents.
<P>
	Freer votes would mean having fewer non-confidence votes. 
This would enable members to vote when necessary against 
their party but for the majority of their constituents without 
suffering the negative consequences of party discipline.
<P>
	In order to illustrate my support for the motion the following 
three questions must be answered. What is the problem with the 
system now? What changes are needed? How would these 
changes make Parliament operate better. The problem lies with 
the succession of Canadian governments which have taken the 
convention of confidence motions too far, beyond other British 
parliamentary democracies.
<P>
	Legally and constitutionally members of Parliament have the 
right to vote freely in the House now. However the minority 
governments of the 1960s had to enforce tough party discipline 
because voting against the party often led to or at least 
threatened defeat of the government. Members towing the party 
line could count on favoured status within the party. Given these 
two factors there was very little incentive for government 
backbenchers to vote with the majority of their constituents and 
against the government position.
<P>
	This move to a system of top down democracy has 
marginalized the role of backbench MPs. As a result individual 
members of Parliament have been denied input into the direction 
and legislation brought forth by their government.
<P>
	During the 1972 to 1974 Trudeau minority government the 
interpretation of a confidence vote was loosened considerably. 
Trudeau declared that the defeat of a government motion would 
not mean the defeat of the government. As a result he was able to 
remain in power despite defeat of government motions, marking 
a return to the more historic interpretation of the confidence 
convention. Despite this, however, Trudeau maintained iron--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4425"> 4425 </A></B>
<P>
fist control over members of his party to ensure they voted the 
party line.
<P>
	With subsequent governments we have now arrived at an 
interpretation of the confidence convention in which virtually 
all votes are considered to be votes of confidence. Therefore 
changes will be needed in the House in order to make the motion 
we are proposing today work.
<P>
	The tradition of tough party discipline can only be reversed 
with the co-operation of members of all parties. A giant step 
forward can be made, however, if the Prime Minister were to rise 
in the House and state that the defeat of a government bill or 
motion would not automatically defeat the government and, 
unlike Trudeau, relax party discipline. If this happened we 
would be well on our way to bringing about this change.
<P>
	The leaders of the opposition parties must also play a part in 
loosening the stranglehold of party discipline. A change in 
attitude is needed to move away from the opposition mentality 
of automatically opposing everything put forward by the 
government.
<P>
	As Reformers we have worked toward providing constructive 
alternatives whenever possible. This is reflected clearly in the 
process a Reform MP goes through in determining how to vote 
on a particular issue.
<P>
	First, Reformers believe it is the responsibility of each 
member of Parliament to vote the wishes of the majority of his 
or her constituents in all cases. How does an MP know what the 
wishes of the majority are? On important moral issues such as 
abortion, capital punishment and physician assisted suicide, the 
issue should be settled by referendum held at the same time as a 
federal election. Direct democracy is used to determine the 
wishes of the majority and policy should reflect this.
<P>
	Because present and past governments have refused to 
institute referenda as a right on moral issues and on issues 
presented through citizens' initiatives, Reform MPs go to their 
constituents through constituency surveys and vote based on the 
majority view. This is how Reformers will vote in the House on 
the physician assisted suicide issue, for example.
<P>
	On certain other well developed policy issues which were 
presented and debated during the election campaign, MPs will 
assume that a mandate was given at election time and is valid 
unless there are indications to the contrary. On other issues 
which were not campaigned on and in areas where there is not 
well developed policy, the view of constituents can be verified 
in different but appropriate ways. When specific issues require 
an immediate response, like the cigarette tax proposals 
presented by the government, an MP can solicit feedback from 
the constituents through a telephone survey. Broader issues of 
national importance, for example the GST, require more formal 
mechanisms to determine the wishes of constituents.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	When various bills and motions come before the House which 
are not moral issues or when there is not sufficient time to make 
a survey of constituents,  Reformers measure the pros and cons 
of the proposed bill or motion by asking themselves how it fits in 
with the party platform and principles. We ask ourselves the 
following questions as well. How much does it cost? Is it 
needed? Can we do it for less? The answers to all of these 
questions determine how we will vote on a given issue.
<P>
	MPs will vote in the House of Commons based on the outcome 
of the caucus vote unless they have determined by the 
appropriate mechanism that their constituents want them to vote 
otherwise. In such a case the majority wishes of the constituents 
always prevail.
<P>
	On issues such as reducing government spending, justice 
reform and making the political system more democratic there 
will usually be party solidarity. On other issues opinions may 
vary and a split Reform vote will occur in the House. This 
process certainly helped to overcome some of the problems 
caused by the current over zealous interpretation of the 
confidence convention, but not all of them.
<P>
	The motion we are debating today would help change the 
current mindset that enforces toeing the party line because the 
incentive of forming a new government as a result of a defeated 
government bill or motion would no longer exist.
<P>
	Once the House is rid of this burden it would enable each 
member of Parliament to freely voice the views of their 
constituents without fear of party discipline if they contradict 
the party line.
<P>
	I believe this will foster more meaningful debate. It will lead 
to more informed decisions which genuinely reflect the views of 
the majority of Canadians and ultimately result in better 
legislation.
<P>
	Therefore, when members of another party vote against their 
party line it should be applauded as a sign of strength rather than 
viewed as a sign of party weakness or a weak link in the party.
<P>
	Canadians have become truly disillusioned with government 
because members of Parliament often vote the party line against 
the majority view of their constituents.
<P>
	I realize that when Canadians vote for an individual they are 
also supporting some of the platform the individual and the 
party ran on during the election campaign. However, it is 
unrealistic to believe that any one party, even the Reform Party, 
can accurately reflect the opinions of a majority of people on all 
issues.
<P>
	My question is this. Why should members of Parliament be 
penalized for representing their constituents? The answer is they 
should not. MPs no longer will be penalized through party 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4426"> 4426 </A></B>
<P>
discipline and trust in government will be restored if this motion 
is accepted.
<P>
	In closing there are two questions all members of Parliament 
might ask themselves. First, what negative consequences could 
result from backing this Reform motion which would improve 
the role of individual members and therefore the government as 
a whole? The answer: none, no negative consequences.
<P>
	Second, what negative consequences will result if members 
do not support this motion? Representation will not improve. 
Maybe there will be no immediate backlash from constituents 
but as voters see their wishes betrayed again and again over the 
next four years because members are obliged to toe the party 
line, the answer will be very clear and it will come in the next 
election. I believe it will be the same answer the Conservatives 
received during the last election. Think about it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I speak 
today in support of the motion introduced by my colleague from 
Mission-Coquitlam. I believe members ought to consider three 
propositions relating to the measures she has placed before the 
House: first, that freer votes are needed; second, that freer votes 
are coming; and third, that freer votes should be welcomed.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	I suggest freer votes together with relaxation of the 
confidence convention will allow members of Parliament to 
truly fulfil their responsibility to represent the interests of their 
constituents in Parliament.
<P>
	The strength of our party system is of the utmost importance. 
That is to say party members must act as a team. They must be 
able to stand united behind a clearly articulated action plan. 
Parties must be a source of inspiration. They must ensure that 
MPs do not vote arbitrarily or irresponsibly. That is why we 
must present them with measures which would enable them to 
move the system toward a more direct democracy. Indeed in a 
representative democracy the paramount responsibility of 
elected members is surely to truly represent not only the party's 
interests but also those of their constituents.
<P>
	This is the first of two reasons why I believe freer votes are 
needed. Put in its simplest terms democracy means rule by the 
people, not rule by a Prime Minister, not rule by a Prime 
Minister and cabinet, not rule by elected members belonging to 
a government party, not even rule by all 295 MPs, but rule by the 
people.
<P>
	Regrettably in Canada few would argue that democracy in the 
full sense of government by the people does not exist. As 
Professor Mortimore has written, there is only a crude veto 
power at election time. In the absence of a system that translates 
informed public opinion into policy decisions, manipulative 
insiders will continue to make policy and govern.
<P>
	I believe that democracy is not a fixed imperishable, but a 
dynamic that must be reinvigorated as old conventions grow 
increasingly unable to meet the needs of a changing society.
<P>
	A true commitment to preserve and protect the essence of our 
democratic system, to ensure that we enjoy the reality, not just 
have the label of living in a democracy, is why we must now 
move toward mechanisms like freer votes which will more truly 
empower a better informed and technologically advanced 
public.
<P>
	In addition to our obligation as leaders and elected 
representatives to preserve and promote truly democratic 
government there is a second reason why measures like freer 
votes are needed. The system must change because it has largely 
lost the trust, respect and support of the people it must serve.
<P>
	One need look no further than the results of the last election to 
gauge the anger at the system that prevails in Canada today. It 
would be a mistake to assume that by changing the players in 
this institution the Canadian electorate has exhausted its 
political discontent. The 1993 election was a symptom of the 
disease, not the cure.
<P>
	Unless we ensure that national decision-making is more truly 
reflective of the judgment of Canadians they will continue to 
express their disdain for the decision-making system and for 
their representatives with all the resulting negative 
consequences for our society.
<P>
	I sincerely believe that only reforms to the system will make it 
possible for Canadians to develop new confidence in the way 
they are governed. That is why I believe freer votes are needed 
as a small and necessary step in the process of reform. I also 
believe that free votes are coming.
<P>
	I am a member of a party which is advocating more open and 
accountable government, subject to checks and balances 
controlled by the people themselves. The implementation of 
direct democracy measures such as recall, referendums and 
citizens' initiatives and freer votes is a key element of the 
Reform Party program.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	This is a party that in six short years has already won enough 
support from the public to elect 52 members to represent the 
people of Canada in the House of Commons. However, we 
should be clear that Reformers have not created some sudden 
demand for direct democracy. Rather we are here because the 
demand existed but no traditional political vehicle was willing 
or able to respond to it.
<P>
	The demand has been intense enough to energize Canadian 
citizens like me to devote the enormous amount of time and 
effort necessary to inject an entirely new dynamic into the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4427"> 4427 </A></B>
<P>
political equation. Neither the demand nor the determination to 
meet it is going to go away.
<P>
	In addition, changes are occurring in our society which make 
democratic reforms imperative and inescapable. Citizens are 
focusing increasingly on their rights and demanding that those 
rights be met.
<P>
	In the marketplace now the consumer is boss. Canadians are 
well educated, well travelled and well informed. They recognize 
the increasing degree to which policy decisions do not enjoy any 
broad public support. They comprehend the waste and 
mismanagement in the administration of the country's economic 
affairs and the burden of the huge mortgage that has been placed 
on our future. They are saying: ``If anyone were listening to us 
such poor decisions would never be made. Perhaps it is time we 
got to make some of these decisions''. They are saying these 
things louder and more insistently all the time.
<P>
	Dr. David Elton of the Canada West Foundation has stated that 
we can fight this move toward direct democracy until it sweeps 
us aside or we can work to facilitate it through a thoughtful and 
well managed process. But one way or another, measures like 
freer votes are coming. It is up to us to ensure that this 
irresistible force does not meet immovable MPs because we 
have already seen that immovable MPs can and will be removed.
<P>
	It is only fair to point out that the present Prime Minister has 
shown absolutely no sympathy or understanding for this clear 
desire on the part of Canadians to move toward direct 
democracy. He says he finds the notion of referendums 
repulsive. When presented with a petition signed by tens of 
thousands of voters demanding the right to recall a 
representative who has lost their confidence he says: ``You will 
get your chance in four years and not before''. He says MPs 
should vote as directed by the party they ran as part of and vote 
as directed by their own judgment. Freedom to vote the wishes 
of the constituents who elected an MP to represent them in 
Parliament does not make his list.
<P>
	In fact the government House leader, in proposing changes to 
the rules of the House of Commons on February 7 explicitly 
excluded any mention of free votes, stating that the subject 
cannot be dealt with by the rules. He then spent considerable 
time denying the legitimacy of free votes in Canada's 
parliamentary system, including reference to our constitutional 
legacy from the United Kingdom. What he failed to mention is 
that the United Kingdom's Parliament has enjoyed free votes for 
over 20 years now. He does not explain why this legacy has been 
ignored in our Canadian Parliament.
<P>
	I would like to conclude on a positive note with my third 
proposition that free votes should be welcomed. Canadians, a 
tolerant and forbearing people by nature, remain willing to 
allow their representatives a good measure of latitude in the 
exercise of their own judgment and in support for the program a 
representative's party took to the voters.
<P>
	Surely it is not too much to ask that when the member's own 
judgment or party agenda clearly and demonstrably diverges 
from the broad public consensus in the riding he or she 
represents that it is the constituents' interests which will carry 
the day. If we cannot countenance democracy even to that 
degree, if the views and conscience of one representative must 
always be able to override the interest and conscience of the 
thousands of electors he or she represents, then we ought to be 
honest, admit that we have abandoned the notion of being a 
democratic nation where the people rule and accept that we have 
instead an elected dictatorship.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	Members of this House are glad to live in a democracy. We 
value and affirm our right as citizens in this democracy to make 
decisions for ourselves regarding our future and the laws within 
which we will conduct ourselves.
<P>
	We recognize that such freedom is meaningless unless we, the 
elected representatives of Canadian citizens, stand ready, 
willing and able to give effect to their rights of 
self-determination by giving effect to their wishes when we 
vote on their behalf.
<P>
	We continue to abrogate the democratic rights of our fellow 
citizens when we refuse to truly represent them for personal, 
partisan or political reasons. My colleague from 
Mission-Coquitlam has provided in her motion a very concrete 
measure by which we can allow our fellow citizens their 
legitimate role in a 21st century democracy.
<P>
	It is a measure long since adopted in other respected 
democracies including our role model of the United Kingdom. 
Only we as members of this House of Commons, this house of 
the people, can be agents of needed change. Will we have the 
courage and commitment to be leaders our constituents can 
count on to put their interests ahead of our party when it comes 
down to a choice?
<P>
	They voted for us. Will we vote for them? I urge members to 
support this motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise in the House to speak in favour of Motion No. 89. I 
would like to thank the member for Mission-Coquitlam for 
bringing this motion to the attention of the House.
<P>
	This motion goes to the very root of many of the fundamental 
problems with the Canadian political system. The motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should permit members of 
the House of Commons to fully represent their constituents' views on the 
government's legislative program-</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4428"> 4428 </A></B>
<P>
	That is part of what the motion states. I believe this to be 
a very important component in relation to parliamentary 
reforms. There are many approaches that one can take in 
discussing the full motion. I would like to perhaps focus on 
what the passage of this motion would mean to MPs who are 
not in government positions or shadow cabinet positions but 
relegated backbenchers and what it actually means to them to 
not be able to participate in government decisions or shadow 
cabinet decisions, et cetera.
<P>
	In other words, I am actually trying to explain to the Liberal 
MPs who find themselves in the backbench row why it is in their 
best interest to support this motion. One thing this motion would 
do is give individual members more authority and more 
responsibility.
<P>
	The agenda of a government would not simply be written by 
the cabinet ministers and the top bureaucrats. If this motion 
were passed, cabinet would have to consult and listen to 
comments from backbencher MPs when drafting legislation.
<P>
	For example, when the 1994 budget was drafted, who actually 
put it together? Were all the members of the Liberal Party which 
is the governing party sought out for advice on what they would 
like to see in the budget or was the budget put together by the 
finance minister and by the people of the finance department?
<P>
	The basic problem here is that the government which drafts 
the legislation and sets the agenda is the ministers. Essentially 
the cabinet is the government. Members of the party that is in 
power which forms the government are almost in the same 
position as those in opposition except that they have fewer 
avenues to express their concerns or voice their opinions.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	Many government party MPs are unfairly relegated to 
obscurity because they are not in a cabinet position. They do not 
have as much opportunity as opposition MPs to ask questions 
during Question Period; there is a greater number of them so 
they have less opportunity to give speeches or to be noticed for 
their efforts. It must be frustrating for the government party 
MPs to be so restricted in what they can actually do to reflect a 
positive change on government. This is something that should 
be changed.
<P>
	Working on committees with members from other parties has 
shown me that there people in all parties with much to contribute 
to this country. Innovative ideas, thoughtful solutions are not 
solely possessed by any party in this House. By opening up the 
process to all members we add much more in terms of ideas, 
proposals and solutions.
<P>
	Instead of the government simply counting on unquestionable 
support of all government party MPs, leaders would have to deal 
with issues and problems in such a way as to achieve consensus.
<P>
	The second positive aspect I want to address is that this 
legislation would enable members to be more responsive to their 
constituents and to the regions where the need arises. There are 
certain issues that cut across party lines and form instead along 
regional or provincial lines; for example, agricultural fishery 
issues.
<P>
	The system of voting along party lines has produced the 
extreme partisanship that currently exists in Canadian politics. I 
believe this partisanship to be largely negative. It creates a 
situation in which the opposition must vigorously oppose 
everything the government does or it is seen as not doing its job.
<P>
	That is not why I entered politics, nor is it why the Reform 
Party came to town. We believe that reformers came to Ottawa 
intent on improving the atmosphere and the workings of 
Parliament. We came here intending not to partake in partisan 
bickering but to provide a constructive alternative to the 
government.
<P>
	By trying to follow this strategy we have been roundly 
criticized, especially by the media. Most comments I read in the 
media seem to think that Reform provides no opposition at all. 
Our lack of opposition is seen because we are not screaming, 
yelling and pounding on desks.
<P>
	Certainly there exists a fundamental difference in political 
philosophies between the Liberals, Reformers and all parties 
and we must be aware of that. That philosophical difference 
should not prevent us all from working together and putting our 
ideas out in the House, or even forming non-partisan coalitions 
to effect some positive change.
<P>
	The more we involve individual MPs in the democratic 
process, the more the people of Canada will become involved in 
the process. The people of Canada understand that their political 
power is essentially limited to a vote every four to five years. 
They understand that the party with the majority of seats forms 
the government which then has up to five years to implement an 
agenda. This results in making people apathetic and cynical 
about the happenings of governments between elections.
<P>
	If the election of 1993 showed us anything it was that the 
people of Canada desperately want their public representatives 
to represent their concerns rather than simply tow party lines.
<P>
	I understand that political parties are essential components of 
our political system and I also understand that we are national 
politicians who must have a national perspective, but our main 
focus as representatives must always be the people who sent us 
here, the people of our ridings. If we do not represent their 
wishes, why do we call ourselves a representative democracy?
<P>
	I urge all members of this House to put aside their 
partisanship when regarding this bill and look at it in terms of its 
attempt to enable individual members of all parties to be more 
effective in representing their constituents. Let us demonstrate 
to the Canadian people that we have learned from the lesson of 
1993 and  respond to their call for a more open and responsive 
Parliament.
