Canada for entry into the United States for the purposes of 
customs, immigration, public health, food inspection and plant 
and animal health, as reported (without amendment) from the

<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the preclearance act is 
a key element in Canada's efforts to modernize our border with 
the United States, while at the same time maintaining Canada's 
sovereignty and protecting the rights and freedoms of travellers 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world we live in is increasingly interdependent, a world in 
which capital, goods and people move ever more freely.  To remain 
competitive we must look outward and think globally.  New 
technologies and modes of transportation increasingly allow us to 
transcend national boundaries.  In this era of just-in-time 
production we must find new and innovative ways of moving people 
and goods while ensuring the safety and security of our border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today over $1.35 billion in trade crosses the Canada-U.S. border 
each day.  There are over 200 million border crossings each year. 
The success of our bilateral relationship with the United States 
hinges on our ability to move people and goods efficiently.  I 
would like to elaborate on how this act will help to modernize 
the management of our border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preclearance is not a new concept.  It was introduced in Toronto 
in 1952 and is currently operating at the Vancouver, Edmonton, 
Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal airports.  It 
allows U.S. border control officers working in Canadian airports 
to determine whether people and goods can enter the United 
States.  In 1974 Canada and the U.S. formalized this arrangement 
under the air transport preclearance agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-22 will provide structure for the existing preclearance 
regime and direct its enforcement.  The bill represents roughly 
two years of negotiations with the United States government.  The 
preclearance scheme is a hybrid which maintains the supremacy of 
Canadian law but also allows the U.S. to administer certain civil 
and administrative matters in designated areas that pertain to 
the entry of persons and goods to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our primary objectives has been to safeguard Canadian 
sovereignty.  This has been accomplished by ensuring reciprocity, 
by making clear that the charter of rights and freedoms and all 
Canadian laws will apply and by ensuring that only Canada 
enforces criminal matters in the preclearance area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the signing of the open skies agreement in 1995 there has 
been a 39% increase in air traffic between Canada and the United 
States.  Many destinations do not have customs and immigration 
inspection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this legislation comes into force, intransit preclearance 
operations will be extended in Vancouver and will be implemented 
in Toronto and in Montreal's Dorval airport.  Other Canadian 
airports with current U.S. preclearance programs will 
subsequently become eligible for intransit preclearance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Intransit preclearance will improve service to international 
transiting passengers, encourage the use of Canadian air carriers 
and airports for travel from Asia and Europe to the United States 
via Canadian airports and foster economic development in airport 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preclearance act is intended to be the basis for agreements 
between Canada and the United States for other modes of transport 
which may include air cargo, road, rail, marine and ferry.  This 
will further revolutionize the way we manage the border by 
creating a virtual border, a border that allows travellers and 
commerce to be processed at their point of departure rather than 
at the physical border.  It will significantly reduce costs and 
increase convenience.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and the United States have a long history of co-operation 
along the world's longest undefended border.  Beyond facilitating 
travel and trade, the preclearance act is a symbol of how we can 
manage the border as a joint asset in the next century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
at the outset I would like to seek unanimous consent to divide my 
allotted 40 minutes with the hon. member for South Surrey—White 
Rock—Langley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, given that this is my 
first opportunity to do so, I would like to begin, on behalf of 
the official opposition, by congratulating the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Ontario and the leadership of Premier Mike 
Harris for the stunning re-election last night against 
overwhelming odds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are thrilled to see that a tax cutting, fiscally responsible 
government has been re-elected in Ontario.  It will certainly 
help to increase transit and free trade.  That is why this bill 
will be much more used under a Mike Harris government in Ontario. 
There will be more economic growth in this province, which will 
mean more trade with our partners to the south and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are watching today on electronic <I>Hansard</I> will 
see that the code of this bill is S-22.  Sometimes they will see 
bills that are C-34 or C-56 and so on.  These different codes 
indicate where the bill has been introduced.  When the bill is 
preceded by a <I>C</I>, it means that it has come in through the 
House of Commons, which is the conventional means of introducing 
a bill into parliament.  When the bill is preceded by an <I>S</I>, 
it means that it has been introduced in the other place, the 
so-called upper Chamber.  That would be the unaccountable, 
unelected, patronage haven a few metres down the hall from here. 
This just so happens to be such a bill, Bill S-22, Senate Bill 
22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are joined by the esteemed and newly academically accredited 
government House leader, to whom we extend our commendation.  I 
would like to point out that while he may have extraordinary 
academic credentials, he does not seem very capable of managing 
the legislative agenda of the government through the normal 
democratic conventions of parliament by introducing legislation 
first in the House of Commons.  Instead, he has taken to the 
objectionable practice of introducing bills such as this in the 
other place.  Why?  Presumably because he thinks it is easier and 
because they have so little work to do over there.  They are so 
unburdened by the business of the people that bills can be 
introduced there to expedite their passage through parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to make it clear that the official opposition objects to 
government bills being brought before us in the elected and 
accountable Chamber which have first been introduced in the 
unelected and unaccountable Chamber.  It may just seem to be a 
technical complaint by members of my party, but for us it 
represents a legitimization of an illegitimate upper Chamber 
which ought not to be exercising powers in a modern democratic 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look very closely at every bill that comes before us which is 
first introduced in the Senate.  Our position is to oppose those 
bills simply as a symbol of our opposition to using the Senate as 
a place for the introduction of legislation.  We have not done 
that in this case.  While I have registered my serious objections 
to Senate legislation, we find that this bill is good in its 
intention and that it is a well drafted bill which seeks to 
expedite the intra-transit flow of passengers and goods between 
foreign jurisdictions and Canada en route, for instance, to our 
major trading partner, the United States.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle, the Reform Party of Canada endorses, embraces and 
supports free trade.  We support reducing red tape.  We support 
any measures that would make it more convenient for travellers, 
business people and trade in goods and services to pass into 
Canada and through Canada.  That is the objective of the bill, 
and for that reason we can support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never let it be said that simply because we are in the official 
opposition position we always oppose legislation unthinkingly and 
in a knee-jerk fashion.  That simply is not true.  Members of the 
government would sometimes have people believe that the 
opposition opposes for the sake of opposing.  That is not so.  As 
I understand it, the official opposition has supported roughly 
half of the government bills introduced in this session of 
parliament. Those have mainly been technical bills that have 
achieved incremental advantages and which we have not objected to 
in principle.  This is such a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to make that point very clear because we try to be a 
constructive opposition.  Where we see flaws in legislation, we 
speak up and object to it and do so sometimes very vociferously. 
When we see bills that are supportable, that incorporate common 
sense and are reasonably well drafted, we are prepared to support 
them at all stages.  We do exercise discretion in the way we 
analyze legislation and in what we choose to support and oppose. 
Never let it be said that this official opposition is simply an 
obstructionist opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, when it comes to the tax increase, soft on crime, top-down, 
Ottawa knows best agenda of the government, we do oppose it 
vigorously, as we do with various bills before parliament today, 
but not Bill S-22, an act authorizing the United States to 
preclear travellers and goods in Canada for entry into the United 
States for the purposes of customs, immigration, public health, 
food inspection and plant and animal health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, as the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs indicated, the bill deals with Canada allowing 
the United States to operate preclearance centres in Canada. That 
already is the practice for Canadian travellers travelling 
directly to destinations in the United States.  A case in point 
would be someone travelling through Lester Pearson airport in 
Toronto, which is the airport that had its privatization contract 
screwed up by this government and which cost the taxpayers 
billions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we were travelling through that Liberal white 
elephant en route to the United States, we would present 
ourselves at a U.S. customs desk and would have to pass through 
U.S. immigration. If we were travelling to the United States so 
that we could pay less taxes, we would end up not having to stop 
to clear customs in the United States.  This is advantageous to 
our trading partners, the Americans, because it allows them to 
screen potentially problematic travellers, commercial or personal 
travellers, before they get onto American soil.  It is to their 
advantage in terms of interdicting contraband and interdicting 
illegal immigrants and illegal aliens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also good for Canadians because it expedites our passage. 
It is very quick.  We get checked in at the airline counter and 
within a few minutes we pass through American customs and 
immigration and are essentially in a legal no man's land until we 
arrive in the United States.  However, we are able to walk off 
the plane there and away we go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For tens of thousands of air travellers, this preclearance, 
which happens at most of our international airports, is certainly 
a convenient expedition of travel.  It saves time and therefore 
saves money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would essentially expand that.  It would allow 
in-transit preclearance services.  Suppose we were to arrive from 
Asia at the Vancouver International Airport on Canadian Airlines, 
our preferred airline, we would find, if the bill is passed and 
the elements of it are adopted and implemented, that we could 
pass through this kind of preclearance allowing Canadian 
transportation hubs like Vancouver to increase. 
It would also assist Canadian air carriers.  This is of 
particular importance to Vancouver, which is becoming a major hub 
for international travel.  We want to do everything we can to 
expedite that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the traveller's final destination is Europe or South America 
on a non-stop flight from Vancouver, the passenger can wait in 
the transit lounge until his next flight and not go through 
customs and immigration until his final destination.  That is the 
kind of thing this would allow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to make clear once again that we are distressed to 
see this bill coming from the other place.  We really do object 
to this gratuitous legitimization of an illegitimate, unelected 
Chamber by this constant introduction of government legislation. 
It was a very irregular practice until this House leader and this 
government began to regularize it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are of course going to continue our fight to legitimize that 
upper chamber.  Next week, we will be participating in a rally 
outside the other place, co-sponsored, believe it or not, by 
members of the NDP and the Liberal Party.  The hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle and the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton will 
be co-sponsoring the event with Reformers and concerned Canadians 
who are distressed with the lack of democracy in parliament and 
in the other place in particular.  We will be there and one of 
the things we will be objecting to is this House leader's and 
this government's legitimization of that upper chamber by 
introducing bills there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to say that we will support Bill S-22 here at 
its final stage and hope for its expeditious passage into law so 
that we can increase, and make more convenient, travel for 
Canadians and other passengers through this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is no surprise to any of my colleagues 
that I would be speaking on the preclearance bill.  The movement 
of goods and persons across the Canada-U.S. border is a pet 
project of mine.  I have been working with the Cascadia trade 
corridor project for almost two years now and have appreciated 
the preclearance that has been a pilot project at the Vancouver 
airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I share the concerns of my hon. colleague, that the 
bill should have and could have been introduced through the House 
of Commons rather than the Senate, which is an unelected, 
unaccountable body, I do feel that the legislation is very dearly 
and badly needed to advance the free trade that has been 
developed between Canada and the United States, as well as making 
it easier for our trading partners from countries other than the 
United States and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This preclearance bill will make it much easier for the 
international community to use Canada as a gateway to its trade 
in the U.S. or to use Canada as a gateway from the U.S. back 
home.  It is essential that we make the movement of people, who 
have legitimate business to carry on, or a legitimate desire to 
visit Canada or the United States, as unencumbered as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns people express is that travellers would fall 
under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and this 
preclearance bill addresses that.  It allows American customs and 
immigration officers to have a degree of law enforcement of the 
American act on Canadian soil, but with limitations.  I think 
that would meet the concern that some Canadians have that the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms would be somewhat 
undermined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this preclearance bill does deal with the issue. For 
anyone who is concerned about the heavy arm of the U.S. 
authorities, that would be minimized.  It is not to say that we 
will not see the odd incident that we have seen in the past 
happen, but I think the bill clarifies the role that U.S. 
officials would have in Canada and reciprocally what role 
Canadian officials would have in the United States.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share with Canadians, who might be watching or 
reading <I>Hansard</I> on the Internet, that we cannot 
underestimate the importance of our trade with the United States. 
There is over $1.4 billion worth of trade between Canada and the 
United States every single day.  The free trade agreement 
accounts for about a third of Canada's GDP, which means a lot of 
jobs.  It means a lot of Canadians are working today because of 
the trade arrangement we have with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can also appreciate that part of that ease of trade is 
the ease of movement of persons and goods across the border.  We 
in the House have a responsibility to make sure that everything 
humanly possible is done to make sure that the trade corridors 
have the right infrastructure and the right legislation to allow 
for the movement of trade, people and goods, that will allow this 
free trade agreement with the United States, and potentially our 
NAFTA agreement with Mexico, to reach the potential that is out 
there.  It means jobs for Canadians.  It means an increasing 
standard of living for Canadians.  Hopefully, it means lower 
taxation and a greater awareness of what the North American 
continent has to offer to the international trade community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preclearance act is a start.  My understanding is that this 
preclearance act is primarily for airports.  Although I think it 
is very important that it be started with the air industry 
because it has already shown that it works very well, we, in 
particular on the west coast with Amtrak, would like to see this 
brought in very quickly in terms of looking at train services 
between Canada and the United States.  We could then continue to 
promote the “two nation vacation” concept that is being 
promoted by Cascadia and, I would imagine, other trade corridors 
are also looking at it.  We could then promote the concept of 
international travellers being able to land in our country and 
getting preclearance in any mode of transportation.  This would 
allow our customs and immigration agencies to highlight their 
time and pinpoint their efforts on the 20% of problem cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preclearance allows far more information to be shared with our 
authorities before they transfer across the border.  It allows 
customs and immigration officials at the border to concentrate on 
those individuals who may create the problems that we are all 
concerned about, whether it is illicit drugs, illicit goods or 
illegal immigration flowing across the border.  This would allow 
both Canada and the United States to concentrate their efforts 
and resources on the problem cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully this preclearance will be brought through not only for 
air, but for rail and potentially trucks.  It would be great to 
see trucks enter some kind of preclearance which could take place 
outside of the border corridor or the border infrastructure. What 
we see now is a congestion of trucks and trains having to stop at 
the borders.  This has caused a problem for Canada in trying to 
meet its pollution requirements under its Kyoto obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of pollution is caused by the delay and congestion in the 
movement of people and goods by truck traffic.  A lot of 
pollution we see every day is caused by trucks lining up and 
being put in park or neutral while they wait to proceed either on 
city streets or across the border at various check points. To 
have preclearance for people who are not a problem in an area 
that is not consuming time at a congestion point would be such a 
great thing for the advancement of our trade corridors.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The preclearance act is a good first step.  I am disappointed 
that it came not through the House of Commons but through the 
Senate.  Barring that, I look forward to legislation that will 
broaden the application of the preclearance.  I would like to see 
that it is not too long a time before these kinds of applications 
are added to the preclearance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly this is a first step. I look forward to supporting it 
and to making sure that at the Vancouver airport, at the Amtrak 
station in Vancouver, at the border crossings this kind of 
preclearance is a very effective way of moving not only goods, 
but people so that we can have this two nation vacation.  We can 
have open borders and free trade that benefits all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to start my remarks by pointing out as well that the 
number of this bill is S-22.  People are not aware that most 
pieces of legislation we deal with are numbered C something, C 
and then a number, meaning that bill originated in the House of 
Commons.  S-22 means that it originated in the Senate, in the 
other place, the unelected and as other members have pointed out, 
unaccountable other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me wonder and it is mind boggling that if the 
government wanted to garner the Canadian public's interest and 
support for this bill why it would originate the bill in a place 
that only has the support of 5% of the population.  Recent 
polling shows that a full 45% of the population wants to see the 
Senate radically reformed, the triple E model, elected, 
effective, et cetera.  Another full 40% of Canadians want to see 
the Senate abolished altogether.  They want to see it done away 
with.  There are very few Canadians left who really like it the 
way it is.  Probably the immediate families of senators are the 
only people left who think it is a really good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were serious about having people rally around 
Bill S-22, it should have been a bill with a C number. It should 
have originated in the House of Commons from elected 
representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking to the bill, the preclearance act was introduced in the 
Senate by the deputy leader of the government side in the Senate. 
The bill would provide U.S. federal inspection services with the 
appropriate statutory authority at designated areas in Canada to 
determine what people and what goods would be allowed entry into 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has allowed the U.S. federal inspection services to 
operate air passenger preclearance in Canada since the 1950s. 
This is not really anything new.  It seeks to broaden and expand 
the preclearance situation in the airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP caucus has serious reservations about Bill S-22. We 
recognize, as do members of the other parties who have spoken, 
that it is in the interests of Canadian travellers to be 
processed more quickly and to move more freely through the 
airports if it is only a simple trip to the United States, to our 
main trading partner.  However we should point out a number of 
problems with the bill as it stands. Our caucus hopes to have the 
opportunity to move amendments which I will speak to later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-22 represents a substantial intrusion on Canadian 
sovereignty.  It gives officers of a foreign government the power 
to enforce foreign preclearance laws on Canadian soil.  We 
believe that preclearance and intransit facilities can be 
legislated in a manner that is less intrusive, particularly for 
Canadian citizens and permanent residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have concerns about the legal implications of the bill. 
While some of our arguments were already addressed by amendments 
that have been made earlier, we still have some concerns as it is 
presently drafted.  I would like to go through a few of those in 
the time I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP remains of the view that it is possible to achieve our 
goals with a voluntary rather than a compulsory framework. 
Persons wishing to go to the U.S. could voluntarily submit 
themselves to examination and if necessary search.  If they did 
not wish to undergo that kind of process, they could then 
withdraw their application to enter the U.S. and leave the 
preclearance area.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not believe it is necessary to create Canadian offences 
for resisting the enforcement of foreign laws on Canadian soil. 
As such we believe that clauses 33 and 34 should be removed and 
that clause 10 should be amended to clearly provide that right of 
withdrawal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe it is not necessary to grant preclearance 
officers the power to enforce U.S. laws on Canadian soil.  In 
particular, we see no reason for granting the power to levy 
fines, seize property or to declare it forfeit as per U.S. law. 
Those in favour of the bill are arguing that the U.S. officers 
should have the same powers that they enjoy at land crossings 
where they are operating on American soil.  In this case they 
would not be operating on American soil. We believe this is a 
major difference both legally and geographically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we grant these powers, they can result in enforcement of 
penalties or the forfeiture of goods in Canada for doing things 
which are not against the law under Canadian law.  We are 
granting U.S. officers the right to enforce and penalize 
Canadians on our soil.  We think this is a breach of Canadian 
sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the use of force, we are very concerned about clause 12 
which authorizes preclearance officers to use “as much force as 
is necessary” in order to effect their purposes.  At the very 
least, this section should be modified to add the word 
“reasonably”.  It is common in statutes of this type to use the 
term “reasonable force” and not give carte blanche to use as 
much force as is necessary.  I know it is a fine legal point but 
it does give a lot of latitude to the enforcement officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These foreign officers would have the right to hold people and 
stop people from leaving.  That is a fairly sweeping power to 
grant a foreign officer on our soil.  It means they could detain 
people.  If the officers think people are guilty of breaking a 
law in another country, they could be held, essentially arrested. 
We are granting foreigners powers on our soil which we do not 
think is necessary.  This needs to be reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under that article, clauses 10 and 22 of the bill need to be 
revised because they have a very low threshold for who can be 
detained.  The NDP is very serious about that particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We submit that the test contained in clause 24 is preferable. 
There it has to be belief on reasonable grounds.  Again it is a 
term that would stand up in court if it was tested and 
challenged. This is not present in clauses 10 and 22.  At the 
very least, we want the same test that is given in clause 24, to 
be treated the same way in clauses 22 and 10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On passenger information, there is a whole series of questions 
that people are asked when entering the country.  A lot of it is 
very private information.  What is done with that information? 
How long is it kept? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to keep in mind that we are giving this information to a 
foreign country, not to a Canadian official.  We may not wish to 
have this private information spread around, personal information 
such as health records. We are told that this information will be 
quickly destroyed but we do not know when.  We are not told how 
long this information is kept. Can this information be sold or 
are they bound to keep it private?  We do not have any control 
over that.  Privacy is becoming more and more of an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP remains firmly opposed to the creation of Canadian 
offences for resisting or misleading a foreign preclearance 
officer.  We do not think it should be a Canadian offence to 
mislead a foreign officer about an issue entering a foreign 
country. I suppose they have every right once a person is in 
their country to charge them with offences, but why should it be 
a crime in Canada to knowingly mislead a foreign officer on our 
soil? These are things we have serious problems with.  We want 
clauses 33 and 34 modified to point to those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the NDP caucus that has problems with this.  The 
Canadian Bar Association made a presentation to the committee and 
coincidentally it pointed to many of the same clauses we want 
changed.  The association wants clause 10, clause 12, clause 24, 
clause 28, clause 32(h) and clauses 33 and 34 amended, most of 
which I mentioned in my original concerns.  This is the Canadian 
Bar Association, people who actually know something about this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interests of trying to make travel more convenient for 
frequent travellers, like us and business people who travel a 
lot, we are ready to trample on Canadian sovereignty. Why?  Where 
is the payback in this?  The two things are of completely 
different weight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are willing to give foreign officers the right to penalize 
Canadians under Canadian law for telling them stories that are 
not true. Frankly, it opens up such a can of worms that it should 
be sent back to the other place for them to try again and take 
into consideration such basic things as national pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other group which spoke out very strongly against the bill 
is the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.  It wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view, the bill should not empower the officials of any 
foreign state to detain Canadians against their will, in this 
country, simply for a suspected violation of foreign law. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, I could be arrested by a foreigner in my 
country because he thinks maybe I did something wrong in 
misleading by giving false information.  If he thinks I might 
have some illegal substance on me he is allowed to strip search 
me, do all those things and hold me there against my will.  In 
any event, that is one of their problems. The Canadian Civil 
Liberties Association went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, even if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that any 
Canadians seeking admission to the United States have lied about 
possessing goods that they may not lawfully take into the United 
States—Such Canadians should have a presumptive right to leave 
the preclearance area without travelling to the United States. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, rather than be arrested because the officer 
thinks perhaps I have some contraband, I should at least be 
allowed to leave, to change my mind, “Okay, maybe I will not go 
to the U.S.  If you are going to be so difficult about this, I 
will just leave”.  That would not be allowed.  They could hold 
me there against my will, detained, arrested by a foreign cop on 
our soil.  That is what the Canadian Civil Liberties Association 
has a real problem with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another person who has a problem with Bill S-22 is our own 
Privacy Commissioner of Canada. He wrote a very strong letter. 
Mr. Bruce Phillips, Privacy Commissioner of Canada, wrote to the 
chair of the foreign affairs and international trade committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am writing to express my concern regarding potential privacy 
issues relating to Bill S-22. ...one must not forget the fact that 
customs officers in the course of exercising their duties often 
collect vast amounts of personal information about travellers, 
sometimes of a highly sensitive nature.  As such, I feel it is my 
duty to impress on the Committee the need to ensure that the 
privacy rights of the travelling public are adequately honoured 
and protected under this Bill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has serious reservations that they are being adequately 
honoured under this bill.  Again, as I have pointed out, there is 
no real detail about how long that information can be held and in 
what way that information might be used.  In this electronic age 
our information is at risk all the time.  We dealt with that in a 
previous bill in the House about privacy, electronic information, 
selling of credit card numbers and no end of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the reasons we cannot support Bill S-22. 
Starting with its place of origin, the other place, we disapprove 
of that wholeheartedly.  We have made that clear.  I predict, Mr. 
Speaker, you are going to hear that from all the members on this 
side of the House. The origin of the bill is our first problem 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key problem is clauses 33 and 34. We do not believe it is 
necessary to create Canadian offences for resisting the 
enforcement of foreign laws on Canadian soil.  Also, we would 
like to see amendments to clause 12 which authorizes the 
preclearance officers to use “as much force as is necessary” 
without even adding the word “reasonably” or if there are 
reasonable grounds to think that someone is doing something 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem with clauses 10 and 22, holding people 
against their will.  If I walk into that preclearance area and 
the U.S. customs official, the foreign officer, looks at me and 
says, “It looks to me like you are carrying some kind of 
contraband”, I cannot just turn around and walk out and say, “I 
have changed my mind, this is too much trouble.  I think I will 
go home”. 
The foreign officer can arrest me and detain me.  We certainly 
want that amended.

information and what they intend to do with it.  We need that 
section amended.   As well, we remain firmly opposed to the 
creation of Canadian offences for resisting or misleading a 
foreign preclearance officer.  I have summarized that one 
already.  Unless we see serious amendments to the bill we cannot 
vote for it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise a second time to speak to Bill S-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party supports this bill. We do not share the criticism of 
some of our colleagues in the House that the bill 
comes from the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to Reform members, among others, speaking of the 
other place. They announced that next week our Reform friends 
are to have a social event outside the Senate. We wonder 
whether they will be wearing sombreros. Perhaps they will be in 
bikinis. Who knows. Next week Reform members will be made 
fun of once again in the Senate, so the invitation is open to everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are also saying that people in the country want a complete 
reform of the Senate, even its abolition. It is true that the 
Senate must be reformed. It is also true, I think, that we must 
look at all parliamentary institutions. They quote figures. They 
say that 45% of people in Canada would like the Senate to be reformed. 
Why not? They say that 41% of the people in Canada would like 
the Senate to be abolished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be other polls, but they fail to cite them. If we 
asked 
Quebecers and Canadians what they think about their politicians, 
I am not sure that the rating would be very good. Does that mean 
that we should commit hara-kiri? There must be a minimum of 
credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A credible poll was taken in Ontario—a Reform member was speaking 
of Ontario earlier—not too long ago, which revealed that 91% of 
Ontarians would not vote for the Reform Party. This was the 
latest Gallup poll. In Ontario, 91% would not vote for the 
Reform Party. Does that mean that the Reform Party should 
disappear or be reformed? Perhaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be careful with figures. What I say is that the 
Senate needs not to be dumped on, but co-operation with this 
House and a look at how the system could be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week there was a report on the reduction in the numbers of 
French speaking Quebecers. There are political safeguards in the 
Constitution. The fact that 24% or 25% of senators come from 
Quebec is protection. The fact that one-third of the justices of 
the supreme court come from Quebec is protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must first respect the Constitution, not denigrate it. We can 
make disparaging remarks about the other place, but are we not 
at the same time criticizing this House? We should be very 
careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have a problem with the fact that the bill originated 
in the other place. On the contrary, people in the other 
place, particularly those who belong to my party, proposed 
amendments to Bill S-22, thus making it a very interesting piece 
of legislation. They are asking, among other things, that the 
bill be reviewed in five years. Now this is interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the five-year pilot project, it would be proper and timely 
to review the preclearance system in terms of its effectiveness. 
This system could be very beneficial to the whole country, and 
particularly to Quebec and Canadian travellers, by facilitating 
transportation and trips to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also an economic issue involved. It is said that Canada 
is becoming a gateway to the United States.

experiencing serious problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Having international travellers make a stopover in Canada would 
have a significant economic impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier we talked about free trade. Thank God we signed free 
trade agreements that opened doors for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at second reading of this bill, let us not forget that 
this does a service to Americans. We must not overlook this 
fact. For quite some time now we have been telling Americans 
“Let us facilitate the movement of people from this country”. 
We have been telling them “If ever undesirables want to enter 
the United States”—very few of them Canadians, of course, but 
people from elsewhere—“they will be arrested before they even set 
foot on U.S. territory”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another thing preclearance does.  It has advantages for 
Canada and advantages for the United States.  They tell us 
“Before entering the United States, travellers from all over 
will be stopping over in your country.  You will have the 
economic advantage, but we will have an advantage too.  If they 
do not suit us, we will just hand them back over to you”.  Then 
the Canadian justice system will deal with them.  They will be 
protected by the charter.  The Americans wash their hands of all 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to be said that this is to their advantage.  They will 
have far less trouble dealing with a possibly undesirable 
international clientele, because now it is Canada that will deal 
with it all. 
They will be returned to their country of origin at Canadian 
expense, or be processed through the Canadian legal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the New Democratic Party said “Yes, but the 
Americans are going to apply their own legislation very 
strictly”.  That may be the case, but they will not do it very 
often.  Someone undesirable will simply be turned over to the 
Canadian authorities. We will be the ones stuck with dealing 
with them and expelling them from the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are familiar with the problems often encountered with illegal 
immigrants involved in crime, and how difficult it is to get rid 
of them with all the appeal processes there are here. They will 
come under Canadian jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, there is one interesting aspect for this country. 
This bill casts some light on practices that were already in 
place. It is a bill that comes to us from the other place and I 
must draw attention to the work that was done there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often said that in that other place they do not have much 
to do. If that is so, it is because there is not much happening 
in this place as far as legislation is concerned.  Where is the 
government's vision on legislation?  There is none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main work of the other place is to review, analyse, 
re-examine and possibly amend bills before returning them to us. 
If they have nothing to do in the other place, it is because 
there is nothing much doing here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some top-notch people in the other place, as there are 
many in this House.  There are some so-so people in the other 
place, as there are here too perhaps.  Not many, of course, but 
there are some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us try to focus the energies and strengths that exist in 
this parliament.  Let us also try to improve what is being done 
and how it is being done.  It is not by running down the other 
place that we will improve things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Quebecers and Canadians were asked who they trusted least, 
the answer might well be this country's politicians, with the 
exception of yourself, Mr. Speaker, perhaps.  That does not mean 
we should all go out and commit hara-kiri.  We must continue to 
work at improving our credibility and showing that we can make a 
difference.  All members of the House are motivated by one 
thing: to make a difference for those we represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-22 can also make a difference for those we represent by 
simplifying business and pleasure travel toward destinations in 
the United States.

an idea comes from the Reform Party that it is bad. Absolutely 
not.  Nor does this mean that all their ideas are always 
sensible and well thought out.  However, the fact remains that we 
cannot be running each other down.  We must get one thing 
straight, which is that each time we say something bad about

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay—Atikokan, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the week of June 6 to 12 marks National Transportation 
Week.  This annual celebration recognizes the important role 
played by Canada's transportation system in the social and 
economic life of our nation, providing hundreds of thousands of 
jobs and moving Canadians and their products throughout the 
country and to international destinations and markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme of National Transportation Week '99, “Transportation: 
Safe, Reliable, Efficient”, draws attention to the ongoing 
dedication to the safety and reliability demonstrated by Canada's 
transportation community and to the sector's continued efforts to 
maximize its use of the latest transportation technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The kick-off is in Moncton today, National Transportation Day. 
Celebrations include a day-long conference and the annual awards 
dinner.  Other events are planned throughout the week and 
throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that Canadians will take time this week to reflect 
on the central role that transportation plays in maintaining our 
quality of life and to consider how Canadian innovation can help 
prepare transportation for the challenges of the upcoming 
millennium.

the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada I congratulate 
Premier Mike Harris and the Ontario Conservatives for their 
convincing re-election to government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Harris and his team have shown that reducing taxes is 
one of the fundamental tools to create jobs and spur economic 
growth, economic growth which generates the revenues needed for 
quality health care and education.  Ontario embraced progressive 
change to get the province back on track, reversing the status 
quo of failed Liberal and NDP policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voters from my province are also hungry for a similar agenda for 
change at the federal level.  Last week's Gallup poll shows that 
the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada is the clear choice 
of 31% of the Ontario electorate.  Just as Ontario voters chose 
the provincial Conservatives yesterday, Ontario voters are 
starting to choose the federal Conservatives as the only true 
alternative to the federal Liberals.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's environment is important to all Canadians.  The 
Government of Canada is committed to protect all species at risk, 
all plants and animals, wherever they are in Canada.  We will do 
so with a holistic Canadian strategy that includes legislation, 
programs, partnerships and citizen engagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  Across Canada we have a long list of laws and 
regulations put in place to protect wildlife, such as the 
Canadian Wildlife Act, the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the

habitat and that support continues to increase.  This government

decisions so we can pass on a proud natural legacy to future

Canada claims to welcome new Canadians to our country.  In fact 
we rely on immigration to grow our population.  Yet the road to 
becoming a Canadian is fraught with barriers, roadblocks and 
pitfalls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the landing fee head tax of $975, plus $500 of 
other fees and charges.  This is a huge barrier to people from 
poor and developing nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head tax is bad enough, but even more and more frequently 
landed immigrants wishing to reunite their families are being 
forced to produce DNA evidence to prove they are related.  The 
cost of over $1,000 per person in advance is absolutely 
prohibitive and completely unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Somalian community and other ethnic groups that 
are disproportionately inconvenienced by these harsh and punitive

</I></B></P><P align=left>The $6 million CIDA contract to a man who donated $10,000 to the

just a bit coincidental.

decision was made by an arm's length committee, with the majority 
of voting members being part of the Government of Mali. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member suggesting that these people are part of some

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member why he keeps raising this 
matter.  Is it, as I said the other day, to hide the 
disintegration of the Reform Party, to hide the failure of the

1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in a public interview just this year the Prime 
Minister's lawyer, Debbie Weinstein, said she had been trying to 
sell these shares since 1996.  How can the Prime Minister sell 
shares he does not even own? 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as far as the Prime Minister is concerned the shares 
were sold in 1993.  There may be a debt owing to the Prime 
Minister through his blind trust, but the Prime Minister does not 
own the shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member is interested in uncovering the truth, the 
truth is there.  All she and her party have to do is listen to 
the answers of the Prime Minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We often find out that what the Reform Party asserts in the

<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
Ontario voters re-elected a Conservative government that cut 
taxes by 30%.  They gave Mike Harris a strong mandate to continue 
cutting taxes for Ontario families, communities and businesses. 
This morning Premier Harris said that federal taxes are too high 
and are a barrier to job creation, investment and growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  When will the 
Liberals follow the lead of Mike Harris and cut taxes? 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, our first task was to eliminate the $42 billion deficit 
burden created by the Conservative government of Mr. Mulroney of 
which the member is a current spokesman.  We eliminated that 
deficit and we moved to a balanced budget.  At the same time, we 
have begun massive tax reductions of $16.5 billion over the next 
three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need to follow Mike Harris' lead on this.  We are 
doing this through a mandate from the Canadian people, including 
those in Ontario.  Unlike Mike Harris, we are not doing this with 
one cent of borrowed money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the federal 
Liberals broke promise after promise, from free trade to the GST, 
from health care to an independent ethics counsellor.  The Harris 
Conservatives took a different approach.  They said what they 
would do before an election and actually delivered. While the 
Liberals are the party of trickery, cynicism and low integrity, 
the Conservatives are the party of honesty, hope and opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Deputy Prime Minister tell Ontario voters why they 
should trust the Liberals when Conservative policies have caused 
Ontario to grow and the federal government to balance its books? 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Ontario voters have already said what they think of 
the federal Conservative Party.  I am sure they are going to give 
a similar verdict in the next federal election and return an 
overwhelming number of federal Liberals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the new ruling by U.S. customs on softwood lumber, 
thousands of Canadian forestry jobs and even the fate of some 
Canadian companies are threatened.  Why has the government 
allowed Canada's softwood lumber trade with the Americans to 
suffer this new blow?  Were the trade officials too busy 
defending the magazine industry to recognize this new serious 
threat of the softwood lumber agreement? 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade,

the seriousness it deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an agreement that his province and that industry urged 
the federal government to get into two and a half years ago. It 
is obviously disappointing that the Americans are trying to 
expand the focus of this agreement.  We have taken action.  We 
have taken action against them at the world customs.  The world 
customs has agreed with us again.  If they continue to persist on 
the softwood rougher headed issue, we will continue to take 
action against them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we know of the action the government has taken at the 
world customs, but there has been no action taken on this most 
recent decision on the rougher headed lumber.  Whatever happened 
to the five years of lumber peace the Liberals promised by 
signing the softwood lumber agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not matter if it is softwood or split-runs, we are 
getting the same scripted answers. Canadians want to know what 
specifically will the government do before parliament rises to 
guarantee that these forest workers do not lose their jobs?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade,

one coast to the other. The member knows this.

that the agreement had been signed by officials. That is what 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs was referring to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the matter of the millennium scholarships, I can reassure the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is all 
very well to play a semantics game and call someone a 
facilitator when in fact they are a negotiator. Basically, is 
the mandate of the federal facilitator not simply to facilitate 
the life of the Minister of Human Resources Development by 
providing him with a pretext to avoid getting on with it and 
assuming his ministerial responsibilities?

that minister Legault

there is a bill before the Michigan legislature that if passed

away trade and investment in that state.

pesticides, the pest management regulatory agency and various

fish pens in Canadians waters, he stated this was illegal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was not at the hearing, but I am sure a close examination of 
the transcript will show that the officials who testified are 
committed to enforcing the laws that parliament passes, enforcing 
standards of safety in pesticides and dealing with environmental 
issues consistent with our objective, which is to maintain a safe 
environment for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
last night we received another two and a half inches of rain on 
already rain-soaked land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 in the Red River Valley only 1,200 acres were affected. 
Right now, in my area of Manitoba, over two million acres are 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the Government of Canada provided $26 million to address 
farm losses in the Red River Valley.  To date, the Minister of 
Agriculture has announced nothing, zero for the people who are 
being affected by this terrible disaster in southwestern 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food going to do 
for those constituents of agriculture? 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of clarification for the hon. 
member, much of the assistance to the producers in the Red River 
Valley a couple years ago was part of a memorandum of 
understanding and part of a disaster funding assistance 
agreement.  That is how much of that was handled at that time 
between the province and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, the province of Manitoba has not asked to call on the 
disaster funding assistance agreement.  It may or may not apply. 
It is up to the province to make its judgment call on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am doing is not leaving any stones unturned as far as 
looking at how we can use programs that are already in place and 
getting the flexibility in them that we can to assist these 
hard-pressed producers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there are a lot of rocks that can be unturned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Red River Valley there was a program where $10 per acre 
was allowed for custom seeding.  There is a small window that a 
lot of these producers may well take advantage of if the minister 
would look at a program like that.  He may want to look at the 
JERI program which would also help producers to recover some of 
their lost input.  Those are the options and those are the 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food reply 
to those and perhaps put them in place right now so that people 
can see their land. 
<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

producers that we are looking at every possible way to assist 
within existing programs.  I will also be visiting the area a 
week from today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not questioning the disaster situation that is there at the 
present time, but I will be reviewing that.  I will also continue 
to discuss with my provincial colleagues, the industry people, 
provincial officials and my officials the different ways that we 
can help.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question of privilege arises from a Canadian Press news story 
which appeared in today's <I>Globe and Mail</I> under the heading 
“Seal herds to be culled”.  It gives its source as the member

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Saanich—Gulf Islands deliberately divulged 
information from an in camera meeting of the Standing Committee

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a committee chooses to meet in camera, all matters are 
confidential.  Any departure from strict confidentiality should 
be by explicit committee decision which should deal with what 
matters should be published, in which form and by whom. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statement attributed to the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands 
was not delivered in the heat of debate in the House.  This was 
not a mistake in judgment or any kind of oversight.  This was a 
deliberate act, and one which demonstrates a disrespect and 
contempt for the privileges not only of every member of the 
Standing Committee for Fisheries but of every member of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I was informed that there was a major interview on CBC 
in Newfoundland also divulging information that was talked about 
in that in camera meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you rule this to be a prima facie question of privilege, Mr. 
Speaker, I am prepared to move the appropriate motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As all members know, 
the question of leaked committee reports in our parliament is one 
that has plagued virtually all committees and is of great concern

the fisheries committee with which I have been involved for the 
past year and a half has been plagued with this problem.  In 
fact, some of the reports that we have done in the past have gone 
out of there by the truckload, by various people in various 
departments.  We are never given a chance to respond and I agree 
it is a very serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this specific case, the day before this report was in the 
public domain.  It was in the media.  It had been released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members never seem to get an opportunity to respond.  In 
fairness, once this was in the public domain and I started to 
receive calls from reporters, I first of all notified the 
parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for Malpeque.  I also 
notified the member for Burin—St. George's in Newfoundland.  I 
told them that my phone lines were burning up with media 
interviews and it was just to let them know that I was speaking 
to the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of courtesy I advised them that the report was out there. Of 
course we knew that.  We talked about the committee.  It was in 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I>.  The report was already in the public 
domain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I did these interviews, what I talked to the media about 
was the comments that I had brought forward to the committee, not 
what other members of the committee had said.  I talked about my 
comments, what I was pushing for in the committee.  I made it 
very clear.  I said “This report is not completed.  We will be 
meeting next week.  These are the areas that I will be pushing 
for and I hope to get a recommendation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was speaking only on behalf of myself; but out of respect for 
the member, and he will verify it, I notified him prior to that, 
that I was making these comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the CBC interview, that person also informed me 
when she called that she had received calls from other members of 
the committee whom I will not name and said “This is what they 
are telling me.  Would you like to comment?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in the public domain the day before.  As a courtesy I 
notified the members.  I only did interviews with respect to my 
comments.  I made it very clear that the report is still not 
final at this time, that it can still be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Much of what has 
gone on right now is debate that could take place within 
committee.  The problem that we have is the question of trust 
within parliament as a whole in terms of the leaking of committee 
reports.

of committee leaks.  I think the Chair is quite correct, but this 
is quite aside from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three or four weeks ago the hon. member for Provencher, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, accidentally released information from a 
committee and was forced to apologize on the floor of the House 
for something accidental and did so.  The exact same thing was 
done deliberately this time and deserves no less consideration. 
That is the point that is different from the initial leak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was a leak made by whoever it is who leaked it, and 
that is totally unacceptable as well, that is one matter. 
However, the matter of someone else deliberately after that 
saying “given that someone already leaked it I am exonerated 
from my obligations”, is not correct.  That is separate issue 
and I would ask the Chair, perhaps not now, but to review that 
matter as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as a member of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans I 
want to make a brief comment on what I consider to be a very 
serious problem which has plagued the work of the fisheries and 
oceans committee since I came here two years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every report gets leaked to some extent, but I think what 
differentiates this circumstance is that before the committee did 
not know who was leaking the reports and everyone was guessing it 
was everyone else.  In this case I think what makes it different 
is that this time we know who gave the information to the news 
media.  I think that makes it quite different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of thing undermines the work of the committee.  It 
weakens the committee and in my view breaches the privilege of 
members of parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
know you have not ruled on this matter and you may want to check 
into it in further depth before you do so.  However, I agree with 
your preliminary comment, as Beauchesne's says, that reports from 
committees may be presented to the House.  Beauchesne's says that 
the committee has the authority to report back to the House if it 
feels that its privileges have been compromised.  By all means it 
is free to do so.  I would encourage committee members to check 
into it if they want.  I do believe that is the proper way to go 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the draft report of the committee was already in 
the public domain.  Unfortunately, as has been mentioned before, 
I think every draft report of every committee in the House of 
Commons in a year has been released to the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a report from the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs that dealt with leaked reports, and that report was 
leaked to the press by someone before it was released.  In other 
words, even that report having come to the House has not even yet 
been concurred in.  The suggestions in that report are put 
forward as a means to try to help solve this continuous problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government as it considers this matter to take that 
report, look at the recommendations that are contained therein, 
and implement them as a first step toward solving the problem 
with continuing leaked reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I know the Speaker 
takes this matter very seriously.  Aside from the specifics of 
this instance, the questions of trust between us as members of

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PRECLEARANCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK186">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill S-22, an 
act authorizing the United States to preclear travellers and 
goods in Canada for entry into the United States for the purposes 
of customs, immigration, public health, food inspection and plant 
and animal health, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak today to Bill S-22, 
the preclearance bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to state upfront that my only reservation is the 
fact that it was introduced in the Senate.  Many of my colleagues 
have raised the same point.  I do not think this bill has the 
same credibility, having been introduced by a body which is not 
elected and therefore not accountable to the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many in this House would have liked the opportunity to speak to 
or speak longer to this bill.  We are down to the wire with the 
closing of parliament and we have approximately one hour of 
debate at third reading, which makes it a bit difficult and also 
leads to some misunderstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the trade critic for the Reform Party, the official 
opposition, I think it is very important that this bill be passed 
as quickly as possible.  The reason I say that is because of our 
tremendous trade relationship with the United States, our biggest 
trading partner.  Over 83% of our exports go to the United 
States.  Therefore, a lot of Canadian companies and Canadian 
business people are involved and they need increased ease of 
access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amount of trade export and imports between the United States 
and Canada is massive.  We have the biggest trade relationship in 
the world.  There is $1.5 billion a day in trade crossing our 
border.  It works well in most instances, but we have to 
continue to work to make it easier to do business across that 
important border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I returned about three weeks ago from meetings with U.S. 
senators in the western states.  There was a meeting in Great 
Falls, Montana.  I saw the problems facing the border states and 
the border provinces.  I saw sweet grass in Montana cross the 
line from Alberta.  I saw thousands of Canadian trucks moving 
cattle into the western United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commerce is going to do nothing but increase.  We have a number 
of integrated economies.  We see it continuing to develop.  These 
economies include steel, the automotive sector and the cattle 
industry, and there are going to be more and more integrated 
economies with the United States in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in the process of trying to negotiate a hemispheric free 
trade agreement, free trade for the Americas, which will bring 
South America, Central America and North America into one trade 
agreement.  Therefore, there is all the more need for 
arrangements which make it easier for our business people to 
cross those borders in a timely fashion.  Time means money and 
these people have to have ease of access.  That is what this is 
really about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a preclearance bill.  Preclearance means that we do not 
have to clear customs in the United States.  It can be done in 
Canada prior to boarding a flight to the United States, for 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague said, as well as making it easier, it will build 
economies at some Canadian airports. Vancouver is a good case in 
point, where travellers coming from Asia will probably use the 
Vancouver airport to access the United States.  We want to 
encourage that.  We do not want to put roadblocks in the way. 
Hence, the need to have this preclearance bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk for a moment about the trends in trade.  In the 
1960s Canada exported approximately 60% of its goods to the 
United States.  People were concerned about that.  I remember at 
the time trade minister Allan MacEachen and Prime Minister Lester 
B. Pearson wanting to diversify that trade into other areas, 
Europe for example.  However, that was not to be because Europe 
was looking inward to the European Union. 
We know the kind of arrangements they have there.  They have a 
customs union, which means that the trucks do not even stop at 
the borders in the European Union.  Commerce flows across those 
borders every day.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure if that will ever happen between Canada and the 
United States, but we know that the trend is that more business 
people will be travelling and there will be closer linkages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an excellent article today in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
by Heather Scoffield which suggests that integration is speeding 
up more and more and there are calls for tax harmonization and a 
common currency.  We hear that right in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trend after the free trade agreement with the United States, 
and following that the NAFTA, is that more Canadian companies are 
looking for markets outside Canada.  They see that a 30 million 
person market is not good enough to serve them in the future. 
They look at the big market south of the border and they want a 
piece of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, because of the free trade agreement and the NAFTA with 
Canada, Mexico and the United States barriers have come down. 
That means that tariffs and duties have come down.  Between 
Canada and the United States all duties are gone except for a 
couple of selective industries.  Small Canadian companies which 
were doing business in Canada only had a protected market here 
because of high tariff walls.  They no longer have those high 
tariff walls.  There are companies from Mexico and United States 
that are looking at Canada as an attractive place to do business. 
There is fairly heavy competition for these Canadian companies 
right in their home market.  Therefore, they have to look 
elsewhere for markets and they are looking into the United States 
and Mexico where duties have also disappeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am suggesting that the trend will be to more movement of 
business between our three countries.  As we expand free trade 
into the Americas, into the hemisphere, there will be more need 
to accelerate programs that can ease the way we do business in 
Canada and how we clear customs in this preclearance fashion so 
that goods are moved quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at a conference in Mexico last year, five years after the 
NAFTA.  There were legislators there from Canada, the United 
States and Mexico.  I think all of us agreed that we will have to 
move quickly to try to remove any impediments that we can to the 
movement of goods and services, and people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The air cargo industry made excellent points.  The way business 
was conducted some time ago in Canada was that small companies 
would build a product which they would sell in their home 
community, and that was it.  Things have changed.  Those 
companies started looking at bigger markets, the province and the 
country.  Now, with barriers gone, those small companies are 
building products and are sending them to destinations all over 
the world, and they want it done in a timely manner.  Hence, the 
growth in air cargo.  Products are being shipped by plane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies want legislation such as Bill C-54, the electronic 
commerce bill.  I would suggest to the government that it is 
important to have that bill passed quickly.  There are a lot of 
Canadian companies that are asking for that electronic commerce 
bill to be passed because it will speed up how they can get paid 
for their products.  That is what this is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-22, although I disagree with its origins, is a good bill. 
It needs to have speedy passage and our party will support it.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CARRIAGE BY AIR ACT

amend the Carriage by Air Act to give effect to a Protocol to 
amend the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules 
Relating to International Carriage by Air and to give effect to 
the Convention, Supplementary to the Warsaw Convention, for the 
Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage 
by Air Performed by a Person Other than the Contracting Carrier, 
as reported (without amendment) from the committee.

<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to 
Bill S-23 on the occasion of its third reading in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 27 the members of the Standing Committee on Transport 
examined the proposed legislation in detail and voted unanimously 
to send it forward for third reading.  I thank my colleagues for 
having dealt with this bill so expeditiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that the purpose of Bill S-23 is to amend 
the Carriage by Air Act so Canada can officially ratify and 
become a party to two international instruments dealing with air 
carrier liability, those being Montreal protocol No. 4 and the 
Guadalajara convention. These two documents update and modernize 
elements of the Warsaw convention which sets out the legal rights 
and responsibilities of the carrier, passengers and shippers in 
relation to international air transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will enhance air carrier liability coverage and 
requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Montreal protocol No. 4 amends the liability regime as it 
applies to cargo by providing stricter carrier liability and 
establishing maximum limits.  It also simplifies the cargo 
documentation requirements and authorizes the electronic 
transmission of information.  This transmission of cargo 
information usually means other than the traditional multicopy 
air waybill and will provide significant cost savings to carriers 
and shippers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become extremely important that Canada act quickly to see 
to this protocol as it came into effect internationally in June 
1998.  This means that until Canada has been able to deposit its 
own ratification documents and have the protocol come into effect 
in Canada, our carriers and our shippers are at a competitive 
disadvantage vis-à-vis their counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Guadalajara convention on the other hand clarifies the 
relationship between passengers and shippers for the first part 
and carriers for the other.  This convention is already widely in 
force.  It distinguishes the contracting carrier from the carrier 
performing the carriage on its behalf and sets out the varying 
liability of each.  This sharing of the liability between 
contracting and operating carrier when they are not the same has 
become increasingly important as international carriers, 
including both Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, join together in 
global commercial alliances and carry each other's passengers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both Montreal protocol No. 4 and the Guadalajara convention have 
the unanimous support of the aviation industry.  The industry 
supports Bill S-23 without reservation and urges parliament to 
pass the bill as quickly as possible.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that the intent of Bill S-23 is both timely 
and non-controversial.  It will provide clarity and certainty not 
only for our Canadian carriers, but for the international 
carriers with whom they co-operate or compete.  It should reduce 
the potential for litigation and bring improved economies of time 
and cost to carriers and shippers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should move quickly to adopt this short but important bill. 
To delay would be to increase the length of time our carriers 
will be at a competitive disadvantage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to briefly address Bill S-23, an act to 
amend the Carriage by Air Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is routine legislation to amend the Carriage by Air Act and 
bring Canada into line with other countries in order to implement 
Montreal protocol No. 4 and the Guadalajara supplementary 
convention.  These were themselves extensions of earlier 
agreements, the Warsaw convention of 1929, which is the basis of 
all rules governing international carriage by air, and The Hague 
protocol of 1995 which updated the Warsaw convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, the Montreal protocol simplifies and 
decreases cargo documentation and brings air billing into the 
20th century by authorizing electronic transmission of documents. 
Unfortunately, it took 23 years to round up the requisite 30 
national ratifications of the protocol in 1998, but at least the 
new rules are in place for the 21st century.  It is now 
imperative that Canada get on board to help its carriers remain 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protocol also clarifies limits of carrier liability in order 
to avoid complex international conflict over the settlement of 
claims.  A carrier will be responsible for damages even if it is 
not overtly negligent, but on the other hand, it cannot be 
assessed for damages beyond a mandated maximum even in the event 
of gross negligence.  Thus both shipper and carrier are protected 
from catastrophic losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Guadalajara convention extends the rules of the Warsaw 
convention to carriage performed by a carrier other than the one 
with whom the passenger or shipper actually entered into his 
contract.  Why we are adopting this convention 38 years after its 
initiation is beyond me.  The mills of the gods may turn slowly, 
but compared to the adoption of international rules with respect 
to air cargo, they are spinning wildly.  In any event the bill is 
now before us and I urge the House to pass it without further 
ado. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My only serious problem with this legislation derives from its 
origin down the hall in what, because we are not allowed to call 
it by its proper name, I generally refer to as hog hollow.  Some 
members refer to it as the other place.  The hon. member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans refers to 
it as the other house.  Perhaps outhouse would be more 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate as currently constituted has no legitimacy and it is 
not supported by the people of Canada.  Nobody elected it and 
although I would be the first to admit that it does include a few 
hard working and public spirited individuals, it is overflowing 
with defeated Liberal and Tory candidates, retired bagmen and 
other assorted political hacks.  At the moment it even has a 
couple of convicted felons clutched to its bosom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might think that because I so thoroughly dislike the 
institution as currently constituted that I would share the view 
of those MPs including the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
who at one time or another have called for its abolition.  Not at 
all. The Fathers of Confederation created the institution for a 
good reason. 
That reason, although they referred to it as sober second 
thought, was really to protect the citizens of Canada from their 
own duly elected legislature.

more than we ever did.  Right now it is not protecting anybody. 
Why not?  Because its appointed Liberal majority has become a 
mere extension of the PMO, a yes sir, of course sir institution, 
as malleable and ineffective as the Liberal backbench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to the problem is not to precipitously trash the 
institution.  The answer is to fix it.  The ideal Senate would be 
a triple E Senate, elected, effective and equal.  This is a 
concept I heartily endorse.  I realize there are barriers to 
getting such an institution and that these barriers are 
formidable since this would require a major constitutional 
amendment requiring the consent of all provinces.  But reform can 
proceed as it did in the U.S.A., incrementally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States did not always elect its senators.  As a 
matter a fact the first state to do so was the state of Oregon 
around the turn of the century.  Once it set the precedent, the 
idea caught fire.  It was only about a decade before all of the

However, it is not generally exercised because of the

the heart of the Prime Minister.  We have already had one highly 
respected elected senator, the late Stan Waters.  We have right

waiting who were elected at large by the electors of the entire

order. 
Is the hon. member going to deal with this piece of legislation 
at any point in time in his diatribe? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must ask the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a direct relevance and connection between the use of 
the Senate as a vehicle for transmitting bills to the House and 
the bill which was actually transmitted.  To me this is a fairly 
logical connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a matter of grave importance to the people of Canada. 
Nothing is more important at the end of the day than the way in 
which we are governed. 
All of the other decisions that are made hang on that particular 
aspect of our lives.  If we do not have a good framework for 
government we cannot have good government. That is fairly simple.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would reiterate that I never again want to see important 
legislation coming to the House from that other place and, in 
effect, taking over the powers of the House of Commons.  This is 
not right.  It is not done to my knowledge in the mother of 
parliaments on which we base our procedures here.  It is high 
time that we brought ourselves into the 20th century and have in 
the Government of Canada an elected, effective and, hopefully one 
day, equal Senate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I would like to speak directly to Bill S-23.  Everyone has 
concerns about the origin of the bill, but we also have to 
acknowledge to Canadians and to parliamentarians that the bill is 
to amend the Carriage by Air Act.  Canada passed the Carriage by 
Air Act in 1947 to enact the 1929 Warsaw Convention.  Back then, 
we had biplanes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Flying to orbit the globe, as Ms. Payette, one of our honourable 
Canadians, has done and who is now on her way back home, and this 
whole evolution of air transportation and aerospace 
transportation is now before us.  However, with this 
modernization came two agreements:  the 1988 Montreal protocol 
and the 1961 Guadalajara convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This modernization by amending the Carriage by Air Act is long 
overdue.  The last update, as we said, was over 40 years ago.  We 
have challenges before us in this whole development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to place a challenge before the House, the 
government and I guess the Senate.  Perhaps there was 
shortsightedness in the Senate, or perhaps the day was a little 
blurry or a little too busy, but I think it has overlooked a 
major issue, a passenger bill of rights for Canadians.  We 
recently witnessed the drafting of such a bill of rights in the 
United States which will protect the rights of passengers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not only about modernizing the whole issue of 
primary carrier responsibilities.  If I board an Air Canada plane 
tonight and I then have to switch planes, which happens to be 
Canadian Airlines or Athabaska Airways, the primary 
responsibility for any rights or liabilities I have would rest 
with the primary air carrier, which would be Air Canada. 
Whichever carrier owns the plane I first board becomes the 
primary carrier.  This is highlighted in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Montreal protocol is very interesting.  It allows air 
carriers to now use new technology to transmit documents 
electronically and updates the currency references in the 
conventions from French francs to the International Monetary Fund 
of conversion units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak about the first issue of new technology 
and the whole issue of the environment and how much paper is 
being wasted on the issue of air transportation in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we board a plane today, our plane tickets and boarding 
passes are all made out of flimsy paper that is derived from the 
fibre of trees.  With the millions of passengers, not only in 
Canada but worldwide, this whole issue has to emerge to a new 
format.  It could be done through the electronic monitoring of 
passengers in some shape or form, either by card registry or as 
we do with Interac.  A few years ago we dreamed of not seeing a 
plastic based currency but it is now a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill amending the Carriage by Air Act will require and 
challenge the air transportation industry in Canada to look at 
the new technologies that will be available for them to be 
competitive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my closing comments, I will speak about competitiveness. I 
read an article about Canada being pushed on several fronts 
toward integration with the United States.  There is a fear that 
our Canadian airlines, such as Air Canada and Canadian, would be 
swallowed up and integrated into an American interest in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to protect our sovereign rights and to make our 
rules, regulations and passenger bill of rights.  We must protect 
our needs and our industries and make them competitive. One way 
of doing it is by bringing this forward into the House and by 
regulating and modernizing our laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the bill before us originated in the Senate and 
it might be a little shortsighted in terms of not expounding on a 
bill of rights.  If there are opportunities for the government 
and the minister to possibly amend this bill, it should be done 
in the near future.  Maybe in this parliament we will see that 
take place here in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
do not wish to take up an extraordinary amount of the House's 
time, but I would like to speak on behalf of our transportation 
critic for Cumberland—Colchester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to express our support for Bill 
S-23.  The bill not only receives our support but the support of 
the Air Transport Association of Canada, a body representing the 
major airlines and many cargo operators as well.  The industry 
regards this legislation as long overdue and essential for the 
modernization and commercial viability of Canadian commercial 
aviation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not respond briefly to the member 
from the Reform Party who suggested that because the bill is an 
S-bill that came from the Senate that perhaps it does not provide 
a good service for Canadians.  Nothing could be further from the 
truth.  Not everybody has a lock on all the ideas. The Reform 
members should certainly recognize that because, quite frankly, I 
do not believe they have a lock on any good ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate, in its wisdom, decided to bring forward a piece of 
legislation that is needed and necessary in the industry.  The 
bill amends the Carriage by Air Act by implementing two 
international agreements respecting air flights, the Montreal 
Protocol No. 4 and the Guadalajara Supplementary Convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These multilateral agreements modernize the rules regarding 
airline liability for passengers and cargo, and also simplify 
documentation for the international carriage of that cargo.  They 
were originally established under the Warsaw Convention of 1929 
and its amendment, the Hague Protocol of 1955. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Montreal Protocol No. 4 deals exclusively with cargo. It 
provides that a carrier is liable for damages to cargo to the 
limits of the liability, but only after those damages have been 
estimated.  As a result, the carrier cannot escape liability by 
taking all necessary precautions and cannot be assessed damages 
beyond the maximum limit, even in the event of gross negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important feature of Protocol No. 4 is that it changes 
airline liability for damage to cargo on board an aircraft by 
removing the requirement that a plaintiff prove that the airline 
was at fault.  Together, these changes will reduce the litigation 
and contribution to controlling costs associated with insurance 
and cargo rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Montreal Protocol No. 4 came into effect in the United 
States in March of this year and thus puts U.S. carriers at a 
competitive advantage over Canadian carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Guadalajara Convention clarifies the relationship between 
passengers and shippers on the one hand and air carriers on the 
other.  It is also widely in force and clarifies the application 
of the Warsaw Convention to situations where the contract of 
carriage was made by a carrier that did not actually perform some 
or all of the carriage by air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-23 has received unanimous support.  I say that again. 
Bill S-23 has received unanimous support.  All potentially 
affected parties, including carriers and their associations, the 
Air Transport Association of Canada, manufacturers, shippers, 
tour operators, consumers and the legal profession were 
consulted.

of the bill are already in practice worldwide.  Canadian carriers

We support the bill and urge quick passage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it came from the Senate does not mean that it is an 
inferior piece of legislation.  What it means is that it was 
brought forward by a group of individuals who saw a need, reacted 
to that need and brought it forward to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party will never accept that.  It never has, it never 
will and it never can accept that principle.  Quite frankly, it 
is very frustrating for not only myself but most Canadians.

the House of Commons to once again support this very important 
legislation, which will move along in those 14 first nations in

important topic of private sector investment so that they too can 
participate in the 21st century. It will ameliorate the poverty 
and the concerns that are expressed here every day in the House 
by the opposition, particularly the Reform Party, raising those 
even again this morning on those questions. This will deal with 
those matters in a very capable way and will act as a precise 
instrument to move those first nations to places where we all 
want them to be, which is to participate in Canada and become 
full members in that process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise to 
speak to Bill C-49 and the amendments that have been passed in 
the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the bill went to the Senate for amendments was that 
the Liberal government did not have the courage, or maybe I 
should say did not want to admit to the serious flaws in the bill 
when they were brought to their attention late last fall and 
again early in the spring. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These flaws were not only brought to the attention of the 
government by the Reform Party but by many Canadians, 
particularly aboriginal Canadians across Canada and especially 
those in my home province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate amendments are a small step in the right direction. 
They certainly are an improvement to the bill.  We had three 
major concerns with Bill C-49 which we presented to the 
government in December 1998 and again in the spring 1999. They 
had to do with the vast expropriation powers granted under the 
legislation; the lack of matrimonial property rights, 
particularly for aboriginal women; and the fact that there was no 
requirement on the part of aboriginal bands and adjacent 
municipalities to consult with one another on areas of mutual 
concern and interest when it came to development issues such as 
sewer, water and road projects and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill came back from the Senate.  It addresses in a small way 
our concern with respect to its expropriation powers.  However, 
it does absolutely nothing to address our concerns with respect 
to the disposition of matrimonial property in the event of a 
marriage breakdown.  It does nothing to address the concerns of 
adjacent municipalities that wish to be consulted and are quite 
willing to provide an obligation to consult them on issues of 
joint concern when it comes to land development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk a bit about private property rights issues, a key 
question aboriginal people living on reserves in Canada face 
today.  Aboriginal people do not enjoy property rights like all 
other Canadians when they choose to live on reserve.  The reserve 
lands are owned collectively.  They are not even owned by the 
band council, by the band or by the collectivity of the 
particular tribe or tribal council.  The underlying title is 
vested in the crown, which is to say the federal Government of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there are no private property rights there cannot be a 
proper disposition in the event of marriage breakdown.  There is 
not even the ability to provide an inheritance for children and 
their children when it comes to the house or property parents 
have resided in all their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking to that point for a minute, I had an opportunity to 
meet a wonderful lady several months ago.  I hope she is watching 
today.  Her name is Mazie Baker and she comes from the Squamish 
reserve.  She has been fighting for a long time for the right to 
be able to pass along to her children the house in which she has 
lived all her life, the house she grew up in, the house she 
considers her home but to which she has no title.  She does have 
a certificate of possession but she does not have title to the 
home because there is no such thing as title on reserve.  There 
are no private property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mazie is very concerned about Bill C-49.  She is representative 
of many aboriginal people living on reserve we have talked to.  I 
spent a couple of hours with her in Vancouver in February this 
year.  She asked me how the fruits of her labour, the house that 
means everything to her and her family, where they had their 
Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners together, could be passed on 
to her children if there were no property rights. 
Then she looked at Bill C-49 and said that it was not taking her 
closer to a private property right, that it was taking her 
further away.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is concentrating the decision making power of who is to 
possess what land and live in what house on reserve in the hands 
of chief and council.  Band members will be dependent on the good 
will and the sense of fairness and justice of the band council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases band councils will be fair about it but in other 
cases they will not.  That is human nature. I would not want to 
be dependent on the municipality I live in right now to be fair 
about the inheritance of the property I own by my children.  I 
would not want to be dependent on them.  I would want something 
firm and solid, a property right, but that is not granted on 
reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about what happens in the event of a marriage 
breakdown.  Aboriginal women in Canada do not enjoy the same 
rights as all other Canadian women.  I could provide many 
examples.  I think I may have spoken about the case of an 
aboriginal lady who splits from her husband but it bears 
repeating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election I was campaigning in Prince Rupert, a 
significant community in my riding.  A relatively young 
aboriginal lady came up to me in tears and asked whether I could 
help.  I asked her what was the problem and said I would see what 
I could do.  She had three young children all below the age of 
10.  If my memory serves me right, two of them were below the age 
of 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her husband had left her on her own.  She could not get a job 
because she had to look after her kids.  Her husband was not 
paying any child support.  He was making good money.  He was a 
fisherman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked why she did not do what what everybody else does, go to 
court and get a court order forcing him to pay child support. 
That is what we do in Canada.  That is how we protect not the 
women but the children.  That is what it is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said that she went to court and obtained a court order, but 
he moved back on to the reserve where the court order was not 
enforceable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is that fair to this woman and thousands of other women who 
end up in the same situation?  How can Canadians sit back and say 
this is the best country in the world in which to live when that 
kind of inequity exists? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one spends time talking with aboriginal people and visiting 
them on reserve and off reserve, one will find out that most 
often when an aboriginal woman marries a man she moves on to his 
reserve.  Most of these communities are small communities with 
small populations, so he is living in a community where he is 
either related to or has a very close association with some of 
the people on the band council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They live in a house which is not owned by them but by the band. 
They may get a certificate of possession if they are lucky, but 
the band decides who will live where.  People in the community do 
not decide that; the band council decides that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the situation of a couple that is married for some 
5, 10 or 15 years.  For whatever reason marriages breakdown, they 
decide to live apart and their marriage is dissolved.  In that 
situation who will be out on the street? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the time it is the woman because she has no private 
property rights.  She is not protected by any of the other laws 
that protect Canadian women from coast to coast.  The chief and 
council make the administrative decision about who will retain 
possession and custody of the house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that what we in Canada want to see?  Is that fair to women 
who are already dependent on government because of the 
paternalistic system that has been constructed around aboriginal 
people over the last 130 years?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it fair for the Government of Canada to do that?  I would 
argue that it is not.  I would argue that we have a very serious 
moral and possibly even legal obligation.  Certainly we have a 
moral obligation to make sure that aboriginal women who end up in 
that situation are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 does nothing to address that issue.  It puts the 
decision making power in land management and land use in an even 
more concentrated form into the hands of the chief and council. 
How will that advance the cause of aboriginal women? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know all parliamentarians have received pleas for help from 
aboriginal women.  The Aboriginal Women's Association of British 
Columbia and the Aboriginal Women's Association of Canada have 
come to us.  We were not the ones who raised the issue.  These 
people came to us when they became aware of Bill C-49.  They came 
to me and to my colleagues on all sides of the House and asked us 
not to compromise their interests but to do something in the bill 
to protect them so they have the right not only to protection for 
themselves but for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a marriage breaks down, most often it is the woman who ends 
up with the care and custody of the children.  We said this to 
the government last fall in the debate on Bill C-49.  In 
committee we asked the government to rethink the bill and to 
include some clauses in the legislation that would provide some 
guaranteed protection for aboriginal women in the event of 
marriage breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some kind of property right should be included even if it is not 
the fee simple land ownership the rest of us enjoy, something 
that moves further in the direction of the private property 
rights we all enjoy.  The government said no, that it would leave 
that up to the chief.  It did not want to interfere in what the 
chief and council were doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an obligation.  We live in a democracy.  The party 
across the way and some of the other parties in the House have 
lost sight of this fact.  I say very seriously that in a 
democracy we ought to have a deeper commitment and a deeper 
obligation to the rights of individuals over the rights of 
collectivities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the crux of what is wrong with the bill.  It speaks to 
the rights of collectivities.  I know our friends in the NDP 
would be happy with that because they believe very much in 
collectivities.  We believe in individual rights.  Democracies 
are founded on the principle of individual rights.  The bill is 
not founded on the basic principles of democracy.  It talks about 
buttressing and strengthening collective rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are collectivities in all democracies and there is nothing 
wrong with collectivities.  The Reform Party of Canada is a 
collectivity of some sort.  There is no question that 
collectivities are legitimate and have a place in society, but we 
must ensure individual rights supersede collective rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government across the way has been in government for most of 
the past 30 years but not all of it.  Our friends close to the 
door were in government for about 9 of those years.  However our 
friends in the Liberal Party have lost their way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in the latter part of the 19th century liberalism meant 
something completely different from what it means in modern day 
terms.  A liberal in the latter part of the 19th century was a 
person who was very much committed to the notion of individual 
rights, a person who was very much committed to the equality of 
all people in society.  They have lost this and the bill reflects 
that point very clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk a bit about what happened when the bill went to the 
Senate. 
The government and some of its backbenchers, actually the member 
for Vancouver—Quadra made statements that were printed in the 
Vancouver newspapers. He talked about the fact that this bill was 
seriously flawed and needed to be fixed.  He said that before the 
bill went to the Senate.  The government did not have the courage 
and not just that, I submit it did not want to suffer the 
embarrassment of acknowledging in the House that the bill was 
flawed.  It would put its own political interests ahead of doing 
what was right.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government did is it made some backroom deal.  The 
evidence of that is everywhere now.  It has spilled out to the 
media.  Some of the government's own backbenchers said they were 
not going to deal with the problems in this bill in the House. 
They said they would send it over there and instruct the Senate 
to bring in the amendments to fix it.  So the government sent the 
bill to the Senate as it was unwilling to address the serious 
flaws in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We cannot instruct the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  The member says we cannot instruct the 
Senate.  He knows full well that the Prime Minister is the one 
who appoints the senators and the senators are beholden to the 
him.  He knows full well that the Senate will do the Prime 
Minister's bidding virtually every time.  That is one of the 
problems my colleague from Cypress Hills was alluding to a few 
minutes ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government sent the bill to the senate.  A backroom deal was 
made and the government got the Liberal senators to agree to 
propose amendments to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate decided to hold committee hearings on the bill.  We 
found out about this and made sure that the people who had 
approached us, the Aboriginal Women's Society of Canada, the 
Aboriginal Women's Society of British Columbia, Mazie Baker and 
Wendy Lundberg from Vancouver had the knowledge that this would 
be in front of the Senate. They came to Ottawa and testified in 
front of the Senate. I could not sit in on all the Senate 
committee meetings unfortunately because my parliamentary duties 
would not allow it, but I sat in on as many as I could.  It was 
an eye opener to hear what those ladies had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judging by the looks on some of the faces of the senators, they 
were absolutely astounded and had no idea how to deal with this. 
It was almost as if everybody was afraid to say that the emperor 
has no clothes.  I can assure everyone that the emperor has no 
clothes.  We cannot pass this kind of legislation on the one hand 
and on the other hand say that we are concerned about the rights 
of aboriginal women.  The two are incompatible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These women came from British Columbia and other parts of Canada 
and made presentations to the committee.  They were very 
compelling in the arguments they advanced and in the stories they 
told in their own languages and in their own words.  They were 
plain spoken, direct and no nonsense.  They did not use six and 
seven syllable legalese terms.  They talked about how it affected 
them, their families and their children.  The senators sat and 
listened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to some of the senators.  I did have personal contact 
with some of the senators on this.  Many of them felt at a loss 
as to what they could do.  I think the Liberal senators, who are 
a majority in the other place right now, were instructed by the 
minister and her department as to what they could or could not do 
in terms of amendments.  Judging by the amendments we see today, 
I think the minister gave them a very short leash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some changes with respect to expropriation but they 
are not sufficient by half.  There is nothing with respect to 
marriage breakdown and marital property.  There is nothing with 
respect to inheritance and nothing with respect to any kind of 
requirement for adjacent municipalities and aboriginal 
communities to have some kind of consultation when it comes to 
property development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk for a minute about what happens when government 
passes this kind of legislation without wanting to think about 
what the ramifications are.  Some of its members are very 
intelligent people.  They do not act like it a lot of the time 
but I know them and they are very capable people. 
I submit that at times they do not want to look into the future, 
they do not want to admit what the net effect of these policies 
are going to be.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what happens when government deals in this kind 
of legislation without that kind of consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1965 the Government of Canada, the department of Indian 
affairs, encouraged the Musqueam band to get into the land 
development business.  The Musqueam band owned a piece of 
property located in Vancouver.  There was nothing on it.  I am 
sure this is how it happened.  The Department of Indian Affairs 
told the band that since it did not need this property it should 
subdivide it and lease it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The band, the department and a private enterprise developer in 
Vancouver entered into a deal.  The Department of Indian Affairs 
signed on behalf of the band.  It signed on behalf of the 
Government of Canada actually because the property is still in 
the name of the crown.  The Musqueam leaseholders came into 
being. That was in 1965. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the master lease was signed in 1965, 74 leasehold 
properties were created. The department of Indian affairs signed 
the master lease and all of the subleases. The master lease 
governs the entire 74 properties but each individual property is 
considered a sublease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the department of Indian affairs had signed the master 
lease people living in Vancouver started to buy the leases.  At 
the time it cost $18,000 to buy a lease and people had an 
obligation to pay so many dollars a year.  The lease price for 
this land was negotiated in 1965 at about $350 a year but on top 
of that property taxes had to be paid.  It was a 99 year lease 
with the initial term being 30 years. It was up for renegotiation 
in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people living in these houses believed they had a 99 year 
lease with a 30 year term which would be renegotiated in 1995. 
They believed they were dealing with the department of Indian 
affairs, the Government of Canada.  They thought they could not 
go wrong. Surely the Government of Canada would never do anything 
to compromise good taxpaying Canadians, some of whom were 
veterans of World War II. The Government of Canada would never do 
anything to compromise their interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980 the federal government, the minister of Indian affairs 
signed a deal without giving any notice, without any consultation 
or discussion with the leaseholders and transferred the federal 
government's authority for the leases over to the band.  Nobody 
was aware of this except the band.  No disclosure was made at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the 1980s and into the early 1990s people continued to 
buy and sell houses which everyone understood were on leased 
land.  Nobody ever bothered to tell the leaseholders that this 
huge change in administrative authority had taken place. It was 
done under section 53 of the Indian Act which the minister of 
Indian affairs at the time was empowered to do, but there was no 
disclosure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 the federal government signed a further deal with the 
Musqueam band allowing it to enter into direct taxation for 
property taxes on these leases.  Until that time there was a deal 
between the federal government, the band and the municipality of 
Vancouver wherein the municipality of Vancouver would provide the 
services and collect the taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 the band became the property tax collector.  It passed 
on some of the money to the city of Vancouver because the city of 
Vancouver had to be paid for the services it was delivering.  The 
residents had no knowledge that this was going to happen.  There 
was no consultation.  It was just done. 
It was done without their knowledge as a fait accompli. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After it was a fait accompli residents became aware of it very 
quickly. Their property taxes skyrocketed.  The band since that 
time has been collecting property taxes.  It will argue that it 
is not collecting school taxes, but I would argue it is 
collecting much higher levels of taxes now than what was 
collected when the city of Vancouver was the property tax 
assessor and collector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The band is not providing school services to those residents. It 
is not turning over any of the tax revenues it is collecting to 
the Government of British Columbia in aid of providing school 
services for the children of the leaseholders who live on that 
reserve. In some cases it has almost as much as tripled the 
property taxes these people pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the municipality in which I live, and all municipalities are 
the same, property taxes are not there as some kind of cash cow 
for the municipality to do whatever it wants.  Taxes are tied to 
the services the municipality delivers.  Municipalities by law 
are not allowed to run either a deficit or a surplus.  They 
collect only as much taxes as are required for them to operate 
the municipality on an annualized basis.  I would submit that 
because the people who pay the property taxes in municipalities 
get to elect their municipal councillors, these people are also 
very accountable for how those tax dollars are spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a completely different situation in Musqueam.  There are 
74 people who are paying property taxes to the Musqueam band 
council but they are not allowed to vote for any of the band 
councillors.  They are not allowed to run for office.  In fact, 
they are not legally entitled to even show up at the council 
meetings.  Now I ask, is that a very wise decision on the part of 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I am very concerned about this bill.  The government 
makes decisions and it does not consider the long term impact of 
those decisions.  On the Musqueam reserve, because of this 
taxation policy, there is the absolutely unbearable prospect of 
taxation without representation. The American break from Great 
Britain happened over taxation without representation.  That is 
how important it is to people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we in Canada think we are so clever and so intelligent that 
we can reinvent these failed policies and somehow make them work? 
I do not understand the thinking behind this.  There are far too 
many people involved in the policy making decisions in this 
country, particularly in the bureaucracy around here, who are 
clever, well educated and totally impractical and who totally 
blind themselves to history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit that the Musqueam leaseholders story in the 
chronicles of modern Canadian history is an absolute nightmare. 
It is absolutely beyond my ability to comprehend.  I have gone 
there and met with the leaseholders.  I know what kind of pain 
and suffering these people have been through and are still going 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fellow the other day sent me the lease bill he had just 
received from the Musqueam band.  His lease bill was $74,000 for 
the property that his house is on.  There was a tiny little 
polite note at the bottom to please pay it within 30 days.  Is 
that not interesting?  I wonder how the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development would like it if we sent her a 
bill like that.  I wonder how anybody else in the House would 
feel if they received a bill like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be so politically correct we are not even supposed to 
discuss these issues in the House of Commons.  We are not even 
supposed to raise these issues.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATURAL GAS

<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK206">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
provide initiatives to deliver natural gas to unserviced regions, 
to address environment concerns and high energy costs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am truly proud to rise to speak to my 
first private member's bill of the 36th Parliament on behalf of 
Canadians in the riding of Churchill River, Saskatchewan, and all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initiative of Motion No. 292, which was deemed votable, will 
be a benefit which all Canadians will be able to enjoy, as well 
as future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 292 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should provide 
initiatives to deliver natural gas to unserviced regions, to 
address environment concerns and high energy costs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the third largest producer of natural gas.  Without a 
doubt, continuing developments and discoveries such as the 
Northwest Territories and Sable Island fields will ensure that a 
fair share of our natural gas resources will be distributed in 
the country, not only in royalties or opportunities but the 
distribution of natural gas itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Natural gas presently is distributed to more than four million 
customers in six provinces.  Natural gas provides 26% of Canada's 
energy needs and this number is increasing each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Canada's natural gas exports are experiencing 
exponential growth.  When we have natural gas exports it means we 
have surplus supply.  In terms of trade we must take care of our 
own families first before we share with the rest of the world. 
That is the whole context of sharing with unserviced areas of 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We share our natural gas with major cities in the south, but 
there are entire regions of this country that do not have natural 
gas service which are being disadvantaged because of lost 
economic development opportunities.  Natural gas provides an 
opportunity for economic development in unserviced regions. When 
major industries and manufacturing companies, pulp mills, 
sawmills, grocery stores, schools, hospitals and university 
campuses calculate the energy costs of certain communities and 
certain neighbourhoods, energy is the major portion of their high 
cost of maintaining these facilities.  If natural gas were to be 
provided equally to certain neighbourhoods, certain communities 
and certain regions, this disadvantage would not be there.  Not 
having this service is detrimental to job creation, community 
growth and community maintenance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we as parliamentarians can contribute to the 
progress of this country into the next millennium.  We have the 
opportunity to ensure that all regions can afford the economic 
and environmental benefits that natural gas presents.  There are 
several options to look at.  The biggest option for us to 
consider when natural gas is being distributed is that it is one 
of the cheapest and most economically sound of all the fossil 
fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fossil fuel industry in Canada has been a growing and 
vibrant industry.  However, in recent years greenhouse gas 
emissions and the Kyoto protocol have challenged what we can do 
in the future.  The first thing we can do is consider the 
cleanest of the fossil fuels, which is natural gas.  This should 
be shared with all our communities so that we make a conscious 
effort to use heat and energy without polluting in the extreme 
our environment and our children's health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At Kyoto I had an opportunity to look at the future development 
of the Kyoto protocol and its implications.  One of the issues 
that I would like to raise is the domestic greenhouse emission 
credits that should be considered.  When Europe considered the 
Kyoto negotiations it considered itself a bubble, so that certain 
regions of economic and industrial development would not suffer 
in terms of their commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Canada has to look at itself as a bubble as well.  There are 
regions that are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, on coal-fired 
electrical generation and on the coal industry.  Greenhouse gas 
is another consideration.  We could equalize these industries. 
We could normalize our total output and meet our commitments.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scary side of emission credits is that if we continue to 
increase our greenhouse gases we will be paying hard cash to 
other countries when they diminish their greenhouse gases in the 
future.  This credit trading will be a major issue.  I would 
rather see that hard earned Canadian cash invested in our own 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any initiative to increase a cleaner carbon source is of course 
environmentally sound.  As part of environment week, I am very 
honoured to raise Motion No. 292.  There should be a conscious 
effort by parliamentarians to rally behind this motion and to 
challenge the federal government to undertake initiatives to 
share our natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to cleaner fuels is an economic advantage, but it is also 
a major win.  The Kyoto credits would be another win.  In terms 
of air pollution there is another consideration which we cannot 
overlook and that is health care.  There are health care costs 
such as asthma and other illnesses caused by air pollution in our 
communities and neighbourhoods, especially in major urban 
centres.  If there is any way we could reduce air pollution it 
would be a major win for the health care of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of high cost, there are far northern communities which 
do not have natural gas.  There are major subsections of our 
communities, even here in Ottawa, which do not have natural gas, 
especially in older sections of town.  Maybe the older sections 
of Montreal, Halifax, Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton and Calgary 
have been overlooked, but some of them have been served for many 
years and it is taken for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that parliamentarians consider all Canadians in an equal 
light and share our natural gas.  Families could realize savings 
against the high cost of living, not only those living in remote 
areas but those living in the high cost regions of the country. 
Savings would be made on the maintenance of their homes.  Canada 
has a northern climate where 40 below is a natural phenomenon in 
January and after Christmas when people are huddled around. 
Natural gas would certainly be an advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking into the future we see the development of fuel cells and 
the whole technology of solar and wind energy.  That might take a 
decade.  It might take a few decades to bring forward, but 
natural gas will always be accessible to all of our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Natural gas is being used by many taxi companies.  Many 
communities have had opportunities to look at other sources of 
energy for transportation.  If it is distributed equally 
throughout the country, it would mean that vehicles adapted for 
this type of fuel could be used by Canadians to travel more 
widely.  Travel would be more accessible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 292 is a votable motion.  I would humbly ask for 
the support of all parties and all members of the House.  I 
believe it is a win-win situation.  It is a win situation for the 
natural gas resources industry.  We have distribution companies 
all over the provinces and regions.  It is also a win situation 
for the health and educational industries.  We have institutions 
that have high costs.  Imagine the cost of heating and cooling 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These institutions, which we take for granted, might be 
generations old.  They need to be retrofitted.  It is a win-win 
situation for the trades industry.  Tradespeople will retrofit 
the heating units of many facilities.  It is a job intensive 
situation. 
It will take people off the unemployment lists.  There could be 
seasonal work for young people.  If this work could not be done 
in the winter, it would certainly have to be done in the summer 
when heating systems are shut off.  Students could gain 
employment and maybe valuable apprenticeship positions as a 
result of this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industries would consider our small communities that do not have 
the distribution.  Industries certainly look at high energy costs 
and natural gas has proven itself as an energy efficient and a 
cost effective way to provide energy to any facility, including 
manufacturing facilities.  For example, the lumber industry uses 
kilns for drying lumber.  We have kilns in the arts industry.  We 
have heating systems in many car plants and hospitals.  To make 
Canada a more self-sufficient country, let us consider sharing 
the abundant natural resource of natural gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could be a major development in relation to the Sable 
Island project.  Big pipelines will be installed along highways, 
but they will not be shared laterally.  Lateral pipes will not be 
available to the neighbourhoods which this major pipeline will 
run through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge this government to look at initiatives.  It might be 
a new infrastructure initiative.  It might be a millennium 
initiative.  It might be a greenhouse gas initiative.  Let us not 
overlook natural gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are ripping up our highways and redoing the potholes in 
our back roads, highways, streets and sidewalks, while we are 
fixing up the infrastructure of this country, let us lay down 
natural gas pipelines and share our resources with all the people 
of this country.  It is a win-win situation which we should not 
miss.  Our children will have to do it if we do not.  We should 
consider our infrastructure in that vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask for a national vision.  I know there are provincial 
interests and industry interests, but I think the federal 
government could tie up all of the initiatives.  The Department 
of Finance, the Department of Natural Resources, the Department 
of the Environment and the Department of Industry all deal with 
major resources.  All of these departments may have separate 
initiatives, but let us share a national vision.  Let us make 
sure that all Canadians are treated equally and that we share our 
natural resources equally.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to private member's Motion No. 292.  I 
support the principle which the member speaks of, but the 
initiative is perhaps somewhat misplaced in that this motion 
proposes that the federal government provide the delivery of 
natural gas to rural regions in Canada.  While I can accept that 
the federal government would and should make a contribution to 
the process, the provision of public utilities falls under the 
responsibility of provincial and municipal governments.  As well, 
there are existing federal programs which might apply to this 
kind of program.  Accordingly, I do not support this motion for 
the simple reason that it brings federal interference into an 
issue of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many provinces already have in place programs to address the 
intention of this bill, to deliver natural gas to unserviced 
regions.  I will quickly go over an example of such a program in 
my province of Alberta.  Alberta has had just such a program and 
has been helping Albertans since 1973. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The natural gas distribution system serving rural Albertans 
began in the early 1960s with small systems built and operated by 
local groups and co-operatives.  Interest in natural gas services 
grew throughout the decade.  In the early 1970s the provincial 
government took action to expand the provision for natural gas to 
rural Albertans at a reasonable cost.  This action was taken in 
accord with the general conclusion that it was in the public 
interest to improve the economic viability of smaller centres and 
that the family farm should be preserved.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was felt that all Albertans, including those in rural 
Alberta, deserved a fair share of the benefits enjoyed by the 
people of that province from the ownership of natural resources 
and the revenue that flows from the development of those natural 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the higher cost of serving scattered rural areas, it 
was decided that a provincial funding program to support 
construction of rural gas distribution systems was needed.  To 
support this initiative the rural gas act was enacted in 1973 and 
soon after the rural gas program administered by the rural 
utilities branch of Alberta Energy was established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program brought many benefits to program users.  The 
primary benefits included affordable installation costs where 
adequate gas sources are available, lower costs and reliability 
of fuel supply.  Obviously all these benefits are crucially 
important to those living in rural areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this program approximately 4,000 new rural gas services 
are installed each year.  Eligible services include uses such as 
homes, outbuildings, irrigation, grain drying, poultry and hog 
barns, greenhouses and more.  Until this program was established 
individuals simply could not afford to access gas distribution in 
rural areas past already established transmission lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this program attempts to reduce consumer costs to a 
reasonable level by establishing a grant program under which 
participating utilities could receive grants based on a cost 
sharing formula from the provincial government.  Under this 
arrangement consumers in the same class pay the same contract 
amount in any year, even though the costs to provide the service 
may vary widely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funding for the new gas installation is based on a formula that 
calculates the pooled costs per service within each franchise 
area.  For example, for a rural installation service that has a 
capital cost of up to $2,600, the capital cost is shared 100% 
between the distributor and the customer.  However, for a rural 
installation that costs above $2,600 and up to $15,000, the 
distributor or consumer covers 25% of the cost and 75% is covered 
by the provincial grant.  With this formula a typical farm 
installation costing $5,000 would receive a grant of $1,800. 
Obviously this makes the convenience of natural gas much more 
affordable to those living in rural areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of factors that contribute to the success of 
the rural gas program.  First, with the expansion of natural gas 
services into rural areas, a new system of franchising had to be 
created to focus on the special requirements of rural areas. This 
concept of franchise areas was applied in the rural gas act to 
ensure a customer base for future viability of the new 
distributors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other criteria included consideration of major obstacles to 
pipeline construction such as rivers or highways.  Under an 
assigned franchise a distributor has the right and responsibility 
to offer service where economically feasible to all potential 
rural and urban residential customers who did not have natural 
gas service prior to 1973. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is the formation of member owned co-operatives in the 
less populated areas of the province.  The provincial government 
recognized the dedication, initiative and independent spirit of 
rural dwellers and felt the program had a better chance of 
success in these areas if the local community controlled its own 
destiny.  Where have we heard that statement before? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third is the provision of grant funding on a cost shared basis 
to make rural gas systems economically viable.  Through 
contributions by the customer, government and co-ops, the 
resulting gas rates could be competitive with urban rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Gas Alberta was established to negotiate price and 
arrange for gas supplies for the co-ops.  Through a postage stamp 
wholesale rate throughout the province, all co-ops were on an 
equal footing with respect to gas costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rural gas program has been very successful in Alberta.  To 
March 31, 1999, services have been provided or systems upgraded 
for over 171,600 rural, urban, irrigation, grain dryer services 
by over 90 distributors throughout a network of pipelines 
totalling 116,521 kilometres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I make by referring to the Alberta example is that 
obviously programs such as those proposed by the motion already 
function and are doing well under provincial jurisdiction.  As 
well, keeping in mind it is the province that collects royalties 
from the export of natural gas and oil, the provinces already 
have a built in funding system without asking Canadian taxpayers 
to unnecessarily subsidize a rural gas installation program.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the principle that the provinces 
should have exclusive jurisdiction over natural resources and 
that citizens of the provinces should all benefit from the 
development of those resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta is not the only province that receives substantial 
royalty income from the sale of natural gas.  The province of 
Saskatchewan received $44.5 million last year in natural gas 
revenue.  It would seem reasonable to me that all the residents 
of Saskatchewan, even those in remote northern communities, 
should benefit from the development of natural gas resources as 
much as any other province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the prime responsibility for making that happen lies 
first with the local community and second with the province. 
Third, there is room for federal participation through existing 
programs such as the PFRA or prairie farm rehabilitation program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. 
member for Churchill River is proposing that the federal 
government should subsidize natural gas expansion projects for 
remote communities as a way of reducing the cost of living of 
residents and achieving environmental benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for his interest in this very valuable 
natural resource.  Natural gas is a cleaner burning, efficient, 
cost effective fuel which is why it has become one of Canada's 
number one natural resources.  Canada also has an abundant supply 
with an estimated available total of between 504 and 617 trillion 
cubic feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the stated objective of the Minister of Natural Resources 
to make Canada into the world's smartest natural resources 
steward, developer, user and exporter.  To become the world's 
smartest resource developer means in part adopting a considered, 
practical market oriented approach that balances the needs of all 
interests.  It is this type of approach that is behind the 
natural gas success story.  It is a thriving competitive industry 
that has followed a course of continuous and sustainable growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To understand the present, it is important to look at the past 
to see how the natural gas industry developed in Canada.  Members 
in the House may remember the energy crisis of the 1970s and the 
concern for Canadian energy security that followed.  In response, 
a group of off oil programs were designed to expand the use of 
domestic natural gas in Canada.  These programs were phased out 
in the early 1980s when world crude oil markets stabilized and 
crude oil prices fell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the mid-1980s the crude oil and natural gas markets in Canada 
were deregulated.  For the Canadian natural gas industry this 
resulted in lower natural gas prices and a surge in natural gas 
activity.  Since then natural gas production, along with 
associated transmission and distribution infrastructure. has 
increased at a healthy and in some cases dramatic pace. 
Expansions to Canada's natural gas infrastructure whether of a 
local or international dimension have been governed by a 
combination of economic opportunity, economic viability and 
technology development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government's current energy policy not to fund energy 
megaprojects but to leave it to the competitive market to decide 
what goes forward and what does not.  This is one reason we have 
difficulty in supporting the hon. member's motion.  This policy 
has not resulted in a stalled natural gas industry, far from it. 
The result has been some very exciting private sector driven 
developments, including the expansion of natural gas distribution 
and production into new previously unserviced regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the Sable offshore energy project.  In late 1999 
natural gas resources from off the coast of Nova Scotia will be 
coming ashore.  The onshore maritimes and northeast pipeline will 
make natural gas available in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick for 
the first time.  Natural gas was first discovered at Sable Island 
in the 1960s, but it had never been economically viable for 
production until now, thanks to new drilling technology and new 
alliances between oil companies and engineering and construction 
contractors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must emphasize that the building of laterals within a province 
such as the hon. member is suggesting falls under the 
jurisdiction of the provinces as my hon. friend from Athabasca 
said.  In the member for Churchill River's case it is the 
province of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these cases expanding the distribution system is the 
responsibility of provincially regulated local distribution 
utilities.  Provincial regulators set financial tests for new 
projects.  Where a project cannot generate enough revenue to 
justify its capital cost, the local distribution company will ask 
potential gas consumers to make financial contributions, as my 
friend from Athabasca so ably pointed out.  They are known as 
grants in aid of construction to bring the project to the point 
of economic viability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If converting to natural gas offers an opportunity for reduced 
fuel bills, consumers can use a portion of their savings to 
finance the cost of conversion.  From 1995 to 1997 there was an 
average of 125,000 new residential hookups per year.  Of these 
customer additions, 70,000 were new constructions and 55,000 were 
conversions from other energy sources.  What this means is that 
48% of Canadian homes are now gas heated on a normal commercial 
market driven supply system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From an energy policy point of view it would not be sensible to 
depart from the principle of the market must decide where 
laterals are built.  However, for other non-energy policy reasons 
there may be programs in other departments which seek to achieve 
economic development or environmental or other goals through the 
subsidization of laterals.  I invite hon. member to investigate 
those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the hon. member's home province of Saskatchewan, for example, 
the western economic partnership agreement between federal and 
provincial governments allowed for such funding.  Indeed the 
federal government approached the provincial NDP government to 
explore whether a portion of the economic partnership agreement 
funding could be reserved to build laterals in remote areas.  The 
provincial NDP government said no, not the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of federal funding that was available to help 
with laterals was the Canada infrastructure works program which 
the government introduced some five years ago.  In the province 
of Manitoba natural gas laterals to rural communities were 
identified as a priority and a portion of Manitoba's 
infrastructure funding was set aside to help build these 
laterals, not for energy policy reasons but for local economic 
and community development purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me assure the House that the Government of Canada is also 
very sensitive to the fact that many remote rural areas face high 
cost energy and general environmental sensitivity.  That is why 
the department has specifically designed alternative and 
renewable energy programs, as well as energy efficiency in 
conservation programs, that will help these communities meet 
their energy needs, lower their cost of living and receive 
environmental benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuing these initiatives is the most workable, economically 
viable and environmentally friendly way of meeting the needs of 
rural and remote areas.  Adapting these new technologies could 
bring these communities savings of $200 million per year, not to 
mention significant environmental benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, some communities are totally dependent upon fuel 
oil that is shipped at great expense.  There are new technology 
programs in the energy section of NRCan that focus on developing 
alternative and renewable sources of supply, including 
bio-energy, small hydro, wind, photovoltaics and active solar 
energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to these technology initiatives the department has 
developed tools to help communities analyse what kind of supply 
source would be reasonable and what they would need to pursue it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another initiative is the development of community energy 
systems to improve energy efficiency and allow the better use of 
waste heat.  Under this approach energy use is reduced by 
integrating conventional energy supply, renewable energy sources, 
the energy demands of the building, transportation and industrial 
sectors, and the use of waste heat. 
The department is also working toward increasing the energy 
efficiency of buildings. Consider the following example: This 
year's federal budget allocated $1.6 million over three years for 
Natural Resources Canada to establish a program with the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities to identify opportunities 
for energy efficiency retrofits in municipal buildings.  Under 
this initiative, municipalities expect to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions by 30% to 40% and save $108 million to $175 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Initiatives like this are the best options for delivering a 
lower cost of living and environmental benefits to rural and 
remote communities.  They are the wave of the future for rural 
and remote areas.  I urge the hon. member for Churchill River to 
investigate all of them thoroughly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to rise today to debate Motion No. 292 put forward by 
the member for Churchill River:  that the government provide 
initiatives to deliver natural gas to unserviced regions, to 
address environmental concerns and energy costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the other speakers, as well as the member for 
Churchill River, and I think he should be congratulated on an 
excellent motion.  I also listened closely to the government's 
answer thinking that much of what the government member said was 
true.  However, this was before the government signed the Kyoto 
protocol which will very much change the way we look at energy 
and the way we use energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We signed a commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 
the year 2010.  We knew, the G-8 countries knew and the 
industrialized nations of the world knew when they signed that 
commitment that they would not be able to meet that commitment. I 
do think the countries signed the commitment in good faith and 
that they meant well.  However, I am not sure they are willing to 
put their money where their mouths are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Churchill River raises a point that many of us 
who represent rural ridings face.  We have significant areas in 
our ridings that are now serviced by fuel oil, diesel fuel, 
electricity, coal-fired electricity and various sources of energy 
that are fairly expensive.  If we could reduce the cost for our 
industries in the ridings we represent, that would certainly 
benefit our position as MPs and we would actually be able to 
bring something back to our ridings.  We would actually be able 
to deliver a service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Churchill River discussed the various energy 
plays that are occurring in Canada at this time and the amount of 
natural gas which is abundant in this country.  I am discussing 
fields such as Venture, South Venture and Thebaud off Sable 
Island.  I am also talking about fields and potential fields in 
the Laurentian Channel and the Sub-Laurentian basin, exciting new 
discoveries in the high Arctic such as Fort Liard, and a lot of 
natural gas exploration in northern Alberta and northern B.C. now 
which will be put into the alliance pipeline and sent all the way 
to Chicago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are becoming major exporters of natural gas to other places 
on this continent.  The Sable fields will go to the maritimes 
northeast pipeline.  Much of it will go into New England.  I have 
seen the plans put forth by the present provincial government in 
Nova Scotia but I am not convinced it will service the rest of 
the province. I am not convinced that P.E.I. will be serviced at 
all. I am not convinced that some of the exciting natural gas 
discoveries off Newfoundland are going to put natural gas into 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps now that we have entered a new era and have signed a 
protocol which is going to force us to use cleaner sources of 
energy, it is time for the federal government to look at 
assisting rural areas in provinces that are not now serviced by 
natural gas to provide service to these areas.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Churchill River should be aware of the flaw that 
is within the system on the east coast.  Many households in the 
rural areas are now heated by fuel oil.  The oil delivery people 
and the Canadian Oil Heat Association of Nova Scotia have never 
been subsidized.  They put those oil furnaces in the homes and 
the people bought them with their own dollars. There were no 
subsidies.  We are now talking about putting in natural gas, 
which is subsidized, and giving the natural gas distributors an 
unfair advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that does not mean that we cannot find ways to overcome 
that or that we should stop looking at this very good motion put 
forward by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several other areas that we need to look at, but the 
most important one is how we go about delivering the natural gas. 
In Nova Scotia in particular, it is absolutely asinine to 
discuss natural gas delivery if we do not have a plan to build a 
lateral pipeline from the Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline which 
will allow a large enough pipe to come off the Maritimes and 
Northeast Pipeline down to somewhere in Stewiacke and into the 
Musquodoboit Valley area.  It should be a line that is at least 
18 inches in diameter that can then be split and fed into the 
urban and metro areas of Dartmouth and Halifax, with another line 
that will split off and go down into the Annapolis Valley and 
hopefully into the Yarmouth area and then another line off that 
which will go down the South Shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a natural asset in the province of Nova Scotia with our 
abandoned rail bed.  We could lay a natural gas pipeline along 
this rail bed to service all of the communities along the South 
Shore area, the riding I represent, and not disturb the road 
system or the highway system.  It would be very convenient and 
very economical to use that existing rail bed, the railroad that 
has long since been torn up, to lay a natural gas pipeline. We 
could continue to use the same bed for recreational purposes and 
other purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other asset that would certainly service the South Shore 
riding would be the fact that we have some heavy industry.  We 
have a hardwood mill in East Chester, a pulp mill in Liverpool, 
and Michelin Tires in Bridgewater.  We also have a number of 
small manufacturing industries that could be well serviced by 
natural gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was one thing that I was not clear on and I am not sure if 
the member for Churchill River mentioned it:  Can we use natural 
gas for refrigeration?  Very clearly there are hundreds of fish 
plants in the South Shore that could easily convert to natural 
gas and be able to use that to generate refrigeration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opportunity for major savings and a major benefit for the 
majority of the citizens in the South Shore is there, but there 
is a problem problem for the existing oil heat people who have 
already been servicing the area for domestic heat.  I think the 
problem can be worked out to the satisfaction of both the 
consumers who are looking for a cleaner and more efficient 
source, and the consumers who have already invested in oil heat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I recognize that the member on the government 
side said that this was provincial jurisdiction.  However, I 
think that was true before we had a hole in the ozone layer, 
before we had signed the Kyoto protocol, before we became a major 
exporter of natural gas, and before much of the world was turning 
to natural gas.  They cannot get enough of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing that has not been mentioned is the potential for us to 
bring liquefied natural gas out of the high Arctic.   Some very 
exciting wells were drilled in the high Arctic on some excellent 
fields.  We have been trying to bring more infrastructure, more 
jobs, more economic opportunities and more industry into the high 
Arctic.  We abandoned the high Arctic years ago when we never 
should have. 
We left for no good reason.  Now it is time that we went back 
there and reopened those fields so that we can bring liquefied 
natural gas out of the high Arctic by containers and use it in 
southern Canada or use it for export.  If we are to meet the 
Kyoto protocol we have absolutely no choice but to convert to 
more natural gas use within the country.

should not look at some way to service the other areas of Canada 
that do not have accessibility to natural gas at this time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to take this opportunity to address the motion on 
natural gas introduced by the hon. member for Churchill River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government's current energy policy not to fund energy 
megaprojects but to leave it to the competitive market to decide 
what goes forward and what does not.  This is one reason we have 
difficulty in supporting the hon. member's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This policy has not resulted in a stalled natural gas industry. 
Far from it.  The result has been some very exciting private 
sector driven developments including the expansion of natural gas 
distribution and production into new previously unserviced 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From an energy policy point of view it would not be sensible to 
depart from the basic principle that the market must decide where 
laterals are built.  However, for other non-energy policy reasons 
there may be programs in other departments which seek to achieve 
economic development or environmental or other goals through the 
subsidization of laterals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat what my hon. friend from Halton said earlier, that the 
western economic partnership agreement was a possible avenue for 
some federal government support in this area, but the NDP 
government in Saskatchewan turned it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the hon. member's desire to ensure an 
environmentally friendly and secure energy source for his region. 
That is what Canada's approach to the complex evolving global 
challenge of climate change is all about.  We see it as a 
challenge that is both environmental and economic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kyoto protocol in December 1997 reaffirmed the conviction 
among some 160 nations that the six commonly identified 
greenhouse gases are accumulating in the world's atmosphere at 
such a rate and to such an extent that they are putting the 
world's future climate at risk.  For Canada this could mean more 
severe and more frequent weather disruptions, more inland floods 
in some areas, more droughts in others, rising sea levels and 
flooded coastlines, more wind and hail and ice storms, and 
greater threats to public safety and economic security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of global scientific opinion suggests that 
human conduct is certainly contributing to the problem and making 
it worse.  The protocol involved a commitment on the part of the 
industrialized world to bring down greenhouse gas emissions. This 
action is much like an insurance policy against those future 
risks, and just like buying insurance one cannot get the coverage 
one should have had after the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canada, our Kyoto target is to get our emissions down by the 
period between 2008 and 2012 to 6% below the level they were at 
in 1990.  It will not be easy.  Canada's northern climate and 
vast distances, its increasing population and increasing 
reduction, and its resource based and energy intensive economy 
all make our commitment much more difficult to meet.  If we just 
carry on from this point forward with no changes, business as 
usual, by the year 2010 Canada's greenhouse gas emissions will 
rise to about 25% above our Kyoto target.  We obviously have to 
slow that trajectory, flatten it out, and then turn it downward 
to reach our target within about a decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where we will be when it ends will depend upon how astute we 
were at managing our domestic climate change challenges in 
relation to the rest of the world.  We need to marry strong 
environmental performance with a strong economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 85% of human made emissions are related to the way we 
produce and consume energy.  The more energy efficient we become, 
the fewer emissions we generate.  The more we achieve in this 
regard through greater energy efficiency, the less we will have 
to rely on other means to satisfy our Kyoto protocol obligations.

individual behaviour of each one of us we must achieve energy 
efficiency excellence.  From a government policy perspective we 
have thus far used a variety of tools to achieve greater energy 
efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For one thing, we have tried to improve our own operations 
within the Government of Canada. We are on track to slash our 
emissions by more than 20% and to reach that goal by 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another tool is the provision of accurate information with which 
people can make informed decisions about energy use.  The 
EnerGuide label is a good illustration.  A third tool is peer 
group challenges like VCR Inc., the voluntary challenge registry 
program where industries and businesses pledge to improve their 
performances and report their progress in a tangible and public 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are incentives like Natural Resources Canada's commercial 
buildings program which is putting up some cash to encourage 
developers and builders to incorporate best practices from the 
ground up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hand in hand with these tools we must achieve a faster rate of 
new technology development and timely deployment of new 
technology.  This is a key underpinning for everything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider an innovation like the Solarwall developed by Conserval 
Engineering, a new solar based energy saving technique for large 
building ventilation systems. It requires modestly increased 
construction costs one time but it generates significant savings 
in ongoing operating costs year after year, a more efficient 
ventilation system, fewer greenhouse gas emissions and a growing 
market across North America and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must build our capacity for efficiency innovation within 
government labs, in academic institutions and in the private 
sector and we must put that new knowledge to work quickly in the 
marketplace.  For our part federally, we are moving in that 
direction, specifically in each of our last three federal 
budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within Natural Resources Canada about $100 million each year is 
normally invested in the search for climate change solutions. 
Other federal departments add another $50 million annually.  The 
1998 federal budget contributed a further $150 million over three 
years to our climate change action fund. Altogether the annual 
federal financial commitment is now at $200 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no one single silver bullet solution to the global 
climate change challenge. We cannot expect to get everything we 
will need from energy efficiency and technology alone.  Among 
other things, we must take greater advantage of the diversified 
mix of energy sources with which we have been blessed, such as 
hydro, solar, wind, earth and bioenergy.  We need progress on a 
range of other issues such as recycling in the metals industry, 
municipal landfill management, and biotechnologies that can save 
energy and agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to strongly engage the enthusiastic participation of the 
average Canadian consumer.  Taken together our collective 
behaviour can make a big difference.  We need to focus on how to 
get more and more people to think globally about a profound 
problem like climate change and act locally to do something 
meaningful about it through their own energy efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These and a host of other issues are currently being assessed 
through our national climate change consultative process.  It is 
a very transparent and inclusive process involving more than 450 
people representing every dimension of Canadian life working 
through a series of 16 issue tables.  We will start to hear their 
detailed advice this summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line of all this is there is no one answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we open the 21st century we must establish Canada as the 
world's smartest natural resources steward, developer, user and 
exporter, as the most high tech, the most socially responsible 
and environmentally friendly, as the most productive and 
competitive.  With respect to energy in particular we need to be 
the very best, the most intelligent, innovative and efficient at 
finding, developing, producing, delivering, consuming and 
exporting the world's most sophisticated and diversified energy 
products, skills, services and science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is a worthy Canadian ambition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very happy to get involved in this debate. I compliment the 
member for Churchill River for raising this issue for two good 
reasons.  It touches on two things people think about a great 
deal: one, saving operating costs for homeowners, businesses or 
property owners; and two, saving our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We obviously have to do something about the urgent issue of 
greenhouse gas emissions. As much as the Reform Party denies it 
is an issue, we know it is an issue. 
We know that the hole in the ozone layer is growing. We know that 
Canada has an obligation to do something, to do all it can to 
bring down harmful greenhouse gas emissions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I used to work on the oil rigs.  I used to work in the oil patch 
on oil rigs, on those big triple rigs we see.  There is something 
I am kind of ashamed of.  I was always mystified frankly, but for 
the industry's sake I am ashamed of it, that every time we hit 
gas everybody would curse “Oh no, more gas”.  We would cap off 
the well, tear down the rig and move to another hole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes that gas had such force, there was so much of it.  It 
had such force it was actually dangerous to cap it off.  It was 
very difficult to contain what we had tapped into.  There were 
these huge massive reserves of natural gas, a precious energy 
commodity like that and nobody could have been more disappointed. 
The driller would be dejected and the engineer would probably be 
fired for putting us into an area where we would hit gas again. I 
just wanted to share that story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has been the attitude about something the rest of the world 
considers absolutely precious and we in this country do not take 
full advantage of it.  It is our most abundant energy resource, 
yet we choose to heat our homes, businesses and factories et 
cetera with other more expensive means of energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unbelievably, in much of Atlantic Canada homes are heated with 
coal thermal generated electricity, the most wasteful, expensive 
and polluting way to generate electricity.  Some of these people 
have heating bills of $900 a month I am told.  I have never lived 
there but apparently $800 or $900 a month is not unrealistic. 
Imagine a working class family living in a harsh climate and the 
best system their government can think of to provide energy to 
heat their homes is thermal powered electricity.  It is 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It raises the question, should the government be involved in the 
distribution of natural gas?  Should it ever be involved in it or 
should it be left up to the private sector?  I would remind 
members that one of the most famous debates that ever took place 
in this House of Commons was the great pipeline debate in the 
late 1950s.  It is legendary.  I still hear stories about it from 
the veteran parliamentarians who relish telling the story about 
that great debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, saner heads prevailed and we did build the 
trans-Canada pipeline.  We did build a national infrastructure. 
Frankly the plan then was how to sell our resources.  It was not 
so much as how to distribute them in Canada.  I am suggesting we 
need a whole new national pipeline debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I am very proud that the member for Churchill River has 
brought this up today.  Now we have to talk about something even 
more pressing, which is the distribution.  How do we as Canadians 
benefit from our precious natural resources instead of finding 
ways to fire them out of the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that was raised was that with the FTA and 
everything else there are more and more opportunities to get our 
products on to distribution networks south of the border.  I 
would caution hon. members that when they read NAFTA and the FTA 
carefully, whatever rate of export we have we are bound to.  Even 
if we run short of that resource in our country and even if we do 
not have enough fuel to heat our own homes, we are committed to 
maintain the same level of export that we started.  It is a tap 
we cannot turn off.  It is one of the things we have always 
criticized about the free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public should be involved in natural gas.  It is a special 
thing and we have the luxury of having an abundance of this 
resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province I come from, which has a Tory government, 
Manitoba Hydro is publicly owned.  It is a crown corporation. 
Centra Gas is a private gas distribution company owned by 
Westcoast Energy, I believe, or some massive conglomerate out in 
western Canada that owns all of the natural gas companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently Manitoba Hydro, a publicly owned company, bought 
Centra Gas.  It saw the sense in having gas distribution publicly 
owned because it is too important a thing to leave to the free 
market.  Apart from that we were being jerked by Centra Gas. 
Being a privately owned company it was making bad real estate 
investments and then passing on its losses to gas customers. 
Homeowners were getting jacked up rate increases because Centra 
Gas made some bad flip on the real estate market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an example and it is a Tory government. It sounds like a 
socialist idea that maybe we should nationalize the natural gas 
industry.  I am not saying we should go that far, but in Manitoba 
we just did.  In 1999 with a Tory government Manitoba saw the 
sense in having a government role in the distribution of natural 
gas. I wish we could convince the members on the government side 
that there is nothing wrong with that idea.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We seem so afraid to start national projects.  Somebody even 
mentioned that we should not be diving into megaprojects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province we have what we call Duff's ditch. Somebody in 
the 1960s had the sense to dig a diversion around our town so the 
town would not flood every spring. They called Duff Roblin a 
madman for digging Duff's ditch.  It was the largest engineering 
project ever undertaken in the country at the time and it has 
saved our bacon every year thereafter.  It was the best couple of 
million dollars ever spent. Yes, it was a megaproject and yes 
everybody dumps on megaprojects these days but it was a necessary 
megaproject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are arguing that government get involved in a natural gas 
distribution project of this kind.  Yes, it could be called a 
megaproject but it would be spread out evenly throughout the 
whole country.  Every rural area that needs that break and an 
abundant supply of cheap clean energy would benefit.  The 
megaproject would not be concentrated in any one area where all 
the jobs would be, it would be all over the place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Churchill River mentioned the unbelievable 
job creation opportunities.  We could put a generation of kids 
back to work in the new burgeoning field of rural gasification, 
if we did it in a big way and not in little minor flare-ups where 
it was financially profitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really like the idea of one of the Tory members who said we 
should use the old rail lines.  We are ripping up railroads all 
across the prairies.  In every small town that used to have a 
rail spur they are ripping them up.  We could turn something bad 
into something positive by using them as the road beds for 
natural gas pipelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the difference it would make if we could reduce the 
operating costs of our homes and businesses.  Every dollar not 
spent on energy could be spent elsewhere in the economy.  We 
would achieve the multiplier effect where every dollar is spent 
four times before it finds its natural state of repose.  It 
usually winds up in the pocket of somebody like Conrad Black but 
it does circulate into the economy many, many times first.  That 
is a benefit.  Then there are the jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about energy retrofitting.  We are talking about 
job creation through energy conservation.  The natural gas 
heating system is only one aspect of a comprehensive energy 
retrofit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start with all our publicly owned buildings. There is a 
good reason right there to bring a natural gas spur line into a 
smaller community where there might be a federal government 
building.  We could bring down our own operating costs and 
provide ourselves an energy cost break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did a lot of research on this.  When I was the head of the 
carpenter's union we did abundant research on the job creation 
opportunities in energy retrofitting as opposed to new 
construction.  There is seven times the person years in 
employment per dollar invested in energy retrofit construction as 
opposed to new construction.  There are the benefits of reducing 
operating costs by 30% and 40% and creating seven times the 
number of jobs.  It is an absolute win-win situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course that involves the building envelope and the HVAC 
system.  The heating system is where the natural gas aspect of it 
comes in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things industries look for most when they are looking 
for a place to locate is an abundant supply of cheap clean fuel. 
The clean is not usually that much of a consideration; cheap 
energy is what they really want. There is almost the feeling of 
build it and they will come.  If we are trying to expand the 
economic development in rural and underdeveloped areas, one of 
the most important things that can be done is to provide a 
constant supply of cheap clean energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. member again for raising the issue. I 
hope we can convince more people in the second and third hours of 
debate.
