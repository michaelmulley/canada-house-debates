	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House denounce the government for reducing the general budget of 
the Department of Agriculture by 19 per cent and milk subsidies by 30 per cent 
and for converting grain transportation subsidies into direct subsidies to 
Western farmers, thereby enabling the latter to diversify and enjoy an unfair 
competitive advantage over farmers in Eastern Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I take great pleasure this morning, as 
agriculture and agri-food critic, to start the debate on this 
opposition day on agricultural issues because we in the Bloc 
Quebecois believe that these matters must get all the attention 
they deserve.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	With the cuts it set in motion, the federal government recently 
gave the impression that the agricultural sector is of secondary 
importance.
<P>
	I would like to thank my colleagues who agreed to speak today 
in the course of this opposition day on agriculture. They are the 
hon. members for Joliette, Champlain, 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, Shefford,  
Matapédia-Matane, Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, 
Lotbinière and Québec-Est.
<P>
	You will note, Mr. Speaker, that, with the exception of the 
hon. member for Québec-Est, all of them represent ridings with 
a high percentage of farm producers and a wide variety of farm 
types. Therefore, should you take the time to listen carefully to 
all the speeches, you will be fully versed, by the end of the day, 
in Canadian agriculture and, especially, in Quebec agriculture.
<P>
	Accordingly, with the motion we are putting before this 
House today, which you have just read, we are strongly 
criticizing the cuts the government is preparing to make on the 
backs of farmers. In addition to slashing in the agricultural 
sector, the federal government is wielding an axe there, 
completely indiscriminately.
<P>
	I will take the liberty of reading word for word the motion 
tabled in the House today by the official opposition: ``That this 
House denounce the government for reducing the general budget 
of the Department of Agriculture by 19 per cent and milk 
subsidies by 30 per cent''-this is a direct attack against the 
12,000 dairy farmers of Quebec-``and for converting grain 
transportation subsidies into direct subsidies to Western 
farmers, thereby enabling the latter to diversify and enjoy an 
unfair competitive advantage over farmers in Eastern 
Canada''-and, of course, farmers in Quebec.
<P>
	We denounce not only the cuts, but the Liberal government's 
lack of long term vision for this sector. I see the Minister of 
Agriculture across from me. I salute him and invite him to spend 
the entire day in the House to discover what Quebec MPs think 
of his recent budget and his vision for agriculture in Quebec and 
Canada. All he is succeeding in doing is throwing the market off 
balance with inappropriate compensatory measures.
<P>
	It looks like a wind of concern is blowing through the Liberal 
camp. They are trying to target the agricultural sector by waving 
the spectre of the catastrophes that will befall us when Quebec 
achieves sovereignty. We will therefore take this opportunity to 
set the record straight.
<P>
	Of all the spectres being waved by the federalists, milk quotas 
are, by far, the one most often hauled out of moth balls to 
frighten the farming community. Just recently the paper, <I>La 
Terre de chez nous</I>, and the daily, <I>La Presse</I>, described in length 
the disasters awaiting farmers in a sovereign Quebec, according 
to an agronomist.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Also in <I>La Presse</I>, a columnist said that sovereignty is 
dangerous because, if Quebec voted yes in the referendum, its 
supply management system would be dashed to pieces.
<P>
	The Council for Canadian Unity has made milk quotas the 
cornerstone of its campaign of fear targeting the farming sector. 
It says that if Quebec separates, it would lose its milk quota for 
sales to Canada immediately-not  tomorrow or the next day but 
immediately. That hits home harder and is scarier.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11449"> 11449 </A></B>
<P>
	Seriously now, is that really the no side's strategy? The 
conclusion to be drawn from this line of argument from 
federalists is that they have no idea how the dairy industry in 
Canada and Quebec works.
<P>
	What saying that sovereignty would be catastrophic for 
Quebec's dairy industry shows most of all is that federalists 
have found no other way of scaring our farmers. The biggest 
myth going around is that Quebec's industrial milk quota would 
be cut at least in half-that hits home even more-forcing many 
dairy farms in Quebec to close. We all know that Quebec 
producers have 48 per cent of the industrial milk quota while 25 
per cent of Canada's population lives in Quebec. Now, several 
farmers from Quebec, who have gone to the trouble of coming 
here to listen to us today, are in the gallery facing me.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Since it is an 
opposition day and the agriculture critic is leading off the 
debate, I would simply ask the House to maintain the spirit of 
debate that prevails at all times. Although there are no specific 
rules regarding the mention of the presence of certain people in 
the gallery, I would ask all hon. members from both sides of the 
House to co-operate during this debate on agriculture, a very 
important issue affecting all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will comply with 
your instructions willingly and I would like to stress that I 
always send my salutations along with the Speaker's to the 
dignitaries who are acknowledged in the gallery behind me.
<P>
	I was saying just before you intervened that the links between 
Quebec and Canada would be cut if Quebec voted yes in the 
referendum. Trade between Quebec and Canada-get a load of 
this, my friends across the way-is over $80 billion per year. 
This economic integration alone is justification for maintaining 
some kind of economic tie between Canada and Quebec or 
Quebec and Canada. Isolating the case of milk quotas to show 
that Quebec would lose its exports, and that the opposite would 
not take place, is pure bunk.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Quebec dairy farmers play a leadership role in the present 
supply management system. With about 48 per cent of industrial 
milk quotas, Quebec is the main supplier of dairy products for 
the whole of Canada. For example, did you know, hon. 
colleagues, that 40 per cent of Canadian cheese consumed by the 
rest of Canada come from Quebec? It is with this in mind that we 
must consider the future.
<P>
	We will soon have to make a decision regarding the future of 
Quebec. I strongly believe that no matter what we decide, it is in 
the best interest of the rest of Canada, as well as of Quebec, to 
co-operate in order to preserve the dynamism of our agricultural 
sector. On Wednesday, March 29, we had very concrete proof 
that this  co-operation goes way beyond the political level. This 
did not happen a century ago, this was last week. Dairy farmers 
in Quebec and Canada signed a memorandum of agreement 
integrating the marketing of industrial and consumer milk in six 
eastern provinces. I would like to name them: Manitoba, 
Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince 
Edward Island. I would remind you that Newfoundland is not 
part of the supply management system.
<P>
	An agreement was signed to create a common market between 
these six provinces. Under this agreement all farmers in these 
provinces will receive the same amount of money for their milk 
and will have a common quota. You have to understand that an 
unfair practise had existed for years. A farmer who had an 
industrial milk quota sold his milk for up to 10 per cent less than 
what he could have gotten for consumer milk. If two identical 
cows had been branded, one for consumer milk and the other one 
for industrial milk, the farmer would have gotten less for the 
production of the latter.
<P>
	In less than 18 months, this inequity will have disappeared. 
We had this distortion, and it was not in Central America or in 
Central Africa, but here in Quebec. We had two different prices 
for the same milk, depending on whether it was to be processed 
or consumed as such. The six provinces now party to this 
agreement account for 85 per cent of the Canadian industrial 
milk quota. This integration will allow them to put in place a 
single system of milk marketing. In the medium term we can 
even see the total elimination of interprovincial barriers to milk 
supply.
<P>
	The lesson to be drawn from this agreement is that even in a 
referendum year dairy farmers in Canada demonstrated that they 
are willing to integrate economically with Quebec. Why should 
they take the risk of signing this kind of agreement at the present 
time? Surely because they know that following a yes vote in the 
referendum, Canada will keep its economic union with Quebec 
in order to protect its own interests.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	This proves that economic reality is stronger than emotional 
considerations.
<P>
	Federalists raise another important issue, namely what will 
happen to customs tariffs with the U.S.? When renegotiating 
NAFTA, the U.S. will probably try to get a better deal than they 
already have, which will not be any different from what is 
happening right now. Just as Canada does at the present time, 
Quebec will answer that tariffs are protected by GATT, which is 
what the agriculture minister tells us every time we ask a 
question in this House regarding the sugar negotiations, wheat 
exports, and the tariff issues raised by the U.S. the day after New 
Year. This very minister invariably answers that GATT 
agreements take precedence over NAFTA. If this is true in his 
case, it should also be true for Quebec.
<P>
	The real threat against the dairy industry and Quebec 
agriculture does not come from Quebec's possible  sovereignty, 
but from the federal government opposite which is increasingly 
neglecting Quebec agriculture, and especially the dairy 
industry. It comes from a total lack of planning on the part of the 
government opposite and, above all, from the lack of fairness of 
the budget measures proposed by the Liberal government.
<P>
	February 28 was a sad day for dairy producers in Quebec and 
Ontario. On that day, the finance minister announced, in his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11450"> 11450 </A></B>
<P>
budget, a 30 per cent reduction over two years of the federal 
subsidy for industrial milk. Since Quebec farmers alone produce 
48 per cent of the industrial milk quota, it is obvious that they 
are the ones who are the most unfairly affected.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I do not want to use props, but there is in Ontario 
a farming magazine called <I>Farm and Country.</I> It is the 
equivalent of Quebec's <I>La Terre de chez nous</I>. Every farmer at 
least flips through it from cover to cover, if they do not actually 
read all of it. This week, there is a cartoon on the front page, 
showing a beautiful Holstein cow and, sitting on a small stool, a 
farmer who bears a striking likeness to our finance minister. He 
is milking the cow. His pail is empty. The teat is full of scars. 
When he squeezes it, all he gets is one lonely drop of milk. This 
is the kind of future this government is shaping for dairy 
producers.
<P>
	Also, last week, Mr. Laurent Pellerin, president of UPA and a 
great advocate of Quebec farmers, whom I salute today in this 
House, estimated that the 30 per cent reduction in industrial 
milk subsidies will cost producers $4,485 over two years. If you 
allow me, I will take a few seconds to explain how he reached 
this figure. I would like the agriculture minister to listen very 
carefully because there is something I want to point out.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Dairy farmers will not receive any financial compensation for 
these cuts, unlike western wheat and grain producers, who will 
receive $1.6 billion in non-taxable funds, which is the 
equivalent of $2.2 billion. But there is absolutely nothing for 
Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	A farmer who produces 2,500 hectolitres of milk per year and 
who buys 71 tonnes of mash every year to feed his cows will be 
hurt because, as you know, the feed grain transportation 
subsidies have also been cut in the East. The Maritimes will be 
hit hard. The subsidy on 2,500 hectolitres has been cut by $5.43 
per hectolitre times 2,500, or $5.43 less 30 per cent or $1.51.
<P>
	Dairy farmers face cuts of 15 per cent this year and 15 per cent 
next year for a total of 30 per cent for every hectolitre produced. 
Next year, they will lose $1.51 per hectolitre. A farmer 
producing 2,500 hectolitres per year faces a $3,775 cut.
<P>
	To this must be added the cuts to the feed grain transportation 
subsidies. The resulting increase for farmers is estimated at $10 
per tonne. Farmers will be asked to do their share to correct the 
past mistakes of successive federal governments that 
accumulated huge deficits. A farmer buying 71 tonnes at $10 per 
tonne  would add $710 to the $3,775 cut and end up with a 
$4,485 contribution to deficit reduction.
<P>
	As you know full well, what will happen in August is that 
dairy producers will ask the Canadian Dairy Commission to 
increase milk prices, and I hope that their request will be 
granted. Dairy producers are not stupid. They do not have to 
suffer such a major drop in income. The Canadian Dairy 
Commission will allow them to raise their prices, I hope, to 
compensate for cost of living increases and the losses incurred.
<P>
	As a result, consumers will pay much more for powdered 
milk, butter, cheese, yogurt and ice cream. This is called hidden 
taxes. <I>Farm and Country</I>, the Ontario magazine I referred to 
earlier, estimates that every dairy farmer contributes $56 per 
cow to deficit reduction.
<P>
	Surprisingly enough, not a single Liberal member rose in this 
House to denounce the 328,000 flights. As we read in the 
newspaper last week, these trips cost nearly $1 billion in travel 
expenses. I have the newspaper article in front of me: the 
328,000 flights taken between April 1993 and March 1994 cost 
taxpayers $275 million so that Canadian Forces members and 
senior officials, in particular officials at the Department of 
Transport, could travel.
<P>
	In closing, I urge dairy farmers in Ontario and Quebec to look 
out for the ordeal that this government will inflict on them in the 
next 24 months.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very glad to have the 
opportunity to participate in this discussion about the 1995 
federal budget, particularly the impact of that budget upon 
agriculture and agri-food.
<P>
	It goes without saying that I profoundly disagree with the 
conclusions that have been drawn so far in this debate by the 
member for Frontenac. I would suggest that his analysis is 
incomplete, entirely negative in its focus and, with the greatest 
respect, his analysis is wrong.
<P>
	To support what are clearly his separatist objectives he seeks 
to sow the seeds of division in a narrow and partisan manner. He 
seeks to pit region against region, province against province and 
farmers against farmers. It is indeed sad to see this rather 
destructive approach, but coming from the Bloc Quebecois it is 
no surprise. Their objective is not to build this country up; their 
objective is to tear this country down. So I am not surprised by 
the motion today from the BQ.
<P>
	What is perhaps surprising is the similarity in approach that is 
taken by the BQ and the NDP. Two weeks ago the NDP and the 
Bloc Quebecois joined together in a rather bizarre alliance in 
this House to block speedy passage of vital government 
legislation to restore services in the Canadian railway system. 
Until they recanted and belatedly changed their position, the  
NDP lent aid and comfort to the Bloc Quebecois in inflicting 
totally unnecessary damage upon the entire Canadian economy, 
particularly upon agriculture.
<P>
	The work stoppage in the rail system could have been ended 
and full service could have been restored within perhaps no 
more than 48 hours. However, the Bloc made that impossible 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11451"> 11451 </A></B>
<P>
and the NDP helped them in doing damage to Canada. The rail 
dispute lingered on for more than a week and the cost of that 
delay was very expensive.
<P>
	In the Canadian grains industry alone, that one lost week 
represented a loss of revenue from grain sales in the order of 
$100 million, plus the delay caused by the Bloc Quebecois and 
the NDP damaged Canada's international reputation as a 
reliable agriculture and agri-food supplier to world markets. It 
is truly impossible to fathom why the NDP would give 
credibility to the Bloc by supporting the BQ in stalling the 
legislation to bring the work stoppage in the rail system to an 
end.
<P>
	But the rail dispute is not the only example of a similarity 
between the NDP and the BQ. They also have similar approaches 
when it comes to an analysis of the federal budget, which is the 
subject of the motion today. Both of these parties, devoid of any 
national vision, without a serious commitment to Canada as a 
whole, resort to the small and petty politics of fostering regional 
divisions. Each of them in their own way try to make the 
case-the erroneous case-that their region has been unfairly 
treated and some other region has been given some unwarranted 
advantage.
<P>
	The BQ claim unfairness toward Quebec and they attack 
western Canada. The NDP claim unfairness toward the west and 
they attack Quebec. Both of them are absolutely dead wrong.
<P>
	The 1995 federal budget has in fact been very well received 
across this country, and significantly in all parts of this country, 
for three reasons. First, it launched a genuine and concerted 
attack against the horrendous problem of government debt and 
deficits. This budget is for real. It is not smoke and mirrors. It 
sets the government on a true and definitive course toward 
achieving our deficit reduction targets as promised in our 1993 
red book platform. What we are doing in this budget is what we 
committed ourselves to do in the last election. We are bringing 
the annual deficit down below 3 per cent of gross domestic 
product over three fiscal years.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Consider the problem of debt that we inherited when we came 
to office in November 1993. The annual deficit at that time was 
running in excess of $40 billion a year. That was about 6 per cent 
of the country's gross domestic product. Think of this. The 
agriculture and agri-food sector of the Canadian economy, all 
included, amounts to about 8 per cent of our GDP. So the deficit, 
at about 6 per cent of GDP, was eroding three-quarters of the  
economic value of the entire agriculture and agri-food sector.
<P>
	The total accumulated federal debt was running, when we 
came to office, at something in excess of $500 billion. Interest 
costs were approaching $45 billion or perhaps even $50 billion a 
year. That works out to $850 million every week, or $120 
million every day just to pay the interest. In fact, if we were to 
add together all the net incomes of every single farmer in 
Canada for the next ten years, we would barely have enough 
money to pay the interest on the national debt for one year. That 
indicates the magnitude of the problem. The problem is huge, it 
is urgent, and in that last budget it demanded swift and decisive 
action.
<P>
	We have acted. We have met and exceeded our deficit 
reduction requirements for 1993-94. We have met and exceeded 
our deficit reduction targets for 1994-95. We will continue to 
meet our objectives with respect to the deficit in 1995-96 and in 
1996-97. We will bring the deficit down below 3 per cent of 
gross domestic product within three fiscal years, as we promised 
to do. Beginning in 1996, for the first time in a long time, 
Canada's debt-not just our deficit but our overall debt-to-GDP 
ratio-will also begin to come down.
<P>
	Yes, the budget is strong medicine. Yes, it is tough. However, 
Canadians have supported it because they know it is necessary to 
deal with the horrific debt and deficit problem that this 
government inherited.
<P>
	The second reason the budget has broad and general support is 
that it is fair and balanced. It tries very hard not to single out 
sectors or regions. The toughness in the budget is evenly 
distributed everywhere.
<P>
	There are two kinds of measures in the budget to deal with the 
deficit. On the one hand we have reduced the overall level of 
government spending; on the other hand we have increased the 
level of government revenues. For every dollar raised in new 
revenues there are nearly $7 in spending reductions. That, of 
course, is consistent with what Canadians told us to do: focus on 
reducing spending.
<P>
	When we add together the combined impact of all the budget 
measures, the spending cuts plus the revenue increases, and then 
analyse how that impact is distributed across the country, we 
find that in every region of Canada the budget's impact is 
closely in line with each region's share of the total population of 
Canada and each region's share of total federal government 
spending. The variations from region to region are only a few 
small percentage points, so there is a fair and balanced 
distribution of the burden.
<P>
	With respect to agriculture, my department has not been 
singled out for any extra burden. In 1994-95 our budget was 
$2.1 billion. Over the next three years we will reduce that budget 
amount by $405 million, bringing it down at the end of the 
three-year period from $2.1 billion where it is today to $1.7 
billion. That amounts to a cut of 19 per cent, and 19 per cent is 
exactly the  average of all departmental spending reductions 
across the entire government. Most of the economic portfolios 
of government are reduced by an amount greater than 19 per 
cent. Most of the social portfolios of the government are 
reduced by an amount less than 19 per cent. Overall the full 
government average is 19 per cent. That is the reduction in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11452"> 11452 </A></B>
<P>
Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food exactly on average. 
We have done our share in the crucial fight against the deficit, no 
more and no less.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	There are some who argue that when transportation budget 
reductions affecting agriculture are added on top of the direct 
reductions in agriculture the percentage of all related spending 
cuts goes up above the 19 per cent average. This figuring is 
misleading. It ignores the transitional programming put in place 
by the budget to offset the impact of the transportation changes. 
When those transitional measures are added back into the 
equation over the next three years, as they must be to make a fair 
comparison, the impact on agriculture is on the average of that 
level of 19 per cent. Overall the balance is fair.
<P>
	Within agriculture we have tried very hard to achieve internal 
balance as well. For example, in dealing with personnel costs we 
will be reducing our public service employee count by just over 
2,000 positions. That is a reduction of 18 per cent, very close to 
the overall departmental spending reduction of 19 per cent.
<P>
	The same can be said about our approach to different 
departmental spending programs. Take our income support 
programs for example. There are two major programs of that 
type within Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. One is the dairy 
subsidy which is significant primarily in eastern Canada. The 
other is our farm safety net system which is significant 
primarily in western Canada. Both are being reduced by the 
same amount of 30 per cent. Again, there is fairness and balance, 
east and west, farm sector by farm sector and for agriculture 
overall in comparison to every other aspect of the economy.
<P>
	This is the second major reason the budget has won general 
approval among the large majority of Canadians; that 
characteristic of fairness.
<P>
	The third reason for budget support is we have coupled the 
hard reality of fewer government dollars everywhere for 
everything with a proactive agenda for renewal, restructuring 
and innovation to smooth the process of transition from the old 
economy to the new economy and to better position a sector like 
agriculture and agri-food to do better in every available 
marketplace in the world.
<P>
	What I have heard so many times from farmers all over the 
country, whether in the east or the west, is they really do not 
want subsidies. What they want are fair market opportunities 
and decent prices from those markets from which to earn their 
living.
<P>
	For this reason we are increasing our emphasis on market 
development and trade. Within our overall smaller budget a 
greater proportion than ever before will be directed toward 
gaining and keeping new and expanding markets. Similarly, 
with respect to research, the cutting edge of innovation to keep 
Canada ahead of the rest of the world, we have found a creative 
way to save precious tax dollars while increasing the overall 
Canadian investment in agricultural research and development.
<P>
	We will achieve about $50 million in savings on research 
overhead and infrastructure over the course of the next three 
years or so. At the same time up to $70 million in both public and 
private funding will be injected into research through joint 
ventures with our private sector partners. We are doing this 
through a new initiative called the matching investment 
initiative for research in agriculture. It is a program that thus far, 
even though it is very new, has been received very well by the 
agricultural sector.
<P>
	We will maintain Canada's renowned reputation for the best 
agricultural inspection system in the world but we will also save 
money. We will do that through a combination of cost reduction, 
cost avoidance and cost sharing together with the introduction 
of brand new technology and the elimination of unnecessary 
overlap and duplication among government departments and 
between different levels of government.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased to say that all my provincial counterparts are 
working very hard with me in the development of a national 
Canadian food inspection system to be top calibre, the best in 
the world and highly cost efficient.
<P>
	We have also recycled some of our budgetary savings into a 
series of adaptation and rural development funds to assist in 
some of the necessary sectoral changes that must be made in the 
wake of the budget and to take advantage of future economic 
opportunities.
<P>
	We have such a fund to help deal with the changes to be made 
in the feed freight assistance program. The Secretary of State for 
Agriculture and Agri-Food is now leading a consultation 
process to define the parameters for how that fund can best be 
used in those feed deficient regions of the country which have 
heretofore benefited from the feed freight assistance program.
<P>
	As another example, within our overall spending envelope for 
farm safety nets there is scope for a series of innovation and 
adaptation funds to be established depending on the priorities 
and preferences of different agricultural sectors and the 
provinces.
<P>
	This notion of an innovation or adaptation fund has been 
offered as old safety net schemes like the national tripartite 
stabilization program are phased out and as new safety net plans 
are developed, as is now the case in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	In this direction with respect to the dairy program, apart from 
the subsidy reductions in parallel with safety net reductions 
elsewhere, we offered in the budget to undertake consultations 
with the Canadian dairy industry to develop the very best 
possible uses in future for the remaining subsidy moneys to 
enhance the industry's competitiveness. I know a lot of thought 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11453"> 11453 </A></B>
<P>
is now being given to this suggestion by the dairy industry 
representatives in the country, including those in Quebec.
<P>
	Another example of adaptation and innovation is with respect 
to a series of subsidy programs previously known as the Atlantic 
and maritime freight rate subsidy measures which will be 
discontinued as a result of the budget, but there will be 
transitional measures put in place with respect to those 
programs as well. That is under the purview of my colleague, the 
Minister of Transport.
<P>
	In addition to all these issue specific funding initiatives, we 
have provided for a general $60 million per year adaptation and 
rural development fund for Canadian agriculture over all. It will 
be used to enhance access to pools of developmental capital, to 
enhance human resources in rural Canada, to enhance farm 
safety, to enhance rural innovation and infrastructure and to 
offset some of the regional implications of transportation 
reform.
<P>
	Let me deal briefly with that aspect of the opposition motion 
today which refers to western grain transportation reform. Here 
as well there is a program being put in place to ease the 
transition away from 98 years of subsidization. These transition 
measures are temporary, as all adjustment measures are. 
However, they are also specifically within the parameters of 
acceptability as defined by the Quebec coalition on western 
grain transportation. It is interesting that the member from 
Frontenac earlier today failed to observe that fact which 
indicates consistency across the country on the basis of certain 
principles.
<P>
	The benefit from transportation reform for western Canada 
comes not from any form of ongoing subsidization because the 
subsidy will be ended. The western benefit comes from a new 
freight rate regime that eliminates discrimination in its structure 
against higher valued production, value added processing, 
diversification and economic growth.
<P>
	The prime difference between our approach in the 
government and that of Bloc members is that, as we have heard 
today so far in the debate, they have a tendency to cling to the 
past. They seem to be rather intimidated by the future. I do not 
think, from what I have seen in my many encounters over the last 
17 months as minister of agriculture, that intimidated point of 
view is representative of Quebecers.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	I have just returned from a sales mission, a trade mission with 
Canadian agriculture and agri-food representatives throughout 
South America. We visited  Chile, Argentina and Brazil. 
Included in my delegation of private sector representatives was 
a broad cross section of agricultural representatives from 
Quebec. They were among the most outgoing, the most 
vigorous, the most aggressive in looking for new opportunities 
and broadening horizons, pursuing the future with great 
optimism and vigour. They did not seem to have this kind of 
negativism reflected in the remarks delivered today by the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	For example, they were talking about the opportunities for the 
pork industry. They were not worried about any kind of 
transportation reform in western Canada. They were not worried 
about one region winning at the expense of another or one region 
losing because of something happening in another region of the 
country. What they were looking at together with their Canadian 
colleagues from across the country was broadening horizons, 
more markets, more trade opportunities, all of us selling more 
and doing better in the markets of the world rather than worrying 
about one group gaining at the expense of another.
<P>
	If we have that kind of negative, inward looking defeatist 
attitude, we will probably end up being defeated. The secret for 
Canada's future is to broaden our horizons, to look outward, to 
take on the world with the confidence that we as Canadians have 
in agriculture and agri-food the very best products in the world 
to sell.
<P>
	We have the most productive and efficient farmers in the 
world producing those products. We have a vital and vibrant 
processing sector. We have the capacity to excel in international 
trade and marketing and we do not have to worry about one 
market getting smaller because another is getting bigger. We 
must expand markets everywhere. We will all do much better in 
that new trading environment of the future.
<P>
	That is the optimism we need to have. With that kind of 
attitude Canadians, all of us, within Quebec and outside, can 
take on the world and we will win.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank heartily the Minister of Agriculture for making the 
time in his heavy schedule to participate in this debate on 
agriculture today.
<P>
	On the other hand, I would like to remind the Minister of 
Agriculture that there is a new dynamics in Quebec, in Canada 
and in this House in particular. I can remember in the years 1968 
to 1970 and up to the 1984 federal elections, Quebec was 
represented in this House by 74 Liberal members and one 
Conservative, in the person of my friend Roch LaSalle. There 
was nobody to denounce inequities. That hurt the Minister of 
Agriculture.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, is it an attempt to set the West against the East? 
Is it an attempt to set the Maritimes against Quebec when we, 
Bloc members, elected representatives of Quebec, rise in this 
House to say, for instance, that Quebec's share of the $3 billion 
budget for agriculture in  1993 was $372 million, or 12.4 per 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11454"> 11454 </A></B>
<P>
cent. That is not even one eighth of the agriculture department's 
budget. Yet, taxes paid by Quebecers account for 23 per cent of 
the budget as a whole.
<P>
	By denouncing inequities, are we trying to pit the West 
against Quebec? In the old days, the 74 Liberal members did not 
rise in this House to do so.
<P>
	I am doing my duty today by stating loud and clear that $300 
million of federal agriculture expenditures went to Quebec in 
1980, as compared to $1 billion to Western provinces, and $410 
million as compared to more than $4 billion in 1987.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	There are about 18 Liberal members from Quebec at present. 
When will the new member for Brome-Missisquoi for example 
rise in this House to defend the interests of the 
Brome-Missisquoi farm producers? Never. Is it an attempt to 
set the Maritimes against Quebec to state in this House that, 
from 1980 to 1987, federal expenditures on agriculture have 
grown six times slower in Quebec than in the rest of Canada?
<P>
	The list of inequities goes on and on. I would like the Minister 
of Agriculture to give Quebec farm producers the same 
treatment given farm producers from his region, Western 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the 
opportunity to respond to that question because it indicates a 
certain misunderstanding of the nature of agriculture in this 
country.
<P>
	In western Canada the agricultural sector is dominated by 
export industries such as grain and beef. Those export industries 
have to compete of course in the marketplaces of the world. The 
expenditure levels referred to in the question were levels that 
were triggered by international trading distortions.
<P>
	For example, the introduction by the United States of its 
export enhancement program caused the price of grain in the 
world to collapse and the obvious necessity for a government 
reaction within Canada. When those trade distortions occurred 
internationally, the level of government expenditure in Canada 
with respect to the grains industry went up accordingly to try to 
offset those international implications.
<P>
	In eastern Canada, agriculture is somewhat more diversified. 
It tends to be dominated by domestic industries that have the 
advantage of a Canadian supply management system. As a result 
of that Canadian supply management system, those agricultural 
sectors in eastern Canada tend to be sheltered against 
international circumstances. They do not have to face the 
difficulty which has been faced in western Canada of those 
distortions in international trade. It is a bit of a mug's game to 
compare the numbers because two systems which are not 
directly comparable are being compared  and the numbers at the 
bottom line get to be a bit misleading.
<P>
	The hon. gentleman may want to draw comparisons of the 
values provided by the Government of Canada to western 
Canadian agriculture compared with the values provided to 
agriculture in eastern Canada and make that east-west 
comparison. To do that he has to take into account the regulatory 
benefit provided to central Canadian and eastern Canadian 
agriculture by means of our supply management system which 
has in fact been worth billions to the agricultural sector in 
eastern Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at the outset I would like to say to the hon. minister that 
I have paid particular attention to his remarks today and I found 
them quite interesting. I agree with some of his statements, in 
particular the assessment of what took place during the debate 
on the rail dispute and how members of the NDP and the Bloc 
certainly acted against the best interests of all Canadians, 
including the interests of Quebecers which the Bloc purports to 
represent.
<P>
	I too found it very disparaging that the NDP, the bulk of whose 
caucus comes from the province of Saskatchewan would act as it 
did. It certainly, in my mind, was not representing the best 
interests of producers and constituents.
<P>
	I agree with some of the statements in the minister's remarks 
today. I would make a few further comments about his 
assessment of Canada's debt and the need to address it through 
spending cuts. That is certainly an area where Reform has taken 
the lead since the formation of our party in 1987. In fact it was a 
real driving force in getting our party started and attracting 
people to the Reform message and the Reform cause.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	We agree that cuts have to be made. We are not opposed to that 
and in fact our cuts would go much deeper. We have already 
outlined in great detail where we would make the cuts, not only 
in the department of agriculture and the area of farm subsidies, 
but also in all levels of government spending.
<P>
	Another point has to be made in light of the minister's 
comments. I find it more than ironic that this Liberal 
government has suddenly discovered the advantages of having a 
free and open system of trade and trying to capture foreign 
markets. This is the same party which was opposed to the free 
trade agreement. It spoke vehemently against free trade when 
Reform was very supportive of the whole concept of a free trade 
agreement not only with the United States but also an expanded 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11455"> 11455 </A></B>
<P>
one which would include other countries and the benefits which 
would flow to the Canadian economy because of that.
<P>
	I find it ironic that the Liberals have such short memories not 
only with regard to free trade and the benefits of trade in 
particular for the agriculture sector but also for all the other 
sectors of our economy. They seem to conveniently forget that it 
was the Liberal Party that started us down this road of deficit 
spending. I can recall quite clearly in 1984 when the 
Conservatives were sent here with a massive mandate. They 
continually said that they inherited the problem. Now we hear 
the same thing from the Liberals.
<P>
	My question for the minister concerns something I hear raised 
by grain producers in my area. I myself-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. The time is so 
short and if we want to entertain a response from the minister, 
whom I will have to ask to be brief, I would ask for the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
just getting to the question.
<P>
	A concern I hear raised constantly about the payout of the 
WGTA is that it is the understanding of the producers that it is to 
be targeted to land owners. In the area I am pleased to represent a 
big percentage of our land, not the majority, but a big percentage 
of our land is owned by foreign owners. I would ask the minister 
through you, Mr. Speaker-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would ask the 
minister's co-operation for a brief response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand that time is short and 
in order to deal with this issue might take more time than is 
available right now.
<P>
	The budget indicated that in order to obtain the advantage of a 
capital gains tax treatment as well as for other reasons that the 
$1.6 billion payment would be directed toward farmland 
owners. We also indicated a flexibility in wanting to hear from 
farmers and farm organizations about their preferences on that 
subject matter.
<P>
	The consultations with farmers and farm organizations have 
been ongoing for the last two or three weeks. I expect to 
conclude them probably this week. I hope to be in a position to 
provide definitive direction on that question after the end of this 
week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to respond to the Bloc motion on the 
fairness of cuts in agriculture.
<P>
	I will do this by first outlining the cuts in agriculture spending 
and making some general comments on the cuts. Second, I will 
ask some questions of the minister regarding the WGTA and the 
payout under the WGTA and other questions on efficiencies in 
the rail system and so on. Third, I will talk about the cuts to 
supply management and how they compare to cuts in other areas 
of agriculture. Finally, I will discuss some of the general 
shortcomings in the budget that impact on every Canadian and 
will impact heavily on farmers if more  action is not taken by 
this government to get to a balanced budget within a definite 
targeted time frame.
<P>
	The Bloc motion reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House denounce the government for reducing the general budget of 
the department of agriculture by 19 percent and milk subsidies by 30 per cent and 
for converting grain transportation subsidies into direct subsidies to western 
farmers, thereby enabling the latter to diversify and enjoy an unfair competitive 
advantage over farmers in eastern Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	This motion demonstrates that members of the Bloc are not 
evaluating this budget fairly particularly in regard to 
agriculture. I will outline the cuts in agriculture and then speak 
about some of the comparisons.
<P>
	The budget clearly demonstrates that farmers have been asked 
to share an unfair amount of the burden of the cuts that were 
made by the Liberal government. I am not saying that the cuts 
should have been distributed evenly in terms of percentages in 
the different sectors of spending. I am saying that any way the 
cuts in agriculture are evaluated, they are unfair when compared 
to cuts in other areas of federal spending and they are unfair 
when compared to cuts in the agriculture department itself. I 
will demonstrate that by going through some of the numbers.
<P>
	The overall cuts in the agriculture department spending 
amount to roughly 20 per cent over the next three years. The 
total funds available for 1994-95 were approximately $2.1 
billion. A 20 per cent cut means that under the Liberal budget 
$445 million will be cut from the agriculture department.
<P>
	Just to summarize the cuts, there will be an approximate cut of 
30 per cent in safety net funding. Safety net funding is spread 
right across Canada. The safety net money provided by the 
federal government is spent in western Canada, central Canada 
and the maritimes. There will be an increase in the amount of 
user pay fees which will be spread right across Canada.
<P>
	The subsidy for dairy farmers of about $217 million a year 
will be cut by 15 per cent over two years, which is a cut of 
approximately 30 per cent. It will be cut to about $160 million 
after the third year. Research has been cut substantially by the 
budget. Of course, research spending in agriculture is spread 
across the country.
<P>
	Another major area of spending was cut by the budget which 
is not in the agriculture department but is a spending cut to 
farmers and agriculture. That is the end of the $560 million a 
year Crow benefit. That is the largest single cut made to 
agriculture in this budget. Along with that there was about a $99 
million cut to the Atlantic Feed Freight Assistance Act and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11456"> 11456 </A></B>
<P>
Maritime Freight Rates Act. Those cuts were originally 
scheduled to end on July 1, 1995 but have been extended.
<P>
	Looking at the summary of agriculture cuts we see about $660 
million in cuts to agriculture coming from the transport 
department through the cuts in the WGTA benefit, the old Crow 
benefit, the Atlantic Feed Freight Assistance Act and the 
Maritime Freight Rates Act. In addition there will be $445 
million in spending cuts in the agriculture department. That 
makes a total of $1.1 billion which will be cut from agriculture 
by the budget.
<P>
	I listened to the agriculture minister explain earlier that the 
cuts in agriculture have been in line with cuts in other sectors of 
federal spending. That is absolutely untrue. In fact, the cuts have 
been weighed very heavily to agriculture. My concern is that if 
similar cuts had been made to other sectors of federal spending, 
a balanced budget would have been presented in February. We 
would have had along with that all the benefits that come with a 
definite target for arriving at a balanced budget.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	When the cuts for agriculture and transport are put together it 
comes to about a 40 per cent cut in total agricultural spending. 
That is totally disproportionate when compared to other sectors 
of federal agricultural spending. It is almost a 50 per cent cut in 
direct payments to farmers.
<P>
	How did the cuts to farmers, as outlined in the budget, 
compare to the cuts in the agriculture department itself? This is 
a valid point that the Bloc member has brought up today. He 
points out that farmers have been cut by almost 50 per cent when 
direct payments and payments on behalf of the farmers to the 
railways, through the WGTA and the feed freight assistance and 
so on are taken into consideration. When those payments are put 
together it works out to a 50 per cent cut to farmers compared to 
about a 20 per cent cut in the department itself.
<P>
	Farmers in my constituency and farmers across Canada say 
that is not right. Farmers are generally saying they know they 
have to accept the cuts that were made because of the mess the 
finances of the country are in. They accept their share of the 
responsibility but they do not accept the fact that these cuts have 
not been balanced between spending for farmers and spending in 
the department. A 20 per cent cut in the department compared to 
about a 50 per cent cut in payments to farmers is not balanced.
<P>
	I am not saying that these cuts should not have been made. 
Rather I am saying there should have been a better balance 
between cuts to farmers, cuts within the department and a better 
balance across the country.
<P>
	The motion of the Bloc states that cuts have been unfair and 
that some of the compensation packages given have been 
unfairly weighed in favour of western Canada. I am going to talk 
a bit about that and explain that the cuts have been unfairly harsh 
to western Canada. I am not getting into a struggle between 
western Canada and central Canada. I am just explaining what 
has happened in the budget. A little bit later I am going to talk 
about  some of the real difficulties that the supply managed 
industry faces. They have very tough times ahead of them. I 
have concerns for farmers in the supply managed sectors but I 
will deal with that later.
<P>
	One of my biggest concerns about the way the cuts were made 
is that the transition time farmers needed was not provided, 
particularly in regard to the Western Grain Transportation Act 
subsidy, the Crow benefit. For example, for farmers who rent or 
lease land the subsidy is cut off overnight. They will not have the 
approximately $15 a tonne freight rate benefit paid to the 
railways on their behalf as of this year's crop seeding.
<P>
	Over the next two months, those farmers who will be seeding 
their land will be asked to shoulder anywhere up to $35 an acre 
in additional costs. The $35 an acre is an extremely high figure. 
Normally the extra cost will be about $15 an acre. That is an 
awful lot to ask farmers to shoulder with no transition time and 
no compensation package. For farmers who lease or rent land 
there is no compensation package in the budget.
<P>
	The compensation package that has been presented is 
available only to land owners, except for farmers who rent or 
lease land from the Farm Credit Corporation. Those payments 
will be passed on to them. However, generally speaking, land 
owners have additional costs to shoulder immediately and no 
compensation.
<P>
	I would like to ask the members of the Bloc if this sounds like 
an unfair situation weighed in favour of western Canada? Some 
of my other concerns were not so much with the way the cuts 
were made but with some of the things that were not done to 
allow the system to become more efficient.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	A limited amount of branch line abandonment will be 
allowed. We are very uncertain exactly which branch lines will 
be abandoned.
<P>
	The agriculture and transport ministers have stated that the 
present car allocation system, based on historic car allocation, 
will be kept in place, at least for now. Keeping the old allocation 
levels in place will not allow for the changes needed to make the 
rail system work more efficiently.
<P>
	The government will still be fully in charge and will fully 
control the Canadian Wheat Board. For years I have been 
arguing that Canadian farmers should be given control of the 
operation of the Canadian Wheat Board. Canadian farmers pay 
all the operating costs of the board. Why on earth does the 
federal government still control the operations of the Canadian 
Wheat Board? The answer is it should not. Canadian farmers 
should gain complete control of the wheat board. Then they 
could decide what they want the wheat board to be like, what 
they want the organization to be in the future. That was not 
provided for in the legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11457"> 11457 </A></B>
<P>
	Another thing that was not provided for that is extremely 
important is legislation that will prevent work stoppages in the 
area of grain handling and transportation. I have seen a lot of 
fingers pointed, even this morning, on this issue. I saw the 
agriculture minister point a finger at the Bloc and the NDP 
saying that they are responsible for the stoppage in the rail 
system.
<P>
	I see it a little differently. I recognize that the Bloc and the 
NDP did stall the back to work legislation. It is beyond me to 
understand why. I do not understand why. They should not have, 
but they did. Let us take another step back from this. If the 
Liberals had done their job, we would never have had a stoppage 
in the grain handling and transportation system.
<P>
	Since the debate that ended the lockout of grain handlers last 
February, Reform has called-and I personally have called-for 
legislation which would end the stoppages in the grain handling 
and transportation system. That is more than one year ago.
<P>
	Over that year, again and again Reformers said not to let 
stoppages occur. It was evident there would be stoppages this 
year. There was no contract in place for several groups, unions 
and management, including rail transportation. No contract was 
signed. It was predictable there would be a stoppage.
<P>
	When the Liberals blame the Bloc and NDP for the stoppage, 
they are only really telling half the truth. The other half of the 
truth is that the Liberals could have prevented this. Reform 
pushed them to prevent it and they just ignored our pressure. I 
encourage Canadians to recognize where the blame for this 
disruption really should lie.
<P>
	I would like to talk now about how payments provided for in 
the budget will be made to the WGTA, dairy, et cetera. First, the 
$1.6 billion compensation package seems to be the area the Bloc 
has targeted in its motion. Its members feel that is unfair. The 
farmers had the Crow benefit, which became the WGTA benefit, 
which subsidized rail freight to port position. It has been around 
for almost 100 years. At times the subsidy has actually been 
$900 million a year. It is an incredibly large subsidy. Recently 
that has been reduced to approximately $550 million a year, 
based on last year. The compensation payment is $1.6 billion.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Look at the way the compensation payment will be 
distributed. The phase out will only be available to farmers who 
own land, not those who are renting or leasing land. In essence, 
this provides a very short transition period for farmers who 
depend on this subsidy. Farmers will shoulder an immense extra 
costfor transporting grain to terminal positions as a result of thephase out.
<P>
	Also provided is a $300 million transition fund. This is in 
place to help farmers deal with the termination of the subsidy. 
We do not know how the money will be spent and the uncertainty 
is very difficult for farmers to accept. It will be difficult not just 
for grain farmers, but alfalfa producers and processors that also 
used the subsidy.
<P>
	Feed freight assistance will be eliminated entirely. The date 
was set back recently from that initially announced in the 
budget. Three hundred and twenty-six million dollars are 
available for an adjustment program regarding feed freight 
assistance. The compensation package will be available for 
farmers in the maritimes and in parts of Quebec, as will the $1.6 
billion be available to farmers in western Canada.
<P>
	How do these cutbacks in the WGTA and feed freight 
assistance compare to cuts in dairy? The dairy subsidy will be 
cut by 15 per cent per year for two years. This subsidy can be 
passed on to consumers. In fact it has been announced that the 
increased costs will be passed on. I have some concerns about 
that.
<P>
	People in supply managed industries will have a difficult time 
dealing with the changes that are going to take place. These will 
be as a result of more competition coming in, perhaps from the 
United States. This is going to happen. I do not doubt that at all. I 
cannot say for sure when or how but it is going to happen.
<P>
	With regard to supply management, Reform feels that farmers 
should have the right to operate together as they do under supply 
managed systems. I refer back to 1990 when I was on the Reform 
agriculture task force that developed the first Reform 
agriculture policy. At that time we noted that supply 
management is moving toward a more competitive system. We 
said that government should not hide this fact from dairy and 
other supply managed farmers. Back then we recognized the 
need for government to be very honest about this.
<P>
	I found that over the past six or seven years governments have 
not been really honest with supply managed farmers regarding 
their systems and how they will be subject to more competition 
in the future. That is really providing a disservice to 
supply-managed farmers, governments not being honest and 
open. If the Bloc really has any doubt that there is this 
movement to more competition in the supply-managed industry 
then I want to point out a few things that I think will show that in 
fact supply-managed farmers will be subject to far more 
competition in the future.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I am not saying that I like the change I see. I know it is going 
to be very difficult for farmers in the supply-managed sectors.It is going to happen. I am not going to hide this fromdairy farmers and from other people in the supply-managedindustries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11458"> 11458 </A></B>
<P>
	We are headed for more GATT negotiations in the year 2000. 
Under the present tariff levels there is good protection for 
supply-managed farmers. We are going to see a rapid reduction 
in tariffs resulting from the new negotiations in GATT around 
the year 2000. As a result of these negotiations there will be far 
more open access to Canadian markets on the part of American 
dairy farmers and other supply-managed farmers.
<P>
	However, there is a more pressing negotiation that is going to 
take place, which will lead the supply-managed sector to more 
competition. That is the new NAFTA negotiations. Bill Clinton 
and Jean Chrétien announced that within four years Chile will be 
in NAFTA. That means new NAFTA negotiations within four 
years.
<P>
	I would like to ask the members of the Bloc if they feel there is 
a realistic probability, better than a 50 per cent probability, that 
these new NAFTA negotiations will not include more access to 
the Canadian market for American supply-managed farmers. I 
believe the answer is no. There will definitely be more access to 
the Canadian market by American supply-managed farmers.
<P>
	I do not believe the Americans will sign a new NAFTA deal 
that will allow Chile into this NAFTA group unless they are 
given more access to Canadian markets. I am not saying this is 
what I want to see; I am saying this is what I believe will happen. 
There is an extremely high probability that this will happen.
<P>
	Any politician who pretends this is not going to happen is 
really depriving the farmers involved of transition time that they 
desperately need to deal with this very difficult situation. It is 
indeed going to be very difficult for supply-managed farmers.
<P>
	Instead of taking a day in this House to debate the relative 
unfairness of the cuts between east and west, between Quebec 
and the rest of Canada, it would be far more productive to spend 
our time talking about how we can help, if we can help at all, 
supply-managed farmers to move to a competitive market 
system. It is an issue that is too important for us to ignore in the 
House.
<P>
	In the future I look forward to the Bloc using an opposition 
day to deal with this subject. I believe it would be of far more 
value to Quebec dairy farmers and other supply-managed 
farmers in Quebec than this type of motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member's 
speech, who wishes that, the next time, the Bloc will table an 
opposition motion on other aspects of agriculture. In the last 
year, the Bloc Quebecois raised the issue of agriculture on two 
different opposition days. If the Reform Party wishes to do so, it 
can use its opposition days to debate this issue.
<P>
	We can probably agree on one point, I think. The 1995-96 
estimates provide for the elimination of 429 jobs in the research 
and development sector of the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food. The department's staff will go down from 3,454 to 
3,015.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	We know that jobs in the research and development sector 
help build the future, but they are also career development jobs 
held by people with university degrees, technical training or 
some other more practical training, and these people help their 
industry develop and prepare for the future.
<P>
	I wonder if the Reform member shares my view, which is also 
that of the Canadian Sheep Federation. The federation feels that 
the federal government is abandoning, without justification, a 
production in full development. Indeed, this government 
decided to pull the rug out from under sheep producers by 
completely withdrawing from the R and D sector of the sheep 
raising industry. Consequently, that industry, which must face 
market globalization and international competition, finds itself 
without any support regarding the development and the 
improvement of its products.
<P>
	Does the Reform member feel that such penny-pinching on 
the part of the Department of Agriculture is a good solution? 
Would it not be wiser to maintain R and D support at its current 
level, or at least delegate that responsibility to Quebec and the 
other provinces, so that they can develop their agriculture? Why 
would the federal government withdraw from a whole sector of 
agricultural production after supporting it for years? Is this not 
an unacceptable decision? Is the Bloc not right in raising this 
issue in the House?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I also received the memo from the 
sheep producers, who expressed their concern about the cuts in 
research funding to their industry. I received the letter yesterday 
and I look forward to talking with the sheep producers to see 
exactly what will happen to research in that area.
<P>
	With respect to the hon. member's comment that these petty 
cuts are not acceptable, there is an overriding concern resulting 
from the budget that requires that cuts be made. Most farmers I 
have talked with have recognized, reluctantly, that the cuts to 
their industry, while unfair, are absolutely necessary in order to 
deal with the severe fiscal problem we have. Again, I say they 
are unfair because they were not balanced between cuts directly 
to farmers and cuts to the department, and they were not 
balanced across the country.
<P>
	The biggest concern of farmers is that the cuts did not go far 
enough. There is no definite target for the deficit being 
eliminated. I would like to address the impact of that on farmers. 
When the member spoke of petty cuts, I became very concerned 
because these cuts were needed, and more cuts are needed. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11459"> 11459 </A></B>
<P>
However, I hope future cuts  will be made in other sectors of 
federal spending in order to have some balance in the equation.
<P>
	This budget did not go far enough. Our interest payments will 
have increased from $39 billion, when the Liberals took power, 
to $51 billion a year by the end of the three-year budget 
projection period, which ends two years from now. Those are 
interest payments on our debt alone. The result of that is an extra 
$12 billion of taxpayers' money that is being spent on interest 
payments on the debt. Still, with the Liberal budget, the debt 
will increase by $24 billion a year at the end of these three years. 
That means ever-increasing interest expenses.
<P>
	Where is the money going to come from to make these 
ever-increasing interest payments on the debt? It will come 
from the taxpayers, and there are not enough taxpayers' dollars 
to pay for increased interest payments. That means that tax 
increases are not an option. That means that cuts will have to be 
made somewhere else in order to pay for these extra interest 
payments.
<P>
	I encourage the government to take a step over the next five or 
six months to present another budget that will go far enough and 
set a definite date on which the deficit will be eliminated. I 
encourage them to do that. However, because that has not 
happened, and by not having enough cuts or a definite date for 
when the deficit will be eliminated, interest rate costs will be 
higher for farmers, because this continuing deficit has put 
upward pressure on interest rates. Lenders will be hesitant to 
lend; getting financing is going to be more difficult for farmers. 
There is also the threat to social programs, which will continue.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	So not only are farmers asked to share more of the cost, but 
there is a real threat to social programs, including pensions, 
health care and other social programs that they depend on and 
want.
<P>
	I do not think any of these cuts can be called petty. In fact, this 
government must go further in the very near future or the 
damaging results will go way beyond the pain that has been 
caused by the cuts in this budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
did not get a chance to listen to the first part of the hon. 
member's speech, but I did hear the last part where he was 
talking about supply management. He said that in his opinion 
supply management will be gone in a few short years.
<P>
	One of the ministers who helped negotiate this is just leaving. 
I would like to know what the hon. member bases that 
assumption on, that in fact supply management is gone or is 
going to go, considering that I feel we had a very successful 
round of negotiations at the GATT and in fact supply 
management is very well protected, thank you very much.
<P>
	Maybe the member can tell me what he bases that assumption 
on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be glad to answer the 
member's question.
<P>
	I base this on three main points. The first point has been well 
made by the lawyer representing the dairy farmers of Canada in 
their push to keep American products out of the market. They of 
course are saying that GATT takes precedence over NAFTA with 
regard to supply management. The lawyer who is representing 
the Dairy Farmers of Canada has said: ``Hey, guys, you had 
better be careful here. The Americans have a very good case that 
in fact NAFTA has precedence over GATT.''
<P>
	As this member will well know, this lawyer-who represents 
the Dairy Farmers of Canada, not the Americans-has said that 
this is a real concern and that we had better be prepared for the 
decision going in favour of NAFTA having precedence over 
GATT. If this happens then supply management as we know it is 
in jeopardy immediately.
<P>
	The next major thing that threatens supply management as we 
know it is the NAFTA negotiations around letting Chile into the 
NAFTA family. Our Prime Minister and the President of the 
United States have said that within four years Chile will be part 
of the NAFTA family. When that happens, and as those 
negotiations take place, I believe Americans will demand that 
Canadian markets be opened up to their products in the 
supply-managed area. That is the second very real threat to 
supply management.
<P>
	The third threat is the new GATT negotiations, which will 
take place starting in the year 2000. I believe those new 
negotiations will in fact lead to a rapid deceleration in tariffs 
protecting the supply-managed industry.
<P>
	I do not like saying these things to supply-managed farmers 
because I know this is going to present a great difficulty and a 
real challenge for them, but I am not going to hide it. I am going 
to be very honest and open and say: ``I believe this is what is 
going to happen. Take any time you have to prepare yourselves 
for this major change.''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the 
opposition chose to focus on agriculture on this opposition day 
and especially on the budget cuts, our intent was not to say that 
we have something against budget cuts when they are needed.
<P>
	Canadians throughout the country, including Quebec of 
course, realize that we do not have any choice. With the 
economic situation being what it is thanks to the previous 
Liberal and Conservative governments, we have to cut.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11460"> 11460 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	But when the taxpayers are asked to tighten their belts, they 
want to know why and for what purpose.
<P>
	As a member of the Bloc Quebecois representing a mainly 
rural riding, I know that our farmers and milk producers are 
wondering what would be the point of making such sacrifices. 
What does the government intend to do? What is the government 
aiming for when it cuts in my industry instead of somewhere 
else? Is the government trying to put our financial house in order 
so that we can all compete more efficiently against each other in 
Canada? Is the government making short-term cuts in order to 
help farmers in Quebec and Canada better compete on the world 
market in the medium term? Or has the government simply 
decided that to pay back our debt it has to cut spending wherever 
it can, since the important thing is to cut?
<P>
	Under these circumstances, no one will agree to make such 
sacrifices.
<P>
	I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, but I should have told you at the 
beginning of my speech that, starting with me, the speakers will 
be sharing their allotted time.
<P>
	I was saying that the way the cuts are made seems unfair to us. 
In fact, the government announced the elimination of the $560 
million annual subsidy known as the Crow rate and-others 
have pointed it out before me but I think it is worth 
repeating-that subsidy primarily benefited Western farmers 
through low grain transportation rates. However, to help farmers 
adapt to the change, the Minister of Finance will give them $1.6 
billion as compensation for the loss in value of their land, $1 
billion in loan guarantees to buy grain and $300 million over a 
five-year period to facilitate the transition.
<P>
	These could be seen as satisfactory measures. We could say: 
``Good for them. The cuts will not harm them too much since 
they will get compensation''. The problem is that when the 
Quebec producers compare their situation with that of others, 
they see that they are not treated fairly. Take milk producers. 
The Minister of Finance will reduce the subsidies to milk 
producers by 30 per cent over two years, which represents $70 
million over a current budget of $300 million. There is no 
financial compensation to help Quebec producers absorb this 
major cut.
<P>
	We show compassion for the Western farmers, we feel sorry 
for them and we give them compensation, but when we talk 
about Quebec farmers, we tell them: ``You are used to suffering, 
you are tough, so we will not give you anything, it is your 
problem''.
<P>
	The government gives $2.2 billion in subsidies to Western 
farmers, the vast majority of whom will recover their losses, but 
it will not give a single penny in compensation for the cuts that 
will primarily affect Quebec farmers.
<P>
	In the face of such flagrant favouritism, can we really talk 
about a fair and equitable budget? I do not think so. The impact 
of these inequitable measures could be very harmful for Quebec 
farmers.
<P>
	The Fédération des producteurs de lait du Québec argues that 
with this generous compensation package, Western farmers will 
have no trouble competing with Quebec farmers, who will be 
struggling with the cuts. Is that what the government wants? 
This is the question I asked at the beginning.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Does the government want to give some farmers an advantage 
over other farmers in Canada? Does it want to specialize farm 
production? Does it want to specialize crops? If that is what it 
wants, it should say so. Maybe it would help farmers become 
more competitive. However, if all farmers specialize in the same 
production both in the west and in the east, then Canadian 
farmers will find themselves competing with each other.
<P>
	This might work under different circumstances, for example 
after a victory in the Quebec referendum. Then it could become 
healthy competition and the same taxpayers would not be paying 
twice. Taxpayers in Quebec would pay to promote their own 
products and taxpayers in the rest of Canada would pay to 
promote their own products. Quebec is certainly capable of 
responding to this challenge. However, it is not willing to pay 
for the development of both its products and those of western 
producers. It is unfair and totally unacceptable.
<P>
	We could talk about hog farmers in Quebec who are also 
threatened by these cuts in subsidies. The compensation given to 
western farmers creates a distortion on agricultural markets that 
will be very costly to Quebec farmers. The 30 per cent cut in 
subsidies to industrial milk producers is particularly unfair 
because it so happens that Quebec dairy farmers produce over 47 
per cent of Canadian industrial milk.
<P>
	It always boils down to the same question: What is the 
purpose of asking Quebecers to make such a sacrifice? Quebec 
farmers account for 47 per cent of the total production and they 
are being asked, without any compensation, to keep producing 
and to remain profitable. Does the government really want to 
help the dairy industry in the medium and long term or does it 
want to encourage other provinces to compete with Quebec?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Good question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> There is another aspect of this budget that we 
need to talk about as it relates to agriculture. Despite the fact 
that the federal government promised in the red book not to cut 
research and development spending, Mr. Martin's budget makes 
drastic cuts in R&amp;D spending.
<P>
	In the Department of Agriculture, as mentioned earlier by a 
previous speaker, research budgets will be reduced by 11 per 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11461"> 11461 </A></B>
<P>
cent over the next three years. Seven research centres will be 
closed, two of them in Quebec. The  closing-down of the centre 
in La Pocatière, for example, will eliminate 30 jobs and result in 
savings of $1.5 million and that of the farm in L'Assomption 
will eliminate 19 jobs and result in savings of $1.3 million.
<P>
	Yet research is the most important ingredient in the creation 
of jobs, and the development of agriculture and animal 
production. What would you think of a farmer who has to reduce 
his costs and decides he is going to stop buying seeds? That will 
be a fine way to cut spending, but at the same time, it will cut all 
his income.
<P>
	We are acting exactly the same way when we start cutting 
research and development. We keep producing with the same 
methods and they eventually become obsolete. We forget about 
the future and our products become less competitive because our 
production procedures are obsolete and we cannot lower our 
costs.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> There is a lack of vision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> That is all part of the planning problem I was 
talking about at the beginning of my remarks. That is what is 
lacking with this government. Cuts were made not because the 
government has a well thought-out plan, but because cuts had to 
be made.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	To give you an example of the slash and burn policy of this 
government, let me deal once again with the closing-down of 
the farm in L'Assomption in my riding. A lot of research and 
development was being done there. They had new horticultural 
products ready for marketing. Those products would have been 
viable; a fine example of applied research. The whole farm was 
cut anyway.
<P>
	The government put up a new farm building in L'Assomption 
at a cost of $3.5 million. It was inaugurated last fall. This year, it 
is being closed down and 19 employees are being sent home. 
What about the equipment there? They do not know yet what 
they will do with it. Is this the kind of planning we can expect 
from this government? Is this the way the government intends to 
deal with the most viable research and development resources in 
Quebec? If so, the Bloc Quebecois cannot stand and watch while 
Quebec farmers are being treated unfairly, as will be very well 
demonstrated by other Bloc speakers today.
<P>
	This kind of situation cannot be tolerated and this is why we 
will speak loud and clear against that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard 
the hon. member talk about a loss in jobs, particularly in the 
research area.
<P>
	Everyone is concerned about losing jobs in research. We all 
know the importance of research. It is one of the top priorities 
Reform has targeted in our budget and in past documents dealing 
with the budget.
<P>
	I agree with the Liberal philosophy with regard to research. I 
believe that at least what they say is the best approach to take 
regarding research. Research should be targeted better. There 
should be more partnerships developed with the private sector 
so taxpayers dollars are in with private business dollars to form 
partnerships to end some of the duplication in research and to 
spend the research dollars better. Private business needs to take 
a bigger role in targeting research so research is being done in 
the areas most likely to pay off well to business in terms of 
improvement. In this case we are talking about agriculture.
<P>
	I agree with the Liberal philosophy presented with regard to 
research. I am concerned about the loss of jobs in research. We 
cannot afford to lose the research. There is room even in 
research to do a better job with the dollars we have.
<P>
	While I agree with the member's concern about the loss of 
jobs, I ask the member for his comments on the loss of jobs that 
will result from the cuts the government has made not going far 
enough. In other words, there is no definite deficit target set in 
the budget. Because there is no definite target business will not 
have the atmosphere it needs to expand and or new businesses to 
be set up. As a result there will be fewer jobs in the future and 
certainly the jobs that could come-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will take a moment to 
express the Chair's dilemma.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have a topic of great importance. Many members, on both 
sides of the House, from all parties, have already indicated they 
wanted to take part in this debate. If we are going to share our 20 
minute speaking time, and break it down into two 10 minute 
periods, each followed by a 5 minute question and comment 
period, I would ask all the speakers from all parties to keep their 
questions simple, direct and short, so that the member who just 
delivered his or her speech can give a proper answer. Everybody 
should keep this in mind. And I hope that we can proceed in this 
fashion.
<P>
	I give the floor to the hon. member for Joliette.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will give a short answer if you can 
tell me how much time I have left. One minute. My answer will 
have to be short.
<P>
	What I wanted to say when I spoke about the farm in 
L'Assomption as an example of the government's lack of 
planning is that a week before it was closed down, the 
employees did not know the experimental farm was to be closed 
down.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11462"> 11462 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	Six months before closing down, a new building worth $3,5 
million was opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Now, the 
annual operating budget was only about $1,3 million. The farm 
did not cost a lot to operate, but it was very productive and 
yielded very interesting results. In fact, it was just about to sign 
agreements with the private sector, but this was ignored, 
because cuts had to be made. I would not be surprised to hear 
that the real target was the farm at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, 
and that it has not been hit because closing down the military 
college was already quite enough.
<P>
	Thus, the government did not want to add the experimental 
farm at Saint-Jean to the list, so it chose two others elsewhere, 
thinking that everybody would be satisfied and that they were 
free to cut. That, Mr. Speaker, is what we want to denounce.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the opposition motion introduced by my 
colleague, the member for Frontenac. In Quebec, since the 
general assembly on the rural sector in February 1991 and 
following the summit on agriculture in June 1992, we have seen 
the rural and agri-food sectors begin to join forces with the 
common goal of gaining a share in new markets. This was the 
expression used by the then president of the Union des 
producteurs agricoles, Jacques Proulx, and I use it today 
because it describes so well the vision which drives our 
agri-food sector.
<P>
	The stakeholders in Quebec want to regain local markets and 
gain access to international ones. In this respect, one of the 
approaches that the agri-food system favoured at the summit 
held in Trois-Rivières consists in stepping up research, 
development and technology transfer, which are part of the 
strategy to gain a share in new markets. With Mr. Martin's 
budget, the Liberal government made cuts in research and 
development, which led to the closing of two research centres in 
Quebec, the La Pocatière and L'Assomption centres.
<P>
	Once again, the federal government makes cuts unilaterally 
without taking into account the consensus of those most 
concerned. Quebec's agri-food sector is trying to adapt to the 
challenges it is facing at the end of this century and it will need 
all the help it can get. Research centres are a valuable tool.
<P>
	Quebec's milk producers relied on research and development 
results from different sources in order to increase their herd's 
productivity, and they were very successful in doing so. As 
proof of this, Quebec's dairy herds are among the most 
productive in Canada and rank well at the international level.
<P>
	This is a good example of Quebec's producers taking results 
of research and development and incorporating them into their 
day-to-day operations. The whole rural community benefits 
from the research and development, which in turn ensures the 
community's survival.
<P>
	On another connection, I would like to draw my colleagues' 
attention to the budgetary cuts made at the Food Production and 
Inspection Branch concerning the application of Agriculture 
Canada's activity plan. Since April 1, 1995, slaughterhouses 
recognized by the government have had to pay part of the cost of 
food inspections. These businesses must, as a prerequisite to 
their certification, conform to Canadian standards on the design 
of slaughtering and storage installations and, subsequently, to 
standards on the maintenance of sanitation.
<P>
	Consequently, these are important investments, particularly 
for small businesses in rural communities which cannot take 
advantage of the economies of scale and the proximity of a 
sufficiently large market. Imposing charges for meat inspection 
is detrimental to small slaughterhouses. Moreover, it will 
penalize rural municipalities where these businesses are 
located. The government says it wants to create jobs, but adopts 
measures which jeopardize jobs. As an example, in my riding, 
there are two businesses which will have to clear this new 
hurdle, or close their doors. Some fifty jobs could disappear.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	In a recent letter that I received on that issue, the Minister of 
Agriculture said that he was in favour of talks and cooperation 
with national sectoral stakeholders so that they could find some 
options relating to cost sharing, programs restructuring and 
changes in service delivery.
<P>
	Should the minister not have waited to find solutions, in 
cooperation with stakeholders, before applying a tarification? 
And how will he consider the duplication of inspection services, 
particularly between the Quebec Department of Agriculture and 
Agriculture Canada?
<P>
	At the États généraux du monde rural, Quebec stakeholders as 
a whole wanted a shift of political powers from the top to the 
bottom. The minister could take advantage of this people's 
willingness to put an end to the duplication in this sector and to 
guarantee Quebecers that they will only have to fund one 
inspection service and that it will be non- partisan because 
administered entirely by the government.
<P>
	Since my riding is made up of agricultural and forest areas, I 
would like to deal with the impact of the federal withdrawal 
from the funding of operations in private woodlots. In the 
Champlain riding alone, private woodlots harvesting provides 
direct and indirect jobs to several hundreds of people. Also, 
several municipal governments collect property taxes through 
developments and value added to private woodlots.
<P>
	In 1992-93, in Quebec, the federal funding of private 
woodlots generated $71 million in profits for businesses and 
operators, $30 million in salaries and $12 million in taxes going 
back 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11463"> 11463 </A></B>
<P>
to the government. So, we can consider that the government's 
involvement in private woodlots is an investment.
<P>
	For each million dollars invested in private woodlots, 
between 40 and 50 jobs are created, whereas the national 
infrastructure program only generated the equivalent of 10 
job-years for each million dollars invested.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is asking for a transfer to the provinces of 
federal funds and related responsibilities, which should better 
serve the interests of forest producers and workers.
<P>
	In conclusion, I urge the federal government to put an end to 
the duplication of services and to give back the powers and the 
budgets to provinces that were able to get organized and to 
establish equivalent services that better respond to the people's 
concerns and needs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to congratulate my colleague and neighbour of the riding of 
Champlain for the excellent speech he made on agriculture. He 
raised a point in which I have a particular interest and it is 
inspection. I have heard about that issue and the situation is 
worse than what I was told.
<P>
	I would like to hear his comments, especially on the issue of 
impartiality that he raised. Are we to understand that inspection 
costs which were paid for impartially by the government in the 
public interest will from now on be paid for by producers, 
thereby placing the inspectors under the control of producers? If 
so, they will be at the mercy of people acting both as judge and 
as jury.
<P>
	Does it mean that the public interest in that area will from now 
on be threatened by privatization which is expanding and 
perhaps being implemented drastically?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and 
neighbour of Trois-Rivières. There are cases in my riding that I 
would like to quote as examples. I refer to small packing plants 
with between 15 and 25 employees. In the past, the costs of 
monitoring sanitation of premises and wholesomeness of food 
were paid for by the government. The last Liberal budget 
imposed that extra monetary burden on small packing plants. I 
believe that small plants cannot compete with larger plants and 
this is an inequity in the federal budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
really wanted to take part in this debate because, as you know, 
my colleague, the hon. member for Champlain, sits on the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture. In the past, he has always 
demonstrated a keen interest in agriculture.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	However, I would like to hear his comments on the issue of 
research and development. As he mentioned, unfortunately for 
the province of Quebec, two research stations will be closed, one 
at L'Assomption and the other at La Pocatière.
<P>
	I remember the day I was sitting on a committee on 
agriculture with the hon. Eugene Whelan, as a guest witness. 
You must have known him very well, since he has made a 
significant contribution in this area. He used to say to us: ``Each 
dollar we invest in agriculture has a $7 return.''
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member for Champlain whether he would 
agree with the hon. Eugene Whelan and, if so, how he can justify 
the cuts the Liberal government has made in agricultural R &amp; D?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> I want to thank my colleague from Frontenac 
for his question.
<P>
	We know that all the farmers in Quebec really need research 
and development activities.
<P>
	I have here a research and development federal strategy 
report. Each year, the federal government invests almost $6 
billion in research and development, not including the tax 
credits which account for $1 billion each year. Almost 60 per 
cent of the federal contribution to research and development, 
excluding the tax credits, are invested in domestic research done 
by federal laboratories, which include all the departments. The 
rest is broken down as follows: industry receives $977 million; 
universities, $960 million; foreign researchers, $286 million; 
and others, $210 million.
<P>
	On the whole, federal spending in research and development 
benefits Ontario. In 1990-91, Ontario received 53 per cent of the 
federal spending, while Quebec got 19.5 per cent. Yet, Quebec's 
industrial structure does not warrant such small investments by 
the federal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to mention that I will be sharing my time 
with the hon. member for Durham.
<P>
	I rise today to participate in this debate on the motion of the 
hon. member for Frontenac which was no doubt prompted by the 
hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot. For these two 
members, agriculture is to Quebec what federalism is for the 
Bloc. They understand nothing about it, they simply do not 
believe in it, they are blocked.
<P>
	The budget was tabled in February and the reaction was good 
on every front. If we want our country to continue onward and if 
we want to maintain all the services we are so attached to, we 
must put our financial house in order. Mr. Martin's budget does 
just that. It is focused on reduced expenses, not on tax increases. 
For each additional tax dollar, expenses are reduced by $7. We 
are striving for healthier finances by trying first to ensure 
growth and create jobs. Some very difficult decisions had to be 
made and this government had the courage to make them. This is 
what responsible government is all about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11464"> 11464 </A></B>
<P>
	Good common sense prevails now, at least on the Liberal side. 
We have chosen to head towards better control of the deficit and 
we are on the right track. We made some tough choices in order 
to save our social programs, our social security and our standard 
of living.
<P>
	The impact of the 1995 budget will be no greater for Quebec's 
agricultural sector than for any other province or sector. I would 
like to adopt a slightly different approach here and explain what 
exactly is the importance of Quebec's agricultural sector within 
the Canadian agricultural and agri-food sector as a whole.
<P>
	The latest data on agriculture in Quebec are very impressive 
and show a very dynamic, sustainable and promising sector. For 
example, the agri-food industry generates 5 per cent of the 
Quebec GDP and 4 per cent of all the jobs in Quebec, which is 
approximately 130 000 direct jobs.
<P>
	The most important primary industry in Quebec is the 
agricultural and agri-food sector. It is first among the 
manufacturing industries.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	As for the data comparing Quebec to the rest of Canada, the 
province of Quebec is doing very well. In fact, the Quebec 
agri-food industry accounts for 22.4 per cent of Canadian 
agri-food GDP and 25 per cent of manufacturing shipments. 
Moreover, 19 per cent of agricultural revenues, 37 per cent of 
the milk produced in Canada, including 47 per cent of industrial 
milk, also come from Quebec's agricultural sector.
<P>
	If we add to these figures the fact that 33 per cent of Canadian 
exports of pork and 9.6 per cent of total Canadian exports are 
also from Quebec, it is obvious the province of Quebec has a 
very prominent place in the agricultural and agri-food industry 
in Canada.
<P>
	Within the Department of Agriculture and Agri-food, it is a 
well-known fact that the success of the agricultural sector is due 
mainly to the efforts made by all the stakeholders.
<P>
	However, no one can deny the contribution made by 
Agriculture and Agri-food Canada in many initiatives aimed at, 
first, ensuring the viability of agriculture and the prosperity of 
the agri-food industry; second, ensuring long-term financial 
security; third, promoting growth and diversification, as well as 
employment in the rural areas; fourth, ensuring the viability of 
the resources and protecting the environment; and fifth, 
maintaining a supply of top-quality wholesome foods.
<P>
	It is to be noted, among other things, that the interests of the 
Quebec agri-food industry were very well represented by 
Agriculture and Agri-food Canada in international trade and in 
the discussions on the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement or 
NAFTA which followed and the GATT. Moreover, Quebec 
producers and processors have already begun to take advantage 
of the numerous opportunities and things should develop faster 
in this era of market globalization.
<P>
	And what about the four research centres established in 
Quebec for the benefit of the Canadian agricultural community, 
the natural resource conservation programs and the 
participation of Agriculture and Agri-food Canada in initiatives 
aimed at reducing nonpoint source pollution, like Vision 2000.
<P>
	I would like to remind members in the House that since 
joining the cabinet the current agriculture minister has always 
worked in close partnership with provinces, the private sector, 
educational institutions, farmers associations, processing 
sectors and Canadian producers as a whole.
<P>
	Co-operation and consultation will continue. The agricultural 
sector will continue growing very rapidly in Quebec and in 
Canada. Constituents from Brome-Missisquoi are proud to 
have elected a Liberal member of Parliament who is ready to act 
in the interests of all farm producers, from Brome-Missisquoi 
as well as elsewhere. They chose to go with the dynamism, the 
transparency and the consultation I offered them as opposed to 
the consistent blocking by the Bloc. Only a flexible federalism 
will allow us to continue developing in a secure environment 
within Canada.
<P>
	Dairy farmers, hog producers, grain producers, apple growers 
and others, the whole processing industry are and will go on 
experiencing great changes in the vast world of international 
trade.
<P>
	Instead of griping, instead of blocking the interests of the 
farmers, let us help them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
may remind you once again that in October 1993, Quebecers and 
Canadians opted for a change, but especially Quebecers.
<P>
	Before 1984, there were 74 Liberal members in this House, 
similar to the member I just heard. Today, Mr. Speaker, there are 
at least 53 members of the Bloc Quebecois who are prepared to 
rise in this House to condemn inequities. During the last election 
campaign to which the hon. member referred earlier, I followed 
him around for a few days, but he was always hidden away, 
while I was around his riding. I often went to L'Encan Lafaille et 
Fils.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	I suggest the hon. member go and talk to the farmers next 
Monday, at L'Encan Lafaille in Coaticook, and ask them what 
they think of the Martin budget on agriculture. This guy does not 
have a clue about what is going on. He should go and talk to the 
UPA on Bourque Boulevard, just outside his riding, near Magog, 
and find out what the UPA in Sherbrooke has to say about the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11465"> 11465 </A></B>
<P>
Martin budget, especially the cuts in the dairy sector. He should 
read <I>La terre de chez nous</I> and find out what the farmers think 
about his government, and he will realize they are not very 
happy.
<P>
	Why not talk to the farmers he did not meet during the 
election campaign, because he refused to have a debate? He does 
not talk about it, he tries to evade the issue, and when Quebec 
was represented by 74 members, 74 sheep, this attitude did a lot 
of damage. In concluding, I suggest the hon. member go to 
Bourque Boulevard. Next Monday, and if he does not know how 
to get there, I will go with him, he should go to L'Encan Lafaille, 
to talk to the farmers. Then he might realize what is really going 
on.
<P>
	It is all very well to have a bunch of lawyers, but a bunch of 
farmers defended by farmers is even better. So I would urge the 
former president of the Quebec Bar Association to take a stand 
in favour of agriculture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paradis:</B> Mr. Speaker, as concerns going out into the 
field, I remind my hon. colleague that I have just returned from 
an electoral campaign during which I met a lot of farmers in 
Brome-Missisquoi. Afterwards I also met farmers from other 
regions. I thank the farmers from Brome-Missisquoi for 
having voted Liberal in the last election. I feel very grateful for 
the confidence they placed in their humble servant. I thank them 
sincerely.
<P>
	I want to go back over the issue of research and development 
that the official opposition mentioned a few minutes ago. 
Several Bloc members mentioned R &amp; D in relation to this 
debate. It would be a good idea to check if the Quebec Minister 
of Agriculture, a good friend of theirs from their PQ head office, 
heard what the Bloc members said. In fact, this provincial 
minister just tabled a budget in the Quebec National Assembly. 
In the tabled documents, it is mentioned, under ``Education, 
Research and Development'', that funding in this area will drop 
from $45 million to $41 million. They are cutting $4 million 
from research and development.
<P>
	The Bloc's friends in the head office cut funding for research 
and development by $4 million. We should at the very least send 
forthwith a copy of Bloc's remarks about research and 
development to their head office as well as to the Quebec 
Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have had 
some experience with farming. This time of year we would 
normally be out on the land cultivating. Most of the farmers in 
Durham are doing just that. I sometimes wonder if they are not 
better off than I am sitting in the House.
<P>
	In my riding of Durham one in five jobs is food related; 2.8 
per cent of provincial milk production is from farmers in 
Durham. Our grain sales are over $10.5 million. We have won 
worldwide acclaim for livestock and crops. One can see farming 
is no strange animal to the people of Durham.
<P>
	One million, eight-hundred thousand Canadians are engaged 
in the vocation of agriculture. It accounts for 8 per cent of gross 
domestic product and 15 per cent of the Canadian workforce, 
clearly a very important industry.
<P>
	Agriculture is a shared jurisdiction and there are some very 
good reasons for that. This has occurred from the time of 
Confederation and continues today. One thing we have in 
common is we all must eat. Clearly it is very important to 
produce our agricultural products efficiently, to transport them 
effectively and to continue Canada's excellent reputation in the 
export of agricultural products.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	I will discuss quickly how in some ways Quebec benefits by 
this shared jurisdiction. The argument laid out today is that 
somehow the agricultural sector of Quebec has been subsidizing 
some other aspect of agriculture within the country.
<P>
	In 1990, Quebec-these are total government spending and 
taxation figures-received $35.1 billion in federal government 
spending. It paid $24.5 billion in taxes. Clearly there is no 
subsidization process here. This is just a trick with numbers 
taking one aspect of that spending and taxation system and 
expanding it to make a big argument.
<P>
	Quebec benefits in many other ways. In the GATT negotiation 
our government argued very strongly and very effectively to 
protect our supply managed industries. High tariff walls will 
prevent a quick reduction in commodity prices in Canada. All 
farmers in Canada have benefited but certainly the people in 
Durham, a large dairy farming area, have expressed their 
appreciation for what the Government of Canada did for them. I 
am sure Quebec dairy farmers feel similarly.
<P>
	When the supply management system was established in 
Canada, of the industrial milk quota, Quebec had 48 per cent of 
the industrial milk production. That is what is owned currently 
by Quebec farmers.
<P>
	In research and development, and we have touched very 
briefly on that subject, I have an interesting quote from the 
member for Quebec East, the agricultural critic of the Bloc: 
``There is no doubt that with regard to research Quebec is not 
unfairly treated at agriculture Canada''. Clearly even the Bloc 
has recognized it is not unfairly treated within our federation.
<P>
	The federal government spends approximately $360 million 
in Quebec in the area of agriculture. Quebec's agricultural 
production which it sells within the country is three times 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11466"> 11466 </A></B>
<P>
greater than what it exports. Clearly Canada is a major market 
for Quebec produce. Over one-third of the total production of 
Quebec agriculture is sold within Canada. Much more of that is 
consumed within the province. Canada is a major consumer of 
Quebec products.
<P>
	The federal government today has 1,400 employees engaged 
in Quebec assisting with agriculture. By reducing subsidies, and 
I believe this is the essence of the motion before us, we will 
increase flexibility within the agricultural sector.
<P>
	This is what the members of the Bloc have been arguing for 
over the last year; reduce grain subsidies, reduce transportation 
subsidies to the west. That is what we have done. The Bloc today 
should be rejoicing rather than having motions of this type 
complaining about the fact that it has happened now.
<P>
	By reducing subsidies we are giving farmers the ability to be 
more innovative, to produce value added crops in Canada. Why 
do we ship raw materials all over the world while other people 
ship us finished goods? This is something Quebec and western 
farmers, indeed all farmers in Canada, have to address.
<P>
	The farmers in my riding have not complained about the 30 
per cent reduction in the subsidies for industrial milk 
production. They do not like it but they understand it and they 
are less concerned about it. When the budget came down they 
told me to make sure the negotiated stand by the government for 
them under GATT is maintained.
<P>
	In 1993 Quebec's agri-food industry reached $1.2 billion, 9 
per cent of the total Canadian market proceeds. In the last 12 
years Quebec farm income has risen 67 per cent. Quebec farmers 
have the highest per capita income of all farmers in Canada. 
Here they are complaining about agriculture. It seems odd to 
me.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us get back to discussing co-operative federalism and 
why this is a shared jurisdiction. The report by the Government 
of Quebec only last year showed that the two levels of 
government work well together. This was its concluding 
remarks. Overlap and duplication are minimal, estimated to be 
less than 1 per cent of combined federal-provincial spending.
<P>
	In July 1994 the federal and provincial agriculture ministers 
reaffirmed their commitment to work together to ensure that 
agricultural exports in Canada will reach $2 billion by the year 
2000. Canada at one time had 3.5 per cent of the entire global 
agricultural trade. This has slipped over the last two years. This 
joint federal and provincial task force has reset those goals to 
take Canada back into the area of 3.5 per cent of global 
agricultural trade. A federal-provincial development council 
has been established in order to reach these goals.
<P>
	This creates one single window of opportunity so that all 
aspects of agriculture in Canada will be able to market their 
programs internationally. Indeed the federal government has 
donated and committed 50 full time federal employees to 
attempt to penetrate 150 foreign markets throughout the world.
<P>
	In summary, by continuing to co-operate federally and 
provincially to solve the problems of agriculture, to work on our 
research budgets, hopefully not meaner, but leaner and more 
effectively, will make Canada a world leader in agricultural 
product marketing. It will also make for a more efficient 
industry within our borders.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in his speech, the hon. member mentioned one item 
which I find very relevant. He wondered why we are so 
dependent on imports and why some regions in Canada are not 
self-sufficient.
<P>
	In this regard, he shares the view of the Canadian Sheep 
Foundation which claims: ``The Canadian government is 
abandoning without any reason a production in full expansion''. 
How can the hon. member explain his government's decision to 
discontinue its research and development assistance to an 
industry whose self-sufficiency, throughout Canada, has gone 
from 23 to 45 per cent since 1976? Why are we informing the 
sheep industry that we are abandoning our research and 
development efforts, that we intend to rely even more, if 
possible, on imports?
<P>
	How can the minister justify such a decision? We are not 
talking about protecting the Quebec market only, but about the 
conclusions of the Canadian Sheep Foundation, which is 
astounded by the decision.
<P>
	My other question to the hon. member relates to shared 
jurisdiction. How can he explain that, in La Pocatière, where an 
agricultural technology institute run by the Quebec government 
and a federally-funded experimental farm are located, we are 
closing the farm without even informing the Quebec 
government, without proposing any other use for the buildings? 
Is that not another example of the major negative impact of 
shared jurisdictions such as the one that exists in agriculture?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question regarding the closure of one of these facilities.
<P>
	Of course it has been necessary to rationalize research 
facilities throughout Canada. This is not just in agriculture. It 
deals with industry. It deals with technology. In all kinds of 
aspects we have had to wonder whether we need bricks and 
mortars in different parts of the country.
<P>
	Technology and research do not necessarily need a building. I 
notice that much of our technology can be done out of people's 
houses these days. Whether we have bricks and mortars in 
Quebec or bricks and mortars in Manitoba is somewhat 
irrelevant to say the least. I note also that the agricultural 
facility here

in Ottawa is downsizing. In fact, a lot of its facilities have been 
transferred to the province of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	The member has an interest in lambs and sheep but I must 
confess that I am not competent to discuss this matter. I would 
suggest that there is possibly a degree of rationalizing. Clearly 
we cannot be competitive in all agricultural products; we must 
pick those areas in which we can excel.
<P>
	I am not saying that is not true for lambs and sheep, but I 
suspect there are only so many industries within the agricultural 
sector in which we can effectively compete. This area has a lot 
of competition from Australia and New Zealand. I would have to 
study how efficient our industry is relative to theirs to answer 
the question properly.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to advise you right off that I will be 
splitting my speaking time with the hon. member for Shefford.
<P>
	I am using this opportunity to speak on this agricultural day to 
draw attention to a highly questionable decision taken by the 
federal government in its recent budget.
<P>
	On budget night, it was announced that the experimental farm 
at La Pocatière would be closing. As it is located in my riding, it 
is clear I find the closure unacceptable and will prevent it from 
happening. What surprised me most was the justification given 
for the closure in the Department of Agriculture's estimates. 
According to the estimates for the agriculture department, the 
facility is being closed because sheep and lamb are low priority 
products. I would like to prove otherwise to this House.
<P>
	In my region, the agri-food development strategy was made a 
priority for the entire regional county municipality of 
Kamouraska. The lower St. Lawrence regional co-operation and 
development council incorporated it as one of its priorities as 
well. Up to this point, you might argue that this is normal, as it is 
a matter of regional interest. However, even the Canadian Sheep 
Federation together with the Fédération des producteurs 
d'agneau et de mouton du Québec feel that the Government of 
Canada is abandoning without justification a type of production 
that is in full development.
<P>
	Why do we say this? Are these empty words, or are they based 
on some reality? My research indicates that, between 1976 and 
1992, we increased our rate of self-sufficiency in Canada from 
23 per cent to 45 per cent. In other words, during these years, 
sheep production took on a larger role in the economy and 
contributed to Canadians' wealth. More than that. Between 1971 
and 1991, the herd increased by 8.7 per cent. In Quebec, between 
1971 and 1991, the number of animals grew from 88,000 to 
121,000-an increase of 37 per cent.
<P>
	Therefore when the Minister of Agriculture says that this is a 
low priority product, I am hard pressed to find justification for 
his position, since both production and consumption have 
substantially increased. The market is expanding as a result of 
significant levels of immigration in Quebec and Canada. Indeed, 
for many cultural communities, lamb is part of their culture and 
part of their traditional food.
<P>
	Then why cut in this area? We must understand how important 
research and development are for any industry. The dairy 
industry in Quebec, Ontario and Canada was not built on 
nothing. Research was done to make animals more productive, 
to improve milk quality and to manufacture better secondary 
products.
<P>
	As for lamb and sheep, we were in the process of doing the 
same. I am going to give you some examples of research projects 
which were being carried out at the experimental farm in La 
Pocatière, so that you can understand that what is done there is 
not harebrained research, but something very concrete, which 
was going to help the industry.
<P>
	For example, the farm is working on enriching the diet of 
ewes with three lambs instead of two, because this means an 
increase in productivity. This is very concrete. This is 
something which lowers production costs and would allow the 
industry to compete with New Zealand and Australia on world 
markets.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Then, there are studies on regulation of the reproductive 
cycle. Software for flock management is even being developed. 
Computers are now used in this agricultural sector, as well as in 
many others. It seems important to me that such research be 
carried out. Refusing an industry like sheep production the 
research advantages given to other sectors is like telling 
producers who invested in that area that they might as well quit.
<P>
	Here is another example. The experimental farm was studying 
the use of canola oil-cake as a feed for sheep. For those who may 
not know it, canola oil-cake is what is left after the oil has been 
extracted from canola. This kind of research benefits 
westerners, because sheep farming is becoming more popular in 
western Canada, and also benefits eastern Canada because 
canola is produced there. It has nationwide applications and 
would cost less than some other feeds currently on the market.
<P>
	These research projects are concrete examples. They are 
examples proving that that particular farm had a country-wide 
mandate to support sheep farmers. The federal government 
closed this facility because it considers sheep as a low-priority 
product. Was that decision reasonable in today's context where 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11468"> 11468 </A></B>
<P>
farmers are being asked to diversify and to be ready to respond 
to changing markets?
<P>
	Considering that sheep farming is the most ecological kind of 
farming and that it permits farmers to use land which can be 
used in no other way, was closing Canada's only research centre 
on sheep farming, the experimental farm at La Pocatière, a 
logical decision?
<P>
	I think that the decision was a major blunder, and each budget 
probably contains one. The Bloc never said that Canada's budget 
should not be cut, we are simply making suggestions regarding 
where to cut. But cutting research and development funding for 
an industry that is progressing is like robbing Peter to pay Paul, 
and it will probably backfire on us.
<P>
	We are inclined to call it another example of Canadian 
federalism. The least competitive sheep producers will 
inevitably have to call on stabilization programs more often. 
That will put more pressure on the Government of Quebec. We 
find this kind of decision unacceptable and we target it in the 
first part of our motion when we state that we ``denounce the 
government for reducing the general budget of the Department 
of Agriculture by 19 per cent''.
<P>
	If the 19 per cent was cut from sectors which did not 
jeopardize future production, we could have seen what kind of 
impact the cuts would have had. But how can a government 
claim to place a high priority on job creation yet cut over 400 
research and development jobs in Canada's farming sector-30 
of which were located at La Pocatière, in the Kamouraska 
region-and systematically cut high paying jobs which 
stimulate economic development?
<P>
	After cutting 30 jobs in agricultural research, biology, 
technology, unskilled labour, how can they justify announcing 
that 25 jobs were created in another sector the following week? 
This decision appears to be some kind of a nonsense.
<P>
	I think I know the basic reasons for the choice. They gave 
experimental farms specialized mandates, for example, sheep 
farming at La Pocatière. They invested around $7 million there 
over the past few years. They rebuilt a sheep barn that had 
burned down. Then they suddenly decide to close the facility. 
Because only one experimental farm had this mandate, the 
others do not really feel that they are affected. They began to 
sever the strong ties between this farm and the local economy.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I believe that part of the mandate could have been maintained 
in this area. Nowadays, there are numerous stakeholders, and I 
will name a few who are not members of the Bloc Quebecois, 
and may not even be known separatists or sovereignists. I will 
give you an example. Officials from the La Pocatière 
agricultural technology institute, where the farm is located, 
Laval University, the Quebec sheep breeders' association, the 
two national federations I mentioned earlier, the Quebec 
agriculture department, all these stakeholders are asking the 
minister to meet with them so that they can explain to him why  
they think he is making a mistake and why he has to change his 
mind.
<P>
	I hope that the agriculture minister will have enough sense to 
listen to their arguments and to look for solutions allowing 
research and development in the sheep industry to continue and 
to expand, so as to provide support for producers and keep one of 
the oldest farming areas in Canada going, with a flourishing 
experimental farm in La Pocatière as its bet for a prosperous 
future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
clear from the remarks of my colleague for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup that La Pocatière is in his 
riding.
<P>
	Let me remind you again that agricultural research and 
development is vital. It is the key to success. It makes the 
difference between a country where there is food 
self-sufficiency and a third world country that continually has 
to import food to feed its people.
<P>
	My main reason for my interest in sheep is the DLS breed. 
Some researchers, particularly researchers from La Pocatière in 
conjunction with their colleagues from Lennoxville, in the 
vicinity of my hon. colleague's riding of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, and my own riding of 
Frontenac, succeeded in genetically producing a new breed of 
sheep which will leave its marks on the future of sheep breeding 
in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	What is even more disappointing for the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup is, of course, the fact that, after 
a fire at the experimental farm, the federal government, 
typically lacking in vision, spent nearly $7 million to repair and 
rebuild buildings used among other things for sheep breeding. 
Now, in this budget devoid of comprehensive view, it is 
announcing the closure of this research station which, 
incidentally, was the oldest in Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity provided 
by the comments the hon. member for Frontenac just made to lay 
stress on how illogical this decision was. A few years ago, the 
federation of purebred sheep breeders made a decision on where 
its artificial breeding centre would be located. They chose the 
experimental farm with a mandate for ovine breeding in Canada, 
namely La Pocatière. They decided to locate their insemination 
unit in La Pocatière, so that there would be a direct link between 
researchers and the industry, which would promote efficiency.
<P>
	New breed development was just mentioned. This is precisely 
the type of work you can expect any experimental farm involved 
in production to perform to develop more productive breeds, 
groups of animals or individual animals. All kinds of research 
can be conducted on sheep to ensure they can compete and will 
enable us to break into the New Zealand market from which we 
are currently importing. No one here can tell me today that it 
makes more financial sense in the long term for Quebecers and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11469"> 11469 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians to keep importing  sheep from New Zealand when we 
have been working for 20 years towards self-sufficiency.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Now that we are halfway there, the federal government is 
taking the wind out of our sails, without any consultations. No 
one had heard about any such plan before budget night. The 
industry is raising up against this plan and asking the minister to 
reconsider his decision, meet with the survival committee to 
ensure that sheep production will be allowed to continue with 
adequate research and development assistance and that the 
experimental farm in La Pocatière can remain in operation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
agriculture is still the basis of the rural economy in Quebec and 
the rest of Canada. In Quebec, almost 50 per cent of farmers' 
income comes from supply-managed products such as milk, 
eggs, chicken and turkey. Industrial milk accounts for 27 per 
cent of agricultural production in Quebec. Farmers and dairy 
producers in my riding, whether they live in Marieville, 
Saint-Césaire, Roxton Falls or Béthanie, are worried.
<P>
	Under Canada's current supply management system for 
industrial milk, which was established in 1990, Quebec farmers 
receive almost 48 per cent of Canadian industrial milk quotas. 
Forty-six per cent of this milk is sold in the other Canadian 
provinces, for a total value of $400 million at the farm level and 
$1 billion on the market. In Quebec, some 2,900 dairy farmers 
are involved in industrial milk production, while processing 
translates into some 4,000 regular full-time jobs. This shows 
how important this sector is to us.
<P>
	Under the federal budget tabled by the Minister of Finance in 
February, industrial milk producers in Quebec will lose 30 per 
cent of their income over two years. This means that industrial 
milk producers will see their income drop by 15 per cent the first 
year and another 15 per cent the following year.
<P>
	How can this budget measure not involve heavy financial 
sacrifices for farmers and rural communities in Quebec and 
Canada? How can the rural structure not suffer radical changes? 
Rural realities are in stark contrast to Liberal government 
policies favouring the development of new markets and income 
security for farmers. Paradoxically, according to the federal 
Liberal government, these budget measures are aimed not only 
at stabilizing producers' prices and income in light of global 
trends, but mainly at reducing farmers' dependency on 
government.
<P>
	The reality is that the agri-food industry in Quebec and 
Canada does not carry much weight in international negotiations 
on market access. In other words, the federal government would 
rather sacrifice a whole sector of its economy in order to 
preserve other comparative economic advantages it has 
managed to negotiate with the U.S. and other industrialized 
countries. I understand this cold and purely economic strategy, 
whereby the men  and women who make these products are mere 
statistics. The only thing that counts is the dollar figure on their 
production.
<P>
	However, there is a world of difference between 
understanding something and accepting it. I cannot accept the 
fact that farmers, whether in Quebec or elsewhere, are victims of 
the system. I cannot understand why financial speculators now 
have the upper hand, at the expense of those who have been 
feeding us for generations.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> I cannot accept the fact that the 
government wants to dismantle this system, since it will 
jeopardize national security in Quebec and in the rest of Canada, 
and leave us vulnerable to the actions of speculators on 
international markets.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	How many generations of men and women worked to clear the 
land? Thanks to their efforts, that land is now fertile and it 
provides us with an abundance of products of all kinds. But the 
Liberals want to sacrifice that.
<P>
	Is it because Quebec controls 48 per cent of the industrial milk 
market that the Liberal government wants to stop providing the 
basics to dairy producers? Or is it simply that the Liberals in 
Ottawa are continuing their crusade against dairy producers, 
through the implementation of detrimental agricultural policies, 
defined-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Dear colleagues, I ask for 
your co-operation. I understand that, at times, the debate gets 
somewhat heated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> It is painful for the Liberal Party 
whip to hear the truth. Yet, he represents an agricultural riding 
from Ontario. He should understand the issues to which I am 
referring and which exist in his predominantly French speaking 
riding.
<P>
	Since 1958, the dairy industry has always been protected and 
supported under the Agricultural Stabilization Act, which was 
passed by a Conservative government. In 1986, Ottawa 
approved a long-term dairy policy and authorized payments, to 
dairy producers, of $6.03 per hectolitre of industrial milk having 
3.6 kilograms of fats. That policy was implemented under the 
Conservatives.
<P>
	In 1991, the Conservative government abolished the 
Agricultural Stabilization Act and replaced it with the Farm 
Income 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11470"> 11470 </A></B>
<P>
Protection Act. That ended federal support to the dairy industry, 
since this industry was excluded from the new agreement.
<P>
	In its November 1992 budget speech, the Conservative 
government announced its intention to reduce by 10 per cent the 
level of subsidies to the dairy industry, and to apply similar 
reductions to all subsidies and payments to the agricultural 
sector.
<P>
	Starting with the August 1, 1993 dairy year, and following 
that decision, the federal government therefore reduced 
payments to dairy producers from $6.03 down to $5.43 per 
hectolitre. This is tragic.
<P>
	So, this Liberal government simply had to confirm the 
agricultural policy of the Conservatives to gain authority to set 
the subsidy at $5.43 per hectolitre, starting with the April 1994 
to March 1995 fiscal year. The more things change, the more 
they remain the same.
<P>
	The Conservatives used to run things and now the Liberals are 
in office, but things have not changed at all. I am really amazed 
when I read the government's objective in Part II of the Main 
Estimates 1995-96, under Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Canadian Dairy Commission, on page 2-8, and I quote: ``To 
provide efficient producers of milk and cream with the 
opportunity of obtaining a fair return for their labour and 
investment and to provide consumers with a continuous and 
adequate supply of dairy products of high quality''. Is this what 
a 15 per cent cut in revenue a year will achieve? No.
<P>
	How inconsistent can the government get? It is as if milk 
producers are not efficient and are obtaining too high a return for 
their labour and investment. Go work on a farm for a week and 
you will see how tough it is, how long the days are in an industry 
where working hours are not tallied up. Worse still, with this 
statement, the government is trying to reassure us that the 
supply of dairy products will not be affected and that consumers 
will even be able to benefit from this decrease in consumer 
price. And there you have it. A little something for everyone. 
What arrogance.
<P>
	I have a final point to make today.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Why is the federal government, the Liberal government, on 
the one hand, providing a package of transition measures to the 
tune of $1.6 billion for owners of prairie farm land in Western 
Canada because it is terminating the freight-rate subsidies, but 
on the other hand, is implementing no such transition measures 
for Quebec farmers? Why have Western producers been given an 
advantage over their Quebec counterparts?
<P>
	Why does the federal government always apply a double 
standard when it has to protect the interests of English-speaking 
Canadians. Is that not just another sign that Canada is in fact 
made up of two countries? Is that not a sign that there are two 
countries in Canada, one in eastern Canada and one in western 
Canada? The issue is not related to racism, but to the fact that we 
have always had two different policies, since agriculture is not 
the same in these two different regions. When we look at  things, 
we realize that Quebec has always been put at a disadvantage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the speech made by the member for Shefford on the 
impact of the dairy subsidy reduction on farmers was most 
interesting, but I would like some clarifications. According to 
my calculations, is it not possible that the elimination or the 
reduction of this subsidy might result in an increase of up to 30 
cents in the price of a pound of butter? Again, it is the working 
poor who would be hardest hit by such an increase.
<P>
	For someone who earns $50,000 a year, a 30 cent increase in 
the price of butter is no big deal, but for a single parent who 
earns $10,000, $12,000 or $15,000 a year, having to pay 30 cents 
more for each pound of butter makes a big difference. Is this not 
what might happen so that, in the end, it is the consumer who 
will have to pay the price, which means that low-income 
Canadians will be more directly affected than others?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. I can only tell members of this House that dairy 
producers will obviously feel insecure. Other agricultural 
producers also have their own problems, but I wanted to talk 
specifically about dairy producers today since we have agreed 
that we should discuss all sectors of the agricultural industry. In 
this sector, there will be a 15 per cent decrease in revenues, 
which means, of course, that prices might or certainly will 
increase.
<P>
	I would also like to tell you that farmers, including dairy and 
other producers, often have to keep investing and taking risks 
after working for so many years, hoping for better things to 
come. Before the farmers came the pioneers who cleared the 
land on which our country is built, and we always had two 
agricultural policies in Canada because we always had two 
completely different systems.
<P>
	As I was saying earlier, Canada and Quebec have two different 
systems. Once we recognize that fact, it will be much easier to 
negotiate. I think that Quebec has always been disadvantaged 
compared to western Canada, and we have the figures to prove 
it. I am not saying that western producers do not have any 
problems. Of course they have very serious problems, but so do 
dairy and other producers in Quebec and they cannot be left at a 
disadvantage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, under Standing Order 43(2), I would like to 
indicate to you that Liberal members will be sharing their 
allotted time for the rest of the day. Sir Winston Churchill once 
made in the British House of Commons the following remarks 
which the Chair did not find unparliamentary: ``The opposite of 
the truth has never been expressed more accurately''. That is 
exactly what I think of the remarks made by the hon. member I 
just heard.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11471"> 11471 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	That Bloc Quebecois member just told us, as you could hear, 
that there will be a 30 per cent reduction in dairy farmers's 
income over two years. Mr. Speaker, you heard yourself those 
nonsensical remarks made by a member of the House. I do not 
know who wrote the hon. member's speech, but that person 
should be fired immediately for writing such things. Yes, phone 
him and fast.
<P>
	I will now tell all Canadians in my riding, in Quebec and 
throughout Canada what the facts really are: the milk subsidy is 
now $5.43 per hectolitre, and it will reduced to $3.80, starting 
August 1, 1996. This means there will be an 80 cent reduction a 
year per hectolitre on an income of $54. Could members 
opposite explain to me how they can suggest that an 80 cent 
reduction on an income of $54 represents a 30 per cent cut? 
What kind of number crunchers do they have to come up with 
such figures?
<P>
	The hon. member says it is in the budget. Mr. Speaker, the 
member opposite should check the budget if he believes the 
figures just given by the hon. member for Shefford. Besides, the 
80 cent reduction applies only to industrial milk and not fluid 
milk.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Assuming a 50-50 split on a farm of industrial and fluid milk, 
we are talking about an overall reduction of 40 cents a hectolitre 
on $54. The people across are alleging that it is a 30 per cent 
reduction in revenue. Forty cents on $54 is less than 1 per cent. 
That is the way the truth is being described by some hon. 
members across.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	No, Mr. Speaker, what we have heard today from the Bloc 
Quebecois is quite frankly inflammatory and an attempt to scare 
Canadians. Listen to what the hon. member for Frontenac says in 
his motion: ``That this House denounce the government for 
reducing the general budget of the Department of Agriculture by 
19 per cent and milk subsidies by 30 per cent and for 
converting-''. Now listen to this: if this is true, it means that 
the reverse is also true of what was said by the hon. member for 
Shefford, because that is not what he said. I continue to quote the 
motion: ``-and for converting grain transportation subsidies 
into direct subsidies to western farmers-''. And now listen to 
this: ``-thereby enabling the latter to diversify and enjoy an 
unfair competitive advantage over farmers in Eastern Canada.''
<P>
	I just heard members insisting that farmers from other parts of 
Canada enjoyed an unfair competitive advantage over those in 
Eastern Canada.
<P>
	Now this is divisive politics. The comments we heard from a 
member a few moments ago are dangerous because they are an 
invitation to Canadians, on false premises, to hate each other. 
That is the kind of propaganda we are getting from some of the 
members opposite, and I do not buy that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I do not believe that western Canadian farmers have been 
treated more fairly than farmers from another part of the 
country. All governments in Canada, be they the Liberal 
government now, the previous Conservative one or others, may 
have made mistakes but they have not tried to pit one group of 
Canadians against the other, the way it is alleged by some 
members of this House of Commons today. To make that kind of 
representation on the floor of the House of Commons is nothing 
short of shameful. It is shameful.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Let us get to the bottom of the issue. Members across the way 
are talking about the reduction of 80 cents per hectolitre. It is 
there and I will not deny it. It affects my constituents probably 
more than the constituents of any other MP in Canada. I have 
more dairy farmers in my riding than does anyone else in the 
House. However, the fact still remains that the reduction of 80 
cents per hectolitre in subsidy cannot be compared with the total 
elimination of the Western Grain Transportation Act and the 
one-time subsidy they will get in the transition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If Bloc members claim that western farmers are treated better 
and even enjoy an unfair advantage, according to the motion 
before the House today, why do they not demand instead that 
farmers and dairy producers be paid three years' worth of 
subsidies immediately, as compensation for the elimination of 
milk subsidies? I have yet to see one member of the Bloc request 
the equivalent of what was offered to western farmers.
<P>
	Why have they not asked for it, Mr. Speaker? Because dairy 
producers are better off keeping the remaining 70 per cent of 
dairy subsidies, as opposed to what was offered western 
producers.
<P>
	That is why we did not suggest it and that is why they did not 
ask for it. In fact, I would not favour this option either. I would 
rather keep the remaining 70 per cent.
<P>
	I am not proud of these cuts, Mr. Speaker. No one is glad to 
lose money. However, we know that sacrifices had to be made to 
ensure the long-term viability of the agricultural sector and of 
the whole Canadian economy. Our government made budget 
cuts, but I do not think it acted unfairly. I am sure it did not want 
to give anyone an unfair competitive advantage. I would urge 
the member of the Bloc Quebecois to withdraw the allegation he 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11472"> 11472 </A></B>
<P>
made in referring to farmers elsewhere in Canada. It is not at all 
helpful to debate, and he should be ashamed of making this 
allegation, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have here an article from <I>Le Droit</I> the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is described as ``a lion 
transformed into a mouse''.
<P>
	If farmers had been attacked, or struck, or knocked about 
when he was a member of the Opposition, the Liberal Party whip 
would have made the exact same speech as the one he just gave, 
but in reverse. Here it says that the member from the other side 
is inflexible in the area of agriculture, he refuses any measure 
affecting the farmers who make up a good portion of his 
constituency, including Réjean Pommainville.
<P>
	I have here a paper, <I>Farm and Country</I>, which is the 
equivalent of our <I>La terre de chez nous</I> in Quebec. It says this 
measure will cost farmers $56 per head of cattle. You heard me 
right, $56 per head of cattle. Farmers in his riding have 60 head 
of cattle each on average, and Réjean Pommainville has 75. 
Multiply these figures by 56 and you will reduce the deficit that 
the Liberals, among others, have generated year after year since 
1970.
<P>
	I have here notes from the press conference held last week by 
the president of the UPA, the Quebec Union des producteurs 
agricoles.
<P>
	He spoke about the subsidy for industrial milk. I suggest my 
colleague, the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, 
phone the UPA and get information on this. I will gladly give 
him the number if need be, like he did two weeks ago on Sunday 
when he gave us a phone number where the information given 
was exactly the opposite.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	The UPA's notes say this: $5.43 by hectolitre, a 30 per cent cut 
over two years; I am honest, I say it. This does not represent 80 
cents or even 90 cents. I would invite him to do the calculation: 
$5.43 multiplied by 0.3 represent a $1.51 reduction by 
hectolitre.
<P>
	So, if a farmer has a quota of 2,500 hectolitres, it means a 
contribution of $3,775 to the reduction of the deficit that the 
member himself helped to create and, on top of that, he is cutting 
the transport subsidy for feed, which is estimated at $10 per ton. 
If this farmer buys 71 tons to feed his cows that will produce 
2,500 hectolitres, he will have to contribute $710 more.
<P>
	So, for the farmers in Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, the 
average contribution is $4,485. The lion, the member of the rat 
pack who got to be well known while in the opposition has 
become a mouse. He should go and meet the people from the 
UPA, he should visit the live animals auction houses to see the 
big disappointment that the Liberal budget has created 
throughout Quebec and throughout rural Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, first let me thank the member 
opposite for quoting the hon. member for Prince 
Edward-Hastings. In fact, his quote from <I>Farm and Country</I> is 
of a statement by the member for Prince Edward-Hastings. 
However, he forgot half the sentence. The hon. member for 
Prince Edward-Hastings did say: ``It is true, 80 cents a 
hectolitre multiplied by 70 hectolitres comes out to $56 a cow''. 
This is true. That is supposing that all of the milk of the producer 
in question is industrial milk. As the average is usually 50-50, 
the figures of the hon. member opposite are twice as high as they 
should be.
<P>
	I would like in addition, if I may, to talk about the matter of 
the Coopérative Avicole de St-Isidore. We spoke of the 
co-operative and of what the Coopérative Avicole de St-Isidore 
had said. I quote from a letter dated March 27, 1995 to Mr. Don 
Boudria, written on the Coopérative Avicole de St-Isidore 
letterhead. I will read the rest and will be pleased to table this in 
the House: ``Due to the rail strike, we no longer benefit from the 
price guaranteed by the railways. We are forced to buy at market 
prices, which are 20 per cent higher, thus increasing our 
production costs. I hope you will be able to remedy the situation. 
Yours truly, Alain Léger.''
<P>
	This is dated March 27, 1995, that is, last Monday. I therefore 
say to the hon. member opposite that I have proof in hand that 
the price of soya was up 20 per cent. If he feels he has evidence 
to the contrary, he should table it. But of course he has none.
<P>
	No one celebrates when subsidies are upset, and one sector or 
another in our society loses revenues. Granted, no one is 
celebrating, but the cuts were made fairly and equitably by an 
honest government wishing to do the best possible for 
Canadians, whether they live in Quebec or elsewhere.
<P>
	The only thing I find lacking in the speeches by the hon. 
members opposite is the fact that they did not check with head 
office. I realize they are just a branch in Ottawa, but cuts were 
made in Quebec to subsidies and services to the agricultural 
sector, particularly in research. The hon. members opposite 
have unfortunately forgotten this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
to take part in the debate today.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to make a few comments at the outset to continue 
where my colleague from Glengarry-Prescott-Russell left 
off.
<P>
	I had the opportunity and the privilege yesterday to spend 
most of the day in the riding of Beauharnois-Salaberry, where I 
met with 125 or 130 dairy farmers for a couple of hours after 
lunch. During that time I spoke to them about what we had done 
in the budget as far as agriculture is concerned. We talked  about 
the WGTA and the effects of that. I spoke about the changes to 
the federal support for the industrial milk program. One gentle-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11473"> 11473 </A></B>
<P>
man stood up and said: ``Yes, we know all about the budget. We 
don't have a problem with the budget. We would like to have you 
discuss with us the challenge the United States is putting 
forward as far as supply management in Canada is concerned.'' 
There were no objections at all to what he said.
<P>
	That is significant and indicative that the dairy farmers have 
accepted it. They recognize that we are in a time of tremendous 
change, tremendous opportunity and tremendous and 
unprecedented challenges. The key words are that we are in a 
time of unprecedented opportunity.
<P>
	I had the opportunity yesterday to visit three family dairy 
farms in the Ormstown area. They are excellent dairy farms, 
tremendous dairy farms. They were not milking what I would 
consider to be a lot of cows. They were getting excellent returns, 
excellent production, and they were very well-managed farms.
<P>
	I assured them this government understands and recognizes 
the importance of those types of farming operations, the 
importance of supply management, and that we are here to 
support them.
<P>
	I will put in context some of the figures the members opposite 
have been throwing out-yes, throwing out. I can see the 
member for Frontenac smiling right now. He is probably going 
to try to quote some more from the newspaper he just quoted 
from. He is smiling all the more; I know he is. He just cannot 
wait until I get my 10 minutes in so he can get his 5 in. I would 
ask him to quote completely.
<P>
	I was simply stating the facts, that if 100 per cent of the milk 
from the average cow in Canada today was used in the industrial 
milk market, the 81 cents per hectolitre would mean $56 per 
cow. I said in that article, and I believe I was quoted in that 
article as saying, that yes, we recognize that is not a small 
amount of money, but we have to put it in perspective. Any 
decrease in anybody's income is significant. There is no 
question about that.
<P>
	However, I want to put it in perspective. For the average 
producer in the province of Quebec, the decrease in their income 
because of this change in the support to the industrial milk will 
be $1,341 based on the production of industrial milk in the 
1993-94 dairy year. I am not making light of the fact that this is 
$1,341. It certainly is considerably different from an addition; it 
is less.
<P>
	As I said to the producers I chatted with yesterday, do not 
underestimate or undersell what they in their industry have done 
in the last number of years, including the manner in which they 
have used the genetic gene pool in Canada to increase 
production and the manner in which they have used management 
practices to increase production in this country. If we look at 
what our dairy industry has done in the last 12 to 15 years, they 
have increased their production by incredible amounts.
<P>
	I was in a barn yesterday near Ormstown, Quebec. I saw a cow 
there and she was the best cow in the barn, I admit. If my 
memory serves me correctly, that cow, in her last 365 days of 
production, produced 30,000 pounds of milk. When my father 
sold our dairy herd, a commercial working herd, in the 
mid-1960s, I do not think my father had a cow that produced 
over 8,000 or 9,000 pounds.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	At that meeting of dairy farmers yesterday-I put this to 
them-how many people would have thought 15 years ago that 
we would see cows in Canada, the very top ones, producing 
30,000 pounds of milk? The efficiency, and what the industry 
has done, is absolutely phenomenal. I am proud to say they are 
not finished yet. Yes, this is a challenge to the dairy industry, but 
I have every confidence that it is one they can meet and beat.
<P>
	Leading up to the budget we all said, in all parts of the House, 
including the opposition in question period, that the budget, in 
all aspects, must be fair, it must be equitable and it must be 
effective. When we look at what we have done in agriculture, it 
meets all those tests.
<P>
	In question period and in the late show period I have 
addressed to the member for Frontenac the concern about the 
WGTA and how it affects the west versus eastern Canada, in 
particular the province of Quebec. I want to state it again. Let us 
make it clear that the $1.6 billion ex gratia payment that is being 
made to the western Canadian grain growers is a one-time 
payment. It is over. They get no further support on 
transportation as of August 1 of this year.
<P>
	The support to the industrial milk portion of the Quebec 
production as of August 1 this year is still at 85 per cent of where 
it was before versus zero to the grain export in western Canada. 
The payment in western Canada is roughly equivalent to 
ratcheting that payment down at the rate of about 10 per cent per 
year over the next 10 years.
<P>
	I have been asked by the minister to lead the consultation that 
must take place over the next few months as far as what we 
collectively, the government, the industry and all stakeholders 
in the industry, do with the support to the industrial milk 
program as time goes on. As we know, the budget stated very 
clearly a 15 per cent reduction this year, a 15 per cent reduction 
next year, but it does not address the size of the amount or if 
there is money left after that.
<P>
	The first meeting happened this morning in my office with the 
chairman of the National Dairy Council. Meetings are being 
arranged with the president of the Dairy Farmers of Canada, the 
Grocery Products Manufacturers, the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture, UPA, OFA and the different provincial marketing 
boards so that we can continue having consultations with all of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11474"> 11474 </A></B>
<P>
them to find out how they want to treat the remainder of that as 
we go forward.
<P>
	The total support in the last year was about $228 million. That 
will be reduced 15 per cent this year. It is going to be about $193 
million. I point out that out of that $228 million, $106,106,000 
went to the province of Quebec. That is because they have 47 per 
cent of the industrial milk production.
<P>
	The question is put forward: with the 1981 census being 
reduced this year, can that be recovered from the marketplace? I 
addressed that as well in the article, from which the member 
may quote me. That discussion is there.
<P>
	The minister has been very clear. He does not wish to make a 
statement on that at this time. There are ongoing discussions 
about the cost-of-production formula. In a responsible way, all 
participants in the dairy industry have taken a look at the 
recovery of their costs from the marketplace for the farmers for 
their milk. They did that in a responsible way before. In doing 
so, they considered what an increase in the price of raw milk to 
the processors would mean to the processors and what the 
processors might have to do with the cost of the product they 
produce for the Canadian consumer.
<P>
	I want to point out as well that the dairy industry-I believe 
that is what the opposition is probably hinting at here today-as 
well as the supply-managed sector, but in particular the dairy 
industry, is not subject, because of the protection we were able 
to keep, to the tariffication in GATT, the high levels of tariff, 
which is deserving. Those producers certainly deserve a return 
on their investment, on their risk and on their management. The 
efficient producers deserve a fair return. It is there for them. It is 
what the level of tariff protection provides for them.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	I must also remind members that their production is not 
subject to the vagaries and challenges as much. Ninety per cent 
of their production is domestic, it is not on the export market. 
However the grain producers in western Canada are totally at the 
whim of world markets. Our supply managed producers are not 
subjected to that.
<P>
	They have a tremendous amount of built-in support. It is not 
something that one can put a dollar value on by getting out a 
bunch of charts, sheets and graphs and adding up a bunch of 
figures. It is there. We are proud to have it there. We are going to 
fight to the last straw the challenge of the United States.
<P>
	Every indication we have is that GATT overrides NAFTA as 
far as what we have done in the past. The Prime Minister has told 
the president of the Dairy Farmers of Canada and the president 
of the UPA to their faces-the minister and I were present at that 
meeting-that what we have done as Canadians is right. We are 
going to fight for it. That is the way we are going to go.
<P>
	We also have to recognize, and the dairy industry does, that 
even though reforms have been made, still more reforms will 
have to be made. The way I have referred to it for a number of 
years is that they have done it in the past and can continue to do 
so The dairy industry has shown it can roll with the punches. It 
has been successful in its genetics management, marketing, and 
so on. I could go on. The producers are an important link in that 
chain. The processors are an important link. There is some 
export. The consumers are an important link.
<P>
	It is important that every efficient link in that chain has a fair 
return on investment and the risk involved in the industry. We 
will fight to maintain that. We look forward to the co-operation 
of the Bloc Quebecois in doing so not only for the farmers in 
Quebec but for the farmers in all of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I would like to cordially congratulate the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture for his contribution to 
the debate today the purpose of which is to expose the unjustness 
of the particular treatment that the government will unfairly 
give to the west.
<P>
	I found it particularly entertaining, since he knows the 
farming sector so well, when he talked about cows producing 
astronomical quantities of milk. I am proud to announce that in 
1990, the champion milk producer, a Holstein cow, lived in my 
riding, in the parish of Plessisville.
<P>
	I would also like to say that the parliamentary secretary 
certainly must frequent different dairy producers than I do. I 
have with me a photocopy of an editorial by Claude Rivard 
which was published in the newspaper <I>Le producteur de lait 
québécois</I>. Mr. Rivard is no small fry. He is the president for 
Quebec and vice-president of Dairy Farmers of Canada. 
Obviously, the title of his editorial is ``The federal government's 
heavy hand''.
<P>
	I would now like to contradict what the parliamentary 
secretary said regarding research and development in the 
farming sector. Mr. Martin's axe has not just nicked dairy and 
transportation subsidies. The government has announced that it 
intends to completely withdraw from all dairy control programs 
within three years. How can we produce world champion cows 
with no control in the sector? Research and development are the 
cornerstones of dairy production.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11475"> 11475 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Had it not been for previous governments investing public 
funds in genetics and milk recording, we would still be like 
some Latin American and South or North African countries. 
Within three years, the federal government will have withdrawn 
from the industry and be quite proud of itself.
<P>
	In 1990, the top dairy cow in Canada was in the parish of 
Plessisville. Yet, in 1995, the government cuts funding. It 
announces plans to cut it completely within three years.
<P>
	The hon. parliamentary secretary raised another interesting 
point in his remarks. He said, and this is true, that, in Ontario, 
milk production is about 50 per cent for industrial use and 50 per 
cent for drinking. In Quebec, this is not the case, of course.
<P>
	Does he not realize that years of relentless work have gone 
into milk pricing? We are in the process of narrowing the gap 
and, 16 or 17 months from now, on August 1, 1996, we should 
have achieved uniformity in milk pricing.
<P>
	However, by cutting $1.51 per hectolitre off the price of 
industrial milk, he just increased the price differential between 
the two again. Of course, milk producers are digging into the 
temporary equivalent stabilization fund but there is hardly any 
money left in this fund. I know what is going to happen. The 
government will boast, saying: ``We did not raise taxes; we did 
not have the heart to do that''. It cuts its tax transfers to the 
provinces, forcing the provinces to cut their transfers to the 
municipalities and, in turn, the municipalities will be forced to 
increase our property taxes.
<P>
	What will milk producers do come August 1? They will go to 
the Canadian Dairy Commission and ask that the price of their 
industrial milk be raised. Then, milk processors will raise the 
price of butter, cheese, yogurt and ice cream by 25, 30, 35 cents a 
pound. And the government will say: ``But we are not increasing 
taxes''. What it takes away from one group, this group has to 
make others pay for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Hypocrisy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Hypocrisy, indeed, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish the hon. member for 
Frontenac had paid more attention because I did not say 
anything about research and development and he rose and said 
that I had. As far as his comments on genetic evaluation and 
milk recording are concerned, he should be informed, if he is not 
already, that the dairy farmers of Canada have been quite willing 
to sit down with the government to talk about getting involved in 
the management of genetic evaluation and the milk recording 
program. They recognize as producers they will benefit from 
that. The government is working very closely with  them on the 
transition in order for them to be able to do that.
<P>
	No part of the argument he made explains why he cannot still 
have the top dairy cow in Canada in his riding, other than the fact 
that he wants to hold on to his seat because probably someone in 
the Prince Edward-Hastings riding may very well take that 
record away from them. There are some very good dairy 
producers in Prince Edward-Hastings.
<P>
	I thank and commend the province of Quebec for the role it is 
playing in the ongoing discussions to work toward a one-pool 
price system for milk in Canada. Most of the provinces 
recognize that is the direction in which we are going to have to 
go and should go in order for us to meet easier the challenges 
coming from outside the borders of the country.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would point out to members opposite, as the 
minister did, that with respect to their reference to the balance 
between what was done in the WGTA versus the dairy industry, 
the WGTA reform package is not in any way inconsistent with 
the position set out by the Quebec coalition on the WGTA in a 
letter to the minister of December 1994. They are here barking 
up one tree while their representatives have told the minister in 
the past that they agree with the manner in which it was handled.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to inform you that from now on my 
colleagues and I will be splitting our time.
<P>
	It is always a pleasure to speak on agriculture, especially 
when the motion is introduced by the Bloc. I always enjoy the 
attitude its members take toward agriculture. They know how 
important it is. I appreciate that even if we do not always agree 
on certain issues. They know fundamentally that agriculture is 
the basis of Quebec as it is in western Canada. The Liberals will 
get educated. Some day they will listen. They are starting to 
listen already.
<P>
	On the farm we always say that the pasture always looks 
greener on the other side of the fence. That is probably true in 
Quebec as well as in western Canada. Maybe it is time for 
Quebecers to take a rest from the milking industry, buy some 
farmland in western Canada and start grain farming. It would be 
a real pleasure to have them there working side by side. Then 
they would really appreciate some of the problems that the grain 
farmers have had in the last few years.
<P>
	Their non-votable opposition motion says that grain farmers 
will be enabled to diversify. That is a little harsh or maybe not 
quite correct. Grain farmers will be forced to diversify. Not very 
many grain farmers today would love to jump into the dairy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11476"> 11476 </A></B>
<P>
industry or the beef industry and take some jobs and production 
away from people who are in that farming industry.
<P>
	I have spoken with a number of dairy farmers in Manitoba 
during the last couple of weeks. They sometimes look very 
jealously toward Quebec and say: ``Why can we not have some 
of that quota? They only have one-quarter of the population and 
have 48 per cent of the milk quota''.
<P>
	I have said to them: ``Why do we not solve this whole problem 
of separation? Why do some of you people not go and buy up 
some of those dairy farms in Quebec and start farming?'' If we 
could get some of the Quebec dairy farmers into western 
Canada, maybe the separation issue could be solved. Maybe we 
could understand each other a little better.
<P>
	I would much rather have some of the Quebec people come 
into western Canada and buy some of the grain farms than the 
Europeans. I make this invitation to them.
<P>
	The other thing I would like to address today is some of the 
unfairness that they are talking about. It is not due to the 
agriculture practices of the farmers. It is due to some of the 
previous governments' overspending and over taxation. That is 
causing us some of the problems.
<P>
	I see some of the hon. members on the other side shaking their 
heads. They must agree with that. If we can agree on some of 
these problems, maybe we can find some of the solutions.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The last government was no good.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> I agree fully with the hon. member but there 
was a Liberal government before that one that I would say was 
no good. This is a difference of opinion probably.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> I am with you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> I am always encouraged when I hear hon. 
members turning up the tempo a bit. Newborn babies have to 
scream a lot to exercise their lungs so that they become healthy 
and viable later. I always feel very glad that I can be of 
assistance to some of these members.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Watch that-
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> We are getting to them. Just give us another 
six months and who knows?
<P>
	I was just going to address some of the unnecessary things that 
are happening in the farm community, which are hurting us. I 
would like to read part of a statement made by a witness who was 
before the Standing Committee on Transportation. He said: 
``Unnecessary costs should not be recovered from users. 
Industry has funded, through seaway tolls, close to $35 million 
in costs that reflect labour inefficiencies, including surplus 
personnel and termination benefits, double taxation brought 
about by large corporation taxes and costs associated with 
tunnels and bridges in the Beauharnois Canal.''
<P>
	I was never aware that grain farmers in western Canada were 
paying for some of the maintenance costs of some of the bridges 
across the St. Lawrence Seaway. I find it very hard to swallow 
that and say it is fair. It is there and it has to be addressed. What 
politicians and industry are going to do about it I do not know, 
but it has to be addressed if we want to keep shipping our 
products through the seaway.
<P>
	I have another bit of information I would like to read as an 
example. In the fall of 1990, the Laurentian Pilotage Authority, 
after negotiations with the pilot association with which it has 
contracts, agreed to increases totalling 32.12 per cent and 29.6 
per cent over three years. That is at least a 10 per cent increase 
per year.
<P>
	On the farm during those three years we have seen prices of 
our products decrease probably by 30 per cent. It is a real 
hardship for us to absorb some of these costs.
<P>
	Some of these pilots earn on average from $115,000 to 
$156,000 a year for about a nine-month year. Nobody in the 
farming industry has some type of labour contract or wages that 
come close to that. This is why I am saying that some of the 
transportation subsidies that have been directed toward 
transportation are not going to the farmers. They are going to 
some of the inefficiencies and the high-priced labour as 
compared to agriculture.
<P>
	I was really astounded and kind of encouraged the other day 
when I saw one of the Bloc members ask the question about the 
unfairness of the 8.9 per cent that was collected by the pilotage 
authorities from shippers. They received a very bad answer from 
the minister, as far as I was concerned, because these costs are 
actually borne by the shippers and later passed on to the 
producers or the manufacturers who use the shipping lines.
<P>
	The NTA recommended that there should be a zero increase. 
The NTA is supposed to regulate these costs. What did this 
Liberal government do? It overruled it and gave them another 
8.9 per cent after the 30 per cent in the last three years. These are 
costs that we as grain farmers have to observe; not just in 
shipping our products, but we also have to pay part of the costs 
of all the steel and all the iron ore that is shipped in to produce 
equipment.
<P>
	Those are some of the things that are unfair as far as farmers 
and shippers are concerned.
<P>
	I have tried to warn the seaway authorities and especially 
some of the people on the other side that if things do not change, 
if they are not turned around, and we receive a fairer equity in 
transportation costs, the seaway will not see much of the grain in 
future years that is produced in Manitoba and west.
<P>

	I would just like to read a little statement from the <I>Winnipeg

he states: ``Hello, Mississippi River. Goodbye, Thunder Bay.''

<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	The House can see that this is not just what farmers are 
saying; this is something other people are reporting on, and it is 
a matter of fact. We have to address it.
<P>
	One thing that really amazes me is why farm organizations 
have not pointed these issues out so we can address them before 
we get into such a predicament. I just happened to get a report 
from Manitoba Pool Elevators or Prairie Pools Inc. This is what 
they say in their brief: ``In 1993 the property taxes paid by 
terminal elevator owners at the port of Vancouver were on an 
average five to six times higher than for similar sized terminals 
in the U.S. port of Seattle''. That seems very high already and it 
seems disastrous as far as grain farmers are concerned.
<P>
	Now listen to what they say about Thunder Bay: ``Property 
taxes paid by terminal owners at Thunder Bay were more than 25 
times higher than property taxes paid for similar sized terminals 
at the U.S. port of Duluth''. How can we be competitive with 
those types of exorbitant taxes and over-pricing?
<P>
	They go on further in their report to say: ``Canada's two 
railways pay more than $640 million annually in fuel, sales and 
property taxes, while the U.S. rail system receives tax 
incentives to maintain rail services''.
<P>
	Those are some of problems we in the grain industry are 
fighting with. I hope we can resolve them and that we can keep 
the jobs in Canada before they are exported to the U.S., which 
we have seen with a lot of other industries.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the Reform member just pointed out, there are two solitudes in 
Canada. Farmers in his part of the country feel that they are 
treated unfairly, and so do farmers in Quebec, particularly dairy 
producers. It is my duty to remind this House of some very 
eloquent figures regarding federal spending in the agricultural 
sector.
<P>
	I randomly selected two years. In 1980, the federal 
government spent 55 per cent of its budget for agriculture in 
western Canada, compared to 16.4 per cent in Quebec-I 
mention the decimal because it is significant, considering that 
the total percentage is a mere  16 per cent. In 1993, the federal 
spent 60 per cent in western Canada, compared to 12.4 per cent 
in Quebec. So, we have 55 and 60 per cent for western provinces, 
compared to 16.4 and 12.4 per cent for Quebec.
<P>
	Yet, Quebec generates 17 per cent of Canada's revenues in the 
agricultural sector. As you know, Quebecers account for 24 per 
cent of Canada's population. Let us look at a specific 
agricultural industry, such as potato growing. In terms of 
cultivated acreage, from 1981 to 1991, there was a 30 per cent 
increase in the West, compared to a 2 per cent decrease in 
Quebec. In the case of cattle, the production rose by 4 per cent in 
the West, while dropping by 13 per cent in the East.
<P>
	As for hogs, there was a 39 per cent increase in the West and a 
16-per-cent reduction in Quebec. Finally, the sheep population 
increased by 33 per cent in the West, compared to 8 per cent in 
Quebec. It is the same for every industry. This is what we mean 
when we say that this western diversification is done with our 
taxes.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Quebecers will actually pay to face unfair competition. This 
is what we are denouncing today. And I can tell Reform and 
Liberal members that every time Quebecers will be treated 
unfairly, the Bloc will raise its voice loud and clear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate those remarks, and 
they are probably very accurate.
<P>
	I am very concerned that we do not have an environmental 
catastrophe in Quebec. Because of all the tears that I have seen 
being shed in Quebec lately, their fresh drinking water might 
turn into salt water. What are we going to do then? I would hate 
to see that.
<P>
	I agree with some of these comments. I would also like to 
point out that when we look at the total budget of agriculture, 
which is around 2 per cent, or perhaps even less, of the whole 
budget, agriculture at least brings back 8 per cent of the gross 
national product. We provide 15 per cent of the jobs in 
agriculture. It is a very important sector that we have probably 
been neglecting, whether it is Quebec or western Canada. I 
would sure appreciate the Bloc's help rather than criticism in 
trying to rectify this.
<P>
	I still maintain that a country is only as strong as its 
agriculture. The sooner we learn to stand on our feet to take the 
problems and solve them together, and not through divisiveness, 
we will have a better country to live in, whether it is Quebec or 
western Canada. That is what I would really like to stress.
<P>

Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the member who just spoke.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11478"> 11478 </A></B>
<P>
	I have just come from a luncheon here on Parliament Hill in 
support of the National 4-H Citizenship Seminar, where 4-H 
members have an opportunity to learn about parliamentary 
activities. They are young agricultural enthusiasts who can 
communicate very well to parliamentarians about the need to 
support agriculture.
<P>
	Can the member, representing an agricultural area of our 
country, tell us about his support for Canadian 4-H and how 
important that program is to all Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question.
<P>
	I have always been very supportive of the 4-H program. The 
Reform Party is very supportive as well of that program and also 
very supportive of any R and D in agriculture. Those two things 
probably go together.
<P>
	When it comes to protecting and promoting agriculture, I am 
never in the backbenches; I am always in the front seat. I will 
continue that way, and I appreciate having that opportunity.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, it being 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 35, the House will now proceed to statements by

<P>
	On May 6 and 7 of this year the committee will launch High

<P>
	This two-day family event brings together veterans,

yesterday, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Immigration spoke against a motion presented by one of her 
Liberal colleagues. The motion reminded Quebecers and 
Canadians that any country or political group that resorts to 
genocide commits a crime against humanity.
<P>
	Our amendment used the Armenian genocide which the 
Canadian government continues to ignore, as an example that 
such barbaric acts should never be forgotten.
<P>
	The hon. member was probably bowing to the government's 
new priorities in foreign affairs, where business interests are 
now more important than promoting human rights and freedoms

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after reassuring Canadians through legislation that 
lacrosse remains a national sport, just one year later lacrosse is 
once more fighting for recognition.
<P>
	Who did the Canadian people vote to make decisions for 
them, the 295 MPs elected in October 1993 or those few 
deciding which sports to fund? Yes, cuts have to be made. 
However, the guidelines and their implementation for the 
allocation of funds are unfair.
<P>
	With one day's notice lacrosse lost 60 per cent of its funding. 
The process is wrong. Those making the decisions have lost 
sight of the fact that lacrosse, our national sport, has been 
ignored for the past 60 years, whereas hockey remains strong 
because of their constant support.
<P>
	I remind the House that in 1904 Canada sent its first 
delegation to the Olympic games. Lacrosse is the only team 
sport in which Canada has won more medals than the rest of the 
world combined.
<P>
	Lacrosse is growing in population yearly, especially after last 
year's Commonwealth games. Our Canadian youth need our 
support to keep them playing lacrosse.

apparently because he has Down's Syndrome.
<P>
	Terry Urquhart, a Special Olympics winner, has led a positive 
and fruitful life within the parameters of his disability. This 
child and others like him are not to be denied the right, and it is a 
right, to the same medical treatment and procedures that any 
other Canadian is entitled to. I was very pleased to learn the 
hospital has reversed its decision and I compliment it for that.
<P>
	I am very alarmed about possible implications of this incident 
on the lives of the disabled. I call on the decision or policy 
makers in similar situations to immediately reconsider such ill 
conceived positions. I call on the health minister and the justice 
minister to ensure this is done.
<P>
	Let there be no misunderstanding, let there be no mistake, 
Canada does not have one set of rules for persons with 
disabilities and another for those without. All Canadians are

relationship which has grown and strengthened in recent years.
<P>
	I would like to thank Germany for its support and leadership

find a solution to the fish crisis which will help preserve the fish

it came as no surprise that the Fraser report concluded the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans was completely out of

returning for spawning. That fact had been backed up by 
numerous task forces in the past and continues to this day.

<P>
	The Liberal government has decided to eliminate all funding 
to Harbourfront, a world class cultural centre set up by the 
Trudeau government. It was originally set up to run in perpetuity 
by revenues from the original development but, as with most 
Liberal plans, it fell through.
<P>
	The Liberals promised funding for Harbourfront but has left it 
high and dry. The Toronto Liberal caucus chair will not 
comment about this latest broken Liberal promise. The entire 
Liberal caucus will not comment on any of the 20 broken 
promises to Ontario. Why not? It is embarrassed with its record 
of broken promises, in particular its betrayal of medicare, 
education and job creation. Rather than account for its betrayal 
to Ontario it wrongly blames the NDP government.

April and spring is here, at least in British Columbia. The 
daffodils are in full bloom and so is the Canadian Cancer 
Society's fundraising campaign.
<P>
	Since 1938 the Canadian Cancer Society has tried to eradicate 
cancer and sought to better the lives of people suffering from 
this terrible disease. Cancer research has resulted in many 
breakthrough treatments over the years. In 1979 the five-year 
survival rate for childhood leukaemia was 17 per cent. Today, 
thanks to advancements in research and rehabilitation, it is 83 
per cent. The Canadian Cancer Society also helped to fund the 
recent discovery of a breast cancer gene that will enhance 
prevention.
<P>
	Despite our small victories, the fight against cancer is not 
over. In 1995 alone 126,000 Canadians will be diagnosed with 
cancer and 62,000 will die from the disease.
<P>
	Therefore, this April I urge all Canadians to give generously 
to the Canadian Cancer Society volunteer who comes their door. 
Together we can give not only money but hope to the thousands 
of Canadians suffering from cancer.

at the same time it substantially reduces its commitment to 
social programs by transferring its financial responsibilities to 
the provinces which already have serious financial problems?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the provincial Premiers and all provincial governments 
are now analysing their respective programs, and we have done 
the same at the federal level. Everyone realizes that as far as 
government spending is concerned, we must reduce the pressure 
on the taxpayer. We have informed the provinces of our position. 
They have been aware of that position since December 1993, 
when we told them that we would eventually introduce a system 
but would give them two years to get ready.
<P>
	In the February budget brought down by the Minister of 
Finance they were informed of the nature of federal cuts. The 
provinces had already made some cuts of their own, and they 
will continue to do so because we believe that at all levels of 
government, it is possible to offer the right kind of service 
without spending as much as we did in the past.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, how does the government expect to be taken 
seriously when it says it wants to co-operate with the provinces, 
when it excluded them from the forum on health, for instance, 
and the budget's enabling legislation gives them no more than a 
purely advisory role in defining national standards?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I have to say to the Leader of the Opposition 
that as far as the forum on health is concerned, we said no, we 
did not want the provinces to be there. Later on, we invited them, 
but they refused to come.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Now listen, they persuaded 
me to invite them, and then the opposition asked me to invite 
them. I was very nice about it, so I did. Once they were invited, 
they decided not to come. Do not blame me, I listened to you. 
Blame them.
<P>
	As for the remainder of the hon. member's question, if we 
want to have national standards across the country, which is 
normal, it is because of manpower mobility in Canada and also 
because we have a minimum of respect for all members of the 
Canadian community. We must establish a satisfactory 
minimum for all Canadians across the country in the areas of 
health care, social assistance and similar services.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, may I remind you to 
address the Chair in your questions and answers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the provinces are told: «We do not want you 
around». It was their understanding that they were not wanted.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister talk about flexible federalism 
when he threatens to cut federal contributions even more if the 
provinces do not respect national standards for the Canada 
Social Transfer? In other words, will he have the courage to put 
his cards on the table at a federal-provincial conference?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we had occasion to discuss that at the different 
federal-provincial meetings I had with the provinces, along 
with the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	Generally speaking, provinces recognize we have to reduce 
the cost of these programs. The best way to do that is by 
collaboration between the provinces and the federal 
government. We have to reduce our spending.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	As I explained earlier, when some provinces including 
Quebec cut $500 million in health services in December they 
were not returning any of that money to us even if we had made a 
strong contribution to that level of payment.

Fisheries and Oceans has confirmed that Canada and the 
European Union reached agreement in principle yesterday in the 
turbot dispute, subject to approval by cabinet and the officials of 
the European Union. With Spain and Portugal's rejection of it, 
the European Union has called for the reopening of the 
agreement in order to wring even more concessions from 
Canada and thus bring the negotiations to a standstill.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans confirm that the 
European Union, under pressure from Spain, in particular, has 
rejected the agreement in principle, thus bringing us back to the 
starting point?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

<P>
	I can confirm that what has just been proposed is not correct. 
Negotiations as we speak are ongoing in Brussels. Good 
progress is being made. I understand there has been a report, 
which no doubt the member has seen, which in effect states that 
the EU has rejected the draft agreement. This is not correct. 
Good progress is being made and Canada hopes that in due 
course these negotiations will conclude successfully.

Felipe Gonzalez, said that Spain was definitely rejecting the 
terms of the agreement in principle?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

through the weekend. Progress was made each and every day 
through the weekend and continues even today. It is a matter for 
the European Union to deal with the views whether they be

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there seems to be growing confusion throughout the 
country concerning the federal government's intentions with 
respect to health care funding.
<P>
	The health minister and the Prime Minister have both hinted 
that funding could be reduced by up to $16 billion or 2 per cent 
of GDP and that Canadians in future will not receive the same 
degree of coverage that they have in the past. At the same time, 
the government has also suggested that health care funding 
should be simply frozen or flat lined.
<P>
	My question is for the health minister. What precisely is the 
government's agenda for reforming health care, in particular 
reforming the scope of health care services and health care 
financing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, while the direct responsibility for health care remains 
with the provinces, we intend to continue to enforce the 
principles of the Canada Health Act. That act has given us one of 
the finest medicare systems in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I asked the minister to reduce the confusion caused, not 
to add to it.
<P>
	Last month the Prime Minister spoke in favourable terms 
about bringing Canada's health care spending more in line with 
that of European countries. The Prime Minister must realize 
however that almost all of those European countries to which he 
refers have a private health care backup to the public system 
which is how they get more bang for their health care buck.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	Does the health care minister support the Prime Minister's 
recommendation that Canada's health care funding should 
become more like that of Europe? Does she have a concrete plan 
for bringing that reform about?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course I support the Prime Minister. The Prime 
Minister has repeatedly said that this country will continue to 
have a universal medicare system.
<P>
	Thirty-two years ago today our Prime Minister was first 
elected as a member of Parliament to the House of Commons.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Ms. Marleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, during those 32 years our Prime 
Minister was present for the creation and the building of the best 
medicare system in the world. Our Prime Minister has nothing 
to learn from the Reform Party which advocates two-tier 
medicine.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that sounded more like a job security speech to me than 
a health care issue.
<P>
	In a March 15 speech the Prime Minister promised to uphold 
the five pillars of medicare but he could not tell his audience 
how he would do it. In a March 4 speech the health minister 
encouraged the provinces to experiment broadly with health 
care delivery and yet refused to say what powers the provinces 
would be given to do that job.
<P>
	My last question is for the finance minister. How long will 
Canadians have to wait before the government presents a 
concrete blueprint for health care reform? How long?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish the Reform Party would listen instead of 
preaching all the time.
<P>
	From the very beginning we have been very clear. Yes, there is 
flexibility providing we maintain the principles and we keep a 
system which serves all Canadians regardless of whether they 
have money or not. Our system has to be based on need. What 
the Reform Party is advocating is a U.S. style of medicare, a 
system for the fit and fortunate.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. In a speech 
yesterday at the Canadian Club in Toronto, the ex-president of 
the CBC, Tony Manera, showed that cutting the CBC's budget 
by more than one third will seriously jeopardize the current 
mandate of the Crown corporation. At the same time, the new 
president of the CBC, former Conservative minister Perrin 
Beatty, said in reference to the cancelling of entire programs at 
the CBC that we are running out of time to make difficult 
decisions.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister confirm that his new appointee to the 
helm of the CBC is ready and willing to cut as much as one third 
from the CBC's current budget and to lay off between 3,000 and 
4,000 employees?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, cuts of four per cent for this year were announced in the 
Minister of Finance's budget. In fact this is not out of 
proportion, compared to cuts we were forced to make in other 
sectors.
<P>
	We also decided then that we had to review the CBC's 
mandate and that of other related organizations in order to 
determine how to adjust to today's realities with today's 
financial means, and in order to determine the kind of television 
network we need in order to be competitive in the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	When the CBC was created, Canadians only had access to two 
television channels; now they can access between 100 and 200 
channels. In the near future, we will be setting up a committee to 
align the CBC's mandate with today's and tomorrow's realities, 
and working from the revised mandate, we will determine a 
budget enabling the CBC and other similar organizations to 
reach their new objectives.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, does the Prime Minister realize that the CBC has 
already been hit by previous budget cuts, is being hit by those 
contained in the current budget and that it will also be hit by 
future budgets?
<P>
	Has the Prime Minister considered whether the deep cuts that 
he is planning to impose on the CBC, which will apply 
indiscriminately to the English and French networks despite the 
fact that the French network outperforms the English one by a 
long shot, will seriously jeopardize the mandate and future of 
Radio-Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have always recognized in the past the necessity of 
having a French radio and television network in Canada. Might I 
add that the CBC's budget is divided. The French radio and 
television network receives a proportionally higher share of 
funding than the francophone population would have warranted. 
We want to continue giving good French language service to 
Canadians from coast to coast. But this budget must be adjusted 
to take into consideration today's realities and the new mandate 
we need to give, given that competition is no longer limited to 
just one network but now involves hundreds of networks. We 
must give an appropriate vocation to both the English and 
French networks of the CBC.

reasonable access so that Canadians will be protected by the 
Canada Health Act?
<P>

protected by the Canada Health Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11485"> 11485 </A></B>
<P>
	Yes, there are pressures from time to time in different areas. 
However, the Canada Health Act ensures that these pressures are 
addressed by the individual provinces. When we see long 
waiting lists, provinces move in very quickly and public opinion 
forces them into doing what is right, ensuring that the needs of 
their citizens are met in a good manner without people having to 
pay to get to the head of the line.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, reasonable 
access is not the only Canada Health Act pillar that has 
crumbled. Let us look at the minister's arbitrary definition of 
user fees.
<P>
	The minister says Alberta allows user fees; naughty, naughty, 
naughty. However at the Eastern Kings Memorial Hospital in 
Nova Scotia patients must pay for stitches, anaesthetic and 
syringes. Does the minister responsible for this arbitrary 
legislation not agree that patients having to pay for these things 
makes it a user fee?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the letter which I sent to all provinces interpreting the 
Canada Health Act and user fees applied to all provinces in this 
country. That is the way we implement federal legislation. 
Medical necessity has been defined by medical associations,

Mr. Beatty's appointment.
<P>
	I think that the hon. member's information-Long before the 
budget was tabled, Mr. Manera had asked to be replaced for 
personal reasons. He called us weeks before the budget was 
tabled to say that he wanted to leave for reasons of his own and 
that his resignation had nothing to do with the budget. He

made sure the people who are to be let go because of the cuts will 
have good payments made to them. An agreement was 
negotiated by the union to make sure there will be some help for 
them to adjust.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Yesterday, the President of Burundi alluded to the threat of a 
double genocide when he said that something must be done 
about the similarities between the current situation in his 
country and what happened in Rwanda. Four hundreds Hutus, 
mostly women and children, are said to have been slaughtered 
last week by the Burundese army and by armed groups of Tutsis, 
in the Gasorwe region.
<P>
	Will the minister tell us what the Canadian government 
intends to do following the plea for help made by the Burundi 
President?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member will understand that any solution 
to the precarious situation in Burundi must absolutely be based 
on a reconciliation of the parties involved.
<P>
	This is why the Union of African States, as well as the 
Francophonie, which met in Paris last week, decided to send 
ministerial missions to meet with the parties to try to make them 
understand that reconciliation is essential. We are confident that 
these preventive diplomacy efforts will give positive results.
<P>
	The hon. member is seeking a military solution, but that is not 
what government authorities want. The hon. member's 
suggestion has not been made by government authorities. The 
solution proposed by the ministers of the Francophonie is 
precisely the one requested by the Burundi government official.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does 
the minister recognize that, beyond the nice assurances and 
comments on reconciliation, it is urgent to take concrete action, 
which includes the rapid setting up of a monitoring group in 
Burundi, as requested by the Burundi ambassador to Canada?
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I just said to the hon. member that, even though the 
Burundi ambassador may have made such a request, Burundi 
government officials did not.
<P>
	I just got back from a meeting of ministers of the 
Francophonie, where the Burundi situation was discussed and 
where we heard from a representative of the government of 
Burundi. What that government official asked for, and what we 
will do, is this: first, send a ministerial mission to attempt a 
reconciliation; second, send a group of experts to help local 
authorities solve their problems; third, provide humanitarian 
assistance, asCanada is always prepared to offer, to non-governmental orga-

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
January of this year the government announced that war 
criminals living in Canada would be deported rather than 
prosecuted for their crimes against humanity.
<P>
	This is a shift in policy from 1987 when the Liberal Party 
endorsed a made in Canada solution to Nazi war criminals.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Justice. Why has the 
government given up on the idea of prosecuting Nazi war 
criminals in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
</B><B>General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, by far the preferred 
way of approaching such cases is to initiate criminal 
prosecutions.
<P>
	However, a couple of things have happened since 1987. First, 
the provisions in the Criminal Code that were added at about that 
time to provide for such prosecutions have been tested in court 
proceedings and interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	Second, the nature, quality and availability of the evidence in 
such prosecutions has diminished in the years since 1987. When 
we came to office we came with a determination to do something 
about the moral imperative of removing such people from our 
midst.
<P>
	We looked at the possibility of criminal prosecution and 
determined that in view of the interpretation placed on the 
provisions of the code by the Supreme Court of Canada in Finta 
and in view of the state of the evidence in these cases, the best 
approach for achieving the moral imperative in a practical way 
was to institute civil proceedings by the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration. That is the step we have taken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have been here for 18 months and in all areas of crime we would 
like to see some justice. I am still waiting. We have not seen 
justice yet.
<P>
	Earlier this year the Minister of Justice said: ``War crimes 
investigators have evidence that 12 suspects are living in 
Canada''. However, the government is only pursuing four cases 
in order to test the legal waters.
<P>
	The longer the minister waits, the more unreliable the 
evidence is going to be. Why is the minister not pursuing all 12 
cases immediately?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is 
quite right. These cases must be undertaken as soon as possible. 
We are starting with four cases. We have identified eight others 
as appropriate for proceeding in this same way. We have eight 
counsel under the lead of a senior justice counsel dealing with 
the four cases that are already before the courts. As soon as we 
possibly can we will initiate the others.
<P>
	We started with four cases that we believe in some important 
respects will clear the way by creating legal precedents that will 
make it simpler to proceed in the other cases.
<P>
	I fully agree with the hon. member and we will commence the 
balance of the cases at the earliest possible date.

to small and medium sized businesses, especially in the new 
economy areas which he knows require both investment in

<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	It is a key issue. In keeping with the approach that the 
government announced in the orange book of assistance to

business will succeed. We are looking to the private sector for 
the kinds of linkages and sources of funds that are important. In 
addition we have a tax system in place that encourages 
innovation and investment in R and D.
<P>
	The R and D tax credit, the creation of the Canada community

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I was not very 
surprised reading the text of the Bloc motion that we are 
addressing today because I find that its members are following 
their usual strategy of being vexatious and provocative, trying to 
pit Canadians against Canadians. They do this under the 
pretence of representing their constituents, but I do not believe 
that Quebecers as a group do not believe in fairness. By and 
large, they are like the rest of us. What we are seeing here is a 
classic example of what the Bloc does in this place day after day 
after day.
<P>
	I asked a couple of Quebec members from the other central 
Canadian party how they felt about the fact that the Bloc 
engages in this type of rhetoric. I asked them if they were at all 
embarrassed by the constant whining and by these efforts to put 
out their hand for more and more. The answer that I got from 
these other Quebecers was: ``Yes, it does embarrass us''.
<P>
	Let us take a look at this terrible abuse that we hear is being 
heaped upon those Quebec dairy farmers with their guaranteed 
40 per cent share of the domestic milk market in Canada. Yes, 
they are going to have their subsidies cut; they are going to be 
cut by 30 per cent over two years. Therefore, their $217 million 
subsidy will be cut by $57 million.
<P>
	What the hon. members from the Bloc neglect to mention is 
that all the dairy farmers in Canada do not reside in Quebec. The 
rest of us have cows too. We are going to be losing our pro rata 
share of that same subsidy, which is causing this inordinate 
amount of whining.
<P>
	On the other hand, the Crow benefit is not going to be phased 
out gradually. We are not going to lose just a few percentage 
points per year over any given period of time. It is going to be 
cut by 100 per cent immediately and forever.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Shame on the Liberals.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Shame on the Liberals. There is going to be a 
$1.6 billion buyout. This buyout is equivalent to what the 
subsidy has been paying over each three-year period, or would 
have been paying over the next three years. After that, nothing. 
But the dairy farmers will still be in there for 70 per cent of their 
subsidy. If this is inequitable to Quebec then please help me 
here. What would they regard as equity?
<P>
	There is another little cute trick in the budget, which I have 
not heard the Bloc mention. That is the Feed Freight Assistance 
Act for feed grains to the eastern part of Quebec as well as the 
Maritimes. We are talking about Quebec here. That is going to 
be phased out over a 10-year period.
<P>
	It now appears, from the rumours I have been hearing, that 
this is not even going to begin for another year. There is going to 
be a one-year moratorium on phasing out the FFAA. All this 
means is that we will continue in the west shipping our feed 
grains to Quebec to be turned into beef and milk products, 
whereas if we did not have this subsidy to work against us, we 
could do it at home more economically and export the finished 
product. However, that is not the way Canada works. We are still 
locked into the old colonial system where the two central 
Canadian provinces get the milk, the grass is eaten in western 
Canada, and we all know what happens in the Maritimes.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	This motion speaks about diversification and the fact that 
because we are going to get this buyout on the Crow rate it is 
going to be a great encouragement for us to diversify. In my 
riding farmers have been diversifying for the last few years, not 
because of the availability or lack of availability of subsidies, 
but in response to market forces. They are growing crops they 
never grew before.
<P>
	When I drove around my riding last summer I saw canola, 
lentils and even sunflowers-big acreages of them. These are 
not native to my part of Saskatchewan, but we are swinging over 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11491"> 11491 </A></B>
<P>
to them in order to profit from the market that is out there and to 
get away from our low-priced product, which is wheat.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to digress a bit from agriculture and talk 
again about the question of who gets what out of Confederation. 
I am sure that hon. members of the Bloc are aware of a recent 
study that indicated that over the last ten years Quebec has had a 
net benefit of payments in, over-taxation out of $168 billion. 
During that same period the province of Ontario has come up 
short by $45 billion. Do not let us ever forget that my 
neighbouring province of Alberta, during the days of the 
national energy policy, had to forgo $90 billion in revenue in 
order to support the economies of the two central Canadian 
provinces. I find it more than passing strange that those of us 
who want to hold our country together, who care about this 
country, are the ones who have been paying the bills, and the 
people who want to tear it asunder are the ones who have been 
benefiting the most economically from Confederation. They are 
saying, in effect: ``We want to be free; we want to go it alone, but 
please, keep giving us money''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the distinguished colleague who spoke just before me, a member 
of the Reform Party from the west, criticized the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois for defending our country, Quebec. I would like 
to give him a short history lesson.
<P>
	In 1837, the Government of Quebec was dissolved from 
London. Three years later, in 1840, Lower and Upper Canada 
were united-an easy matter because there was no longer a 
government in Quebec. The problem, however, was that Quebec 
was thrifty and did not want to go into debt like the government 
has since 1970, surely and consistently. Quebec was only 85,000 
pounds in debt, while Ontario was 1.2 million pounds in debt.
<P>
	As there was only one government to decide-the government 
of Ontario-it was decided that the two debts should be 
combined into a single one. This is how Quebec has been treated 
for years. Today, they have the gall to blame us for criticizing 
injustices. I will not take it. I will not.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Producers in the three western provinces are being offered 
$1.6 billion, interest and tax free, in compensation for the 
disappearance of the WGTO. They do not even have to declare it 
for tax purposes. In Quebec, each milk producer is going to be 
penalized some $5,000 on average and will be receiving 
absolutely no compensation. Nothing.
<P>
	The worst part of all of this is that western producers will use 
the compensation to diversify their production and will move 
into Quebec markets to compete against us  with the help of tax 
dollars we gave the government. Take hogs, for example. I am 
talking about the period from 1981 to 1991. After 1991, things 
tend to intensify and will get worse after 1996. There is no 
supply management in hog production. Are you aware that, in 
ten years, western hog production grew by 39 per cent, over 39 
per cent? In the same time period, in Quebec, production 
dropped by 16 per cent. How about that?
<P>
	In terms of surface used, hothouse production in the west has 
grown by 67 per cent, while the increase in Quebec is barely 46 
per cent, despite the fact that the markets are in Ontario and 
Quebec. I promise you that, each time we have the opportunity, 
the members of the Bloc Quebecois will rise in this House to 
criticize both Liberal and Reform Party members for failing to 
have a global vision of this country; for never setting foot in 
Quebec, for the most part; and for claiming that Quebec is still 
griping and asking for more. We have paid more than our share 
in this country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Madam Speaker, I liked that little history 
lesson at the beginning. Unfortunately I do not see what 
relevance it has to what we are debating today, current economic 
conditions in Canada.
<P>
	Since the hon. member has only left me one moment, I will 
have to direct myself to one of his statistics. He talks about an 
increase in the hog production, I believe he said 39 per cent in 
the west and a decrease of 16 per cent in Quebec. With the feed 
freight assistance, if the farmers of Quebec cannot compete with 
the west, he is bad mouthing his own province. He is speaking ill 
of Quebec. I would not think of doing that.
<P>
	We are progressive. We are working hard to diversify. We are 
not asking for handouts and as far as the $1.6 billion, all the hon. 
member has done is reiterate his previous arguments. He did not 
raise anything new. He said the same thing over-
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will share my time with the hon. member for 
Guelph-Wellington.
<P>
	So far, it seems that Bloc members are choosing the issues in 
which they would like to intervene. They chose to remain silent 
in the Montreal and Vancouver port disputes but today's debate 
is another example of the partisan way in which the Bloc 
Quebecois chooses the causes it wants to defend.
<P>
	I would like to explain a few things about the dairy subsidy 
announced in the last budget.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	First, it should be pointed out that this government is formally 
committed to maintaining an orderly marketing system for dairy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11492"> 11492 </A></B>
<P>
products, eggs and poultry. These products are a very important 
part of the Canadian agri-food industry.
<P>
	In the final round of GATT negotiations, we showed how 
serious we were by securing customs tariffs high enough to keep 
our supply management system almost unchanged. Some tariffs 
are as high as 200 per cent or 300 per cent for various dairy 
products.
<P>
	These tariffs will drop by only 15 per cent over a six-year 
period. It is the smallest reduction required on such tariffs. In 
addition, international agreements call for limited access for 
imports while giving us comparable access elsewhere for our 
dairy products.
<P>
	Consequently, all experts agree that this sector will enjoy a 
high level of protection for several years. As you will recall, 
when the GATT bill was before this House, we were accused of 
failing to protect article XI. That is how things were done.
<P>
	It is good news, since the dairy sector is now experiencing a 
surge in activities. In 1993-94, Canadian industrial milk 
production rose by 3.2 per cent compared to the previous year, 
while a 4.5 per cent increase is forecast for this year. Quebec 
dairy farmers, who receive almost 50 per cent of national 
quotas, are taking advantage of the situation.
<P>
	As for cutting the subsidies paid to industrial milk producers 
by 30 per cent over two years, it is necessary to do so to improve 
our public finances.
<P>
	As elected representatives, we have certain inescapable 
responsibilities and reducing the deficit in real terms is one of 
them. We can no longer allow the deficit to keep adding to the 
national debt. We must strive towards fiscal balance. All 
Canadians agree on that.
<P>
	Therefore, the government must cut its spending at every 
level and in many sectors, including the agri-food sector.
<P>
	In the dairy industry, producers are currently paid $5.43 per 
hectolitre in direct subsidy for industrial milk. An hectolitre is 
equal to 100 litres. So, in simple terms, this is a subsidy of about 
five cents a litre. Moreover, it does not apply to fluid milk, the 
milk that we drink everyday, for which producers are paid a 
higher price.
<P>
	This means that only a portion of the dairy producers' income 
is affected. In that case, I think this decision is perfectly 
justified when, as we know and I repeat, the government has to 
cut its spending. It has no other choice but to take stringent yet 
sensible budget measures.
<P>
	After all, the subsidy is not completely gone, far from it. 
Seventy per cent of it, or $160 million, will continue to go to 
milk production. In the coming months, the Canadian Dairy 
Commission and officials from the Department of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food will hold consultations with the industry to set 
prices for the crop year beginning on August 1.
<P>
	Later this year, the government will discuss with the industry 
how the subsidy can be best used. The most efficient use 
possible should be made of these funds, i.e. to support long term 
growth in the industry.
<P>
	Producers and processors alike are committed to adjusting to 
the new global context. The Canadian dairy industry creates 
many jobs and generates billions of dollars in revenues. It is 
important that this industry be able to prosper and meet new 
challenges in the future.
<P>
	The industry always sold a percentage of its production, 
particularly surplus milk powder and sought after cheeses, on 
the global market.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Just recently, on a trade mission to Latin America, the 
Minister of Agriculture and representatives of the sector 
interested Brazilians in importing Canadian parmesan and 
mozzarella. This confirms that there are new markets for our 
excellent products.
<P>
	At the last meeting of the national milk supply management 
committee, six of the nine provincial marketing boards decided 
to set up a special marketing quota in order to develop the export 
market. This new approach could see the light of day by the 
summer, and might eventually encompass all the provinces.
<P>
	As we can see, the sector is changing to suit its needs. The 
government intends to help the move to a new generation of 
orderly milk marketing, as is already the case in the poultry and 
eggs sector.
<P>
	Furthermore, the budget announced new ways of helping the 
agri-food sector as a whole, including the dairy sector. 
Moreover, the government is proposing a series of adjustment 
measures so that the industry can seize the new opportunities 
opening up on the world market and to compensate for the 
reduction in government funds.
<P>
	The government is prepared to provide the financial tools, as 
evidenced in the doubling, a few weeks ago, of the funds 
available under co-operative credit legislation. It will also 
provide more market information to businesses wanting to 
expand their foreign sales.
<P>
	As you can see, the government is helping the dairy sector, as 
its financial situation permits, in the same way it is helping other 
agri-food sectors.
<P>
	The cuts announced are real but not dramatic to the point of 
harming the growth of the dairy sector. On the contrary, we want 
it to continue to develop within a context of orderly marketing.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank the hon. member for his comments. I know 
he is as concerned about the future of agriculture in Quebec as I 
am about the future of agriculture in all of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11493"> 11493 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member made comments about the current tariff of 
351 per cent on some products put in place on supply managed 
products. He also referred to the 50 per cent market for fluid 
milk Quebec farmers now enjoy. I have been having trouble with 
the logic of the Bloc's argument about how, when Quebec 
separates, it will continue to have 50 per cent of the Canadian 
fluid milk market at 351 per cent tariff. It does not seem to add 
up to me.
<P>
	What steps is his government taking to help supply managed 
farmers in Quebec make the adjustment for the time when we 
have complete free trade in agriculture? That time is coming 
very quickly. In the beef industry we have free trade with the 
United States now. We actually have gone to some special 
import permits beyond the minimum access so it is happening 
quicker in the beef industry than even was scheduled under 
GATT.
<P>
	The United States has served notice that it wants to discuss 
supply managed industries in Canada. Therefore there will be 
increased pressure to move to complete free trade.
<P>
	It seems to me the Liberal government would have to be 
taking some concrete steps to help those farmers make that 
adjustment. If we are saying it cannot be done, if we will to 
maintain these 351 per cent tariffs, after a six year reduction in 
GATT it seems to me that tariff will still be 300 per cent, which 
is not realistic.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member what he is considering doing to help 
these supply managed farmers make the adjustment necessary to 
continue to have a viable industry after free trade is 
accomplished.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> It is reassuring, Madam Speaker, that 
members other than Bloc Quebecois members have realized the 
importance of the rural agricultural industry in Quebec, 
especially dairy farming. It seems there is only one party in this 
House that does not realize the benefits Quebec enjoys through 
the protection and actions of gestion de l'offre. Dairy producers 
in Quebec especially enjoy tremendous advantage.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	I find it very puzzling at times when I discuss this with rural 
members in my riding. Maybe it is not uncommon that the main 
leaders in the federation that supposedly defend the interests of 
farmers have separatist tendencies. Maybe the Bloc do not 
choose to advocate the benefits farmers enjoy because of the 
adherence to the federation that we love to call Canada. 
However, in Quebec they would prefer to have their own 
country.
<P>
	I am baffled. Whenever a letter is written to a newspaper, very 
quickly someone from the UPA for example will refute the 
arguments and we get into a battle.
<P>
	There is no guarantee that the protection farmers enjoy today 
would be continued in a separate Quebec. No member of the 
Bloc Quebecois can stand and honestly  say that in this House. 
The protection is by staying in Canada.
<P>
	If we look at their so-called draft bill, Bloc Quebecois 
members are very quick to state that we are offering only the 
status quo, but they exclude article 1 of their draft bill which 
states categorically that Quebec will be an independent country. 
Then in articles 2 to 16 they say they would like the same 
monetary unit, the same immigration, the same passport, the 
same economic union. That is the status quo. They have all of 
that already within Canada and now they want to destroy it to get 
it back. There is no guarantee they will get protection under 
GATT, the G-7, or any other agreement.
<P>
	To answer the question, the tariffs that were negotiated in the 
last round of the GATT see a decreasing protection through 
tariffication of roughly 15 per cent per year. That will give the 
industry enough time to adapt. By the same token, the 
government has doubled the loan provisions from $1.5 billion to 
$3 billion to help farmers obtain access to needed capital. The 
tariffication process will allow them the needed three or four 
years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> It is 15 per cent over six years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> No, no. It is reducing 15 per cent. The 
transition period they are requesting to my knowledge does not 
exceed more than three or four years. They have plenty of time 
to adapt.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the motion by the hon. 
member for Frontenac. I will focus my remarks on inspection 
and research.
<P>
	It is well known that in our recent budget the guiding principle 
was to share the burden of deficit reduction. Every sector and 
every region has had to make a contribution and this has been 
done fairly. The people of Guelph-Wellington support the 
government in its deficit reduction efforts. My constituents 
want reduced government spending and an end to government 
deficits.
<P>
	Within the context of fiscal restraint we planned our budget to 
support our vision for Canada's agricultural and agri-food 
industry. It is one built on economic growth and security, on 
sustainable agriculture and a safe food supply.
<P>
	Guelph-Wellington represents every aspect of the food 
chain. We have excellent farmers who work the land and provide 
food and dairy products. Better Beef Limited employs over 400 
of our neighbours. Woolwich Dairy Incorporated of Ariss 
produces award winning goat's milk cheeses. The United 
Co-operatives of Ontario manufacture livestock feeds. These 
companies not only provide employment but they also 
contribute to our agricultural industry. My riding houses the 
University of Guelph, an important research facility.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11494"> 11494 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, we are all consumers who value a safe and high 
quality food supply and control of animal and plant diseases that 
have a human health or economic impact. My constituents want 
as our first priority to ensure that food safety will not be 
compromised.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	At the same time, recognizing the need to reduce the deficit, 
the people of Guelph-Wellington know that costs to the 
taxpayer must be reduced. Industry must be helped to find ways 
to keep input costs down so it can offer the best quality product 
at the best price.
<P>
	For these reasons Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has 
been working closely in the past year with other federal 
departments and provincial ministries of agriculture and health 
to develop national standards. We are aiming to establish a 
nationwide Canadian food inspection system. This will reduce 
overlap between jurisdictions and will result in a more 
streamlined and efficient regulatory system. My constituents 
have asked all governments to work together to reduce overlap 
and to control spending, something even the Bloc Quebecois can 
applaud, I would hope.
<P>
	In addition, we will level the playing field between domestic 
and imported industries by enhancing inspection of imported 
products. We will also move to a system of monetary penalties 
in support of enforcement and compliance.
<P>
	These are examples of the fairness that has been demanded by 
the people of Guelph-Wellington and others across this land. 
This fiscal year in co-operation with the meat industry we will 
be implementing program efficiencies in the area of meat 
hygiene.
<P>
	These initiatives are expected to save $10 million. Surely all 
members of this House applaud that initiative. In 1997-98 we 
will be achieving further savings through initiatives such as 
privatizing quality assurance and residue testing and 
implementing hazard analysis and critical control point 
programs.
<P>
	We also plan to transfer routine laboratory testing to the 
private sector. Industry benefits from the food inspection and 
regulatory system earning high prices for higher quality. We 
believe industry should pay its fair share of inspection costs.
<P>
	We are currently negotiating with the private sector to make 
our inspection and quarantine programs more efficient and more 
effective and at the same time to meet budget reduction targets. 
This will be achieved over the next three years through a 
combination of cost reduction, cost avoidance and cost sharing 
initiatives.
<P>
	There will however be no adverse effects on food safety. Let 
me underline that food safety is this government's top priority 
and continues to be. The government's goal here is to reduce the 
cost to taxpayers who live in communities like 
Guelph-Wellington by recovering an additional $46 million of 
the cost of inspection services by 1997-98.
<P>
	To keep at the leading edge of technological changes, we must 
continue to conduct research. As I mentioned earlier, the 
University of Guelph conducts research in the areas of animal 
production. For example, it has developed a vaccine that reduces 
the stress animals suffer during shipping, a saving of millions of 
dollars to producers.
<P>
	The university also studies new breeding methods for crops. 
Its program of agri-food assistance reviews all areas of farming 
production by bringing together all players, for example 
environmentalists, to study both the positive and the negative 
aspects of farming. That is important, the positive and negative 
aspects.
<P>
	Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada will continue to be the 
prime federal source for agricultural research and development 
in Canada. Research and development accounts for a large 
portion of departmental expenditures. It will remain a major 
element of government support to the agri-food sector. We are 
committed to research and technology transfer efforts which 
protect the safety and security of our food supply and the 
sustainability of our resource base.
<P>
	Value added products, new cost saving technology, non-food 
products from agricultural commodities and innovative 
approaches such as biotechnology are all the result of a vibrant 
and creative research infrastructure. We are committed to 
maintaining this. However, given the enormity of the task of 
coming to terms with the federal deficit, all areas must 
contribute their share.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Departmental research and development activities will 
consequently absorb part of the reduction of departmental 
expenditures outlined in the 1995 budget. Savings of $50 
million will be achieved by 1997-98 primarily through 
streamlining the research infrastructure and reductions in areas 
where results are more portable, or the location is not important. 
Of that, an additional $3 million will be saved from the capital 
expenditure budget.
<P>
	We will be moving toward a network of strong, viable, 
focused centres of excellence. Seven smaller research facilities 
will be closed: three in western Canada, two in Ontario, and two 
in Quebec. The remaining centres will be strategically 
positioned to better reflect industry strengths and competitive 
advantages in the regions where they are located, thus creating a 
critical mass of the most useful expertise. Some of our work is 
being transferred to and enhanced in the province of Quebec 
which surely must be appreciated and encouraged by our friends 
in the official opposition.
<P>
	In addition to streamlining our research infrastructure, we are 
also reallocating resources to fund a matching investment 
initiative. This fund will support industry led joint research 
projects. Government will match industry contributions dollar 
for dollar, up to $35 million. A strong response by industry 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11495"> 11495 </A></B>
<P>
could result in an investment of $70 million by the end of this 
century. This will help  offset the reductions and ensure that 
money is spent where industry can best use it.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by re-emphasizing that we are 
committed to maintaining food safety as the priority of the 
inspection system while reducing overlap and duplication; 
levelling the playing field for Canadian producers by ensuring 
better border controls; and sharing the cost of services which 
provide a private benefit to industry. We also remain committed 
to ensuring a safe critical mass of research and technology 
transfer dedicated to the safety of our food supply and the 
sustainability of our agricultural resource base.
<P>
	As I represent the people of Guelph-Wellington, all 
important contributors to our food chain, I express our support 
for these initiatives. I congratulate the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food for ensuring that while funding is reduced, our 
guiding principles will never be compromised.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member for Guelph-Wellington is lucky, because she 
can count on the university bearing the same name as her riding. 
The federal government and several para-public organizations 
contribute considerable research budgets to the university in her 
riding.
<P>
	Members will agree however that not all ridings can boast 
such fine universities as the University of Guelph unfortunately. 
It has put a lot of emphasis on research. I picked a year at 
random from my notes on federal government spending, and 
came up with the research spending of the Department of 
Agriculture in 1990. I will give you a few figures and I invite 
you to reflect on them.
<P>
	The federal government spent almost half of its farming 
research budget in the grain sector, some $111 million. Of 
course, friends out west are not complaining. One hundred and 
eleven million dollars, close to one half. But the grain sector 
only produces six per cent of Canada's farming outputs. In the 
same year, 24 per cent of the federal government's agricultural 
research budget went to the dairy, poultry and hog sectors.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	And it so happens that hog, poultry and dairy producers are 
concentrated in Quebec and, of course, in Ontario.
<P>
	I, myself, am a farmer and a member of the UPA. I know many 
other farmers. I spent all of last Saturday going up and down the 
concessions visiting farmers and it is funny but I did not meet a 
single one who applauded the Liberal government's budget, 
especially regarding farming issues. Not one.
<P>
	Last Monday, I was at the Lafaille auction in Coaticook. Over 
one hundred farmers were there. I asked some questions. They 
were obviously proud to see that one of their own made it to 
Ottawa to defend their interests. None of them were happy. Not 
one.
<P>
	So in Ontario, out of 99-sorry, 98 Liberal ridings, one 
slipped out of their grasp and went to a Reform friend-the 
general protest reminds me of what happened in Quebec in the 
1970s, when the only person even remotely capable of playing 
the role of the opposition was Roch LaSalle.
<P>
	The UPA and the Association des producteurs laitiers have 
literally come out swinging against this budget. Now I will 
discuss an article written by Claude Rivard and will ask the hon. 
member for Guelph-Wellington to comment on it. In a 
newspaper article on dairy producers in Quebec, published in 
March 1995, Mr. Rivard talks about the federal government's 
intention to withdraw altogether from programs in the areas of 
dairy control and genetic testing. That is some major research. 
Her government is backing out and she is happy with the 
research done. My foot.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Madam Speaker, the member for 
Frontenac began by talking about how lucky I am as the member 
for Guelph-Wellington. He is quite right, I am. However, we 
are all lucky to live in this wonderful country. I would like to put 
that on the record.
<P>
	The member for Frontenac wanted to talk about research and 
development. The federal government will be maintaining 
excellent research infrastructure in Quebec which will have four 
of the national centres of excellence; Lennoxville, 
Saint-Hyacinthe, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and Saint-Croix. 
We will transfer 53 research positions from the national capital 
region to these centres, enabling our scientists to concentrate on 
research areas of high priority to Quebec producers and 
processors as well as to producers across eastern Canada and the 
whole country.
<P>
	We are all lucky to live in Canada and to enjoy the support of 
the federal government, including Quebec.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member but her time has expired. Resuming debate. 
The hon. member for Matapédia-Matane.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first of all, I want to thank my colleague, the hon. 
member for Frontenac, for putting forward this opposition 
motion on agriculture. This is an extremely important day for all 
farmers in Quebec and across Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11496"> 11496 </A></B>
<P>
	I see that there are not many members across the way. They 
may not come from another planet, but I do not know where they 
come from.
<P>
	People have been hit very hard by the budget. My colleague 
from Frontenac said earlier that none of the farmers he has 
spoken to was happy with the budget.
<P>
	They claim that the budget is acceptable, that it is a good 
budget. I do not understand where these members come from.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> From Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> It is impossible to pay too much attention to 
agriculture, and especially to young farmers. A nation that is not 
self-sufficient in agriculture must be considered part of the 
third world. A country that does not give top priority to 
agriculture does not understand anything.
<P>
	When game became scarce, mankind turned to farming to 
survive. Nothing has since replaced the food taken from the 
land. However, in order to grow this food, farmers must work 
hard, invest money and take risks. Farmers do face great risks, 
as they have done for generations. They are willing to assume 
terrible risks.
<P>
	These people have attained sovereignty on their land. They 
own their land. They sow their fields with whatever grains they 
please. They breed whatever animals they please. Their work 
does not bind them to a fixed schedule, but one thing is sure, 
they have put in an incredible number of hours. They are ready 
for a country of their own.
<P>
	According to a poll commissioned by the UPA, the results of 
which were released on November 22, 1990, at the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission, 73 per cent of farmers were in 
favour of sovereignty-association, 73 per cent.
<P>
	On September 2, in the middle of the election campaign in 
Quebec, the president of the UPA, Laurent Pellerin, argued in 
the presence of Premier Daniel Johnson that there is not much 
more to fear from sovereignty than from the current situation, 
what we have gone through over poultry and continue to got 
through every day in our trade relations. That is what the 
president of the UPA said.
<P>
	Indeed, farm producers have met great challenges over the 
years, moving from traditional to industrial farming, facing 
international competition, computerizing their businesses, 
learning new production techniques and keeping up with all the 
new advanced technologies. They are ready to take up the new 
and great challenge of becoming the kings in their own castles, 
masters of their own houses, in other words, sovereign.
<P>
	To those who claim that, in a sovereign Quebec, agriculture 
would be profoundly disrupted, our producers reply that the 
future of Quebec's industry is conditioned much more by market 
development than by the advent of a sovereign Quebec.
<P>
	Those who think farm producers from the rest of Canada are 
unlikely to go for maintaining supply management are wrong. 
We all know that, to maintain the revenues of all dairy 
producers, each province must preserve the supply management 
system.
<P>
	We doubt that it would be in the interests of the rest of Canada, 
particularly Ontario and the Maritimes, to eliminate the supply 
management system, which is still the only adequate income 
security system for farmers. Should that system be eliminated, 
markets would open up and, to be sure, the rest of Canada would 
be the biggest loser.
<P>
	Allow me to digress for a moment. It is difficult in Quebec, 
particularly in my region, to talk about agriculture without 
referring to forestry. Most of our farmers have some woodland 
on their farm. In many cases, if used properly, that woodland can 
provide a supplementary income which can sometimes be 
relatively substantial.
<P>
	Again, the federal government will hurt these farmers. The 
Eastern Quebec Development Plan, which was to be renewed for 
three years, was only extended for one year.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	This will result in a shortfall of more than $13 million over a 
two-year period. The federal-provincial agreement, which will 
end in 1996, is also in bad shape. As you know, these 
federal-provincial agreements have been in place for 25 years 
and their continued existence is now uncertain, unfortunately. 
Foresters and farmers are very concerned.
<P>
	Investing in agriculture is an obligation, while investing in 
forestry is a necessity. It is a plus, an investment. It is not a 
donation. The ministers of agriculture and natural resources are 
yielding to the finance minister who, in turn, yields to the 
multinationals. The problem is: who governs the country? It is 
the multinationals. Occasionally, the Minister of Finance will 
give his opinion, but it is just an opinion. Earlier, some members 
opposite accused us of being partisan; sure, because we 
represent our people. We are quite willing to be accused of 
partisanship because we truly look after the interests of those 
whom we represent.
<P>
	What will happen is disturbing, if not downright frightening.
<P>
	We have a moral obligation to feed ourselves, as well as 
others, because the Gaspé Peninsula is a vast territory. If we 
were given the tools to invest in our agricultural land base, we 
could feed thousands, perhaps millions of people. All we need is 
a bit of help. As I said earlier, people in our regions are used to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11497"> 11497 </A></B>
<P>
taking risks and putting  up with an unpredictable climate, 
various diseases and fluctuating interest rates. They are 
survivors. They can once again meet the challenge with pride 
and dignity.
<P>
	People need more than bread: they need more than figures and 
financial statements. Quebec farmers know that what people 
need above all are dignity and pride. Should we deprive 
ourselves of the life enjoyed by free nations, which deserve to be 
free, merely because we are a minority in North America? Based 
on what logic or what decree should the Quebec nation deprive 
itself of what is vital to other nations? Farmers know our history 
well. They know that there was a winner and a loser.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying to my fellow farmers: you should 
not have any complexes: your past performances are a guarantee 
of future success. Your land is yours. All you have to do is give 
yourself a country. That country is called Quebec.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
hon. friend talked about the future as being frightening. I would 
certainly agree with him. The future is extremely frightening for 
Quebec farmers if they listen to the misinformation which I 
heard coming from the other side relative to what would happen 
if Quebec separates.
<P>
	He is absolutely right in saying that supply management has 
been the only viable income system for farmers. He should 
admit up front that this viable income system will be put in 
jeopardy should Quebec move toward separation. That supply 
management system is one of the benefits Quebec farmers have 
gained from being a part of Canadian federation.
<P>
	While I am on my feet, I might as well ask a question about my 
concern with the resolution put forward by hon. members 
opposite. They are leaving the impression that converting the 
grain transportation subsidies into direct subsidies to western 
farmers is an advantage at the expense of Quebec. Nothing could 
be further from the truth.
<P>
	As a government, we have admitted that changing the WGTA, 
which has been the cornerstone of agricultural policy in western 
Canada, is extremely hurtful to western farmers. The fact of the 
matter is that farmers in Quebec got off relatively lightly with 
the budget as compared to those in the west.
<P>
	How does the member opposite explain to farmers in Quebec 
that they are not going to lose the supply management system 
should they move to separation? Is he not willing to admit that 
Canada has been extremely good to farmers in Quebec over the 
last century and in fact the budget has really been relatively light 
in targeting Quebec farmers?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member asked a question, but I think the 
answer is pretty obvious, because as you know, when we need 
something, we go to whoever has what we want. At one point, 
Russia was ordering wheat from us. We were capitalists and they 
were communists. They did not care about borders. They came 
to buy our wheat because it was good wheat and the price was 
right.
<P>
	When people say Canada had been very good for Quebec, my 
answer is this: our farmers are telling us this has got to stop. 
These are not my words but theirs. I speak on their behalf, since 
when we are elected, it is our duty is to speak on behalf of our 
constituents. I talked to farmers and they told me to say what I 
just said. This is no joke, this is dead serious. I speak for the 
farmers in my riding, and they say it is practically impossible to 
live with this kind of system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as soon as the Bloc Quebecois caucus 
decided that the next motion on the Order Paper for our 
opposition day, would be a motion on agriculture denouncing 
the Liberal government's budget, I told the hon. member for 
Frontenac that I was very anxious to speak in this debate.
<P>
	First of all, I want to commend my colleague from Frontenac 
for the clarity of his presentation and also for the fact that his 
interventions on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois were very much 
to the point.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11498"> 11498 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I want to congratulate him on behalf of all farmers in Quebec 
who are proud of the work done by the hon. member for 
Frontenac.
<P>
	It is rather difficult to remain calm when speaking in this kind 
of debate. Especially when we hear from members on the 
government benches, although the same could be said of some 
Reform Party members, what I would qualify, without wishing 
to use unparliamentary terms, as outrageous statements from 
Liberal members and several members of the Reform Party.
<P>
	I am referring more specifically, before I get to the gist of my 
speech, to what was said by the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, who in this very House accused 
all Bloc members of lying or saying the opposite of the truth, 
which apparently is parliamentary, and then, with the Minister 
of Agriculture, accused us of causing emotions to run high 
across this beautiful country of ours.
<P>
	The hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is 
extremely good at saying just about anything without being too 
particular about how he says it. Everyone will recall, and this 
will go down in history as one of the achievements of the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, his speech in the 
House during the debate on back-to-work legislation to settle 
the railway dispute. The hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell rose in the House to speak out 
loud and clear about what one of his constituents had told him 
which was, according to him, that shipping costs for soya beans 
had gone up 20 per cent because of this dispute. And he gave us 
his constituent's telephone number so that we could call him 
right away. Well, it transpired that the only element of truth in 
what was said by the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell was this telephone number. That 
was the only fact. The rest was a tissue of falsehoods. This was 
checked immediately by the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm who called our Liberal colleague's 
constituent on the telephone.
<P>
	This morning, or was it this afternoon, I also heard the hon. 
member for Lisgar-Marquette of the Reform Party say that 
Quebec benefited as a result of federal intervention, especially 
in the dairy sector. I would like to take a few minutes to clear up 
a few things.
<P>
	As everybody in this House knows, I represent the riding of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead where there is a large number 
of farmers, especially dairy farmers. Dairy farming is a very 
important industry, economically speaking. The economic 
spin-offs of dairy farming in my riding amount to tens of 
millions of dollars. As one can see, milk production is a very 
significant activity in Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead.
<P>
	We are told that, should Quebec become sovereign, the rest of 
Canada will refuse to buy milk from Quebec. This is the kind of 
blackmailing we are being subjected to, and of course, there is 
no intent, on the part of our  colleagues who make this 
suggestion, to have feelings run high.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Very calmly, they are not trying to scare anyone; on the 
contrary, they just want to reassure us by saying that once 
Quebec is sovereign, there will be no more dealing with Quebec. 
This is what is being said in this House.
<P>
	This seems to me to be utter nonsense. One must look at the 
facts. The facts are that trade between Quebec and Canada 
amounts to more than $80 billion. For a large part, this trade is in 
agricultural products. In this area, Quebec shows an average 
deficit of more than $800 million.
<P>
	That is to say that Quebec buys from the rest of Canada more 
than it sells. So, if someone should be doing some blackmailing 
in the context of a sovereign Quebec, it certainly should not be 
the rest of Canada. This means that English Canada would 
decide, in cold blood, to stop buying milk from Quebec 
producers, while knowing that Quebec could buy its beef, grain 
and other foodstuff from other sources.
<P>
	I am saying this again very seriously mostly for the benefit of 
farmers, the men and women who own farms worth hundreds of 
thousands of dollars, sometimes even more than one million 
dollars. Agriculture in Quebec is no small potatoes. It is a 
thriving industry. A very significant industry.
<P>
	I am saying this for the benefit of these men and women, 
Quebec's sovereignty cannot have the impact Liberal and 
Reform members would like us to believe. With Canada 
showing an $800 million deficit-and it is important to keep this 
figure in mind-in agriculture each and every year, Quebec is in 
a strong bargaining position when the time comes to negotiate 
with the rest of Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi stated in this House 
that the Quebec government was cutting funding to agricultural 
research and development. He asked us very 
seriously-probably confusing one level of government with 
the other because he is newly elected at the federal level-to 
take the matter up with the Government of Quebec so that the 
situation can be remedied.
<P>
	I just want to point out to the hon. member for 
Brome-Missisquoi and all the hon. members of this House that 
the best solution to Quebec's budget problems is for Quebec to 
become sovereign. Quebec's share of the federal agriculture 
department's budget of more than $2 billion should be $500 
million-that is how much should be spent in Quebec-but the 
figures prove otherwise. Instead of 25 per cent, we are actually 
getting 12 per cent; for research and development, it is more like 
10 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11499"> 11499 </A></B>
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that the best solution to Quebec's 
agricultural development problem is to achieve sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would like to remind 
the hon. member that, in remarks made earlier today, he used 
words that almost fit my description of unparliamentary 
language. I would simply ask him to be careful when referring to 
what the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell said.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead for his spirited speech 
regarding agricultural producers in his riding. I too represent an 
agricultural riding in Alberta. I am a farmer and I appreciate his 
concerns for the people who are affected.
<P>
	However, I do want to remind the hon. member that no one is 
talking about refusing to buy milk from Quebec, even though 
Quebec now enjoys 50 per cent of the Canadian fluid milk 
market with only approximately 25 per cent of the population. If 
Quebec were to separate, that might influence whether the rest 
of Canada would buy milk from Quebec. It certainly would not 
buy milk based on a 351 per cent tariff. It would be looking for a 
price based on a world price. If it is going to be competing it has 
to meet the competition. I see that as the biggest threat, not the 
decision of whether to buy from Quebec.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to give us some idea of how the 
supply-managed producers in his riding can make the transition 
from the current system, with 351 per cent as the high tariff on 
butter-they are all in that range-down to free trade in 
agricultural products, which is going to happen over a period of 
time. How do we make that transition easier for the producers? It 
is of concern to all of us. He talked about the hundreds of 
thousands of dollars that these people have invested. The same 
situation exists in the grain farming industry in western Canada.
<P>
	It seems to me that as responsible people we have to not 
pretend that we will have the supply-managed tariffs in effect 
forever. We must look at the reality that we are going to have 
free trade and there will be zero tariffs down the road. We have 
to help these people make the adjustments necessary to get 
there. I would welcome his comments in that regard.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from the 
Reform Party for his question which seems quite relevant. I will 
answer his question as clearly as possible. In fact, he is asking 
me how farmers can adjust to the new international trade 
context, that is, the reduction in tariffs now set under GATT?
<P>
	Of course, this is a major concern of farmers in my riding and 
throughout Quebec and of all dairy and other producers affected 
by international trade and tariffs.
<P>
	Allow me to share with him some farmers' reaction with 
respect to dairy production in particular. Many farmers in my 
riding said in response to my questions that they would be 
willing to compete with U.S. farmers-since they are our main 
competition in the area of dairy production-provided they 
played by the same rules. In other words, they would if they 
were in the position to offer products as good as those on the 
American market.
<P>
	It must be pointed out that in both Quebec and Canada-since 
the milk marketing system is the same across the country-not 
only production but also quality is subject to regulations. This is 
something we can be proud of. If we want to preserve this 
quality, we must pay the costs involved. The whole matter must 
be considered. I will surely have the opportunity to get back to 
this later.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Gatineau-La Lièvre.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	The motion before the House today suggests this government 
is providing western farmers with an unfair advantage over 
farmers in eastern Canada. Our job has been and always will be 
to work with all sectors of the agriculture and agri-food industry 
to create opportunities and advantages, not to promote one 
sector at the advantage of another or one region over another, as 
my hon. colleagues would suggest.
<P>
	This government's first and foremost priority is to win the 
national battle against the deficit. Within that reality of fewer 
government dollars, this government is working extremely hard 
through the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 
to help position the Canadian agriculture and agri-food sector to 
increase Canada's share in every available marketplace, at home 
and abroad. That work has not been at the expense of one part of 
the country over another. Western and eastern farmers alike 
have said repeatedly that they do not want to be subsidized; they 
just want good markets and fair prices.
<P>
	The changes outlined in this government's budget will help 
farmers reach that goal while helping reduce the overall cost of 
government through changes that are designed to improve our 
efficiency and competitiveness, to remove impediments to 
development and value-added production and processing, and 
to take maximum advantage of the world's new trading 
environment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11500"> 11500 </A></B>
<P>
	This government recognized that structural reform in our 
transportation system was long overdue. Reforming the Western 
Grain Transportation Act will eliminate barriers to value-added 
opportunities, diversifications and economic growth. 
Eliminating the WGTA will provide Canada and the agri-food 
sector with a faster, lower-cost and more efficient 
transportation system. Transportation reform can help us more 
effectively comply with the new international trade rules under 
GATT.
<P>
	There is a big difference between subsidies for grain 
transportation and dairy producers. In fact, eliminating the $560 
million subsidy addresses competitive concerns raised by 
farmers in eastern Canada. The annual subsidy, which has 
already been reduced by over 23 per cent in the last two years, is 
now being completely eliminated as of August 1, 1995. The 
dairy subsidy meanwhile is being reduced by only 30 per cent 
over a period of two years.
<P>
	The adjustment package this government is offering to the 
grain industry reflects the potential impact of eliminating a 
96-year-old commitment to the western grain sector. To 
eliminate the subsidy with no funds to help the sector adjust 
would seriously disrupt the prairie grain economy because it has 
traditionally represented an important source of land value for 
prairie producers. An ex gratia capital payment of $1.6 billion 
will be paid to owners of prairie farmland in recognition of the 
impact on land values that may result from the termination of 
the long-standing freight rate subsidies. This one-time payment 
is not tied to production or marketing decisions.
<P>
	A multi-year adjustment package of $300 million has also 
been established to address specific issues arising from the 
transportation reform. The amount is not excessive. It does not 
give western farmers an unfair advantage. Rather it is necessary 
to help adjustment of the industry and the transportation system 
in the west.
<P>
	It should also be noted that while the GATT agreement has 
brought some discipline to export subsidies, the prairie grain 
sector will face considerable competition from subsidized 
exports of grain. While the dairy subsidy is being reduced, it is 
not disappearing. In fact, our national supply management 
system, one of the great advantages of our federal system, 
ensures a reasonable return to efficient producers, and this 
management system will be maintained.
<P>
	It is rather ironic that the hon. opposition member calls our 
approach to transportation reform an unfair advantage for 
western farmers. Some western provinces and producers have 
argued the budget cuts to western Canada are substantially 
greater than to eastern Canada. They have argued that eastern 
Canada is receiving a greater share in adjustment transitional 
funding relative to the magnitude of the subsidy programs that 
are being eliminated or reduced.
<P>
	What this tells us is that all farmers, and indeed all Canadians, 
are sharing equally, as we must, in the responsibility for deficit 
reduction. It is a responsibility we must all shoulder to ensure 
the future growth of our agriculture and agri-food sector and to 
maintain our competitiveness on a global scale.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	This government is creating opportunities for western and 
eastern Canadian farmers alike. As my hon. colleagues know, 
this government has set aside considerable funding for 
adaptation initiatives. While the overall budget for Agriculture 
and Agri-Food Canada may have been reduced by 19 per cent, 
the department has initiated a 20 per cent increase in its 
adaptation funding. This reflects the industry's shift in direction 
toward acquiring financial security from the marketplace rather 
than from government programs. This adaptation funding is 
available equally to farmers in eastern and western Canada to 
help improve the sector's ability to grow and capture markets.
<P>
	This government's package of reforms to grain transportation 
is not inconsistent with the position set out by the Quebec 
coalition on the WGTA in December 1994. The package of 
subsidy reform is fair and balanced with respect to different 
situations in different regions of our country and in different 
sectors. All will have to do their share in contributing to deficit 
reduction and all will share in reaping the benefits.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House this afternoon to ask a 
question of the member for Saskatoon-Dundurn.
<P>
	I am quite taken aback by his very weak defence of the 
elimination of the Crow benefit for western Canadian farmers. I 
am taken aback because he says in his remarks that the 
elimination of the Crow benefit will take away almost half of the 
net farm income from farmers in Saskatchewan alone; it will 
reduce their land values by a significant amount; and it will 
double and in many cases triple freight rates for the 
transportation of grain. He said: ``This is creating opportunities 
for farmers'', that the Liberal program of eliminating the Crow 
benefit for farmers, which will devastate rural Saskatchewan 
and western and rural Canada, is creating opportunities for 
farmers.
<P>
	This is reminiscent of another movie. The movie I refer to is 
in Saskatchewan with Grant Devine, the PC premier who 
bankrupted the province-he and his cabinet-almost 
single-handedly in nine short years. It was one of the wealthiest 
provinces in Canada. They fired 275 highway workers and their 
comment at that time was not ``creating opportunities for 
farmers''; their comment was that they were freeing up the 
workers to participate in the private sector. That is exactly the 
same kind of comment, the arrogant positioning of the Liberal 
government with respect to the elimination of the Crow, that we 
hear today in this House of Commons.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11501"> 11501 </A></B>
<P>
	I find that personally distasteful. I predict, and many farmers 
and other people in Saskatchewan predict, that come the next 
federal election we will not see one Liberal member of 
Parliament re-elected as a result of this single attack on farmers, 
as well as the rail-line abandonment issue.
<P>
	The member for Malpeque, another Liberal member who 
voted in favour of the abolition of the Crow benefit, is now 
chairman of an agriculture subcommittee going around the 
country listening to farmers' concerns, joined by Reformers and 
other Liberals, to see what impact the elimination of the Crow 
benefit will be. We can tell them what the impact will be, but 
having the Liberal member for Malpeque and his other members 
go around the country listening to farmers' concerns is like 
putting a pack of wolves in charge of the hen-house. Liberal and 
Reform members are saying: ``We want to hear what the impact 
will be, Mr. and Mrs. Farmer. Please tell us. Although we voted 
to eliminate it, we are going to try to listen to your concerns.'' 
That is a sham. That is a scam.
<P>
	The Liberal member for St. Boniface, who participates in this 
debate from his seat, does not understand the issue because he 
does not have any rural component in his constituency. If he did, 
he would be in jeopardy of losing his seat as well.
<P>
	How does the member from Dundurn explain that the 
elimination of the Crow benefit and massive rail-line 
abandonment will increase exports when in fact grain will not be 
produced for export in the same quantity as it is now? Farmers 
will be going bankrupt in substantial numbers and people will 
see a smaller number of farmers farming in western Canada. 
How does he square that?
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member mentions the 
bankruptcy of farmers. The bankruptcy of farmers in 
Saskatchewan, should any arise, will be as a result of the 
provincial NDP policies not as a result of Liberal policy at the 
federal level.
<P>
	Let us not forget that some policies in Saskatchewan which 
the hon. member has been espousing as being so wonderful are 
by the NDP government. It is the same NDP government in 
Saskatchewan that would not lower the provincial sales tax, 
which chased away business into other provinces. It is the same 
government that would not reduce the aviation fuel tax until 
pressured to do so, again chasing jobs away. This is because the 
NDP government in the province of Saskatchewan did not want 
to lower its equalization payments from the federal government.
<P>
	The NDP government in Saskatchewan has been living like a 
welfare bum off the federal government. That is what it has been 
doing. As fast as we have been creating jobs in Saskatchewan 
under infrastructure and other programs, the Government of 
Saskatchewan has been destroying those jobs.
<P>
	I do not believe the hon. member is in a position to be 
commenting on the devastation of the agricultural industry, 
which is not occurring in Saskatchewan. In fact, production is 
going up in other sectors such as hog production and cattle 
production. The whole industry will benefit rather than suffer, as 
indicated by the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the remarks made by the hon. member for 
Saskatoon-Dundurn and the questions posed by the hon. 
member for Regina-Lumsden show the conflict that exists in 
the agricultural sector and the need for reform.
<P>
	Of course, we are concerned about the changes or budget cuts 
recently announced by the Canadian Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food. In its motion, the opposition denounces as unfair to 
some Canadian farmers the budget cuts recently announced by 
the Minister of Finance. These people are clearly acting in good 
faith but I am sure that they are mistaken.
<P>
	Sometimes, our colleagues opposite do not realize that this 
country is facing a crisis as a result of the deficit accumulated 
over the past 15 to 20 years. Our deficit represents 73 per cent of 
GDP. We can no longer put it off. Whatever difficulties await us 
in the future, certain problems must be solved, namely bringing 
public spending under control and introducing sound 
management for all Canadians without exception.
<P>
	The Department of Agriculture was asked to cut spending by 
19 per cent. Other departments were also required to make 
sacrifices. The Department of Agriculture met the challenge and 
found a way to sweeten the pill by ensuring that the cuts are fair 
to all farmers across Canada.
<P>
	Breeders in animal feed deficit areas receive feed grain 
transportation subsidies aimed at reducing the cost of this feed 
and allowing breeders to compete. Financial help is provided to 
breeders almost everywhere from the Atlantic provinces to the 
Yukon, including parts of Eastern Quebec, Northern Ontario and 
British Columbia. Those are the facts.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	A subsidy on which rely the producers in most provinces, 
including Quebec, is about to disappear, but there is more. The 
government recognizes that this may not be a popular measure. 
It also knows that it cannot, and must not, ask producers to 
drastically change their operations overnight.
<P>
	Contrary to what some might think, the government is willing 
to listen. During our post-budget consultations, we learned that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11502"> 11502 </A></B>
<P>
the initial date set for the elimination of the FFAP, the Feed 
Freight Assistance Program, which was October 1, did not give 
enough time to the producers and to the industry to adjust to 
such a major change. Consequently, the government agreed to 
wait until  December 31, 1995, and not reduce the level of 
assistance provided during that period.
<P>
	While the government will eliminate the subsidy provided 
under the FFAP, it will inject $62 million, over the next ten 
years, in the regions where the FFAP is currently in effect. Part 
of these funds will be used to make the payments provided under 
the program, until it expires later this year. The government is 
also providing financial assistance by giving a lump sum 
payment to western farmers affected by the repeal of the WGTA. 
We are receptive to the concerns of producers, while also 
showing fiscal restraint with the taxpayers' money.
<P>
	This financial assistance will be provided to affected 
producers in every province and region in the country. How will 
that money be spent? As you know, we do not have that answer 
yet, but we decided to seek the help of experts. The government 
feels that those who are most qualified to answer that question 
are the producers, the people in the food and cattle industry, the 
feed producers and the animal farmers from the regions which 
will be most affected by the gradual elimination of the FFAP.
<P>
	This is why the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
announced that consultations would be held with the producers, 
in the coming weeks and months, to look at ways to use the FFAP 
adjustment fund and the transition fund. Moreover, these people 
will look at various financing options offered by other programs 
run by the Department of Agriculture, including the joint 
investment project in agri-food research.
<P>
	The government is aware that hard times lie ahead. This is not 
necessarily the best solution, but under these circumstances, we 
have to act. However, we would be grateful if the opposition 
could come up with better solutions. I remind the House that, 
because of the disastrous economic situation we have inherited 
from the previous government, we have no other choice but to 
take rather drastic measures.
<P>
	National consultation is the only way to establish closer ties 
with representatives from the agricultural industry. Together, 
we can find solutions, come up with new ideas and even reach 
compromises that would ensure that all farmers are treated 
fairly. This agricultural reform should have been implemented 
several years ago. Think about what is happening in the area of 
fisheries and oceans, where the fish stock has been declining for 
the last ten years, where we are still waiting for changes that 
should have been made more than 10 years ago, and look atthe results. We do not want the same situation to occur inagriculture.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	The whole world is undergoing unprecedented changes and in 
turn we have to make fundamental changes to preserve our 
agri-food industry.
<P>
	Finally, all those who know something about agriculture 
realize that this industry has been very efficient in the past in 
Canada. We are one of the most fortunate countries in the world, 
because our agri-food industry has evolved rather nicely. 
However, with all the changes that were made in terms of GATT 
and NAFTA, and with the competitiveness of the United States 
south of our border, we are under a lot of pressure.
<P>
	There are times, I must say, when the dealings of the United 
States on the world market create unfair competition. A country 
with a tenth of its population is bound to be affected by its 
actions. This is why the Department of Agriculture must make 
changes. We do not want the situation to worsen. It could have 
very disastrous consequences for all of Canada.
<P>
	So, we must recognize that the measures put forward are not 
perfect. But nothing is perfect in this world. Any way, the 
important thing is to act. As the situation evolves, we will make 
adjustments to ensure that all farmers are treated fairly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I agree up to a point with the hon. member for Gatineau-La 
Lièvre who shares with me the position of vice-chairman of the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. I must 
admit that the hon. member is very knowledgeable on 
agricultural matters.
<P>
	However, I may remind him that the country's current debt 
was not created by the Americans, the French or the Mexicans. 
Around 1969-70, the debt was almost nil. I will not tell you who 
was governing the country at the time, since you know that 
better than I do. But in 1984, when Liberals were ousted, the 
debt totalled around $250 billion.
<P>
	In nine years, the Tories brought the debt close to $500 
billion. His team was responsible for creating at least half of the 
cumulative debt. Today, the government is asking or rather 
telling farmers to do their share to reduce the deficit it created in 
the first place. And farmers, oddly enough, are being asked to do 
a bit more than that.
<P>
	My friends opposite did not mention the fact that during the 
past fiscal year, 328,000 flights were logged by public servants, 
not including members of the House of Commons and senators. 
The cost: $275.5 million. They do not mention that.
<P>
	Earlier, while listening to the hon. member for Gatineau-La 
Lièvre, I was reading an editorial by Claude Rivard, Quebec 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11503"> 11503 </A></B>
<P>
president of the dairy producers, who had the following to say: 
``As far as reducing the deficit is concerned, we expected Mr. 
Martin and his government to do what they promised: a budget 
that would be hard but fair''. You may recall that for a month  
they were saying that the budget would be hard but fair. The 
article goes on: ``Well as far as we are concerned, the Chrétien 
government was hard but unfair''. That is the perception Quebec 
farmers have of this budget.
<P>
	And what about the major banks that declared a profit of $3.5 
billion in one year? They will be asked to pay a meagre 
additional $100 million as a temporary tax, spread over 18 
months.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I realize that the major banks are among those that make the 
biggest donations to the party's coffers. There was the 
Conservative Party, but since they are out of the picture, I will 
not mention that.
<P>
	So I agree we have to reduce the deficit. But, instead of 
coming down hard on farmers, I would like to add, for the 
benefit of the hon. member for Malpèque, that in 1988-89-and 
I am about to conclude, Madam Speaker,-spending in the 
agri-food sector, as a percentage of total federal spending, was 
3.5 per cent. In 1994-95-the fiscal year which just came to an 
end-this percentage was 1.6 per cent; and in 1996-97, it is 
expected to be 1.2 per cent. So I am not very pleased with the 
way this government has treated and will treat agriculture in 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assad:</B> Madam Speaker, I must correct something. My 
colleague opposite said that, in 1984, the Liberal government 
left behind a debt of $250 billion. The debt was not $250 billion, 
but $160 billion. There is a big difference. In 1984, in terms of 
the Canadian economy, the debt was one of the lowest among the 
industrialized countries. I therefore find it a bit odd that he is 
providing incorrect figures. He could look at the facts.
<P>
	Secondly, he mentioned that Mr. Rivard, the head of the dairy 
producers association, had said it was a tough budget. It is true. 
It is pretty tough, but it must be remembered that a Liberal 
government elevated the dairy industry to its present level. With 
milk quotas, dairy farmers in Quebec have become some of our 
wealthiest farmers. We must look at both sides of the issue.
<P>
	I would tell my colleague across the floor that he should try to 
quote figures accurately. There are consequences for failing to 
do so.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Verchères-international trade; the hon. 
member for Cumberland-Colchester-health; the hon. 
member for Lévis-youth strategy.
<P>
	Debate resumes with the hon. member for Lotbinière.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to talk about agriculture, a critical sector of our economy.
<P>
	The official opposition is using this day devoted to agriculture 
to set the record straight in this area. I would not be surprised if, 
last week end, some members opposite forgot to reset their 
clocks.
<P>
	Our job is to set the record straight regarding the last budget 
which has left Quebec farmers with a rather bitter aftertaste.
<P>
	This last budget shows once more how unfair this government 
is.
<P>
	The transition measures planned for Western producers 
following the elimination of the Crow rate are typical of the 
double standards applied by this government. Our party's 
position is clear: we support the elimination of this subsidy 
which created undue distortion in grain transportation.
<P>
	However, we are against the $2.2 billion transition payment to 
western producers. By reneging on its commitments, the federal 
government is pitting eastern producers against their western 
counterparts and creates new trade distortions. Once the subsidy 
is eliminated, grain producers in remote areas will be tempted to 
dump their products on the domestic market. Otherwise, they 
will have to pay for transportation costs to foreign markets. This 
will lead to lower grain prices in the west, and higher prices in 
the east, since they will reflect the real transportation costs.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, beef and dairy farmers in the east will be doubly 
penalized, compared to their competitors in the west, since they 
use cereals as feed.
<P>
	This is not an attack against western producers. It is the 
federal government, and no one else, which is upsetting 
domestic markets by introducing compensatory measures which 
apply only to the west. The government created an imbalance 
when it introduced the Crow rate and it now creates a new 
imbalance by doing away with it. It should have either cut the 
subsidy without compensation or cut it and compensated 
equitably all producers. It is probably too much to ask from 
people who, as usual, acted without considering the 
consequences.
<P>
	Following Martin's budget, the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food will see his budget go from $2.1 billion to $1.7 
billion in three years. Two thousand positions will be abolished 
because of these cuts.
<P>
	Rather than cutting the budget in this way, why did the federal 
government not transfer the resources to the provinces? They 
could have rationalized spending, taking into account the 
programs they already manage. All the federal government had 
to do was withdraw from this field of provincial jurisdiction. 
Again, this is a perfect example of duplication since two levels 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11504"> 11504 </A></B>
<P>
of government are going to compete against each other at the 
expense of  the industry. By eliminating overlaps we could have 
avoided some cuts.
<P>
	Quebec would certainly not have slashed research and 
development, and the experimental farms of La Pocatière and 
L'Assomption would have survived. In the farm community, as 
well as many others, we question the relevance of paying taxes 
to Ottawa when we do not get in return the necessary resources 
to develop our industry.
<P>
	Also, we are still not getting our fair share of federal spending 
in agriculture, since we are only receiving about 12.4 per cent 
when 17 per cent of agricultural revenues come from Quebec. 
Meanwhile, the west is taking the lion's share with about 60 per 
cent of federal spending.
<P>
	The situation in Quebec worsened since 1980, when our share 
of spending was 16.4 per cent. Moreover, taxes paid by our 
farmers help maintain policies which compete with their own 
production. Yes, many Quebec farmers are questioning the use 
of remaining in a country which lets them down at the slightest 
provocation. On the other hand, we know that we will have to 
counteract the fear generated by federalists.
<P>
	The fear campaign began when federalist mercenaries 
published statements concerning the dairy industry in Quebec 
which, according to them, would be threatened by sovereignty. 
We are told that a sovereign Quebec would loose half its quota of 
industrial milk, which would lead to the closing of thousands of 
dairy farms in Quebec.
<P>
	According to federalists, sovereignty would be catastrophic 
for the Quebec dairy farmers who supply the federation with 48 
per cent of its industrial milk whereas Quebec only represents 
25 p. 100 of the Canadian population.
<P>
	Let us analyze the facts calmly. It is incorrect to say that a 
sovereign Quebec will no longer trade with the rest of Canada. 
The Quebec dairy industry is not a blessing, nor a gift or an 
advantage of federalism. It is just an economic fact.
<P>
	Therefore, the worse case scenario should take into account 
the fact that the value of the trade between Quebec and Canada is 
more than $80 billion and that trading is not one way only. If 
Quebec is to lose its trade with the rest of Canada, is not the 
reverse also true?
<P>
	Comparing one scenario to another, members will admit that 
this one defining an economic area which is advantageous to 
both parties is more realistic. True, it will not win an Oscar in 
the horror category or for fiction. But it is also true that people 
prefer movies with a happy ending. Here is a true script: just last 
Wednesday, dairy farmers from Quebec and Canada signed a 
memorandum of agreement on the integration of marketing 
operations for fluid milk and industrial milk in six eastern 
provinces. In these six provinces, farmers will be paid the same 
price for their milk and will share a common quota.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Together, these provinces represent 85 per cent of the 
Canadian industrial milk quota. Such integration will eliminate 
interprovincial barriers to milk supply. Quebec played a 
substantial role in this issue. Nobody was tempted to ignore it.
<P>
	Without Quebec, the Canadian milk policy would fall down. 
The dairy farmers from other provinces know that and 
understand perfectly. In this pre-referendum period, they 
acknowledge the importance of economic integration with 
Quebec. We have put the federalist scare scenario far behind us, 
have we not? Canadian dairy producers know that the day after 
Quebec votes yes in the referendum, Canada will maintain an 
economic union with Quebec, not to please Quebecers but to 
protect its own interests.
<P>
	Who would dare think of excluding Quebec from the supply 
management system, from quotas? Producers from other parts 
of Canada would have to compete with the highly competitive 
Quebec dairy producers and the Canadian market would 
experience a shortage of products from Quebec. The GATT 
would prevent Canada from slapping on new trade restrictions to 
prevent dairy products from Quebec from making inroads into 
its market.
<P>
	The GATT prohibits the imposition of new restrictions on 
markets. Maintaining a common economic link would permit us 
to ward off pressure from the Americans, who have remained 
opposed to customs tariffs on Canadian dairy products. 
Federalists are also trying to use NAFTA to scare us.
<P>
	Even though the United States always tries to get the most out 
of its trading partners, Quebec will invoke the GATT to protect 
its customs tariffs, just like the Canadian government does.
<P>
	If we absolutely must talk about threats to the dairy industry 
in Quebec, let us talk about the latest federal budget. That is the 
real threat to the dairy industry. The government is reducing its 
industrial milk subsidy by 30 per cent over a two year period. 
Obviously, with 48 per cent of the quota for industrial milk, 
Quebec will have to absorb a large part of the cuts.
<P>
	Calculating quickly, that will represent an income loss of 
$3,775 for medium sized dairy producers, whose average net 
income is $25,000. This will mean a 15 per cent drop in income, 
in addition to the increased cost of livestock feed stemming 
from the loss of subsidies for grain transport and feed transport, 
to which I referred at the outset.
<P>
	I repeat that no compensation will be offered in this budget to 
Quebec farmers, who will be the hardest hit.
<P>
	In closing, please allow me to quote the Quebec Minister of 
Agriculture, Marcel Landry, after the Martin budget was tabled. 
He said that Canada's new federalism is a big tax grab, a 
reduction of services, and national standards. On this subject, he 
recommends taking control  over our taxes as soon as possible 
and starting to map our own paths for the future-

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but the hon. 
member's time has expired. Questions and comments. The hon. 
member for Malpeque.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to point out to the hon. member that I am one federalist 
who is not trying to scare Quebecers or Quebec farmers. I am 
trying to make sure the farmers understand the facts as they 
relate to Canada, especially in terms of the supply management 
system.
<P>
	I am assuming it was an oversight on the part of the member 
when he talked about 12.4 per cent of the direct moneys to 
Quebec farmers and that he did not think was a fair share. 
Quebec has 48 per cent of the dairy quota.
<P>
	Has the hon. member done any calculations? If he has could 
he table any calculations on the real benefit to farmers in Quebec 
of the Canadian supply management system in terms of dairy, 
poultry and eggs?
<P>
	The member talked about the loss of the subsidy. I will agree 
that is a loss. I am a dairy producer and I accept the cutback in 
the subsidy in terms of my contribution to deficit reduction. At 
the same time I know full well, as does the member, the dairy 
industry operates on a cost of production formula which assures 
efficient farmers reasonable returns on their cost of production, 
labour and investment. That is a pretty good deal. We know they 
are getting that deal from Canada.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	I have a last point I want to make. It may just be a factual 
error, but I would not want the member to leave the wrong 
impression. The member said there was no compensation for the 
loss of the feed freight assistance program. Adjustment moneys 
have been put in place for the loss of the program. We face that 
in Prince Edward Island as well. In fact $60 million has been set 
aside for farmers to use in order to adjust to the loss of the 
program.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to respond to 
my colleague from Malpeque. He spoke about equity. He 
admitted in his speech that an inequity problem had existed for a 
long time between Quebec and the rest of Canada.
<P>
	He said that he used to be a farmer in the Maritimes. He knows 
full well that, a few years ago, potatoes from the Maritimes were 
fully subsidized for export to the Quebec market, while Quebec 
farmers had to pay transportation costs for their potatoes. 
Farmers in Quebec and the Maritimes were competing for the 
same Quebec consumers. If we are going to talk about equity, we 
should really do so.
<P>
	With regard to transportation, the Crow rate has been 
eliminated, but some compensation formulas are still unfair to 
Quebec. Twenty-five years ago, I was too young to be involved 
in politics but some politicians, in whose footsteps I have 
followed, have told me: ``Jean, you will see when you grow up 
how difficult it is to fight the federal government''. I now realize 
that what I was told 25 years ago is still true today. All I am 
asking the government is to be fair to Quebec and the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would gladly let my hon. colleague from 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead speak but, as you so rightly 
said, I am the member for Québec-Est. My riding of Québec-Est 
is an urban riding. I am not from a rural but an urban riding. I 
know of a number of farmers in my riding but they are all 
retired.
<P>
	I nonetheless appreciate the importance of agriculture. I know 
that agriculture is one of the pillars of the economy, particularly 
in Quebec, which is about to become a country. Agriculture is a 
basic economic sector. I also learned a thing or two about this 
sector from working, a few years ago, for Agriculture Canada 
minister Eugene Whelan, who was considered as one of the 
greatest ministers of agriculture in Canadian history.
<P>
	So, I am familiar with this inequity issue that was discussed at 
length today. It is well known that Quebec farm producers were 
treated less fairly than those from the rest of Canada, and 
Western Canada in particular. The latest budget tabled in this 
House by the Liberals provides a most glaring example of 
inequity. It is plain obvious.
<P>
	While Western producers are very generously 
compensated-we are talking about $2 billion-subsidies paid 
to milk producers in the East are being cut by 30 per cent. I must 
say that this is nothing new. There was much talk about this here 
today. Quebec has not been getting its fair share for ages now.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Had one quarter of federal spending for Canadian agriculture 
been going to Quebec, since it is normally calculated on a per 
capita basis, Quebec would have been much better off. Instead, 
Quebec got 10, 12 and sometimes as much as 15 per cent, but 
never a full 25 per cent share of federal spending. According to 
my calculations, on this basis, Quebec's shortfall for the past 15 
years, since 1980, is between five and seven billion dollars.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> It is a disgrace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Quebec has paid between five and seven 
billion dollars out of its own pocket in support of agriculture in 
Western Canada and the rest of Canada. If only Quebec farmers 
had benefited from such investments in their province, Quebec's 
agriculture would have been even stronger than it is, and that 
does not include the Crow rate, which cost the federal 
government between $600 million and $800 million a  year. 
These 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11506"> 11506 </A></B>
<P>
investments in western grain transportation were very 
discriminatory and they were made solely in favour of western 
farmers.
<P>
	A quarter of that money came from Quebec and statistics 
show that, during the last 15 years, Quebec lost two billion 
dollars more. These are huge losses. When the federal 
government announces the elimination of the Crow rate and 
talks about a compensation package, it only has in mind western 
farmers, the constant winners for 15 years, with the grain 
subsidy and the unfair federal investments in agriculture. 
Quebec has always lost out. The unfairness is blatant, even more 
so when one recognizes that Quebec farmers earn on average 
about $25,000 for their very hard work.
<P>
	A farmer can work up to 80 hours a week. He works the 
equivalent of two jobs for a total salary of $25,000. So, the 30 
per cent cut in milk subsidies and the 15 per cent cut in farmers' 
revenues are a blow to milk producers. It is a blow because their 
revenues are not that high. The inequity is obvious and we have 
discussed the subject at length.
<P>
	The overriding theme is that Quebec, in practically all areas, 
has always been subjected to this sort of unfairness. Even 
though the other members in this House will not admit it, 
Quebec has been a cash cow for the rest of Canada. This is 
obvious in every sector, whether it is the sale of goods and 
services, or the research sector. As regards the latter, over the 
last 15 years, Quebec has been getting, on average, 10 to 15 per 
cent of research investments. Ontario was the big winner, with 
an average of 50 per cent of the total federal assistance. Again, 
Quebec lost money.
<P>
	I could give you a whole list of examples where Quebec was 
the loser, but I will stop here. At some point, Quebecers will 
have to put their foot down and say: ``Enough is enough! We are 
fed up with these injustices''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand: </B>This is why Quebec farmers must also 
assume their share of the risks involved in that venture. 
Obviously, there are some concerns. Achieving Quebec's 
sovereignty will not be a breeze. Nobody said it would be. 
However, in the middle and in the long term, there is no question 
that Quebecers will benefit from such a move. This is no 
question about that.
<P>
	There is a transition period which raises several issues, 
including for the farming community.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, farmers too wonder what will happen once Quebec 
opts for sovereignty.
<P>
	The hon. member for Lotbinière answered some very 
important questions earlier. The government is resorting to 
fearmongering when it says that Quebec dairy producers will 
lose all their quotas. Such arguments are not reasonable and are 
obviously based on emotions.
<P>
	Quebec buys beef from Alberta, grain from the western 
provinces, corn and soya from Ontario. We buy a lot more 
outside the province than we sell. Do you think that, all of a 
sudden, the rest of Canada will refuse to buy our butter or our 
cheese, and that Quebec will no longer buy beef from Alberta? 
Of course not. It is totally unreasonable to think that the rest of 
Canada would force us into such an unfair situation.
<P>
	I certainly believe that sovereignty will be beneficial to 
Quebec farmers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from 
Québec-Est who clearly described the obvious advantages for 
Quebecers to opt for sovereignty as soon as possible. It has also 
been demonstrated that the federal system does not work. I know 
that my Liberal and Reform colleagues do not like it when we 
talk about inequity, even though it reflects the real situation, so 
let us say that the federal system does not work, if this is the 
expression the federalists would rather use.
<P>
	On that issue, the hon. member for Lotbinière was very 
eloquent. He used figures and several arguments to show that it 
is impossible to ignore how the Canadian Department of 
Agriculture has harmed the interests of Quebec.
<P>
	Let me conclude my remarks which can be interpreted as a 
question to the hon. member for Québec-Est.
<P>
	Without asking for more than what Quebec is currently giving 
to the federal government in the area of agriculture, and given 
the fact that Quebecers already pay 25 per cent of all federal 
taxes, if we were to get our hands on a similar proportion of the 
agricultural budget and to manage the whole thing, then we 
would be able to provide our farmers with an additional $500 
million-since the federal Department of Agriculture has a $2 
billion budget-in addition to the $300 or $350 million budget 
of the Quebec Department of Agriculture.
<P>
	I know how capable, passionate and proud our Quebec 
farmers are and I am sure this will give them a competitive edge. 
So, I want to say thank you to my colleague from Québec-Est.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
colleague from Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead.
<P>
	What he said is true. Quebec farmers will likely have a greater 
share of the province's revenues, money that was not available 
to them before because it was distributed elsewhere. But once 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11507"> 11507 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec becomes sovereign, farmers will have the chance to 
receive more money from the government.
<P>
	We must also recognize the strength of the UPA and of Quebec 
farmers. Our province is certainly the best organized province in 
the agricultural industry in Canada. It is in excellent shape. It is 
well structured. Farmers have a good knowledge of their trade 
which will allow them to take advantage of new markets, 
particularly of the new American market that is opening up. If I 
am not mistaken, under the new agreements, we will have access 
to 5 per cent of the American market. Therefore, Quebec 
farmers are in a good position to take advantage of Quebec's 
sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	I would like to come back to the issue of milk quotas. Dairy 
producers must understand that Quebec will not become 
independent overnight after a victory in the referendum. There 
has to be a period of negotiations. The current agreements, such 
as the GATT and NAFTA, will stay in place. There will be 
negotiations between Canada and Quebec and they will not 
necessarily be conducted sector by sector, farmers with farmers, 
bankers with bankers. These will be comprehensive 
negotiations between Quebec and Canada. A framework will 
have to be established, and when the parties are able to look at 
the situation rationally, without letting their emotions interfere, 
the rest of Canada will understand that, in the agricultural 
industry, Canadian producers will have to maintain a good 
relationship with Quebec producers in all sectors in order to 
protect themselves against unfair competition from Americans.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am glad to have the opportunity to comment 
on the Official Opposition's motion denouncing the government 
for giving Western farmers an unfair advantage over their 
Eastern counterparts.
<P>
	The facts do not support the motion. They show that each 
individual, each region and each sector contributes its fair share, 
no more and no less, to reducing the deficit.
<P>
	The 1995 Budget contained fair and balanced measures to 
address circumstances that differ from one region and sector of 
the country to another. It is worth mentioning that our reform of 
the WGTA is consistent with the position adopted by the Quebec 
coalition in December 1994.
<P>
	Generally speaking, the government is eliminating its 
transportation subsidy programs, including the WGTA in the 
West, feed freight assistance in BC and Central and Eastern 
Canada, as well as various transportation subsidies in the 
Maritimes. What we are looking at is not a proposal to draw a 
parallel between the East and the West, but rather a principle to 
be implemented nationwide.
<P>
	However, where we have eliminated transportation subsidies, 
we are providing assistance to those who are hit the hardest, be 
they in the East or the West.
<P>
	As the hon. members know, the Western grain transportation 
subsidy will be abolished as of August 1, 1995.
<P>
	In the adjustment measures it has offered, the government 
took into account the potential impact of the elimination of this 
96-year old commitment toward the Western grain industry. The 
prairie farmland owners will get an initial payment of $1.6 
billion in relation to capital, which is equivalent to three more 
years of the annual subsidy of $560 million.
<P>
	In the budget he brought forward, the Minister of Finance 
made it clear that this ex gratia payment to prairie farmland 
owners was to offset the potential impact of the WGTA reform 
on the land values. This is not a gift from above nor a regional 
development subsidy.
<P>
	The financial aid granted is not excessive and does not 
provide undue benefits to Western farmers. However, it will 
help grain producers adjust to changes. The GATT Agreement 
established certain disciplinary rules for export subsidies, but 
the prairie grain producers still have to compete with subsidized 
wheat exports.
<P>
	The dairy subsidy is to be reduced by 30 per cent over a two 
year period, but the government remains committed to 
maintaining our national supply management system.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	This system is one of the major benefits of federalism and it 
gives a reasonable income to efficient producers both in the east 
and the west.
<P>
	Dairy farmers do not get a compensation package because 
their subsidies, contrary to the WGTA subsidies, have not been 
eliminated. But we are looking for ways to improve the dairy 
industry competitiveness. Consultations will take place with 
dairy farmers on the future of their subsidies.
<P>
	We have been considering for 25 years the pros and cons of a 
reform of western grain transportation subsidies. So, we 
understand very well the reasons behind such a change. The 
solution we found with the industry takes into consideration the 
new circumstances of world trade, our fiscal situation and the 
need to be more sensitive to market forces.
<P>
	This kind of dialogue did not take place in the dairy industry. 
We do not advocate any particular reform, but we think the time 
has come for us to determine with farmers and other players the 
best way to support the competitiveness of the dairy industry. 
We intend to initiate discussions this year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11508"> 11508 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister has announced that his parliamentary secretary, 
the hon. member for Prince Edward-Hastings, will hold 
consultations with the industry on the way we should use the 
large amount of money still available.
<P>
	Cuts in agricultural spending take into account the improved 
financial outlook for the agricultural industry, the new 
discipline imposed by the new general agreement on 
international subsidies and the difficult fiscal situation of the 
government.
<P>
	Interestingly enough, while the official opposition condemns 
us because we allegedly make deeper cuts in eastern Canada 
than in western Canada, others accuse us of doing just the 
opposite. Critics take the elimination of the WGTA subsidies 
out of context and ignore the $1.6 billion compensation 
payment. The official opposition does the same with the 30 per 
cent reduction in the milk subsidies and forgets about factors 
that will cushion the impact of that reduction and the 
government's commitment to the national supply management 
system.
<P>
	The 19 per cent cut in the agriculture department budget is 
exactly the same as the average reduction in all federal 
departments. In other words, the budget cuts at Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada represent about 4 per cent of the total cuts of 
$7.2 billion proposed in the federal programs review. The fact 
that the AAC expenses represent approximately 4 per cent of the 
total federal expenses is not a coincidence.
<P>
	We had some difficult choices to make given the critical 
situation of the debt and the deficit. All the budgetary changes 
reflect the need to materialize the government's vision of the 
agri-food sector in Canada and the need not to let the deficit 
jeopardize our future.
<P>
	Our vision is based on financial security and the vitality and 
viability of that sector. Only a continuing and sustainable 
growth of the rural regions and the urban areas will make this 
materialization possible. This government's priority is to 
implement the necessary framework to help that sector find new 
markets, create jobs and ensure its own development.
<P>
	An investment in the agri-food sector is an investment in 
growth for all regions of Canada-whether from the East, the 
West, the North or the South.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to commend my colleague for his balanced speech 
that looked at both sides of the issue. I would like to ask him a 
very important question.
<P>
	I suspect-if he disagrees with me, I will not be upset in any 
way-that the motion put forward by the Bloc Quebecois today 
was just to score political points, to try to play one part of the 
country off against another.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	They did not sincerely believe that one region had been 
treated more or less favourably than another, they simply 
wanted to get one region to play off against another. They have 
been unable to look at the situation  and this issue in a balanced 
way. As I said earlier, I will not be upset in any way if my 
colleague disagrees with me. I would like to have his comments, 
sincerely and honestly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bertrand:</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. 
member for Saint-Boniface for his question.
<P>
	I sort of agree with what my colleague has said. Il is true that 
our government was faced with very tough decisions to make 
and I sincerely believe that the decisions the Minister of Finance 
had to make were very difficult for all regions in Canada, 
whether in the East or in the West. I believe that the cuts that 
have been announced in the past or that will be in the future are 
fair and legitimate. I can hardly understand why the Official 
Opposition is trying to set the East against the West.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I wish to take the last couple of minutes to state my 
disapproval of the motion being put forward by the opposition.
<P>
	I am surprised that my colleagues in the agricultural sector of 
the Bloc Quebecois would actually put together such a motion. I 
know and work with them very well in our committee. I am 
surprised that they are trying to suggest to the House and to the 
Canadian people that those areas of the budget related to 
agriculture are anything but fair to all areas of the country.
<P>
	Everyone in the agricultural community recognizes that we 
require fairness in dealing with our debt and deficit situation. 
That part of the budget prepared by the Minister of Finance 
dealing with agriculture certainly was given a great deal of input 
by the minister of agriculture. They tried to deal in a fair and 
equitable manner with the areas of supply management and the 
western grain transportation issues.
<P>
	One disappointment I have had since becoming chair of the 
standing committee on agriculture has been hearing hon. 
members in the House claim that one part of the country is 
getting a better deal than another part. I also was disappointed 
that a number of commodity groups and farm organizations 
spend too much time arguing over who got what rather than 
working and pulling together not only as commodity groups but 
putting together different aspects of an organization to help 
Canada in our commitments to export trade.
<P>
	It will be in the export sector that agriculture and rural Canada 
will find the jobs in the future. The government has made a large 
commitment to exports. I feel that if the different groups get 
together and if the Bloc Quebecois put aside its partisan political 
interests, it would want to co-operate with all Canadians to 
make sure that Canada's agricultural products are exported 
around the world.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP)</B> moved that Bill C-244, 
an act respecting a national solidarity day for the aboriginal 
peoples of Canada, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, recognizing that the starting 
speaker is allotted up to 20 minutes, I would like to seek the 
unanimous consent of the House to see if I could share this 
20-minute spot with one of my New Democrat colleagues.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the generosity in 
allowing my colleague to join me in co-sponsoring the bill. In 
the Order Paper there are a number of co-sponsors. I refer 
specifically to the member for the Battlefords-Meadow Lake, 
the member for Regina-Lumsden and the member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway. Others have also indicated to me they are 
in support of the bill.
<P>
	This is the second time I have actually tabled the bill. The first 
time it received the support of every aboriginal organization in 
the country. It received support from countless bands across the 
country and also from many urban organizations of aboriginal 
people and all the significant leaders of aboriginal peoples. To 
my knowledge no one has yet indicated their opposition to it, 
either among the aboriginal or the non-aboriginal communities.
<P>
	We only have one hour for debate. In the closing moments I 
would hope either the debate would collapse, which would then 
allow a voiced vote to send it off to the Standing Committee on 
Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, or simply 
unanimous consent to send this off to the appropriate standing 
committee for continuation.
<P>
	The bill is fairly straightforward. I do not suspect it would 
take an awful lot of study and examination. There may be the 
will of the House to provide unanimous consent to move through 
all stages before the hour is out, which we have done on previous 
occasions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> A great idea.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> My hon. colleague from Regina-Lumsden 
suggests this is a good idea. We will see as the hour progresses.
<P>
	The preamble of Bill C-244, an act respecting a national 
solidarity day for the aboriginal peoples of Canada, is as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas it is desirable that Canadians designate a day in recognition of 
Canada's original inhabitants;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And whereas Canadians seek earnestly to set an example of their commitment 
to honouring native cultures;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And whereas June 21, being the longest day of the year and marking the 
changing of the seasons, should be designated as a day in tribute of Aboriginal 
solidarity;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the 
Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Therefore this act may be cited as the National Solidarity Day 
for the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada Act. If it passes it will be 
just that.
<P>
	A point of clarification is needed. A number of my colleagues, 
particularly in the Reform Party, have asked whether this is a 
legal holiday. The point is not to make it a legal holiday but to 
designate it as a day when Canadians from coast to coast join 
with aboriginal peoples from coast to coast in acknowledging 
the tremendous cultural contribution First Nations and 
aboriginal people have made to this country. There is some 
question about who the first Europeans were who arrived on 
these shores. I take some pride in saying that my forefathers, the 
Vikings, were probably the first Europeans, although some 
people suggest it was the Irish. Some suggest the Chinese. 
Whoever they were it is important to say they arrived on the 
shores of North America and Canada to meet incredibly 
advanced cultures; cultures that had existed in some cases in 
rather hostile natural environments for hundreds and hundreds 
of years, thousands of years in many cases.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	They had developed not only an incredible harmony in terms 
of working with each other and complimenting each of the 
organizations, tribes, clans and cultures in existence but they 
worked and lived in harmony with the natural environment.
<P>
	When the first explorers from Europe arrived on Canadian 
shores they found by and large people who complimented their 
efforts and assisted them. They gave of all their own resources 
and so on to facilitate in the exploration of what we call today 
Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11510"> 11510 </A></B>
<P>
	Then the colonizers arrived. The settlers arrived. They met a 
relatively welcoming culture, a welcoming people who 
introduced them to the realities of living in this part of the globe. 
One can imagine the incredible suffering that would have 
occurred with some of these original settlers if the original 
inhabitants of those areas were not there offering co-operation, 
support, guidance and help at virtually every turn.
<P>
	Things took a turn for the worse. It was then that we as a 
non-aboriginal culture began to practice what can only be called 
cultural genocide in many cases with intent, in other cases 
indirectly. The reality was disease, sickness, illness, violence 
and all sorts of aspects resulted in the genocide of aboriginal 
cultures, almost to their extinction.
<P>
	Right now as we speak there are only a handful of original 
aboriginal languages left in the country. Thank goodness that at 
the 11th hour we have to give full credit to the aboriginal leaders 
across the country who stood up and said: ``This is the end. We 
will now reverse this process''. Through incredible leadership 
they have reversed the process of cultural extinction. Today 
aboriginal cultures from coast to coast are probably richer, more 
vibrant and more dynamic than they have been for a long time.
<P>
	I want to refer to a number of aboriginal leaders in my 
constituency. Every member could stand in their place this 
afternoon and do the same. There are outstanding individuals 
who in a number of ways through their leadership ability and 
commitment to not only advancing the cause of their own 
peoples but the country as a whole have made these tremendous 
gains possible.
<P>
	I refer to people like Chief Nathan Matthew, Chief Manny 
Jules, Chief Ron Ignace, Chief Richard LeBourdais and many 
others from the Shuswap nation of central British Columbia. I 
acknowledge those same statements could be made for 
aboriginal leaders from coast to coast.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Chief Sol Sanderson from Saskatchewan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Chief Sol Sanderson from Saskatchewan and David 
Ahenakew and others as my colleague says. There are so many. 
We owe them so much.
<P>
	We must consider that before us in the next number of years 
probably the most important social issue will be the relationship 
between aboriginal people and non-aboriginal people and 
sorting out this complex and growing relationship.
<P>
	I refer to the emerging reality of self-government, of 
self-determination and of self-reliance for aboriginal peoples, 
the resolution of land claims, cultural preservation, social and 
economic development, educational training and general 
cultural advancement.
<P>
	I acknowledge the minister of Indian and northern affairs who 
has in his own way provided much needed leadership in a variety 
of these areas.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	When we look at the last 18 months, there have been 
significant advancements in terms of a move toward 
self-government, self-determination and self-reliance, 
particularly for progressive Indian bands across the country to 
say nothing of the Inuit, Dene and Metis advancements as well.
<P>
	In order to permit my hon. colleague to say a few words, I will 
conclude my remarks by saying that at a crucial time in the First 
Nation's evolution in our part of North America, it is very 
appropriate for us as parliamentarians on behalf of those we 
represent to extend a hand in acknowledgement of the 
contributions made by the First Nations.
<P>
	We must tell them we recognize and appreciate those 
accomplishments and that we would like to work 
co-operatively, positively together for the advancement not 
only of aboriginal peoples across Canada but Canadians 
generally. We do acknowledge the existence of First Nations and 
what that entails.
<P>
	I would like to finish my remarks by referring to the Indian 
Act and how this act, in my judgment, was a lie from the 
beginning. The lie is betrayed in the first line of the act: ``This is 
an act respecting Indian people''. This was not an act respecting 
Indian people and it is for that reason I ask my colleagues to 
extend a hand now and recognize June 21 as a solidarity day for 
aboriginal peoples.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the 
fine motion presented today by my colleague from Kamloops. It 
is a motion to recognize a day of solidarity with aboriginal 
peoples. It shows a lot of understanding of the challenges that 
face our societies.
<P>
	I would like to think that every day I stand in solidarity with 
aboriginal peoples. However, that is not the case across the 
country. It would be very useful to have a day to specifically 
remind ourselves of the injustices to native people and that there 
are specific things we need to do to address those injustices and 
meet future challenges.
<P>
	The royal commission on aboriginal peoples has released an 
interim report on suicide. We must actively work to address the 
recommendations on that issue.
<P>
	The Senate has just released a report on the treatment of 
aboriginal veterans from World War I, World War II and the 
Korean war. We must as a nation actively work to address the 
grievances of aboriginal veterans.
<P>
	The House of Commons standing committee on Indian affairs 
has in the past reported on the lack and the inadequacy of 
housing in aboriginal communities. This issue must be 
immediately addressed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11511"> 11511 </A></B>
<P>
	An environmental panel looking at the acceptability of low 
level military flight training over Innu land in Labrador reported 
that land claims in jurisdictions must be dealt with quickly. This 
is a critical issue which the government must pursue as soon as 
possible.
<P>
	The list goes on. Currently committees of the House are 
examining the issues of self-government, of aboriginal 
education, of aboriginal fishing and economic development, of 
mental health among aboriginal people and the future of 
resource management in areas where aboriginal communities 
are located.
<P>
	There is an urgent need for Canadians of all racial and ethnic 
backgrounds to acknowledge the history, heritage and future of 
Canada's first peoples. The adoption of a day of solidarity is 
certainly one small step in the right direction.
<P>
	In my own constituency much is happening in this regard. 
Within the aboriginal communities chiefs like the late Big Bear, 
Poundmaker, Ahtakakoop and Seekaskoch are focal points for 
the development of interpretive and educational centres. 
Non-aboriginal communities have begun to sponsor or jointly 
host powwows and other cross cultural activities.
<P>
	Individuals like the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian 
Nation's Chief Blaine Favel have talked about the need to foster 
stronger human and economic ties between non-aboriginal and 
aboriginal communities and people. Tribal councils like the 
Meadow Lake Tribal Council are demonstrating that successful 
aboriginal businesses can contribute a great deal to the success 
of neighbouring non-aboriginal communities. There are 
negatives and positives in the relationships that exist between 
our societies. If we are ever to overcome the negatives and make 
the future positive we must take a few small steps first. This bill 
sponsored by the hon. member for Kamloops and supported by 
the hon. member for Regina-Lumsden and other members of 
the House provides us with just such an opportunity.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise to support this bill. 
I commend the hon. member for Kamloops for bringing it to the 
House. The day which he talks about would be a day of 
reflection.
<P>
	I would like to quote Georges Erasmus, who said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The history of our people needs to be told. We need to present accurately 
what happened in the past, so that we can deal with it in the future- I don't like 
what has happened over the last 500 years. We can't do much about that. But 
what are we going to do about the next 500 years? What are we going to do about 
the next ten years?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On this day of reflection these are the things which we should 
be thinking about. We should be thinking about the fact that 
when the Europeans landed here the Indians fed them, showed 
them how to avoid scurvy and asked for nothing. They asked 
Jacques Cartier for nothing. We  should reflect on the Truro 
wampum, the covenant chain, the broken treaties, the food 
which they gave us.
<P>
	My background is Irish and Italian. The Irish think that the 
potato came from Ireland. It came from the Indians. The Italians 
think the tomato came from Italy. It came from the Indians. They 
had over 1,200 different plants when we arrived. It was a 
self-sufficient nation.
<P>
	We should reflect on their path of tears. We took away their 
voice. We made them non-persons. We put them on reserves. We 
put them in residential schools. It was not good enough to put 
them in residential schools, we moved them to other provinces. 
It was not good enough that they were in schools in other 
provinces, we said: ``You shall not go home from the age of six 
to eighteen''. They did not go home, not even for Christmas or 
holidays. Then we decided we would take away their language 
and their culture. To back all of this up and to make the kids go to 
residential schools we invented the pass laws. If the parents did 
not give up their kids to go to these schools they did not get a 
pass to leave the reserves.
<P>
	Show me an Irish family or an Italian family or any other 
family that came to this country and was treated like that. In 
other words, the visitors to this country were treated better than 
the people who had been here for 10,000 years. We should 
reflect on that.
<P>
	My friend reminded us that we should reflect on the Indian 
Act. It is archaic. It is an act which should not exist in any 
country.
<P>
	We should reflect on the dams at Grand Rapids, Churchill, 
Nelson and Cheslatta that took away their livelihood. We took 
away their very being. We should reflect on what we did to the 
Haida Gwaii and the Micmac with our development of the 
forests. We should reflect on what we did with minerals. 
Because we needed minerals in northern Ontario, in came the 
Robinson Superior treaties. That is why we have those treaties, 
because we needed minerals.
<P>
	In my area we took away the sturgeon and the wild rice. Not 
only were they food sources, they were religious things to them. 
They were there for generations and then they were gone.
<P>
	We should remember our land grabs on those days, and the 
people who have come and gone: the Elijah Smiths; the elders of 
the Yukon; Jake Fire of the Mohawks, a traditionalist who came 
to a meeting unarmed and was shot; Frank Calder and the 
Sparrows. These are not individuals, these are families. For 
three generations the Sparrow family in B.C. has been saying the 
same thing. We should reflect on that and we should remember.
<P>
	We should also reflect on what they are doing. They now have 
over 5,000 businesses, representing 31,000 employees. 
Twenty-five years ago only 600 to 800 aboriginal students were 
in post-secondary schools. Today, as I stand here, they have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11512"> 11512 </A></B>
<P>
150,000 graduates, with  22,000 in post-secondary institutions 
this year and 23,000 who will be in post-secondary institutions 
next year.
<P>
	They had the leadership and they were articulate. On this day 
that the hon. member is proposing we should think of that.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	In the past 17 months, and to me it feels like 17 years, we have 
tried to implement the promises of our red book. We have 
negotiated with the Micmacs. We have said: ``You've done so 
well in education, now it is time to take over jurisdiction''. The 
Micmacs in Nova Scotia are doing just that.
<P>
	At the meeting when we signed the agreement, one of the 
elders now, but once a chief said: ``You know when I started this, 
Ron, there were only four Micmacs in the whole province of 
Nova Scotia in post-secondary. I came to this meeting tonight to 
sign with high hopes in my heart. I saw a car there. There were 
three kids in this car and they were out of gas so I stopped and 
helped them. All three were Micmacs, all three were university 
graduates''. We should remember that.
<P>
	On the Manitoba dismantling, a year ago people in the House 
of one party thought it was craziness. Within three or four 
months the public said maybe it is important. A month before 
the signing they said it is historic. Now they say at Harvard that 
it is the most significant aboriginal self-government agreement 
in the world. That is the spirit.
<P>
	In British Columbia it is difficult because we are doing 
contemporary treaties, in spirit and intent. There are now over 
120 First Nations negotiating at five tables with 50 people from 
our side bringing in contemporary and modern treaties.
<P>
	We intend to dismantle in northern Ontario. The meetings will 
be held in the next two or three months. We intend to move 
jurisdiction in Treaty 3 in the Fort Frances area and that is going 
on now.
<P>
	We are moving oil and gas. This is the way it works. There are 
110 oil and gas chiefs, 50 are on significant oil and gas reserves. 
They do not own it and they do not manage it. We have to give 
them that because it belongs to them. It is on their reserves. That 
will be done.
<P>
	In Quebec we are dealing with the Inuit, the Cree, the 
Montagnais, the Huron. We are dealing with them face to face 
with dignity and respect, and agreements are being reached 
there.
<P>
	The same thing happened in the Yukon. You all went through 
that as members. I would like to recall to you the night we voted. 
I looked up at the Yukon delegation sitting in the gallery. They 
were all in their traditional garb. We applauded and they 
applauded. They started crying and our hardened members here 
started crying. Hardnosed Liberals were crying over this. That is 
the kind of commitment we must have. The same thing will 
happen in the Northwest Territories.
<P>
	I wish I could go on and on, but my time is limited. I want to 
talk about what can be done and what we should remember on 
that day. How can we? It seems so simple but it is difficult. It is a 
triangle. At the top of the triangle is dignity, respect and 
self-government. At the bottom of the triangle are adequate 
health facilities, adequate housing facilities and adequate 
economic development. If we do not do these things at the 
bottom, the triangle is going to collapse.
<P>
	There will be opponents. They will say we are bleeding hearts. 
They will say we have our agenda. They will say the Indians 
have too much right now. I do not feel I am a bleeding heart. I do 
not feel I have an agenda. I have eyes to see. Erasmus is asking 
us to see.
<P>
	What will it take? It will take courage to stand up to these 
arguments. It will take knowledge of what is out there. It will 
take compassion. We have to have compassion. It will take an 
attitude that we will talk face to face. One Metis leader said to 
me: ``We've talked back to back and side to side too long. We 
must talk face to face''. We can do it.
<P>
	In the Northwest Territories, they have nine official 
languages, four more than the UN. They have translation in their 
legislature. The Russians have come here to see what we have 
done. That is the attitude we should have as Canadians, not just 
doing a good job but the best job in the world, where people will 
come to us.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	Today the Irish, the Scots, the English and even the French are 
flying Canadian flags. If we are to have a flag in the aboriginal 
portfolio it should be the aboriginal people and other Canadians 
saying it is a flag of tolerance, a flag of dignity, of sharing and 
respect. It will work. That is why this day is important and that is 
why I will support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, 
the Bloc Quebecois also intends to support the motion moved by 
the hon. member for the NDP.
<P>
	It is a subject with which I am familiar, and I have been trying 
to learn more about it for nearly a year and a half, since it is 
extremely complex. It is not easy to understand because after all 
we have 635 communities in Canada. When I say communities, 
these are often reserves spread out across Canada. And there are 
not only communities but also nations. Furthermore, there are 
nearly 50 different languages and dialects, which is rather 
surprising.
<P>
	There is among aboriginal nations a definite desire to really 
go back to their own traditions and language, and they are to be 
respected for that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11513"> 11513 </A></B>
<P>
	Ten minutes is not much for a subject as complex and indeed 
edifying as this one, because it is always interesting to talk about 
this and see how these exchanges take place and how aboriginal 
peoples try to negotiate with us, because these negotiations are 
based both on tradition and the modern way of doing things. 
However, I have decided to concentrate on symbols in my 
speech, because aboriginal peoples use many symbols. I would 
like to talk to you about one which has my particular interest: 
wampum.
<P>
	So what is wampum? There are several definitions. And 
although there is more than one definition, there is one that I 
find particularly interesting and I would like to expand on that.
<P>
	Wampum refers to white and black beads, often strung 
together in parallel strands. At the time, especially in the 
seventeenth century, trade was very important. Often trading 
between the settlers and those who had been there for 25,000 
years took the form of an exchange of presents, and wampum 
was something that was very important to them.
<P>
	The origin of the word is Algonquian. I have here an 
interpretation of wampum which we are sometimes given on the 
Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. I tend to agree with this 
interpretation. Several chiefs came to explain what it meant, and 
I think wampum has both an historical and a contemporary 
connotation. I think that what is explained and interpreted in the 
wampum beads has an entirely modern application today.
<P>
	So I will read what wampum means to most of the native 
chiefs, and this is the interpretation I attach the most meaning 
to. It goes as follows: ``Our relations are not those of father and 
son, but of brothers. These two rows''-these are the two rows 
of beads I mentioned earlier-``represent boats sailing together 
on the same river. One belongs to the original people''-those 
who were here before us-``with their laws and customs, and the 
other to the European people, with their laws and customs. We 
travel together, but in our own boats. Neither shall try to steer 
the boat of the other''.
<P>
	I find this is very representative of the relations between us, 
the Europeans, and the native peoples. Naturally, I would add 
that we must not try to sink each other's boat, either. So we 
understand the symbolic importance.
<P>
	In the 17th century, wampum meant a lot to the officers of the 
British crown, with whom gifts were exchanged. It was a very 
popular gift.
<P>
	As is the case today, the more gifts there were, the more the 
exchange was important. Even today, I am offered gifts every 
time I visit certain reserves in Canada and Quebec-with very 
few exceptions. For our part, we also developed the habit of 
bringing along some little offering to give them.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	In many cases, the size or number of gifts is not as important 
as the symbolic value of maintaining this tradition of 
gift-giving. This allows a fruitful exchange with Aboriginal 
peoples because their traditions are being respected.
<P>
	Although the Europeans knew that the wampum was a symbol 
of commitment, it seems that these commitments were not 
honoured. People must be made aware of this, and this 
awareness campaign could take place on June 21.
<P>
	We denounced the old South African government over the 
issue of apartheid. I find it outrageous that in a country as open 
as Canada is at this time, there are still 635 reserves. We are 
ghettoizing these people by confining them to parcels of land. 
We took away between 90 per cent and 95 per cent of their lands, 
making billions of dollars in the process, in return for a social 
contract under which they were often set aside, ignored or 
shunted off to lands that were not even productive. We said in 
the social contract that we would look after them.
<P>
	I think that if June 21 is ever designated as Aboriginal 
Solidarity Day, we should consider the impact of this legislation 
and the importance of dismantling it as soon as possible. Canada 
has had this law for 100 years and that is 100 years too many.
<P>
	I also want to say a few words about June 21. This is an 
important date that was not chosen inadvertently. June 21 is the 
day of the solstice, that is, the longest day of the year. This is not 
just in Canada. Throughout the world, aboriginal peoples often 
celebrate this particular day. I was in Cancun, for instance, and I 
can certify that the Mayas, when they built their pyramids, were 
very much aware of the solstice.
<P>
	On the longest day of the year, at a given moment, you can see 
a snake come down from the pyramid in Chichen Itza, the snake 
being, of course, a symbol of the longest day. The snake comes 
down from the pyramid at six o'clock in the evening, I believe, 
and often these temples and pyramids are built to mark the 
occurrence of the solstice. So June 21 is a very important date, 
and I think that if we decide on a national day, it should be June 
21.
<P>
	Finally, this is a day on which we should try and mix European 
and aboriginal cultures as much as possible. In a way this has 
already happened. The minister mentioned examples of food, of 
ways in which we exchange items, but there is also other 
aspects. If we take certain details of our daily lives as 
Europeans, for instance, what could be nicer than to go 
tobogganing with our children. Now the toboggan was invented 
by the aboriginal people, along with canoes, snowshoes, certain 
items 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11514"> 11514 </A></B>
<P>
of clothing such as moccasins. They taught us how to use furs 
and certain skills such as how to survive in the bush, how to trap 
animals and how to hunt. All of this we learnt from the 
aboriginal people.
<P>
	We should use this day to increase our knowledge of each 
other's cultures which unfortunately, as I see it, have become 
increasingly isolated in the past number of decades.
<P>
	So the answer is not the red book or the Canadian 
Constitution. It is up to us individually to have an open mind and 
be receptive to the other culture. We must show compassion, we 
must listen and we should keep an open mind. We should not let 
ourselves be polarized by our differences: the Canadian nation, 
the Quebec nation and the aboriginal nation. We should try to 
understand each other and be generous and open. If we do that, 
June 21 will only make us richer, and I think this day should be 
an opportunity for us to learn as much as we can about aboriginal 
culture, and we in the Bloc Quebecois will be delighted to 
support this motion.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise to address and support 
Bill C-244, which proposes to recognize June 21 as a national 
solidarity day for aboriginal peoples.
<P>
	In the last two weeks Canadians have demonstrated an 
understanding of the important principles behind this bill, 
principles of celebrating equality and partnerships. Last Friday, 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians from across the 
country, including the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, gathered in Vancouver to celebrate the National 
Aboriginal Achievement Awards. Fourteen aboriginal 
Canadians were honoured for their outstanding contributions. 
On Thursday evening at nine o'clock, all Canadians can share in 
this celebration because it is being televised nationally on our 
CBC.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Canadians also celebrated the uniqueness of our cultures and 
heritage on March 26 at the annual Juno awards. A touching 
tribute to Buffy Sainte-Marie in particular highlighted the 
central role of aboriginal cultures in defining the broader 
Canadian culture.
<P>
	This is what we are talking about today, marking the 
achievement of aboriginal people and their tremendous 
contributions to this great nation. These contributions span the 
spectrum from politics, business and law to entertainment, 
athletics and culinary experience.
<P>
	For generations aboriginal people have made a visible, 
internationally recognized contribution that has for too long 
been largely unrecognized in our country. I firmly believe in the 
principle of this motion, as does the government and everyone 
on this side of the House.
<P>
	We had these very principles in mind when we sat down to 
write our red book. Our goal was and is for a future where 
aboriginal people enjoy a standard of living and quality of life 
and opportunity equal to those of other Canadians. Our goal is a 
future in which aboriginal people live self-reliantly, secure in 
the knowledge of who they are as unique peoples; a future where 
all Canadians are enriched by aboriginal cultures and are 
committed to the fair sharing of the potential of our nation; a 
future where aboriginal people have the positive option to live 
and work wherever they choose; and one where aboriginal 
children grow up in secure families and healthy communities 
with the opportunity to take their full place in Canada.
<P>
	This government recognizes the special relationship that 
exists between aboriginal people, the first inhabitants of this 
land, and the Crown. We are committed to fulfilling our 
obligations and to building a new partnership based on trust, 
mutual respect and participation in the decision-making 
process.
<P>
	It was for these reasons that we put aboriginal issues at the 
forefront of our agenda. I am pleased to see that my hon. 
colleague from Kamloops also regards aboriginal issues in such 
a serious manner.
<P>
	The goal of enabling aboriginal people to assume their 
rightful place as full partners in Canadian society is not a goal of 
one group; it is a goal shared by millions of Canadians. Clearly 
aboriginal issues involve more than just our aboriginal people. 
They involve each and every one of us. That is why I believe it is 
important for all Canadians to participate in marking the 
contributions past, present and future of aboriginal people. In 
these efforts, our focus should be on partnerships, 
commemoration and positive action.
<P>
	Clearly before a decision like this is made, it is essential to 
seek consent from the aboriginal community. When our ultimate 
goal is to create a full and equal society, it would clearly be 
regressive for us to sit here and legislate a special day for 
aboriginal people without their explicit support.
<P>
	I strongly feel that the hon. member's bill is worthy of our 
consideration and debate, particularly as we celebrate the first 
year of the United Nations International Decade of the World's 
Indigenous Peoples. By supporting the United Nations 
recommendation to pronounce August 9 as an International Day 
for Indigenous Peoples, we may also have an opportunity to 
bring aboriginal issues further on to the international stage.
<P>
	I want to thank my hon. colleague for bringing this bill before 
us. It is an important reminder that aboriginal issues must 
continue to be a priority for all Canadians. I thank him for the 
opportunity to participate in this debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in this first debate 
of Bill C-244, an act respecting a national solidarity day for the 
aboriginal peoples of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11515"> 11515 </A></B>
<P>
	I am sure the member for Kamloops initiated this bill with the 
best of intentions, borne out of concern for recognition of the 
contribution of native cultures to the Canadian mosiac. 
Canadians are proud of the uniqueness of native cultures and 
their contribution to what we call Canada. From coast to coast, 
respective Indian tribes have brought their own specific 
background and history to what we have built in this country. We 
in Canada are all unique as a consequence of native cultural 
contributions and from those cultural contributions brought by 
others over the past centuries. That understanding and respect 
for many cultures is why Canada stands as a beacon of tolerance, 
compassion and stability.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Since becoming a member of Parliament, I have met and 
visited with aboriginal people from every region of Canada. The 
diversity among aboriginal peoples is obvious and they are the 
original Canadians. Their cultural legacy is a major contributing 
reason why Canada is different from the United States. 
Canadians enjoy this distinction.
<P>
	I do urge caution in playing politics with the dynamism of 
native cultures. Our native people are a sensitive, intelligent and 
proud people who, despite years of inequities, outright 
discrimination at times and at other times criminal mishandling 
of their affairs by others, have continued to carry on their 
cultural pursuits and have developed a community of interest.
<P>
	My party supports native peoples' independence and 
full-fledged partnership in this country, we support their 
self-sufficiency, and we support the removal of the albatross of 
the Department of Indian Affairs from their necks. We support 
their advancement, not a reinforcement of the past.
<P>
	As I said previously, theirs is a dynamic culture that deserves 
to grow and flourish no less than any other in this country. The 
tremendous cultural contribution native peoples have brought to 
this country stands on its own merit. It is a rich and endearing 
culture, not one to be isolated and ghettoized, as we did under 
section 91.24 of the BNA Act and then again under many aspects 
of the Indian Act. This is what our native cultures are trying to 
shake off. The surly bonds of colonialism must be relinquished.
<P>
	As I understand it, recognition by this Parliament of a day of 
recognition is innocuous in that there is no statutory holiday or 
out-of-pocket expenses associated with this recognition.
<P>
	Is it necessary to talk about national solidarity for aboriginal 
peoples? This has connotations of Poland climbing out from 
under the yolk of communist oppression. Surely, we can 
celebrate aboriginal culture without calling it Solidarity Day. 
This sounds confrontational. Let us not build walls. Let us 
nourish without singling out or separating our aboriginal 
peoples from the mainstream. Let us build on our strengths, our  
consensus, the very thing that has been the strength of Canada in 
the face of adversity.
<P>
	Canadian consensus, more than any other government action, 
has protected the minority against the tyranny of the majority in 
modern times.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to take 
part in this debate. I would like to commend the hon. member for 
Kamloops for bringing this issue to the floor of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	It has long been an important premise of this country that we 
work to achieve equality in this society. Unfortunately, this has 
not always been the case. For hundreds of years aboriginal 
people have not been afforded the same opportunities as many 
Canadians. It is time to attempt to correct these past wrongs. 
That is why this government is committed to taking action to 
help aboriginal people assume their rightful role as full partners 
in Canadian society.
<P>
	As a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs and Northern Development, I would like to focus my 
comments on the work the government is doing in consultation 
with aboriginal communities and organizations. In our red book 
we dedicated an entire chapter to aboriginal issues. Most 
important in our platform was the recognition of the inherent 
right of self-government.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	In January 1994 the minister launched a national consultation 
process on how best to implement the inherent right. With these 
consultations now almost completed, I feel confident that we 
have some very exciting times ahead.
<P>
	I would like to focus on three areas that are fundamental to 
achieving our goals: resolving land claims; changing the Indian 
Act; and dismantling the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development.
<P>
	First we need to try to create certainty with respect to 
aboriginal rights and title as well as opportunities for economic 
development in aboriginal communities. Resolving outstanding 
land claims is part of that solution.
<P>
	Claims fall into two categories: specific and comprehensive. 
The specific ones arise from the alleged non-fulfilment of 
treaties and other lawful obligations such as the Indian Act. 
Since coming to power our government has settled over 50 
claims of this nature in all parts of Canada. Comprehensive 
claims, on the other hand, are based on the concept of continuing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11516"> 11516 </A></B>
<P>
aboriginal rights and title which have not been dealt with by the 
treaties and other legal means. These agreements define the 
ways in which aboriginal people assert rights over land and 
natural resources.
<P>
	Currently the Government of Canada, the provinces and 
territories and the First Nations are considering 11 of these 
comprehensive claims. Benefits of economic development 
which is most important will be part of these negotiations. We 
are moving forward on these claims with the goal of helping 
aboriginal people forge a path of self-sufficiency, a path that is 
an essential component of the inherent right of 
self-government.
<P>
	At the same time however, there are some real obstacles. I am 
referring specifically to the Indian Act. The act gives the federal 
government the authority to strictly regulate First Nations and 
their lives. This includes reserve lands, elections, education, 
amusement centres, and so on. The act prevents the First Nations 
from managing their own affairs.
<P>
	That is why the hon. Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development recently announced the willingness of the 
government to amend the act if First Nations want these 
amendments. This of course would be an interim measure. The 
goal of the federal government and aboriginal peoples is to make 
self-government a reality. Under that reality there would be no 
need for the Indian Act.
<P>
	Clearly, all this means redefining the role of the Department 
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. What it really 
means is that the department's responsibilities will gradually be 
turned over to First Nations and the department will not be 
needed.
<P>
	December 7, 1994 was a historic day for the Manitoba First 
Nations. The government along with Grand Chief Phil Fontaine 
of the Association of Manitoba Chiefs signed the first 
dismantling agreement for the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development. This agreement will give full control of 
program administration to the First Nations people of Manitoba.
<P>
	Moreover, it sets the stage for real change for both the federal 
government and First Nations. Dismantling will eliminate the 
federal government's role in decision making affecting the daily 
lives of aboriginal people, a role dating back to 1876. It will go a 
long way toward resolving and restoring dignity, honour, 
self-reliance and self-government to the First Nations.
<P>
	It is important to remember though that dismantling will not 
occur overnight. We agreed in the red book to wind down the 
department at a pace determined by the aboriginal people. This 
is significant given that our objective is to create real and 
meaningful partnerships with the aboriginal people.
<P>
	This cannot be done by simply unilaterally imposing our will 
and our impressions of what should be changed and how things 
should change. We take our lead from those aboriginal leaders 
and communities who have their own ideas, time frames and 
goals. Dismantling will be achieved based on negotiated 
agreements, reasonable action plans and realistic timetables, all 
of which will be  established jointly by the federal and 
aboriginal governments.
<P>
	Most important, dismantling will assist First Nations in 
implementing their inherent right to self-government. 
Ultimately this means gradually shutting down the department's 
regional office in Manitoba.
<P>
	Our government is seeking to refurbish our relationship and 
rebuild its nature on a government to government basis. We can 
change the way we carry out our responsibilities. We can try to 
correct our past wrongs. We are creating a process by which 
aboriginal people will control their own lives.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty to advise 
the House that pursuant to Standing Order 44, the original 
speaker, the member for Kamloops, will automatically close the 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
comments will be very short.
<P>
	This is one of those moments when the House of Commons 
works incredibly well on an issue in that all sides see merit in it. 
It is appropriate to recognize that all those who have spoken 
have done so in a sense as co-sponsors of this initiative. The 
positive aspect of Private Members' Business is that it is not a 
party event or initiative; it is simply an initiative that individual 
members take and it is supported in that fashion.
<P>
	In light of what has been said and some concerns my hon. 
colleague raised regarding the term solidarity and whether that 
was appropriate or necessary, on second thought I tend to agree 
that mention of the term solidarity is not absolutely necessary. It 
is something that could be examined quickly in committee.
<P>
	For clarification, I would like to seek the unanimous consent 
of the members of the House to send this off to committee for 
further consideration.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, I want the 
record to show it was a Liberal member at least-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> That is not a point of 
order; it is a point of debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rideout:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, is it a 
request that this matter go off to committee or is it a request for a 
vote?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The motion in effect 
would be to adopt it at second reading and send it to committee. 
We do not have unanimous consent.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. I wish to 
comment with respect to the Speaker's last words. I am not 
debating the Chair and I want that clearly understood. I want to 
put on the record that I stood in my place and I wished to say a 
few words about this business before it expired. The Speaker 
was busy doing other things but I wanted to participate-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> If I may remind the 
member, when the member for Kamloops rose that meant debate

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERNATIONALTRADE">INTERNATIONAL TRADE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, a 
few weeks ago, I questioned the Minister for International Trade 
about the trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada over goods 
subject to quotas, such as poultry, eggs and dairy. At the time, 
the trade minister was unable to give farm producers the 
assurance that Canada's position will prevail over that of the 
U.S. Canada's position, according to which the GATT Accord 
takes precedence over NAFTA regarding agricultural 
commodities subject to quotas is steadfast and flawless.
<P>
	Since the Americans never challenged the tariff structure 
submitted by Canada during the Uruguay Round, particularly 
with respect to yogurt and ice cream, it would be very difficult 
for them to come and ask Canada for tariff concessions for these 
commodities now.
<P>
	That being said, the restructuring necessitated by the shift 
from a quota system to a tariff system will particularly affect 
dairy producers, 50 per cent of which are found in Quebec.
<P>
	Throughout this transition period, dairy producers will have 
to contend with the federal government's decommitment in 
several areas. Of course, this decommitment will have a major 
impact on them, as it will affect their competitiveness in the 
short, medium and long term.
<P>
	First, in the short term, the federal government's decision to 
reduce by 30 per cent, over the next two years, its subsidies to 
industrial milk producers will result in significant losses for 
these producers.
<P>
	Indeed, the Quebec federation of dairy producers estimates 
that these cuts will result in a 15 per cent loss of revenue for 
industrial milk producers. This translates into a loss of $3,775 
for a medium-sized dairy farm producing 25,000 hectolitres of 
milk.
<P>
	These losses, which will result in a shortfall of close to $34 
million for the Quebec industry, will also be felt when, as is the 
case now, there is a need to invest in modern infrastructures to 
compete with American producers.
<P>
	Incidentally, dairy producers, unlike western farmers, will 
not benefit from any compensatory measure following this 
reduced federal assistance. Again, this shows the double 
standard applied by the federal government.
<P>
	The withdrawal of federal support to the dairy industry will 
also have an impact in the middle and in the long term, since 
several so-called green programs, under the GATT, will be 
eliminated. These programs deal with genetic evaluation, milk 
recording, dairy animal improvement, and research.
<P>
	Reducing or eliminating funding for these various programs 
will have very serious repercussions, because these moves not 
only threaten the programs that already exist, but they also 
affect Quebec's and Canada's ability to remain leading 
innovators in the dairy industry on the world scene.
<P>
	While we are cutting that which would allow us to stay on the 
cutting edge in this sector at the very centre of our economy, the 
Americans are planning to invest more than $600 million over 
the next five years in so-called green farming programs under 
the terms of the Uruguay Round agreements.
<P>
	What logic did the federal government use when it decided to 
cut research and development programs in the dairy sector, 
although studies show that for each dollar invested in genetic 
improvement or in quality control in the dairy sector, Quebec 
and Canada taxpayers reap seven dollars in benefits?
<P>
	No, dairy producers vigorously oppose any funding cuts to 
so-called green programs because the industry regards them as a 
priority. Obviously, there is no way  that I or the Bloc Quebecois 
can support such acts on the part of the government and that is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11518"> 11518 </A></B>
<P>
why I am behind the dairy producers all the way when they 
petition the federal government to stop dismantling their 
industry.
<P>
	Not only is the government jeopardizing the future of our 
dairy producers, but it also seems that its incompetence is 
robbing the dairy industry of its means to grow in an 
increasingly competitive world market.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to respond to the comments of the opposition this 
evening. However, I must remind the member that his comments 
in no way, shape or form are related to the question he asked in 
the House. That is what I will be responding to because I believe 
that is what his constituents want an answer to.
<P>
	The United States has requested a NAFTA chapter 20 
consultation concerning the application of Canada's World 
Trade Organization tariff equivalents to U.S. dairy and poultry 
products. The initial round of consultations took place on March 
1 in Ottawa.
<P>
	We in Canada have consistently maintained that both the FTA 
and the NAFTA make clear that Canada has preserved all its 
GATT rights with respect to supply-managed agriculture goods, 
including the right to apply the World Trade Organization 
tariffication provisions to U.S.-origin agricultural goods. In our 
view, Canada's approach to tariffication of dairy and poultry 
products is fully consistent with our international trade 
obligations under both NAFTA and the WTO.
<P>
	With respect to ice cream and yoghurt, in response to the 1989 
GATT ice cream and yoghurt panel report, we indicated that 
Canada would implement the panel findings in the context of the 
Uruguay Round. In the Uruguay Round, Canada and all other 
WTO parties agreed to tarrify their import restrictions. In our 
view, Canada's tariffication of quotas on ice cream and yoghurt 
addresses the GATT panel report of 1989.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	I can assure this House, all the dairy farmers and the 
opposition that we will continue to strongly defend Canada's 
tariffication approach on all supply-managed commodities.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTH">HEALTH</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Health.
<P>
	On March 27 of this year, Statistics Canada released its study 
on 39 medical procedures performed in hospitals across Canada. 
One of the procedures studied was hysterectomies. The 
hysterectomies that are performed on the women in my riding of 
Cumberland-Colchester are at a very high rate, as a matter of 
fact an alarming rate, the highest in the country. We have almost 
1,137  hysterectomies performed per 100,000 women, when the 
national average is approximately 437.
<P>
	In the county next to mine, Annapolis Valley, the rate is 137 
per 100,000 women. That is a significant spread. Ten times more 
hysterectomies are performed in Cumberland County than in 
Annapolis County and they are in the same province of Canada.
<P>
	This is a health issue. We know there are major causes of 
female problems that warrant hysterectomies. The number one 
cause is cancer of the ovaries, the cervix or the uterus; 
trophoblastic disease is another cause; fibroids; endometriosis; 
birth control in women where pregnancy would have meant 
certain death; and a few other reasons, such as Down's 
Syndrome, resulting in mentally handicapped children.
<P>
	Hysterectomies are a very normal procedure, but they are an 
invasion of women's health. That concerns me very definitely 
and very sincerely.
<P>
	We have tracked down the sincerity and the integrity of these 
numbers. They originated in the Department of Health in 
Halifax, Nova Scotia, and they have been tracked to the 
hospitals. The numbers have great significance, they have 
integrity and they are valid.
<P>
	My question for the parliamentary secretary is, will we 
investigate this phenomenal anomaly, which is very significant 
to the invasion of women's health? Whether it is due to 
overzealous doctors looking for cash crops on surgical 
procedures or whether it is due to fundamental underlying health 
problems for the women of Cumberland County, I would ask the 
parliamentary secretary to pursue this great anomaly.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member asks a very 
interesting and a very pertinent question. It is one in which we 
are very interested at Health Canada, mainly because it has to do 
with the issue of the health of Canadians and of Canadian 
women.
<P>
	Before I speak any further on the issue, I want to tell the hon. 
member that the issue of the number of services delivered has to 
do mostly with provincial governments and the medical 
profession. Therefore, that is not something I can comment on. 
At the same time, I can tell the hon. member that variations by 
region and by area may sometimes have some very valid reasons 
in specific interventions in health.
<P>
	Be that as it may, the federal government is very interested in 
overall health care servicing: the type of services we get and the 
quality of services given across the country. We are working 
with provincial governments and with health care providers to 
find out how it is we can improve the quality of care and the 
appropriateness of service.
<P>
	For example, the Minister of Health has just given money to 
the Canadian Medical Association to provide Canadian clinical 
practice guidelines. We need to look at the appropriateness of 
care to set clear guidelines and  priorities for care so that we are <BR>
<BR>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11519"> 11519 </A></B>
<P>
doing the right things to the right people at the right time. This 
kind of thing is what we are interested in dialoguing on, an 
evolving evaluation of care, et cetera.
<P>
	With respect to the issue of women's health, that is of great 
concern to us. The minister has committed herself to looking at 
health issues. We have not done enough research and enough 
work on women's health issues to be able to assess 
hysterectomies, the validity of them, when they should be done 
and how often they should be done. We are going on very old 
data. We need to set up centres of excellence for women, which 
we are committed to, which will investigate, do the research, get 
the data and look at the appropriateness of care for women in 
this country.
<P>
	I am glad the member asked the question because we believe it 
is something we need to look at. We have already embarked on 
the kinds of dialogue we need with the providers and with the 
provinces to ensure that we provide appropriate care in this 
country.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUTHSTRATEGY">YOUTH STRATEGY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on March 
30, I asked the Minister of Human Resources Development a 
question on the effectiveness of his Youth Strategy. Of course, 
since his answer was not satisfactory and contradicted his own 
department's assessment of his own program, I would like to get 
back to this matter. Allow me to reiterate my quotes, taken from 
page 2-41 of the Estimates for the Department of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	The first one stated that program evaluations revealed no 
significant improvements in terms of job opportunities 
compared to what could have been anticipated without the Youth 
Strategy program. The second quote, a little further along, 
indicated that the Canada-New Brunswick Youth Strategy also 
increased participants' dependency on social assistance. Still 
further along, the Strategy is described as not obviously 
affecting dependency on social assistance in Newfoundland. 
Participants and non-participants alike were more dependent on 
social assistance after the program. Considerable money was 
spent.
<P>
	For example, the Canada-New Brunswick agreement 
provides that $120 million will be spent. The Youth Strategy 
program in Newfoundland will spend $56.6 million. If I have the 
time, I would like to give you some statistics for Quebec to show 
that young people's dependency on social assistance increased 
not only in New Brunswick and Newfoundland. I will give some 
statistics for Quebec.
<P>
	In 1991, Quebec had 116,000 welfare recipients under 30 
years of age. In 1995, we now have 140,000 young people on 
welfare, of whom 74,000 are under 25, if we want to correlate 
this with the figures from Statistics Canada used by the 
Department of Human Resources Development. I find it hard to 
understand, and I hope the parliamentary secretary will be more 
persuasive than his minister, that although according to a 
document prepared by the department, an internal assessment of 
this program shows there has been an increase in the number of 
young people on welfare, the minister says it is the best program 
in the world. I find that hard to believe.
<P>
	There is also the fact that last year, we had cuts in 
unemployment insurance totalling $2.5 billion. Bill C-17 
increased the waiting period for unemployment insurance 
benefits, reduced the benefits themselves, and also reduced the 
benefit period. As a result, there has been a significant increase, 
in Quebec and other provinces as well, in the number of people 
who go from unemployment insurance to welfare. The most 
frequent casualties of this situation are young people, because 
they have 40 per cent of the insecure jobs in Canada and are the 
first to be unemployed, and thus the first casualties of cuts in 
unemployment insurance. Their only alternative is welfare. I 
wish the parliamentary secretary would be a little more 
forthcoming than his minister about the assessment of this 
program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first I would like to thank the hon. member for the 
sincerity expressed about young people. I know he is a member 
who truly cares about young people.
<P>
	Going back to the original question about the programs in 
Newfoundland and New Brunswick, he said: ``The results were 
devastating''. That is why the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has decided to discontinue this ineffective 
initiative and to focus on what really works in this country for 
young people.
<P>
	It is also important to remind the hon. member that this 
initiative dates back to the Conservative years. Our approach 
toward young people has changed quite drastically to the point 
at which if we look at budgetary items related to youth 
employment we have seen an increase over last year even though 
we must consider our fiscal situation.
<P>
	The youth internship program is exclusively designed to help 
young people make the transition from school to work. Over 
2,000 young Canadians will have benefited from our sectoral 
streams. By that I am referring to the programs launched in the 
environment, in logistics, in Canadian auto repair and services, 
electronics, electrical, manufacturing, tourism, all jobs with a 
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11520"> 11520 </A></B>
<P>
future. Also in the community and school based stream 
approximately 80  projects have been initiated. Over 4,000 
participants have participated.
<P>
	The funding for youth internship programs has been increased 
to $118 million in 1995-96 from the 1994-95 figure of $25 
million. This speaks to the excellent record the government has 
established in the area of youth.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 
p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.46 p.m.)
<P>
