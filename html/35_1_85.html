present two petitions on behalf of my constituents pursuant to 
Standing Order 36.
<P>
	The first is signed by several dozen residents of Walpole 
Island, First Nation, who call upon the government to maintain 
at all times their no GST status on or off the reserves for any 
purchases they might make.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ETHANOL">ETHANOL</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent):</B> Mr. Speaker, the second petition 
is signed by hundreds of my constituents of Kent who call upon 
the government to support a domestic ethanol industry in light 
of the fact that a $170 million plant for Chatham is in jeopardy 
without federal involvement and since legislative support of 
ethanol is Liberal policy. The petitioners want it to become 
government policy.

sponsored by the city of Chatham in the county of Kent. It was 
an outstanding day with enthusiasm and high spirits.

	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
petition from business men and women who point out that some 
progress has indeed been made by government and the private 
sector with regard to access to more capital to provide more 
growth and therefore more jobs.
<P>
	They also point out that there is a need to continue to work 
hard to eliminate the red tape which is often an impediment to 
conducting business in Canada. They see the current goods and 
services tax as cumbersome, as wasteful and as burdensome. 
They want the GST replaced and while doing so they want 
government and those who are working with government on an 
alternative not to forget the small and medium size business men 
and women.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to 
Standing Order 36 it is my honour to present two petitions 
signed by several thousands of constituents.
<P>
	The first petition which has 2,343 signature wishes to draw to 
the attention of the House that the incidents of sexual abuse 
directed toward children are becoming more and more frequent; 
that each incident of paedophilia harms the public and that there 
would be fewer such incidents if such persons were immediately 
taken off the streets for the protection of our children and the 
safety of our communities.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to enact 
legislation that would remand to custody any person charged 
with the act of paedophilia and that such person be denied bail 
until such time as this person has been proven innocent or until 
they have served the full length of sentence imposed upon them.

Speaker, I have the honour to present a petition signed by 
numerous residents of Harrowsmith, Sydenham, Glenburnie, 
Belleville and Kingston. That pretty well covers the 
communities that have signed, all of which are objecting to 
changes in the human rights code of the Canadian Human Rights 
Act or the Charter of Rights and Freedoms dealing with same 
sex relationships and approval thereof.
<P>
	Most of the constituents are from the neighbouring riding of 
Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington but for whatever

	The petitioners who signed this are from the same 
communities. They ask that the prohibition against assisted

Victoria-Haliburton and other areas concerning young 
offenders.
<P>
	No doubt they are joining the thousands of Canadians who are 
concerned about the violence in our communities, in particular 
the disturbing rise in youth violence.
<P>
	This petition has been duly certified by the Clerk of Petitions 
and calls on Parliament to review and revise our laws 
concerning young offenders by empowering the courts to 
prosecute and punish the young law breakers who are terrorizing 
our society by releasing their names and lowering the age limit 
to allow prosecution to meet the severity of the crime.

the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
following questions will be answered today: Nos. 49 and 50.
<P>
[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question No. 49-<B>Mr. Simmons:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What action has the Department of Environment taken in response to the 
concerns raised by the Auditor General in his 1993 report that ``parliamentarians 
and stakeholders were not comprehensively and equally informed about key 
issues affecting the effectiveness and cost of the pulp and paper regulations?''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Environment Canada accepts these 
criticisms and is modifying its process. In the future, the process 
will involve early consultation with all stakeholders and 
partners (provinces, parliamentarians, industries, NGOs) in the 
development of options for a particular environmental issue.
<P>
	Accordingly, Environment Canada has committed itself to 
implement a process that will fulfil the principles of: public 
participation, openness and transparency in the 
decision-making process; exploring options beyond traditional 
command and control regulations such as: market-based tools 
(trading programs, taxes and charges, financial incentives, 
environmental liability and deposit/refund systems); voluntary 
actions (guidelines and multistakeholder protocols); 
information provision (environmental labelling, technology 
development and transfer, government reports/inventories, 
citizenship); and regulations/guidelines/environmental quality 
objectives; and cost effectiveness, flexibility, and harmonizing 
environmental management regimes among federal and 
provincial governments.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> The Department of Environment will 
continue to ensure that the regulatory impact analysis 
statements (RIAS) fulfil the Treasury Board requirements in 
terms of providing clear and concise information on:
<P>
	1. the rationale for the environmental measure (regulations or 
economic instrument);
<P>
	2. an assessment of alternatives to the selected environmental 
measure;

possible);
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5267"> 5267 </A></B>
<P>
	4. the comments received in the course of the consultation 
period; and
<P>
	5. how the environmental measure will be enforced.
<P>
	Since the RIAS is a summary of technical and economic 
studies, any economic related information or questions could be 
answered by providing interested parties with these studies. 
These are available upon request and upon the publication of the 
RIAS in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>, Part I.

	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister of National 
Revenue)</B> moved that Bill C-11, an act to amend the Excise Act, 
the Customs Act and the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act, be 
read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I am sure every member 
appreciates, smuggling is both a serious and complex problem. 
It threatens our economy and the health of young Canadians.
<P>
	Bill C-11 plays an important role in the fight against 
smuggling and in protecting the health of young Canadians.
<P>
	We know that the Prime Minister's four point, 
anti-smuggling initiative announced on February 8, 1994 is 
having a positive impact in the fight against tobacco smuggling. 
Cigarette exports have plummeted. These exports represented 
the major source of smuggled products.
<P>
	However, we need to maintain the momentum we established 
with the government's anti-smuggling initiative. The decisions 
by Quebec, New Brunswick, Ontario, Prince Edward Island and 
Nova Scotia to lower their tobacco tax rates and work within the 
Prime Minister's anti-smuggling framework are very 
encouraging.
<P>
	Bill C-11 deals with the legislative changes we need to make 
to give our law enforcement agencies the flexibility and tools 
they need to fight the smuggling problem in its entirety. The 
proposed amendments to the Excise Act will allow the 
government to designate other Canadian police forces as 
appropriate with the authority to enforce certain seizure related 
sections of the act.
<P>
	For example, section 88.(2) of the Excise Act provides an 
officer with the authority to seize vehicles that have been or are 
being used for the purpose of transporting contraband. As well, 
subsection 163.(3) will allow an officer to seize contraband 
spirits in any vehicle used to transport contraband spirits.
<P>
	These powers have always been available to the RCMP. With 
Bill C-11, however, we can now extend these powers to other 
Canadian police forces. In particular, Bill C-11 allows us to 
respond to requests from Ontario and Quebec for additional 
powers for their provincial police forces.
<P>
	In addition to this measure, Bill C-11 includes an amendment 
that will allow these law enforcement agencies to immediately 
destroy seized contraband without hindering the ability of 
authorities to bring criminals to successful prosecution.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	This measure will provide our law enforcement agencies with 
increased flexibility in dealing with the smuggling trade without 
jeopardizing prosecutions. It will also save taxpayers over 
$200,000 a year in storage costs. This figure represents savings 
only to the Department of National Revenue. It does not include 
amounts to be saved by the RCMP.
<P>
	An amendment to the Excise Act will also require individual 
cigarettes to be stamped. This measure will enable our law 
enforcement agencies and all law-abiding Canadians to more 
easily identify contraband tobacco products.
<P>
	Under an amendment to the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons 
Act, Bill C-11 would also ban the importation of tobacco 
products by persons under the age of 18. This  amendment will 
help to protect young Canadians from accessing tobacco 
products from outside the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5268"> 5268 </A></B>
<P>
	In short, Bill C-11 will help us crack down on smuggling. It 
will help us break the criminal networks that control the 
smuggling trade. It will help to protect the health of young 
Canadians and it is enforceable.
<P>
	Finally, when we deal with smuggling we also address the 
underground economy and the problems it creates. Bill C-11 
promotes greater co-operation between governments. We are 
better able to address the challenges we are facing and do it more 
efficiently by working together.
<P>
	In closing, I want to highlight an observation that I made 
during the debate on Bill C-11 in the House and in committee. It 
appeared to me that all sides of the House agreed on the need to 
strengthen the anti-smuggling powers of our law enforcement 
agencies and on the need to protect and educate young 
Canadians on the dangers of tobacco. I believe that my 
statements here today have shown this government's 
commitment toward resolving these problems.
<P>
	In the House of Commons on February 8 the Prime Minister 
stated that we must act to eliminate smuggling to protect the 
health of young Canadians and to restore respect for the law. Bill 
C-11 plays an important role in accomplishing these objectives.
<P>
	I hope members of this House will act together to support this 
bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. GÃ©rard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I rise today to speak on Bill C-11, An Act to amend 
the Excise Act, the Customs Act and the Tobacco Sales to Young 
Persons Act.
<P>
	I congratulate the government on finally living up to its 
responsibilities and bringing in amendments so that the Act can 
be applied more effectively. Unfortunately, it seems that the 
government has decided to tackle the serious problems caused 
by cigarette smuggling on the backs of the manufacturers and 
retailers.
<P>
	Instead of applying the Act to the letter and having goods 
seized and offenders arrested, on Indian reserves among other 
places, the government has opted for dissuasion and retaliation 
against honest citizens. The Prime Minister himself has 
admitted that he had difficulty getting the Act applied.
<P>
	Under the weight of public pressure, the Minister of Health, 
the Hon. Diane Marleau, the same one who gave her word that 
taxes on tobacco products would not be lowered, had no choice 
but to give in. You have to admit it is sad to see that the current 
government seems to prefer protecting criminals who break the 
law to concerning itself with the health of Quebeckers and 
Canadians.
<P>
	Despite that, there are some good provisions in Bill C-11, 
although some others ought to be amended. I am going to use the 
few minutes at my disposal to discuss  these provisions with my 
fellow members here in the House. The bill contains the 
following amendment to section 7.1(1) of the Tobacco Sales to 
Young Persons Act: ``No person shall sell or offer for sale 
cigarettes unless they are sold or offered for sale in packages 
containing at least 20 cigarettes per package''.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	It should be noted that packs of less than 20 cigarettes are 
primarily bought and consumed by young people. You might be 
inclined to think that the purchase of cigarettes by young people 
would now drop significantly, except that the government has 
just lowered the tax on cigarettes, which could have the opposite 
effect to the government's stated goal, thus making it easier for 
young people to get access to tobacco products.
<P>
	This brings me to what it costs young people to smoke. 
Although some young people have a bit of work, often at the 
minimum wage, they are not rich, and so it is to be hoped that 
they will decide to stop smoking and invest their money in 
something more constructive. This may be a hollow hope, since 
it was estimated in 1989 that 90 per cent of young Canadians 
aged 12 to 19 years of age smoked every day. The total volume 
of purchases by this segment of the population represents$436 million.
<P>
	You will agree that this is a huge amount of money:$436 million gone up in smoke-if you will allow me a small 
pun-especially when 40 per cent of young Quebecers were 
living below the poverty line in 1990. My figures are a few years 
old, but the situation has hardly changed.
<P>
	Equally appalling is the fact that adolescents are starting to 
smoke younger and younger, a situation that alarms me very 
much indeed. I know what I am talking about, because one of my 
own children is 12 years old now, and I am sure that I am not the 
only member of this House to be confronted with this harsh 
reality. You can try your best to persuade them not to smoke, but 
at that age young people often succumb to peer pressure. 
Moreover, it is often before the age of 17 that dependence on 
cigarettes develops, and the older you get, the harder it is to 
break the habit.
<P>
	According to Health and Welfare Canada, 38,000 people die 
each year of illnesses directly or indirectly related to tobacco 
use. And what about the years of diminished productivity caused 
by inability to work thanks to tobacco-related illness? The 
amounts that have to be paid out by the government-and that 
means by you and me, through our taxes-for leave and health 
care are enormous.
<P>
	Another aspect of the bill that perplexes me is the control of 
the age restrictions on people who want to buy tobacco products. 
It is commendable to make access to tobacco products more 
difficult for the young. One of the provisions in the bill prohibits 
vendors from selling tobacco products to anyone under the age 
of 18, on pain of fines or imprisonment. The problem I see with 
this clause is that of controls and application.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5269"> 5269 </A></B>
<P>
	The government says controls will be tighter, since some300 Health Canada inspectors will be responsible for ensuring 
that the legislation is applied to the letter. If these amendments 
are applied in the same way as those governing the sale of 
alcohol to minors, we are entitled to wonder about their 
relevance. We all know how easy it is for young people to obtain 
alcohol from unscrupulous vendors. You have only to visit any 
corner store in Quebec to realize that.
<P>
	To follow up on what I have just said I would now like to speak 
about the fines that vendors would have to pay for selling 
tobacco products to minors, and manufactures for packaging 
cigarettes less than 20 to a pack.
<P>
	The amendment that the bill proposes to section 7.2(1) of the 
Act would make anyone convicted of selling cigarettes to a 
minor liable, on summary conviction, to a fine of not more than 
$2,000 or a prison term of not more than six months.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	You will agree with me that $2,000 is not a lot of money. In my 
opinion, the fine should be a little stiffer, to give the bill more 
teeth. On the other hand, the fines by the cigarette 
manufacturers will probably have a strong deterrent effect since 
they range from $100,000 to $500,000 and from six months to 
two years in prison.
<P>
	In my opinion, education about the dangers and the cost of 
smoking, among both young and old people, is still one of the 
most effective ways of eliminating the problem of tobacco use in 
Canada-on condition, though, that the messages conveyed are 
relevant. Unfortunately, the government's publicity campaigns 
put forward in recent years by Health Canada are far from 
having had the desired effect. In the opinion of young people 
themselves, those campaigns did not get their attention. Instead 
of telling them that it is stupid to smoke or that their friends will 
drop them if they keep on smoking, we should show young 
people what really happens when people smoke.
<P>
	In closing, I shall address the point of view of the tobacco 
product manufacturers and retailers concerning Bill C-11, an 
act to amend the Excise Act, the Customs Act and the Tobacco 
Sales to Young Persons Act.
<P>
	The cigarette manufacturers have agreed to stop 
manufacturing packs containing fewer than 20 cigarettes, and 
the retailers have agreed to stop selling them. However, the time 
allowed by the government to sell off that stock is too short, in 
the opinion of the manufacturers, distributors and retailers. 
Stopping the production of packs containing fewer than 20 
cigarettes will entail considerable costs.
<P>
	Nor is taking packs containing fewer than 20 cigarettes off the 
market right away justified: these products are not faulty and 
have no manufacturing defects.
<P>
	Another point that should be noted is that whether the 
distributors and retailers have packs containing fewer than 20 
cigarettes in stock depends, essentially, on their sales in the 
past, when these packs were legal. A retailer who had ordered a 
large quantity of packs containing fewer than 20 cigarettes but 
had not sold many of them would need more time to sell off that 
stock.
<P>
	Nor should we forget that the cigarette companies will have to 
remove all machines that distribute only packs containing fewer 
than 20 cigarettes, a move that also entails costs.
<P>
	For all the reasons I have just mentioned, we in the Bloc 
Quebecois ask the government to extend the deadline for 
manufacturers, distributors and retailers so that they may sell 
off their stock while suffering as few losses as possible.
<P>
	In conclusion, I express the wish that the amendments to Bill 
C-11, An Act to amend the Excise Act, the Customs Act and the 
Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act, will be strictly enforced 
and will help eliminate smoking, particularly among young 
people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to make a few remarks in the third reading of this bill.
<P>
	It has been a number of months since Bill C-11 was first 
debated in the House. During second reading of Bill C-11 in 
February the Reform Party used the opportunity to discuss and 
debate all the changes proposed by the government as a part of 
our national action plan to combat smuggling, particularly our 
opposition to the tax reduction on cigarettes. That was our main 
concern.
<P>
	I wish to make it clear that while Reformers support the 
changes to Bill C-11, we are still opposed to the tax reductions 
on cigarettes which were recently introduced in Bill C-32.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	Yesterday we introduced an amendment that would make it 
more difficult for young people to obtain chewing tobacco. We 
have grave concerns in that regard. We appreciate very much 
that the government listened. At this time it is not going to 
implement the amendment, but we appreciate its openness and 
acceptance of the idea.
<P>
	Bill C-11 will improve enforcement under the excise and 
customs acts by giving the government the authority to allow 
police forces other than the RCMP to enforce specific 
provisions. Provincial and municipal forces can be designated 
with the authority to seize alcohol or tobacco, to seize vehicles 
used 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5270"> 5270 </A></B>
<P>
to transport contraband, and to seize equipment used in illicit 
activities. Reformers support these increased enforcement 
measures.
<P>
	Bill C-11 provides for the immediate destruction of certain 
seized goods, primarily tobacco and alcohol. Currently these 
goods would have to be kept for one month. It is estimated the 
measure would save taxpayers $200,000 per year in storage 
costs. Bill C-11 also provides for compensation to be paid to a 
person who is entitled to have the seized goods returned but the 
goods have been sold or destroyed.
<P>
	Reformers have some concerns about this provision because it 
is not completely clear to us whether the person would get the 
fair market value of the goods if the goods were sold. I am 
referring to subsection 9(3) which states that if it is not possible 
to return them ``the person shall be paid (a) where the goods 
were sold the proceeds from the sale''.
<P>
	Our concern is that the proceeds from the sale may not be the 
fair market value for the goods, vehicles or equipment sold. 
While we have some reservations concerning compensation for 
seized goods that have been sold or destroyed, Reformers still 
support the new provision.
<P>
	Bill C-11 will also amend the Excise Act in order to require 
individual cigarettes to be clearly stamped to indicate that 
excise duties have been paid. This will make it easier for 
everyone to identify those persons who are smoking contraband 
tobacco products.
<P>
	The Canadian Cancer Society still believes that individual 
stamping of cigarettes may not be visible enough and has 
recommended that Bill C-11 be amended to make it possible to 
require tobacco manufacturers to produce cigarettes with 
different coloured paper. If individual stamping does not prove 
to be effective, certainly a different coloured cigarette would be 
more noticeable. While Reformers support the amendment 
proposed by the Canadian Cancer Society, we will still support 
Bill C-11.
<P>
	Just as an aside, I think it would be an interesting research 
project to see what effect black paper would have on the outside 
of cigarettes rather than white paper. It would be an interesting 
research project for someone to do some time.
<P>
	Bill C-11 also amends the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons 
Act by raising the legal age of purchase to 18 years and 
prohibiting the sale of so-called kiddie packs. The amendment 
will make it illegal for tobacco vendors to sell kiddie packs and 
make it illegal for tobacco manufacturers to package cigarettes 
in packages containing fewer than 20 cigarettes.
<P>
	There has been some concern by tobacco manufacturers about 
the cost and the timing of the implementation of the amendment, 
but Reformers believe it is not a major issue. The health of 
young people is more important and we support the 
government's amendment.
<P>
	I wish to remind the government of the comments made by the 
hon. member for Wild Rose in the House on February 22. I 
should like to quote them at this time: ``Stopping the so-called 
kiddie packs is one thing that is excellent about this bill. The 
only problem is that we will not have to worry about kiddie 
packs any more because now they can afford the 25 packs''.
<P>
	This statement illustrates a real concern about the 
government's national action plan to combat smuggling. The tax 
reduction on cigarettes has made cigarettes more affordable for 
everyone, especially young people. We just do not know how 
many thousands of people will start smoking or start smoking 
more as a result of the tax reduction on cigarettes. Consequently 
we do not know how much the government's action plan will 
cost taxpayers in increased health care costs. This is a major 
concern for us.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Our concerns were confirmed when the Parliamentary 
Secretary for the Minister of Health appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Finance on June 7 and advised that the 
government's goal was ``to reduce the demand for tobacco, the 
number one cause of preventable death in Canada. It is the 
number one cause of preventable death''. She went on to say: 
``The government fully recognized that the action plan to 
combat smuggling and the tax measures associated with it would 
pose health risks''.
<P>
	It is inconceivable to me how the government could 
rationalize those two statements. It recognizes the problem and 
it recognizes that what it has done will compound the problem. I 
think this needs to be addressed.
<P>
	In conclusion, once again I express our support for Bill C-11, 
as amended, even though we oppose the government's tax 
reduction on cigarettes. Reformers look forward to the real 
debate on the government's national action plan to combat 
smuggling when Bill C-32 comes back to the House from 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to take but a few minutes to say a few words on 
the bill.
<P>
	As the member of Parliament who has the honour and 
privilege of representing Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, and 
more particularly Glengarry for the purpose of this 
conversation, I would be remiss if I did not take a few moments 
in the House to express my gratitude to hon. members for 
supporting the legislation.
<P>
	Unless members have actually seen what it was like in and 
around Cornwall, Ontario, at this time last year they really 
cannot have an appreciation of how big and how serious the 
issue was for our government. It was obvious to the previous 
government that the problem would never go away on its own 
and that very drastic measures needed to be taken.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5271"> 5271 </A></B>
<P>
	I remember around this period last year receiving telephone 
calls in my constituency office and in my Ottawa office virtually 
every day from people who were telling me: ``Last night there 
was a van parked in my driveway along the St. Lawrence River 
when I got home. People were loading cigarettes right in my 
yard''. I remember people telling me: ``I was sitting on the 
veranda. A boat came up to my house and just stopped. A van 
wheeled in and they unloaded cigarettes and in 10 seconds flat 
they were gone. They had unloaded a cargo in my yard before my 
very eyes in the daylight''. I remember constituents telling me 
how the smugglers would shoot their guns to frighten them into 
their homes so that they could continue their illegal activity.
<P>
	We saw all of that in my riding. We saw it for a long time. We 
saw that kind of illegal activity going on. We also know how all 
of it was run by organized crime, or at least the great majority of 
it. This was no cottage industry for a few local people. No, it was 
way beyond that. I am sure deep down inside all members know 
this as well.
<P>
	To pretend that simply applying an export tax to tobacco 
would solve this problem is wrong, and I think members know it. 
To pretend that changing the colour of the cigarette and making 
it obvious that anything not that colour is contraband would 
solve the problem is also wrong. People were proudly 
displaying, otherwise law-abiding Canadians, in their pockets 
cigarette packages that were strictly made for the contraband 
market.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	I will never forget the day when I found a package of 
contraband cigarettes beside a dumpster near the West Block 
and I brought it to the attention of the House at that time.
<P>
	We all knew the contraband market was everywhere. 
Changing the colour of the barrel of the cigarette, plain 
packaging or a few other measures like those simply could not 
work on their own. We needed an all encompassing plan. As the 
centrepiece of that plan we required a reduction in cigarette 
taxes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And that is the only thing that makes the plan work. Without 
that main element, without that cornerstone, nothing would have 
worked, and parliamentarians know it.
<P>
	My colleagues in the Bloc know it perhaps better, certainly a 
bit better than the Reform members, because Quebec and 
eastern Ontario were affected by the smuggling much more than 
were some other regions.
<P>
	But the country was not spared, not in the east, not in the west, 
or anywhere else. We heard about major seizures, even in cities 
like Edmonton. Mr Speaker, you heard about them yourself: 
seizures of smuggled goods worth millions of dollars. So, that 
we know.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The announcement by the Prime Minister came on February 8. 
I conclude by reading a bit from an article in the <I>Standard 
Freeholder</I> of February 16, eight days after the government 
announced its plan. That was barely enough time for smugglers 
to liquidate their stock of illegal cigarettes. Yet eight days later 
the following story was on the front page of Cornwall's daily 
newspaper, the <I>Standard Freeholder</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Smuggling is down to a trickle. The volume of black market cigarettes moving 
through this region has dropped significantly since the federal government's 
crackdown on smuggling began one week ago today.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>OPP Det. Inspector Chris Lewis said police have seized some smuggled 
smokes since the federal anti-smuggling plan went into effect last Wednesday. 
But the volume of contraband seized in the past week has ``been quite a bit less'' 
than the police had been accustomed to seizing in a seven-day period.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Lewis, with the Anti-Smuggling Task Force in Cornwall, could not give 
specific figures, but he did attribute the slowdown to the stepped-up police 
enforcement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Snowmobile activity on the river has slowed down as well. Lewis said during 
the week there was a lot of activity from mainland U.S. to Cornwall Island but 
very little between Cornwall Island and mainland Ontario. This too he attributes 
to the stepped-up enforcement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Then there is the quote from then Grand Chief of the Mohawk 
community of Akwesasne, Mike Mitchell, who said: ``If there is 
anything moving it is just a trickle''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In eight days, the plague that had stricken my constituency 
had been eliminated: eight days.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My constituents experienced in a free and democratic society 
not even being able to leave their homes to go outside in their 
own backyards without being threatened by gunshots. This was 
not in Sarajevo, not in Mogadishu and not in Rwanda but50 miles from Parliament Hill. That is what my constituents 
were subjected to. That is what they had to live through for a 
long period of time.
<P>
	To anyone who tells me that these high cigarette taxes should 
be reimposed like I heard yesterday I say: ``Do not try selling 
that policy in Glengarry. Do not try selling that policy to the 
millions of Canadians who know the illegal activity that went on 
and the fact that otherwise law-abiding Canadians by the 
millions were no longer respecting that law''.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	The social contract had broken down, not the Bob Rae social 
contract but the Hobbesian kind, that rule by which we all agree 
to respect the laws of this country. That rule no longer existed as 
it pertained to taxes on cigarettes. When society decides 
collectively that the rule no longer exists, it ceases to exist. That 
is the reality.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5272"> 5272 </A></B>
<P>
	Yes, we could bury our heads in the sand and say ``Oh, no, no, 
we could have hired six more policemen to patrol a 4,000 mile 
unprotected border and that would have fixed it''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris</B> Hire as many as you need.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Yes, right. Members across say hire as many as 
you need. The deficit reduction bunch across the way say yes, 
hire as many as you need.
<P>
	Do you know how many police officers it would take to patrol 
the Canada-U.S. border if you had one per kilometre? It would 
take around 6,000 of them three shifts a day, seven days a week, 
just to patrol the border if you had one every kilometre. That is 
how idiotic that kind of a solution to the problem is. No, that was 
not the solution.
<P>
	A letter signed by the person in charge of the RCMP, Norman 
Inkster, was tabled in the House. It stated that it was not the 
solution and that there was only one solution left. Two years 
before perhaps there could have been other solutions, but it was 
too late. Now we had to take the drastic action taken by the 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	On behalf of all of my constituents, those who lived through 
that sad period of time, those who had their lives threatened and 
those people who are no longer with us because they were killed 
in the process, I want to thank the government for doing the right 
thing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very closely to the what the member had to say. I 
appreciate the fact that the government can act decisively when 
it chooses and it can drag its feet when it chooses.
<P>
	I have a couple of comments and I hope the member will 
respond to them. He described how tobacco products were being 
brought in and smuggled right through people's yards and so on. 
When the taxes were reduced, of course there were no more 
tobacco products being smuggled. Now the problem is alcohol 
and guns according to my understanding.
<P>
	If organized crime is the problem, why was that not dealt 
with? We have simply given them something else to focus on 
because it is no longer profitable to deal with tobacco and 
cigarettes. The problem in Manitoba demonstrates that. This 
reduction in taxes only made organized crime turn to something 
else.
<P>
	Enforcement could have been tried. We could have worked 
together with the American authorities. We could have had an 
export tax. There are other avenues that could have been 
pursued.
<P>
	Now the smuggling goes on between provinces. We have only 
shifted the problem into other areas. The government did not get 
to the root of the problem with organized crime so it is now 
turning to other things. I am very curious to know what the 
decisive action of the government will be in this regard or 
whether it will drag its feet on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all about this dragging of 
one's feet, nonsense. This government was sworn into office in 
November. The initiative was announced on February 8, only a 
few days after Parliament was recalled. I asked for three years in 
the previous government to do something. I asked this new 
government, three weeks and it was done. This dragging of the 
feet allegation is sheer and utter nonsense. The member knows 
it.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	In terms of anti-smuggling, obviously the 25 per cent 
increase in the police force was not just for tobacco smuggling. 
As I indicated to the member, it was not just a reducing of the 
taxes. It was the centrepiece of the program. Other things were 
done as well. The member alluded to some of them, but those 
things on their own could not work according to the RCMP and 
according to the people of my riding unless you included that 
centrepiece which was the reduction of taxes.
<P>
	The member talks about the smuggling of arms and the 
smuggling of liquor and so on. First, how does the member think 
we are catching these people now? It is because we have 
increased the number of police that we have. Because we no 
longer have that scourge of tobacco smuggling we can 
concentrate our efforts elsewhere. Otherwise we would not even 
know the problem was there. That is how it came to our 
attention.
<P>
	Finally, the smuggling of arms and the smuggling of liquor is 
not done in the same way as tobacco smuggling. I could sit down 
with the member and describe to him how some of these things 
occur. There is a link but it is not nearly as direct. You do not 
smuggle liquor on snowmobiles in the winter or on boats across 
the river at Akwesasne, at least not generally.
<P>
	The liquor is smuggled largely by tanker cars, false bottoms 
and things of that nature. Furthermore, a lot of the liquor is 
smuggled for institutional use as opposed to domestic use. It is 
smuggled in large barrels and containers. It is then emptied into 
smaller bottles by hotel and bar operators and so on and used in 
that way. It is not the same as the problem of cigarettes where 
society was probably displaying a smuggled pack. It is vastly 
different.
<P>
	On the gun issue, there are many differences again where guns 
are smuggled on the bottom of trucks. Containers are fastened to 
the underside of trucks as they cross the border and things like 
that. I am told the same applies to railway cars, that sort of thing. 
It is a vastly different network.
<P>
	Finally, on the issue of liquor, if I can just go back to that 
point, liquor taxes are not federal taxes. The member would 
know that as well. Between 80 per cent and 85 per cent of liquor 
taxes are provincial. They are not federal taxes. The solution 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5273"> 5273 </A></B>
<P>
could not be the same even if it were advocated and of course it 
is not in any case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> What about the 
tobacco smuggling issue between provinces?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> On the issue of tobacco smuggling between 
provinces, perhaps I was not paying close enough attention. I 
had not recognized that question as being part of his series of 
questions that he asked. I apologize for that.
<P>
	On the issue of tobacco smuggling between provinces, the 
member would know that it is the responsibility of the 
provincial government to ensure that the provincial taxes in the 
respective jurisdictions are adhered to. The difficulty there is 
that many provinces saw that the appropriate way to go was to 
co-operate with the federal government in an effort to reduce 
the smuggling. They did so. It is thanks to those provinces that 
we managed to get rid of the problem that we had.
<P>
	I say to the House, let us not forget that it is estimated that80 per cent of the tobacco smuggling in Canada was coming into 
the country through my riding. One million dollars a day in 
illegal money in my riding alone, 1,000 cases smuggled a day at 
$1,000 a case. There was $1 million a day that went through the 
underworld.
<P>
	I congratulate the government again for having put an end to 
that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I sit here and listen to the hon. member's 
rationalization of this government's soft position on criminal 
justice and a stricter law enforcement, I have some serious 
questions.
<P>
	The hon. member said that the party opposite, meaning us, 
talks about deficit reduction and yet is willing to spend more 
money on law enforcement issues and the hiring of more staff. 
This party campaigned on increased spending and criminal 
justice.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	The member opposite has taken what was essentially a 
criminal problem, a problem of breaking the law. Smuggling is 
not a taxation problem. It is a problem where people were 
breaking the law. This government refused to send in the 
necessary police forces to control it.
<P>
	This member just told us that a million dollars a day in 
tobacco products was coming across the border. That is a huge 
amount. I would suggest to this member that if they had been 
willing to go to the source, to the territory where that smuggling 
was taking place, which they were not, with the appropriate law 
enforcement people that that could have been curtailed.
<P>
	There is no way that one can rationalize that a million dollars 
a day worth of tobacco products is just simply too hard to find 
for the police and the cost would be too great. What about the 
cost that is going to be incurred by the health of this country with 
the increase in smoking? It will increase because now the price 
of cigarettes is affordable.
<P>
	This government has refused to take a hard stand on criminal 
justice and has refused to enforce the laws to take necessary 
action to control crime in this country. It is typical of the Liberal 
philosophy that no individual is responsible for crimes they 
commit. It is society to blame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member across did not major 
in geography. To say that one could actually design the patrol of 
that area and actually get rid of the problem that way, clearly 
indicates a lack of knowledge in that regard.
<P>
	I say to the hon. member to come with me to the area and he 
will understand. We hired RCMP additional officers. It takes 
approximately eight months to a year before they are actually 
over there doing that kind of thing once one they have been 
trained.
<P>
	Did he want a million dollars a day for another year in illegal 
money to be made while we did that? I did not want to see that 
illegal activity, my constituents being shot at for another year, 
no. I wanted action, tough action, immediate action. I wanted 
protection for my constituents and we got it thanks to this 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has apparently 
forgotten that this country has a well equipped armed forces that 
could have been used in that situation.
<P>
	This government is trying to define a role for the armed 
forces. Here was an excellent example of a role that the militia 
of this country could have played. The army could have been 
sent in to control this situation. Yet, it refused to do that. Why?
<P>
	I am inclined to think it is because of where the problem was 
happening. There were other issues involved here and this was 
an area that this government did not want to touch.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand I have only a few 
seconds left.
<P>
	The member is advocating a military intervention at 
Akwasasne and outside of Akwasasne in an area some 40 miles 
long on the Canada-U.S. border. That may be the hon. member's 
idea on how to have laws respected. It is not mine. Heaven 
forbid that we would undertake an issue like that.
<P>
	The other thing it would involve effectively is militarizing the 
Canada-U.S. border. The member knows how porous the border 
is and to shift an issue one mile either way is not very hard. I say 
to the member that unless he has seen the area, unless he knows 
how to get in and out of that area, unless he knows that 
smuggling had reached such proportions that in the spring it was 
even occurring by helicopter, how can he say that we should 
have sent the army to patrol the Canada-U.S. border?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5274"> 5274 </A></B>
<P>
	No, not on the Canada-U.S. border and least not in my riding 
and least not again at Akwasasne. Nowhere will that be done if I 
have anything to do with it.

<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the House on Bill C-36, 
the Split Lake Cree First Nation settlement agreement. Before I 
do so I would like to make some general comments with regard 
to what the government is trying to do to assist aboriginal people 
to get to a point where they can get more control over their lives.
<P>
	I would like to go back to some comments that were made last 
week by an hon. member. It says here: ``You do not have to stir 
the wood in the stove in order to cook meals. Instead of having to 
tend a garden in the summer you just buy the food from the 
supermarket''.
<P>
	I just came in from my hometown of Repulse Bay yesterday, 
which is right on the Arctic circle. I was out seal hunting, along 
with a lot of the people of my hometown who were out seal 
hunting for their food. They were not going to the grocery store 
to buy their food. They were going out to hunt the food.
<P>
	I do not think the remark that was made is quite correct. I 
really did not see any people who were staying home because 
they felt lazy. Even when they were very tired they went out 
hunting.
<P>
	As a result of these comments some may be thinking that 
aboriginal people must be lazy, wearing sun glasses and 
Bermuda shorts on some island. When we talk about bills like 
this, and we are trying to correct some wrongs, we do not want to 
give the wrong impression to the people of Canada.
<P>
	One of the first remarks that a constituent of mine from Iqaluit 
made to me yesterday was: ``We should invite that person from 
the Reform Party to come up in February with sun glasses and 
Bermuda shorts and we will go to some island''. I think there 
was a similar invitation from the chief of the Opaskwayak Cree 
Nation yesterday.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> A point of order, the hon. 
member for Athabasca.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am listening to the speaker talk 
about an issue that I believe was dealt with and settled in this 
House some time ago. The debate on this bill concerns the flood 
management-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. With all due 
respect to the hon. member, he does not have a point of order. It 
is a matter of debate and so I would ask the parliamentary 
secretary to continue his intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was commenting on what we are 
trying to do as a government to help the aboriginal people. I 
make these comments because of comments made last week in 
the House and I think the hon. members from that party could 
learn an awful lot if they would just listen.
<P>
	I will quote some more: ``I do not know the answer to the 
native communities and the problems which persist''. It should 
be fairly obvious that if the hon. member could keep the people 
thinking that he is ignorant of aboriginal issues and kept silent 
instead of opening his mouth and proving it, then we would all 
be much better off.
<P>
	In the debates when we are trying to do as much as we can to 
ensure that aboriginal people have a rightful place by righting 
some of the wrongs that have been done over the years, the 
members opposite would like us to go back a further 100 years 
and just say it is not your land. We do not have to help you. You 
should be on your own. We are not asking for that kind of help. 
We are asking for righting some of the wrongs that have been 
done over the last 200 years. We have resided in this country for 
40,000 years.
<P>
	I would like to go on to the bill to address the Split Lake Cree 
First Nation's flood agreement. As hon. members are aware, this 
is a very short bill. It is nonetheless an important bill because it 
ensures that certain commitments of the Government of Canada 
will be met. I would like to explain why it is before the House.
<P>

<P>
	In 1977 the northern flood agreement was signed by the 
Governments of Canada and Manitoba, Manitoba Hydro, and 
the northern flood committee which represents five Manitoba 
First Nations.
<P>
	It was intended to resolve a number of issues that arose after 
11,861 acres of reserve lands were flooded by hydro related 
projects on the Churchill and Nelson Rivers. This project also 
flooded up to 528,000 acres of non-reserve land, much of which 
was traditionally used by the affected First Nations for hunting 
and trapping. The affected waterways were used as a source of 
drinking water, for recreational pursuits, for food and 
commercial fishing, and for transportation.
<P>
	The northern flood agreement sets out a compensation 
program to the more than 9,000 status Indians adversely 
affected by the Lake Winnipeg regulation and Churchill River 
diversion project.
<P>
	Unfortunately the northern flood agreement has been very 
difficult to implement. Its vague and inadequate wording, along 
with its failure to anticipate all the issues that have arisen, have 
lead the parties to seek arbitration on many points.
<P>
	A total of 172 claims have been filed and this has occurred at a 
great expense to taxpayers. To resolve these problems, in July 
1990 the four parties agreed to a proposed basis of settlement for 
addressing outstanding issues under the northern flood 
agreement.
<P>
	This new accord approved a long list of matters to be resolved 
and provided a basis for band specific negotiations relating to 
them.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	The only such negotiations to be completed to date involve 
the Split Lake Cree First Nation. An agreement was signed with 
this First Nation in June 1992 and it is now being implemented 
with no significant problems.
<P>
	In addition to providing financial compensation to this First 
Nation, the settlement agreement increases socioeconomic 
opportunities for the Split Lake Cree and releases Canada from 
further obligations to this First Nation under the northern flood 
agreement in return for compensation provided.
<P>
	The Split Lake Cree settlement agreement includes a 
commitment by the Government of Canada to implement certain 
provisions of the agreement through legislation. This is what 
Bill C-36 sets out to do. It does not give force to the Split Lake 
Cree settlement agreement. This agreement has its own legal 
force and is already being implemented.
<P>
	It does not include commitments by the Government of 
Canada which have not already been made by the agreement 
itself. It does not make any grand promises to aboriginal people 
and it does not make any new demands on the federal purse. Bill 
C-36 simply ensures that the government lives up to one of its 
commitments to aboriginal people. That is something that all 
Canadians and all members of the House would want to do.
<P>
	Bill C-36 will achieve four specific objectives. I would like to 
quickly review them for the House. First it provides, as intended 
by the agreement, that moneys owed under the Split Lake Cree 
agreement are not payable to the crown. This means these 
payments will not be considered Indian moneys under the Indian 
Act. This is very important for a couple of reasons. First, it 
means that the moneys paid under the Split Lake Cree agreement 
will be administered by a trustee at the direction of the First 
Nation, rather than by the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development.
<P>
	Not only does this reduce our administrative burden but it also 
gives the affected band much greater control over these moneys 
than it would have over Indian Act moneys. It also removes a 
potential source of friction between the Split Lake Cree and the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development over 
the management of its money. This is strictly in keeping with 
our objective of empowering First Nations to set their own 
destiny.
<P>
	The second thing Bill C-36 does is clarify the status of fee 
simple lands owed to the Split Lake Cree First Nation. 
Specifically, the legislation ensures, again as intended by this 
agreement, that 2,800 acres of provincial crown lands that are 
provided in fee simple title will not become special reserves 
under sections 35 and 36 of the Indian Act.
<P>
	The objective is to give the Split Lake Cree more control over 
the use and management of their lands, including any future 
potential development than would be possible if they were 
reserve lands. This stipulation means that the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development will not have the 
responsibility for these lands, along with the related costs and 
administrative burdens.
<P>
	Third, Bill C-36 ensures that individual band members can 
continue to make certain claims against Manitoba Hydro under 
the northern flood agreement. However, settlement or 
adjudication processes set out in the band specific agreement 
will have precedence over the process included in the northern 
flood agreement, which as I mentioned earlier, is cumbersome 
and costly.
<P>
	Bill C-36 ensures that the Government of Canada can utilize 
the Manitoba Arbitration Act when matters are in dispute under 
the northern flood agreement. Currently Canada is the only 
party to the agreement that does not have access to these 
arbitration mechanisms.
<P>
	I want to assure hon. members that Bill C-36 was developed 
in full consultation with the Split Lake Cree. The four northern 
flood agreement bands that have not yet signed settlement 
agreements will not be affected by the proposed legislation, 
which is band specific and deals only with the Split Lake Cree 
First Nation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5276"> 5276 </A></B>
<P>
	As well, the province of Manitoba and Manitoba Hydro 
support the bill, as it simply implements some provisions of an 
agreement that was signed three years ago. Hon. members 
should also be aware that the province of Manitoba is now in the 
process of drafting companion legislation to Bill C-36.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	The Split Lake Cree settlement agreement has provided an 
important new beginning for this First Nation. It has given them 
control over their own future and the resources needed to 
support their socioeconomic advancement.
<P>
	This House is being asked to help fulfil all of Canada's 
commitments under that important agreement. I urge hon. 
members to join me in supporting Bill C-36. In so doing we will 
send an important message to aboriginal people, a message of 
action, commitment, partnership and respect.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like by way of introduction to note that living conditions in the 
territories covered by this agreement, like those in many parts of 
Canada's North, are in no way comparable to those of South Sea 
islands. This needs emphasis, because in these territories the 
temperature can drop to 30 or 40 degrees below zero. It is often 
sunny, and you do have to wear your dark glasses, but bermuda 
shorts and sandals are not recommended. I have been there 
myself, and I can tell you that I was very happy to have my heavy 
parka, because even all bundled up I was very cold. So bermuda 
shorts were quite out of the question.
<P>
	So living conditions are very difficult there. The cost of living 
is very high, as well. That has to be borne in mind, because I 
think it's important to set the scene before we zero in on the bill, 
so that we understand why the bill is important. I was very 
surprised to find that three litres of milk, for example, cost about 
$11 there.
<P>
	I would also like to invite my colleagues to listen to me on 
Thursday afternoon, because I am going to table in this House a 
motion dealing with this very question of food distribution in 
the North, setting out and demonstrating clearly and in detail 
that it is in Canada's best interests to ensure that food is 
distributed more cheaply. Many of the families there pay up to 
100 per cent of their income for food alone. So not only is life 
hard, but the cost of living is extremely high.
<P>
	As for working conditions, in the rest of the country we talk 
about the unemployment rate; there they talk about the 
employment rate. The First Nations north of 60 are often said to 
have an employment rate of 20 per cent. While we are indignant 
because we have an unemployment rate of 20 per cent, they have 
an employment rate of 20 per cent, which means an 
unemployment rate of 80 per cent. So of course they are 
dependent on government social programs. There are certain 
things in this bill that I have reservations about,  but it is a step in 
the right direction, toward helping them regain control of their 
future.
<P>
	As is my custom, I would also like to put these people's past in 
perspective. It is, I believe, important for seeing how the new 
situation fits into the old. The name ``Cree'', like certain others, 
probably comes from a French word. When the Europeans came 
in contact with the Cree about 200 years ago, they called them 
the ``Cristinois''. The word ``Cree'' probably derives from that.
<P>
	Five hundred years ago the territory occupied by the Cree was 
extremely vast. It stretched from the eastern shore of James Bay 
along the rivers that run north into the Bay to the northern tip of 
Lake Winnipeg. Pottery has been found that marks the Crees' 
travels through that territory almost 1,000 years ago. Here again 
is evidence that the first occupants of this land were not 
Europeans at all but aboriginal inhabitants. Their traces go back 
1,000 years.
<P>
	By some estimates there were 15,000 people speaking Cree at 
that time, and today there are about 11,000. I will talk about that 
a little later. The plural form ``Crees'' sounds rather like the 
French word ``crise'', meaning crisis; I trust there is no 
connection, and I do not think there is.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Cree women were noted for their traditional embroidery, 
made with moose and reindeer hairs. Those are other traces they 
left in their territory.
<P>
	Having read up on the Cree, I can tell you that they were 
regarded by the first Europeans as spirited people, very 
attractive, good at getting along with others, great admirers of 
eloquence. They would certainly have been at home here. I do 
not know whether my hon. colleague has any Cree ancestors, but 
he is certainly eloquent. Native people as a general rule do 
appreciate eloquence, so he is in his element in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	I would now like to move quickly to the bill that is before us at 
this time. In 1977, Manitoba Hydro decided to flood 11,861 
acres of land belonging to the Cree, about 10 per cent, by the by, 
of their territory. The flooding completely destroyed the 
traditional trapping and hunting territory. Finally it was realized 
that an agreement had to be reached with the Cree.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, there are now 11,000 Cree living in 
five bands on the land in question. I will name them because I 
think we are coming to the nub of the difficulty; we will not be 
able to give the bill our full support and the question will have to 
be referred to committee. There are five bands involved. The 
agreement is with the Split Lake Cree First Nation but there are 
other First Nations affected by the agreement and they are the 
Cross Lake, the Nelson House, the Norway House and the York 
Factory First Nations. These four other First Nations will be 
indirectly affected by the bill. I think this point ought to be 
clarified.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5277"> 5277 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1977, an agreement was reached with the Northern Flood 
Committee. The Northern Flood Committee is made up of the 
five First Nations I just listed. Manitoba Hydro, the government 
of Canada and the Northern Flood Committee reached an 
agreement, but many matters were left unresolved in that 
agreement, among them the question of what form 
compensation for the flooded land would take. Perhaps 
employment of band members on hydroelectric projects is an 
option, because the bill before us today deals with compensation 
for which the government of Canada recognizes it has a 
responsibility as well as Manitoba Hydro.
<P>
	At the time, people said that compensation would be paid for 
the flooded land, but there were ambiguities. Among other 
questions, how many band members could work on 
hydroelectric projects? How much would it cost to implement 
the agreement? What about environmental monitoring? These 
were all questions that there was no time to deal with in any 
depth. The result was 174 claims for arbitration. It was evident 
that the agreement was far from clear and was contributing to 
increased numbers of claims. This led to new negotiations in 
1989. In July 1990, the four negotiators of the agreement 
relating to the flooding of land in northern Manitoba reached an 
agreement on settling the claims.
<P>
	Unfortunately, only one band accepted the negotiators' 
recommendations, and that was the Split Lake band. There are 
2,129 Cree registered as members of that band, but only 1,400 
live on the reserve itself. I will cover the salient points of the 
agreement. As I have said, only the Split Lake Cree are 
involved. Other agreements are under negotiation but none has 
yet been concluded. The objective is to settle with the Nelson 
House band in 1994, but as far as I could tell from discussions 
this morning with the Northern Flood Committee, not much 
progress has been made in the negotiations.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	The trouble is not the financial compensation; the trouble is 
the water level, because in the agreement itself, Manitoba Hydro 
is exonerated from any responsibility if the water flows fall 
below a certain level. There is the trouble: below a certain level.
<P>
	The Split Lake First Nation reached an agreement. However, 
the York Factory band, the other Indian band with direct access 
to the lake, is not included in that agreement, and its members 
are saying: ``Listen, we realize you have reached an agreement 
with the Split Lake First Nation. But if Manitoba Hydro intends 
to do anything that will affect the level of the lake and if it has an 
agreement with the Split Lake First Nation, that will have a 
direct effect on us''.
<P>
	There is the trouble. And yet-this is something noteworthy 
that I must point out-the Split Lake Cree have become very 
skilled in water cleanup. I find it important to note that, because 
with very traditional, very limited means, these people have 
managed to set up a small, inexpensive laboratory, and they are 
treating the lake water. It is well known that the water in that 
kind of lake contains a great deal of lead and that, if you want to 
clean it up, there certainly is a lot of environmental work 
involved.
<P>
	These people have become so skilled that they are setting up 
an exchange of information network with South American 
countries, including Chile, and I think that is noteworthy.
<P>
	The agreement also specifies which lands are to be transferred 
to Canada by Manitoba and set aside as reserve lands, some with 
flooding rights. All that is in the agreement; the legislation 
simply clarifies some of those provisions. Of course, resource 
management and environmental monitoring are a capstone of 
the agreement.
<P>
	As is the case in several agreements affecting the First 
Nations, -this is something that is of very great importance to 
them, as I keep repeating, because it is noteworthy-First 
Nations always attach a great deal of importance to the 
environment and consequently, where resource management is 
concerned and when a major player like Manitoba Hydro comes 
along, they often have to set up joint systems to accurately 
monitor the environmental effects. I think it is important that it 
be done that way.
<P>
	I now come to the compensation fund. The compensation fund 
is a fund of $20 million; a series of trust accounts will be set up 
and administered. That is important because, in practice, the 
money will not go directly into the Consolidated Revenue Fund 
for the Department of Indian Affairs, but will constitute a fund 
to be administered directly by the Cree.
<P>
	Of course, there were other negotiations, on consultation and 
arbitration jurisdictions, because an agreement is often subject 
to arbitration and disputes occur, and there must be systems that 
ensure that these disputes can be settled. Then, Canada and 
Manitoba are exonerated from any obligation or claim having to 
do with the Split Lake Cree under the agreement. So exoneration 
from obligations and claims is provided for.
<P>
	Bill C-36, I repeat, affects only the Split Lake First Nation. 
So, that means that the four other nations I mentioned earlier are 
not affected by this agreement, although, according to what we 
claim, according to the discussions we had with the main parties 
concerned, the bill has significant effects on the four other bands 
and that is why we have reservations about the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5278"> 5278 </A></B>
<P>
	There is one statement, contained in the usual explanatory 
notes accompanying a bill, that this version of the bill was 
developed in co-operation with the five bands. It would appear 
that this is not the case, because I have here a document signed 
by the four other chiefs saying that they did not have any part in 
this bill's being tabled in the House and were not adequately 
consulted.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Another odd thing in the explanatory notes accompanying the 
bill is that the English version states that there was consultation 
only with the Split Lake First Nation, while the French version 
states that all the bands were consulted. There seems to be an 
inconsistency there, and I think it would be worthwhile for the 
Committee on Aboriginal Affairs to consider the true 
background for this agreement.
<P>
	I mentioned the $20 million fund. I have the details about how 
this fund will be allocated. Of course, the Government of 
Canada and Manitoba Hydro are the ones paying into the fund. 
They have agreed on shared contributions to be spread out until 
1997.
<P>
	As well, at present, money is owing that came due in April 
1993 and April 1994. This money owing will be paid as soon as 
the bill is passed. So it is important to note that Canada and 
Manitoba Hydro have acknowledged their responsibility 
concerning the flooding during the early 1970s.
<P>
	Instead of going into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the 
money is to be put directly into a trust account set up for the 
Split Lake Cree. As I was just saying, the money will be 
transferred as soon as the Act comes into force. Lands will also 
be ceded to the Cree, and a provision in the Act states that they 
will not be special reserves. That is important to those people. 
Normally certain provisions of the Indian Act should apply but, 
at the express request of the Split Lake First Nation negotiators, 
they will not apply in this case.
<P>
	Provision has also been made for arbitration in the bill. Some 
systems are provided for, so that, in case of disagreement, the 
Cree and Manitoba Hydro can reach agreement under a system 
of arbitration.
<P>
	In conclusion, I think that, like most bills that have been 
tabled concerning aboriginal peoples, including Bills C-16, 
C-33 and C-34, this one is in fact a step in the right direction. 
The clear intent is freedom from guardianship of the aboriginal 
peoples; through this type of agreement, we are freeing 
ourselves from it in part, by providing compensation fees and by 
setting up committees.
<P>
	We plan to address the 80 per cent unemployment rate by 
giving the aboriginal peoples a chance to take charge of their 
lives. These are not programs applied from Ottawa. They are the 
ones in charge of certain aspects of jurisdiction. That is entirely 
in accordance with what the Bloc quÃ©bÃ©cois wanted: the 
dismantling of this legislation that is, to some extent, the 
equivalent of apartheid in North America.
<P>
	I must also give high marks to those who paved the way for 
this type of agreement. I must mention the James Bay 
Agreement, a very sophisticated, very advanced agreement in 
Quebec that, in my opinion, paved the way for the type of 
agreement we have before us today and the type of bill we are 
considering today. Quebec is very proud to say that we gave a 
great deal in compensation to the Cree and that the agreement 
and the legislation were reached in common agreement among 
the Cree, the Province of Quebec, and the Government of 
Canada. I think that is noteworthy. Quebec has something to be 
proud of. The agreements like the one we have before us today 
will be largely based on and similar to the James Bay 
Agreement.
<P>
	Lastly, I must tell you that the Bloc Quebecois will ask simply 
that the bill be referred to the Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, 
solely because of the lack of consultation. I do not think that we 
are in an emergency situation, as was the case in the Yukon, 
where people waited for 20 years and exerted tremendous 
pressure for the bill to be passed before the end of the session.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	Negotiations surrounding this compensation agreement have 
been underway since 1977. I do not think waiting a bit longer 
will be catastrophic. The Bloc Quebecois would be hard put to 
agree to the bill concerning the Split Lake Cree First Nation 
without taking into consideration its effect on the other four 
nations. Having examined the agreement and the scope of the 
bill, I think it does impact on the other nations. In my opinion, 
therefore, it would be entirely appropriate for the Committee on 
Aboriginal Affairs to closely assess the impact of this whole 
decision on the other four nations.
<P>
	Therefore, we will simply propose, after second reading, that 
the bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs for a closer study of its scope.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-36, the Split Lake 
Cree First Nation Flooded Land Act.
<P>
	This legislation comes as a result of a Manitoba hydro project 
initiated back in the 1940s. This project flooded 11,800 acres of 
land on five Indian band reserves. This economic development 
project flooded 10 per cent of the reserve lands with negative 
consequences for the bands at Split Lake, Cross Lake, Nelson 
House, Norway House and York Factory affecting their 
traditional activities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5279"> 5279 </A></B>
<P>
	Negotiations in the 1970s to deal with the effects of the Lake 
Winnipeg regulations and Churchill River diversion projects led 
to an economic development known as the northern flood 
agreement. In 1977 this agreement was signed by the five bands, 
Canada, Manitoba and Manitoba hydro. This agreement turned 
out to be unsatisfactory in the ensuing 10 years due to 
ambiguities in such areas as reserve land compensation and 
social aspects including employment and environmental issues.
<P>
	These uncertainties led to another agreement among the Split 
Lake Cree, Canada, Manitoba and Manitoba Hydro in June 
1992. This agreement calls for compensation in dollars and 
lands and other benefits. Specific agreements with the other four 
bands are in the course of negotiation.
<P>
	The Split Lake agreement requires the governments of 
Canada and Manitoba to recommend legislation implementing 
the agreement. That is why we are here.
<P>
	Bill C-36 provides that moneys payable to the Cree pursuant 
to an agreement by Canada, Manitoba, Manitoba Hydro and the 
Split Lake Cree dated June 24, 1982 are not paid to the federal 
government and then administered under the Indian Act, but 
rather to a band trust for administration.
<P>
	This bill also provides that the fee simple lands to be provided 
by the province to the Cree are not subject to becoming special 
reserves under the Indian Act. This act also provides that 
individual Cree as well as the band or its agents can bring certain 
claims against Manitoba Hydro. Manitoba arbitration law will 
apply in this regard.
<P>
	The approval of the 1977 and 1992 agreements are not the 
issue here, only the exemptions and rights under the provisions.
<P>
	I just mentioned that this is a unique situation concerning 
specific claims arising through unusual circumstances. Those 
circumstances are the flooding and therefore loss of reserve land 
for a hydro project.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	Background briefing provided by the department is sketchy in 
some areas and this gives rise to some questions. For example, 
my party is concerned with the administration of the trust fund. 
We would like to be sure that generally accepted accounting 
principles are followed and that there will be accountability.
<P>
	As well we ask if fee simple lands involved in a transfer 
replacement here are to be held by the band collectively. If they 
are, can they be sold and to whom? If they are sold, who will 
receive the proceeds from the sale? These are operative 
questions and we do not have the answers. Furthermore, 
concerning taxation it is unclear if the fee simple lands are 
subject to property taxation. It would be preferable to clear up 
these loose ends.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports legitimate native grievances and 
Bill C-36 addresses a grievance. We trust checks and balances 
were put in place in negotiations with the input and participation 
of the province of Manitoba and Manitoba Hydro.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We now move to the next 
stage of debate in which members will have 20 minutes for their 
interventions, followed by 10 minutes of questions or 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
address the House on Bill C-36, the Split Lake Cree First Nation 
Flooded Land Act. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak 
to this bill. I want to commend my colleague, the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, for introducing this 
legislation to the House.
<P>
	My hon. colleague spoke briefly about the history behind Bill 
C-36. I would like to expand on that because I think it is 
important for this House to understand how the northern flood 
agreement impacted on the five bands in the area.
<P>
	During the late 1960s and into the 1970s a number of projects 
were undertaken to divert the Churchill River in northern 
Manitoba to increase water flows to hydro stations on the 
Nelson River. These hydro stations were part of a scheme to 
support economic growth and development in the province. 
Indeed they have served their purpose and served it well.
<P>
	Today the generating stations on the Nelson River are making 
an important contribution to the Manitoba economy. But a price 
has been paid and once again, as has been the case all too often in 
the past, too much of the price was paid by aboriginal people, 
our aboriginal people in Manitoba.
<P>
	The Churchill River diversion projects flooded more than 
4,800 hectares of Indian reserve lands. This flooding deprived 
many aboriginal communities of their traditional fishing, 
gathering, hunting and trapping areas. The flooding also 
disrupted or destroyed traditional water transportation routes 
and shoreline access points. In many cases personal property 
and community infrastructure were damaged or destroyed.
<P>
	Five First Nations were affected by the flooding: Split Lake, 
Cross Lake, Nelson House, Norway House, and York Factory. 
Although these bands lost the benefits of flooded or damaged 
lands and resources that had supported them for many 
generations, they received few jobs or other benefits from these 
hydro projects.
<P>
	Action to compensate the affected bands was finally taken in 
1977 when the northern flood agreement was signed by the 
governments of Canada and Manitoba, Manitoba Hydro, and a 
committee representing the five bands. In addition to cash 
compensation this agreement contained provisions for land 
management, resource development, community infrastructure, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5280"> 5280 </A></B>
<P>
navigation, and so on. It also provided for the appointment of an  
arbitrator to deal with claims arising under the agreement.
<P>
	The implementation of this agreement has been rife with 
problems and created considerable difficulties for those 
aboriginal people involved in this process. It is safe to say that 
most parties had different expectations of the agreement. Few of 
these expectations have been fully met. Because of the vague 
wording on certain issues such as additions to reserve lands, 
employment of band members on the hydro projects, 
implementation costs and environmental monitoring could not 
be resolved.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	When it became clear that the northern flood agreement was 
not properly addressing these issues the five First Nations began 
of course to explore other options. This led to the negotiation of 
a proposed basis of settlement which has paved the way for band 
specific negotiations on the outstanding issues. Such an 
agreement was signed with the Split Lake Cree in June of 1992.
<P>
	This agreement is important to all parties. It addresses the 
outstanding obligations of the governments and Manitoba 
Hydro in this instance to the Split Lake Cree Band. It provides 
for additional compensation and, in doing so, releases the 
federal government from any further claims. Equally as 
important, it provides the people of the Split Lake Cree First 
Nation with the means and resources to take control of their own 
future.
<P>
	For example, this agreement ensures that the Split Lake Cree 
will have a more substantial and secure land base with which to 
pursue economic development. Over time the band will receive 
permits and fee simple title to more than 1,000 hectares of land 
throughout its traditional hunting grounds. As well, two new 
reserves will be established and a 46,000 square kilometre area 
will be co-managed by the band and the province of Manitoba.
<P>
	This agreement also provides for the establishment of a band 
controlled environmental monitoring agency. It gives the Split 
Lake Cree a strong voice in how their compensation moneys will 
be managed.
<P>
	For the information of hon. members, these moneys will be 
used to support economic and social development, to 
compensate the Split Lake Cree for the adverse effects of the 
flooding on their natural resource base and to remunerate the 
band and its members for damage to property and infrastructure.
<P>
	I want to assure hon. members that Bill C-36 in no way 
expands or diminishes the commitments made in this settlement 
agreement. It follows through on some of the provisions of this 
agreement.
<P>
	Let me reiterate what this bill sets out to do. It ensures that 
money under the Split Lake Cree First Nation agreement will not 
be considered Indian moneys and it will therefore be 
administered on its behalf by a trustee and not the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern  Development. I want to assure the 
hon. member from the Reform Party that standard accounting 
practices will be adhered to I am sure by the band.
<P>
	It is ensures that provincial crown lands provided in fee 
simple title will not become a special reserve under the Indian 
Act. It provides that any specific adjudication process that is set 
out in this band specific settlement agreement will take 
precedence over the processes set out in the northern flood 
agreement. It ensures that the Government of Canada can utilize 
the Manitoba Arbitration Act as do the other three parties in the 
northern flood agreement.
<P>
	I also want to remind hon. members that Bill C-36 will apply 
only to the Split Lake Cree Band. This is an important feature. It 
will not apply to the other northern flood agreement First 
Nations which have not yet negotiated band specific settlement 
agreements, and we wish to respect that.
<P>
	As the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
has said, the province of Manitoba is currently preparing 
companion legislation based on Bill C-36. This provincial 
legislation will further protect the interests of the Split Lake 
Cree First Nation.
<P>
	I want to thank the minister for confirming that consultations 
have been undertaken with the affected First Nation, with the 
provincial government and with Manitoba Hydro. This has 
resulted in a clear and concise bill that has the support of all 
parties to the Split Lake Cree settlement agreement.
<P>
	Finally, I want to join my hon. colleagues, the minister of 
Indian affairs and the parliamentary secretary to the minister, in 
urging quick approval of this bill. It will put into place the final 
elements of the implementation process for the Split Lake Cree 
agreement. It will demonstrate to the Split Lake Cree Nation, to 
First Nations across Canada and to all Canadians that this 
government is committed to implementing its lawful 
obligations to the aboriginal people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to make a direct comment on the words spoken by 
both the hon. member from the Bloc, two speakers previously, 
and the hon. member from the government House, a speaker 
before that.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to recognize the contribution made by the Split Lake 
Cree First Nation and indeed all our First Nations people and 
remind this House that earlier in this session it was a member of 
the Reform Party who spoke for and argued for the rich cultural 
heritage given to us by our First Nations people and that 
therefore we must retain lacrosse as our national sport.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5281"> 5281 </A></B>
<P>
	Not one member on the government side or from the Bloc 
spoke in recognition of this rich cultural heritage in our First 
Nations people.
<P>
	Perhaps it is time for all members in this House to stop 
making hurtful and unproductive comments and remarks in the 
House. I respectfully submit it is unparliamentary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Iftody:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member from the 
Reform Party for her comments. I and all members on this side 
of the House wish to have an intelligent and informed debate 
about matters as important as our first peoples in Canada, 
particularly when it comes to our obligations as a government to 
respect those rights and implement our fiduciary duties.
<P>
	I would assure the member that the respect that she is 
suggesting regarding ongoing discussions and issues is 
something that we want to adhere to. I do not believe for a 
moment that anyone in this House wishes to engage in any kind 
of language that is inflammatory or hurtful, to use her words. We 
are quite prepared to get down to business if the Reform Party 
members are to see that this bill gets through with quick and 
speedy passage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
with regard to the transfer of lands, is this land to be taxed in the 
usual manner as land held fee simple by anyone?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Iftody:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to inform the hon. member 
that I do not have the details in terms of the taxation provisions. 
Certainly this is a complicated matter, something that has been 
discussed in a number of research and white papers, discussion 
papers since the 1970s.
<P>
	It is a complicated matter, one that will have to be negotiated 
in some detail. I have not checked the exact provisions of the act 
on particular questions of taxation and resource based sharing 
agreements with the province or the federal government. I 
would of course agree that it is an important question and 
perhaps something that could be considered.
<P>
	I believe that the legislation is comprehensive, that these 
issues have been dealt with. Certainly I would support a sound 
tax base, as in any local government that both the hon. member 
and I work with at our community levels, that tax provisions for 
the ongoing support services for aboriginal communities are 
necessary and important.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
assured the speaker from the Reform Party that standard 
accounting practices would be used in the administration of the 
funds that are being transferred to the Split Lake Band.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member what basis he is using to give 
us those assurances. Is he using some wording in the agreement 
or the legislation to give us those assurances?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Iftody:</B> Mr. Speaker, to provide a clarification on the 
taxation side, I am quite sure there will be tax provisions, 
sufficient provisions. In answer to that specific question, as the 
hon. member knows full well, the aboriginal First Nations 
across this country have entered into agreements and 
undertakings with the Government of Canada on a number of 
specific kinds of initiatives.
<P>
	We have everything from health care services to education to 
transfers of welfare services to the bands. I would assure the 
hon. member that under almost all of those circumstances the 
bands have been practising good management and standard 
accounting practices that are reported at this time through 
specific kinds of agencies in the department of Indian affairs. I 
cannot see any reason why the band would not under these 
circumstances and local government control continue to follow 
those same practices of good government.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to speak briefly to Bill C-36.
<P>
	Generally as the House has heard our party supports the goals 
of this legislation, the transfer of the moneys in the agreement to 
the Split Lake Cree Nation rather than being held in trust by the 
department of Indian affairs. Certainly we do not argue with the 
compensation in land, replacing that land which was flooded 
under the hydro project.
<P>
	However, it appears the reopening of the northern flood 
agreement to accomplish these provisions considerably tops up 
the compensation provided in the northern flood agreement and 
enriches it considerably.
<P>
	There are a number of questions that need to be answered. As 
we heard before, the briefing material provided by the 
department on this particular piece of legislation is very vague 
and incomprehensive, and it is hard to find the answers to the 
questions we are looking for. Hopefully we will be able to 
accomplish that in committee.
<P>
	On a number of questions like the one of standard accounting 
practices, I do not really think it is reasonable to assume that 
because most other Indian bands across this country follow 
standard accounting practices it is reasonable to be able to 
assure all Canadians that standard accounting practices will be 
followed in this instance.
<P>
	There need to be provisions in the agreement, in the act, to 
provide for that specifically considering that the administration 
of these funds is removed from the auspices of the Department 
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and therefore also 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5282"> 5282 </A></B>
<P>
removed from the jurisdiction of the Auditor General. That 
specific concern should be addressed.
<P>
	One of my other concerns is why when all five bands were 
covered by the northern flood agreement are we now separating 
it out and dealing with one specific band instead of all five bands 
in a single piece of legislation or a single act to provide the same 
provisions for all the bands?
<P>
	As I said, generally we support the objectives of this bill and 
hopefully if those answers can be provided to us in committee in 
areas with which we are concerned I am sure we can provide 
support and help a speedy passage of this bill through the 
process to enactment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, since I do not 
think that the matter was raised, I have a question. When we 
dealt with the Americans concerning Hydro-QuÃ©bec, all 
compensation payments were made by Hydro-QuÃ©bec. In this 
matter, I would like to get confirmation that three quarters of the 
compensation are coming from the federal government, 
Manitoba Hydro paying the remaining quarter.
<P>
	I merely want some light shed on the subject. Is the federal 
government really paying three quarters and Manitoba Hydro 
and the Government of Manitoba a quarter? I would like the hon. 
member to confirm this to the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think this really goes to 
demonstrate the confusion and the lack of understanding of the 
provisions of this bill in the briefing material that we received.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	I certainly cannot answer the hon. member's question because 
I have not been able to make the same determination from the 
material provided. Hopefully those questions can be answered 
by others in committee or in the House, but I do not know the 
answer to the question.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, consideration of this bill has been 
long and very perplexing for many of us. We have dealt with it in 
the House and we have dealt with it at committee. We think there 
are still some very serious problems with it.
<P>
	Essentially I believe that two wrongs do not make a right. 
Many wrongs have been alleged in this bill. Right from the very 
start of the whole Pearson development program there has been 
an allegation of interference in the system of setting up the 
contract and awarding it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5283"> 5283 </A></B>
<P>
	There have been allegations of inappropriate lobby tactics and 
of crown princing, which is when something is designed so that 
only one prechosen person or group can qualify for it. There 
have also been allegations of generally improper government 
contacts in setting up this whole contract.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	A public hearing in this whole process would have been 
desirable. A public hearing could have laid to rest who was at 
fault, whether or not this was a bad deal in terms of the contract 
itself, and whether or not the entire process by which this was 
done was flawed. This was something we tried for. It was 
something the opposition also tried for, but we were not 
successful in getting the government to agree.
<P>
	What we got instead was the Nixon report which in effect was 
a non-report. We are not quite sure as the public is not sure 
exactly what the terms of reference were for Mr. Nixon. We are 
not sure exactly how he conducted this. We do know he did not 
call on several of the principals involved in this contract. We 
know he did not have anybody testify under oath. We know he 
did not make the information he received public. We know that 
the principals involved did not get an opportunity to refute any 
of the information he had gathered. He then made a 
recommendation to the government which interestingly 
coincided exactly with what the government planned to do.
<P>
	There should have been some process whereby all the people 
involved in this contract and the way it was set up and awarded 
would have made public the very things they were involved in.
<P>
	We did ask many of the principals and the lobbyists to attend 
meetings of the Standing Committee on Transport. 
Unfortunately, most of the principals and virtually all of the 
lobbyists declined to appear. We in the opposition attempted to 
put in a very long list of witnesses for the committee to subpoena 
but this was not done.
<P>
	After two attempts at getting the principal witnesses in and 
their choosing not to attend, the committee decided there was no 
need to go any further. On the basis of the fact that these people 
were invited to committee and they chose-and I do use that 
word very clearly-they chose not to attend, this puts to rest for 
all intents and purposes the whole question of whether it was a 
good deal and whether it was a flawed system by which this 
whole contract operated. They had the opportunity to come 
forward and expose where they thought the government was 
making a mistake and this is something they did not do.
<P>
	I am not aware of this in Canada but in the United States legal 
system there is a plea of no contest in addition to guilty or not 
guilty. No contest is when someone accuses you of something or 
alleges certain wrongdoings and you simply choose not to deny 
these and the court makes its decision accordingly.
<P>
	While we may not have that legal concept in Canada that is in 
essence what has occurred in Bill C-22. The people involved 
who say they have been wronged chose not to come to the 
committee meetings. The government, which says this was a 
very bad deal and a bad system, also chose not to go public and 
expose to Canadians what in effect was wrong with this deal. 
Since they have chosen to do this I am essentially prepared to go 
with that and say that fine, if the principals do not wish to 
contest that they were unfairly dealt with and the government 
chooses not to defend its decision, then so be it.
<P>
	It does leave one last aspect on which the government has to 
have some input and some knowledge of the process that is 
taking place. That is the process of the government arbitrarily 
choosing behind closed doors to pay or not to pay compensation 
to the players in this whole deal.
<P>
	Given that they were not prepared to come forward and defend 
themselves in terms of whether or not the government made a 
bad decision brings to question whether or not any 
compensation should in fact be paid. I am certainly more than 
willing to listen to the claims they might have. I proposed an 
amendment at committee stage so they could bring their claims 
to committee, but that did not pass.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Now we have a situation in which the minister can choose to 
either accept or reject claims. The public and for that matter 
even the committee in this House are not going to be privy to 
what those claims were, what the justification was or even to 
whom these claims are paid.
<P>
	As the master contract was to the Pearson Development 
Corporation it is quite possible the minister may choose to make 
the payment, if he makes one, to the Pearson Development 
Corporation. It can then disburse the funds within its own 
organization and we will never know who really got paid.
<P>
	This whole process is wrong. The government has now hired 
Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright is not running this whole program but he 
is collecting these claims to the government. They are then 
being turned over to auditors who examine them to see if they 
involve lobbyist fees or lost profits and a recommendation will 
flow from that to the minister. He can then choose to accept or 
reject the recommendation.
<P>
	Mr. Wright is being paid $1,000 a day on top of his expenses. I 
am not questioning whether or not Mr. Wright is worth that 
money. I am questioning why we hired Mr. Wright when the 
proper conduit for these claims and for these claimants to come 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5284"> 5284 </A></B>
<P>
forward and make their case should have been to the Standing 
Committee on Transport. That is the proper process.
<P>
	We are here to represent all of the people of Canada. In that 
way they can see that justice was done. That is the process we 
still need. That is why I brought forward this motion. I want it to 
go on record that it was originally drafted by the Bloc 
Quebecois. The Bloc brought forward the motion but held off in 
favour of the amendment I brought in. I bring it forward now 
because we are still seeking some way to keep this entire process 
visible and transparent.
<P>
	My amendment did not tie the minister to following our 
recommendations, only that we got to see and make those 
recommendations in the first place.
<P>
	I would like to close by simply suggesting that we have to do 
the right thing. A wrong process has been flowing through this 
program all the way. I will conclude by repeating what I said at 
the beginning of my speech: Two wrongs do not make a right.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-OrlÃ©ans):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport presented the 
committee's report to the House, following its consideration of 
Bill C-22. You will agree that the amendments proposed to this 
House hardly deal with the questions we have raised since the 
bill was tabled for first reading on April 13.
<P>
	What the report proposes to hon. members of this House boils 
down to three short recommendations. The first one is on Clause 
11, where we are asked to strike out line 36 on page 3 and 
substitute the following therefor: ``The Governor in Council 
may, etc.'' The second recommendation is to add, immediately 
after line 2, on page 4, the following: ``An order made by the 
Governor in Council under sub-section (1) shall be laid before 
the House of Commons not later than the fifth sitting day of the 
House of Commons after it is made''. And the third brief 
recommendation: ``A copy of the Minutes of Proceedings and 
Evidence, relating to this Bill-Issues 7, 8, 9 and 10-is 
tabled''.
<P>
	After the many hours we have spent working in the House of 
Commons and the Transport Committee, it is astonishing to read 
these recommendations by the committee of which I am a 
member, although a dissident one. Let me explain. On June 11, 
the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> gave a good summary of the drawbacks of 
this legislation and the problems encountered by the transport 
committee, except that it mistakenly reported, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Gouk for instance tried to have key Pearson players subpoenaed to testify 
before the committee after only seven witnesses showed up out of the 17 who 
were invited to appear. The Liberals killed that move.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With respect, the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> was wrong. It was the Bloc 
Quebecois member who made that request-in fact, yours 
truly-and I think the hon. member will agree that the 
attribution was erroneous. However, the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> was 
right when it said that the Liberals turned down my request. I 
submitted a list of 17 witnesses, 13 of whom declined to appear. 
I asked for three people to be subpoenaed: Otto Jelinek, Peter 
Couglin and Senator Leo Kolber. This motion was also defeated, 
thanks to the Liberal majority on the committee. These 
witnesses would have clarified the issues for the committee and, 
in that case, the report to the House would not have been the 
same.
<P>
	It was not a frivolous request on my part. These three people 
were closely linked to the process that awarded the contract to 
Pearson Development Corporation. In fact, Peter Couglin was 
president of Pearson Development Corporation, and he was not 
heard. Liberal Senator Leo Kolber, was, according to the 
<I>Financial Post Directory of Directors</I>, a director of Claridge. 
Canadians will recall that during the last election campaign, at 
his residence in Westmount, this valiant senator entertained 
guests such as Charles Bronfman, who is linked to the project, at 
a $1,000-a-plate dinner to hear the present Prime Minister who 
was then trying to get elected.
<P>
	I had also asked that Mr. Otto Jelinek, former Conservative 
minister, who now heads the Matthews Group branch 
responsible for Asia, be subpoenaed.
<P>
	Why did the Liberal members on the transport committee 
refuse my request? What were they afraid of? Why did 13 of the 
17 witnesses on the list presented by the Bloc Quebecois refuse 
to appear in front of the transport committee?
<P>
	Since the bill was introduced in the House on April 13 last, the 
opposition parties have been suggesting numerous amendments, 
making many requests, and demanding a royal commission of 
inquiry to get to the bottom of dealings the Prime Minister 
himself denounced during the election campaign. And yet, his 
Liberal government is turning down all our requests, either in 
committee or in the House of Commons. Democracy is all fine 
and good, Mr. Speaker, but the Liberal version of it is you talk 
and we decide.
<P>
	There is a limit to people's patience. I said it many times here, 
Canadians were expecting transparency from this government 
and all they have seen so far is scheming. The Conservatives and 
the Liberals are cast from the same mold.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5285"> 5285 </A></B>
<P>
	I am getting repetitive, you will say. Unfortunately people in 
Beauport-Montmorency-OrlÃ©ans, whom I am proud to 
represent, and I have lost faith in the present system.
<P>
	All the parties in this House are aware that the Pearson airport 
contract was awarded to the Pearson Development Corporation 
to benefit friends of the Conservative Party. The proof is that 
before the elections, the present Prime Minister promised to 
cancel the deal for the reasons I just mentioned. And yet, today, 
he refuses to get to the bottom of things and introduces a bill to 
compensate friends of the former regime. Could it be that he has 
the same friends and the same financial backers? I do not know, 
but it makes me wonder.
<P>
	We cannot allow the minister, with the approval of the 
Governor in Council, pursuant to clause 10 of the bill, to enter 
into agreements on behalf of Her Majesty to provide for the 
payment of such amounts as the minister considers appropriate 
in connection with the coming into force of the act, subject to the 
terms and conditions that the minister considers appropriate. As 
you can see, I quoted clause 10, which we find contentious. We 
cannot agree to that as long as this House does not have all the 
facts and does not know exactly how much the cancellation of 
the contract awarded to the Pearson Development Corporation 
to manage Pearson airport will cost taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Nor can we authorize the Governor in Council to enter into an 
agreement and simply lay it before the House not later than five 
days following the entering into the agreement. First of all, we 
have to know the truth. Considering that requests have been 
made and rejected, I feel compelled to propose a motion.
<P>
	I propose the following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-22 be amended by deleting Clause 10.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is a good reason for this motion. Given that, in 
committee, the minister told us that compensation could be nil, 
zero dollars, I tell you that, having played an active role in the 
work of the committee, I am not in a position to determine 
whether compensation, if granted, will be reasonable. With 
respect, I ask my colleagues in this House to support this motion 
and refuse to give the Minister of Transport a blank cheque.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This motion has indeed been received 
and judged to be in order, therefore the debate is on this motion 
and the other one.
<P>
	It is now the turn of a government member. I recognize the 
hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me take the opportunity in 
addressing the two amendments to make some comments 
vis-Ã -vis what both opposition members have indicated.
<P>
	I thank all members of the committee and the chairman 
specifically for the way he managed the affairs of the 
committee. I also thank the critics of both the Bloc Quebecois 
and the Reform Party for their co-operation on a very difficult 
issue. We understand that and their co-operation was necessary. 
However I must disagree with what has been said today. It is 
important for me to clarify some of the allegations made by both 
my friend from the Bloc and my friend from the Reform Party.
<P>
	The government wants to do the right thing and wants to do 
things right. Let us not forget that the bill before the House does 
what we promised to do during the election. One was a promise 
to review the Pearson privatization bill and appoint an arbitrator 
to take a look at the process and the deal to ensure the public 
interest was being protected. Mr. Nixon did that in an admirable 
fashion. He made a recommendation to the Prime Minister and 
the Prime Minister, as promised during the election, cancelled 
the Pearson deal after we became the government.
<P>
	This bill formally cancels a bill and an agreement signed 
behind closed doors by the former government two weeks before 
the election. We know the process was not right. We know the 
public interest was not being served. By virtue of Bill C-22 the 
government has formally cancelled the bill and the contract. We 
have honoured our commitment to the Canadian people who put 
their trust in the Liberal Party to do exactly that.
<P>
	Let it be very clear that we are not talking about a process 
whereby we are trying to hide behind the curtains or trying to do 
something behind closed doors. The agreement formally cancels 
the Pearson deal and puts Pearson back into the hands of the 
government. Therefore we are doing the right thing.
<P>
	The Reform Party said that two wrongs did not make a right. I 
would agree with that philosophy but there were not two wrongs. 
There was one wrong and that was the putting together of the 
deal by the former government. We know what happened to the 
former government. It was thrown out of office at election time 
because of the way it operated generally and because of the way 
it operated on that bill.
<P>
	To suggest that this bill and the conduct of this government 
are wrong is absolutely false. First our program and bill state 
that we will cancel the agreement, and that is what we are doing. 
Second, there will be no compensation paid, especially for 
lobbyist fees, profits and lost opportunities.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	The people who entered into the agreement were warned 
before the election not to sign it. The new government in waiting 
gave them notice not to sign it. They chose to sign two weeks 
before an election. They took their chances. However the bill 
specifically says that we will only pay out of pocket expenses. 
We will only pay invoices where there was value for work done. 
If they cannot prove there was value for work done by way of an  
invoice, they do not get any money. It may very well be. Clause 
10 says there may be no compensation unless they can prove that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5286"> 5286 </A></B>
<P>
they had a bona fide invoice prior to their signing the agreement 
or even after signing the agreement on October 7.
<P>
	I also want to talk about some allegations that were made here 
today. Government members on the committee did not stand in 
the way of calling witnesses. Of the 17 witnesses the Bloc and 
Reform parties put forward, government members had said to 
invite them all in to tell their story and shed some light on the 
process. We only objected to two witnesses because we felt they 
were doing the negotiating. Mr. Wright and Mr. Nixon had 
already given advice to the government. Government members 
agreed to invite every other witness to the committee on that list, 
including Mr. Coughlin, Mr. Cogler and Senator Kobler.
<P>
	We cannot force them to come to the committee if they do not 
want. Mr. Jelinek could not make it. Mr. Coughlin did not. I 
cannot remember whether or not former Prime Minister 
Campbell was invited. I do not know. A number of them chose 
not come before the committee.
<P>
	The Bloc critic suggested that we should subpoena them. I 
understand the subpoena method has not been used in the House 
of Commons since 1913 or 1930. It is a complicated process that 
would have taken months. The House of Commons would have 
to be involved; the Senate may have to be involved. It could have 
taken months.
<P>
	The Canadian people want us to put the matter to bed. They 
want us to cancel the agreement, get on with taking over Pearson 
and start to look at the opportunities with regard to Pearson. We 
have to formally cancel the contract. The bill does so.
<P>
	We have to move forward. The delaying tactics the Bloc has 
put forward such as subpoenas and public inquiries would have 
cost millions of dollars. They would have taken too much time 
and at the end of the day, guess what? We would have arrived at 
the same conclusion the government arrived at: to put a bill 
before the House to cancel the contract and negotiate fair 
compensation, whether or not there should be any 
compensation. I think we are at that stage.
<P>
	I want to get to the meat of the amendments put forward by the 
Reform Party and the Bloc. As far as transparency is concerned 
the Reform Party has suggested in its amendment that the 
minister shall cause to be laid before the House any agreement 
entered into. While that might sound innocent enough, let me 
suggest to the member who put it forward that it is redundant. 
There are checks and balances in the system that will lay 
transparency and accountability at the feet of the minister. 
Anything the minister pays-one nickel, one penny or one 
dollar-will be subject to public scrutiny of the auditor general. 
It will be subject to the public  accounts committee of which a 
Bloc member is the chair. After an agreement it could ask to 
review the agreement.
<P>
	The House of Commons indirectly deals with those matters. 
Government is transparent. Government will be subjected to the 
court of public opinion. Whether or not compensation is finally 
arrived at, if any, it will be in the court of public opinion. The 
process is transparent. Accountability is to the House and to the 
government, which in a democracy is exactly where it should be.
<P>
	For the Bloc to suggest by virtue of its amendment that no 
compensation should be paid whatsoever is wrong. We have said 
that there shall be no compensation for lost profits. There shall 
be no compensation for lobbyists. This was a signed agreement, 
maybe repugnant. We may not agree with the process. We may 
not even agree with the content but it was signed legally by a 
government and legally by another party.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Our clause 10 suggests that you have to show value for work. 
We will not pay more than one cent than we have to. That is what 
the Prime Minister had indicated and I think that is reasonable.
<P>
	We have international obligations. We have to be seen as 
being reasonable. This was a unique bill for some very unique 
circumstances. Never in the history of this country I believe has 
such a bill said either you negotiate, and you have 30 days to 
negotiate, and after proclamation you have 30 days thereafter or 
there shall be no compensation whatsoever.
<P>
	This government took bold action because it agreed that the 
process was flawed, that the public interest was not being served 
at all. We cancelled the Pearson deal and we said to those people 
``come to us with the legitimate invoices and we will only pay 
what we can and if you don't like what we think about what you 
should be paid there shall be no compensation whatsoever''.
<P>
	We need to get control of our destiny in terms of Pearson and 
this bill does it. Those amendments do nothing to this bill to 
improve it but in fact move to waste more of the taxpayers' 
money and cause us more time loss.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the member opposite.
<P>
	There is no doubt in the minds of members of the Reform 
Party that the government did the right thing by cancelling the 
Pearson airport deal. I am sure all members would agree with 
that.
<P>
	I think it is important to carry this one step further by way of 
this amendment. The minister has promised openness and 
transparency in finalizing the examination of any claims. We are 
simply asking that the government extend this transparency just 
one step further.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5287"> 5287 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no doubt in anybody's mind in this House I am sure 
that this was a deal that maybe contained the dirtiest part of 
politics in this country. It was a deal made between political 
friends of the past government. It was a deal made that probably 
epitomized the way that the Canadian public mistrusts the way 
business with government has been done in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Sleaze, all of it sleaze.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Sleaze, yes, Mr. Speaker, it was sleaze and no 
other word probably defines it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Tory sleaze.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Tory sleaze, yes. I thank the hon. member for 
helping me out in this presentation.
<P>
	All we in the Reform Party are doing is asking that the 
government just do one more small thing to try and restore the 
confidence of the Canadian voters and that is to let the settling of 
this agreement, the cancelling of this agreement, the wrap-up of 
it become one small bit more transparent.
<P>
	It is not our intention to hold this thing up for a length of time 
that would in fact cost millions of dollars as the hon. member 
opposite indicated. We simply want the government once it has 
determined if any, and I hope that there is none, claims are 
worthy to be considered for payment that it would simply 
present these claims either to the Standing Committee on 
Transport for examination by all three parties or to a special 
committee formed by the government, whatever the case. It 
would not entail a long period of time to get a recommendation 
from that committee.
<P>
	This is not a huge order in the scope of this. This is just one 
more small step that the government can take to toward 
restoring the confidence of the voters and in fulfilling its 
election promise of transparency and openness in the way the 
government does business.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	People have a lot of questions about the Pearson airport deal. 
They never want to see a deal like this again in this country. It is 
incumbent upon the government to consider laying all the facts 
before the public and the three parties in this House so that they 
can be examined in detail.
<P>
	We are not asking for a huge delay, just one more small 
opportunity to open this up so that the public will be able to see 
in a timely fashion and not wait until the Auditor General makes 
a report next year because the voting public wants to see this 
openness happening now. They want to see examples of it on a 
daily basis. That is what this amendment would do.
<P>
	It would actually help the government in power to get its 
message of openness across. I am surprised frankly that there is 
any opposition to this by the government. I urge those members 
to reconsider their position. Let us forget about partisan politics 
here and put the interests of the Canadian public first and 
foremost in everything we do. Let us do the right thing in this 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened attentively to the remarks being made by the opposition 
parties to Bill C-22, and in particular the amendments that have 
been put forward, especially by the Bloc member.
<P>
	Let me begin by saying I am privileged to be the chairman of 
the transport committee of the House. I congratulate members of 
the Reform and in particular the Bloc, especially the member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-OrlÃ©ans, who worked very hard and 
diligently in ensuring that the public interest was always held 
high and that work was being accomplished at committee with 
the valid, helpful suggestions being put forward by the Bloc 
member in requesting particular witnesses to appear before the 
committee.
<P>
	I will address the last question put to government by the 
Reform first. The hon. member referred to extending 
transparency, saying that he simply wants the government to 
determine that if any claims are made by third party interveners 
that a government committee examine the payments.
<P>
	We argued this in committee. It was made pretty clear by 
government members on the transport committee to the hon. 
member of the Reform Party, the Reform Party that by the way is 
against duplication of process, a Reform Party I believe that is 
against a waste of government members' time or the cost of 
doing government and the expense involved in having 
committee meetings. He wants to have the committee examine 
all these third party expenses being allocated by the government 
to the third parties.
<P>
	There is a process available now that will ensure that these 
payments are above board and that will be done by the Auditor 
General of this country. Why are we duplicating a process by a 
Reform request to take what are literally these mounds of third 
party receipts and requests for payments? Somebody laid down 
some gravel at the site or somebody made a contract for the 
outhouses to be placed on site. We have to consider all these 
things. They are legitimate third party payouts. That process is 
going on right now.
<P>
	Why do we want to take all that and look at it all over again 
when there will be an opportunity for the Auditor General to 
complete that work? Let us save the taxpayers of Canada some 
money, I say to the Reform. Let us save ourselves some time I 
say to the Reform.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5288"> 5288 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> The Auditor General 
is the third party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> My colleague from Broadview-Greenwood does 
bring up the fact that the Auditor General is an independent third 
party, not three different parties sitting down and looking at 
receipts. It is an independent third party. That being said, I hope 
the hon. member is satisfied with that answer.
<P>
	Getting back to the Bloc member, the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, he is the critic of course 
for transport for the Bloc. He is doing a solid job. He put forward 
the list of witnesses we needed at that committee. I am proud to 
say the committee said sure, bring them all on.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	There were a few exceptions like Mr. Nixon, for example.Mr. Nixon submitted his report. He is more than above board. He 
has given us a full documentation of all the facts that he could 
present to us. We dragged him to a committee and asked him the 
same questions that were answered in a report that he filed with 
our committee. Again, let us not waste the time of the House or 
of hon. members. Let us get to the job. Let us get to the bottom 
line. Let us look at the bottom line, which is that Canadians 
asked us to kill the deal. Canadians said it was a lousy deal, so 
just get to it.
<P>
	Pearson International Airport is an economic hub, a revenue 
generator, a very important link and element to transportation 
not only just in southern Ontario but in Canada. It is also an 
economic engine for Canada, aside from the fact that it happens 
to be an aviation hub.
<P>
	We have to ensure that everything that is going on at Pearson 
airport is being completed on time in a very time sensitive 
industry, the airline industry. We have to plan today for what 
that airline policy and industry is going to look like tomorrow. If 
we do not, we get caught with our pants down. We will. It has 
happened in the past under Tory administrations. But that will 
not happen with this government, with this party. That is not 
going to be allowed to happen. We are going to keep on top of it 
and we congratulate the Minister of Transport for keeping on top 
of it.
<P>
	There is no wishy-washy decision making here. What do 
Canadians want? They said it was a lousy deal. Fine. It is a lousy 
deal. ``Do you want us to kill it?''-yes. We killed the deal. 
Sensitivities are made because we do not want to pay lobbyists 
and we do not want to pay for potential profits of the future. 
Come on, potential future profits, give us a break.
<P>
	After all it was a legal document and the previous 
administration did sign and we have obligations to the 
international community. Therefore, we are sensitive enough to 
say: ``Look we are not going to go fully this way and say the deal 
is cut, finished, done, dry. You are all hung out to dry''. No, 
some legitimate third party claims been made and we are going 
to respond to them. We are not so insensitive as to not respond to 
those  claims. We are going to do that and they are going to be 
cross checked by the Auditor General an independent third 
party.
<P>
	The bottom line I suppose is that we invited all the witnesses 
to come forward, except for Mr. Nixon, for example. Let us go to 
the beginning.
<P>
	Seventeen names were requested by the Bloc. Except for two 
or three of those names they were all invited. Those individuals 
responded. Either they were out of the country or they were 
going through their third party legal counsel. I do not even want 
to remind the House of his name. I am seeing a smile and hearing 
laughter from the Reform. Some of this stuff that was brought 
forward by this legal counsel for some of these individuals was 
just ridiculous.
<P>
	However, they were all invited and either they were out of the 
country or were unable to attend and we said fine. Then there 
was a request for the chairman to invite them. The chairman 
invited a shortened list. Again those individuals said: ``Sorry, I 
am out of the country''. Can you imagine Jelinek or Corbeil, 
who were on the list, coming back? Ghosts from Tory 
administrations past. Who cares? I frankly do not give a damn 
what Jelinek or Corbeil have to say about this issue because it 
was a lousy deal. We cut the deal, we ended the deal and I really 
do not care about what they have to say.
<P>
	I was hoping as the non-partisan chairman that the committee 
would not allow individuals to what, come and clear their name? 
``Hey, I am really a good guy and it really was a good deal but the 
Liberals killed it''. I do not care. The committee did not care. In 
the end they were asked and then a subpoena was requested. The 
subpoena process is there. However, as we know and what 
Canadians might find of interest, in the rules of the House 
people can still turn down a subpoena request. Then the whole 
committee decides to take the subpoena request to the House and 
the House has to make the request. If the individual does not 
come then we send the Sergeant-at-Arms and off will go Gus to 
drag this individual in. The last time that full process was done 
was in 1913. The person still did not come and went to jail. That 
is the story behind that. It is a great story.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Canadians asked us and we, the Bloc and the Reform did our 
jobs. We asked the people to come. However, at some point you 
have to say enough is enough. We have asked three times and 
they have said: ``Sorry, I can't make it, I'm out of the country, et 
cetera''. The committee, in its wisdom, said: ``We know what 
the bottom line is and we have to get to it. We are not going to 
stretch this thing out until the fall and dig up some dirty laundry 
from some sleazy Tory deals of the past. We are doing the job 
that has to be done''. I congratulate the committee members for 
having done that job. I just hope that we get speedy passage of 
this bill.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, if we were to 
go looking for the truth, we would not find it in the mouths of the 
members across the way who last spoke.
<P>
	Along with my whip, I sat on the committee responsible-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I do not believe 
we on this side of the House attacked the truthfulness of any of 
the statements. If you want to review what the member just said, 
he is questioning the truth of our statements. I think that is 
unparliamentary. I seek your guidance whether it is a point of 
privilege and if the member should be required to withdraw 
those sad comments.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The parliamentary secretary raises the 
question. I was listening to the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I did not hear any unparliamentary words. I will look at the 
blues, but for the moment, I cannot say that I heard any words 
that are not acceptable in this House.
<P>
	In my opinion, what we have is a point of debate between the 
two speakers. I will review the blues and if there is a problem, I 
will get back to the House.
<P>
	Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Scratch my back and I will scratch yours. That is about the 
extent of what is currently happening between the Liberals and 
the Conservatives who once occupied these very same seats.
<P>
	Along with my whip, I attended the committee meeting at 
which time the question of potential witnesses was discussed. 
When the Pearson Airport bill was debated on second reading, 
the Liberals opposite told us: ``A royal commission of inquiry is 
unnecessary. You will have every opportunity to hear all the 
witnesses you want in committee''.
<P>
	When we got to committee stage, quite a squabble broke out. 
It was worse than selecting jurors for a trial. As soon as we 
mentioned the name of someone with ties, however remote, to 
the Liberal Party of Canada, our choice was rejected. At most, 
they agreed to let us hear from a few witnesses who were 
particularly well connected with the Conservatives. Even then, 
they could not provide us with a great deal of evidence. 
Therefore, when the members across the way claim that they 
agreed to all the witnesses we suggested, that is false.
<P>
	Now they are saying that we will have the opportunity to 
discuss the deal next year when the Auditor General of Canada 
releases his report.
<P>
	This calls to mind an infamous statement which the Prime 
Minister made during the Oka crisis. He said: ``So let the 
Indians escape. We will catch them later''. The Liberals appear 
to be using somewhat the same tactics in this case. They seem 
intent on playing the role of the blushing, innocent bride.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	And yet, in this morning's <I>Globe and Mail</I>, not the <I>Journal de 
MontrÃ©al</I>, Terence Corcoran reports the following: ``Not a shred 
of evidence has been produced to demonstrate that the Pearson 
contracts are anything but honest, legal, sound and desirable 
agreements to redevelop the airport''. This is not me talking, or 
the separatist <I>Journal de MontrÃ©al</I>, but a Toronto newspaper.
<P>
	This reporter also mentions that Torontonians are beginning 
to get fed up with the attitude of the Liberals. Furthermore, he 
states clearly that during the election campaign, the Liberals 
lied to the public. And they act like prima donnas. How sad, a 
contract that should not have been signed in the first place is 
going to be cancelled! Did they include a compensation clause 
when they cancelled the helicopter contract in Montreal? Did 
they include a little clause to make sure their friends were taken 
care of? No, there was none. These people are acting in bad 
faith.
<P>
	I call the people of Canada to witness and I tell them this: 
``See, people of Canada-and of Toronto in particular-how 
easily you are done out of $250 million, with a stroke of the pen 
in a transaction that will make the national deficit grow. You are 
being taken for a ride''. These people have been taking us for a 
ride for over 25 years, and now on the pretence of remedying, 
resolving a problem, they cancel a small contract which may not 
have been desirable, a contract we probably would not have 
signed. Now that their friends have been caught red-handed, 
they are trying to backtrack, they are putting on the brakes, so to 
speak. They are trying to spare as much as possible those of their 
buddies who meddled in this business. That is a disgrace!
<P>
	It is too bad that certain people, in Toronto in particular, may 
decide not to listen to what is being said on this side because it is 
coming from Bloc members, those mean separatists. 
Torontonians might then realize that we would rather get out of 
this confederation before the members opposite sink us and, by 
favouring their buddies, leave this country in such a sorry state 
that it will never be able to recover and that dismantling Canada 
will make sense after all, financially speaking. The bottom line 
is these people are not acting in good faith.
<P>
	When I first spoke on this bill, I asked what had led the 
government to introduce such a bill when we are dealing with a 
valid contract-I did not say legitimate, but valid as in legally 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5290"> 5290 </A></B>
<P>
signed- one which normally, based on rulings regularly made 
by the Supreme Court of Canada,  was binding on the 
government that was in office at the time and had the power to 
enter into contracts.
<P>
	In this morning's paper, Terence Corcoran also tells us: ``Any 
reading of Bill C-22 makes it amply clear the special law was 
crafted to avoid a legal expropriation process-and to avoid 
embarrassing the Liberals rather than Mr. Matthews''. He is one 
of the Tories involved. ``If there are any smoking guns at 
Pearson, they're in Liberal hands''.
<P>
	That is how highly the Liberal Party is regarded by the people 
in Toronto. I always knew when the leader of the party currently 
in power spoke of a chair, that the chair he had in mind was not 
of the kind that generally comes to mind. In the Prime Minister's 
mind, a chair can have two horizontal legs, a tilted seat, a 
horizontal back- That is the Prime Minister's idea of a chair. 
His perception must be contagious because I think the members 
of his Cabinet and his ministers' parliamentary secretaries, 
some of whom are sitting across from us, have had their minds 
warped by all kinds of inconsistencies or by the tendency to 
mislead everyone.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The Pearson contract is a disgusting scheme-I hope the term 
is strong enough-and they are taking at least $250 million out 
of the pockets of Canadians who have trouble making ends meet, 
in an effort to put out the fire.
<P>
	The smoking guns referred to in this morning's press review 
are what they are attempting to hide. Try to make our friends 
happy? Always. Scratch my back and I will scratch yours, and 
the Liberals are the best at this kind of scheme.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (TÃ©miscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not 
with joy in our hearts that we speak to a bill like this one, except 
that this afternoon's amendment would make it more 
reasonable.
<P>
	My colleagues talked about various provisions earlier, about 
the state of mind that prevailed at the transport committee. I 
would like to add a few things myself. Earlier I heard Liberal 
members refer to their commitment, to the fact that the people 
asked them to cancel the Pearson Airport contract signed by 
their Conservative predecessors on whom they put all the blame 
in this.
<P>
	The deeper we dig into this issue, the clearer things become. 
People are starting to dig deeper and that is why the government 
is in a hurry to get rid of this case once and for all to avoid 
getting to the bottom of things.
<P>
	Reference was made to witnesses who found it difficult to 
come before the transport committee. Obviously, it was not in 
their interest to shed light on this issue and the government did 
not want to do it either. Why? Because it is not true that only the 
Tories or those very close to them were to blame in this.
<P>
	On top of all this, the government found a way to compensate 
its friends and I do not think that was what the people asked for.	 The member for Hamilton West just said: ``The people asked us to destroy this agreement, to cancel it''. Except that the people never asked them to compensate their friends. They never as
<P>
	Yes, we were told that next year the Auditor General could 
look into it. As in all the other cases, it will be on a page in his 
report, denouncing some other anomalies buried among all the 
other scandals involving the management of public funds. It will 
make the news for a day, a few hours, and it will be drowned in 
other bad news, so the government will be able to get away with 
it and never have to face the people and be accountable.
<P>
	That is why the Reform Party's amendment at least suggests 
that these things should be more transparent, that this 
compensation should be submitted to the House and debated 
more publicly and openly.
<P>
	In this regard, this amendment is a second option. We would 
prefer not to have any compensation at all, especially with all 
the scheming-that is really the word for it-surrounding this 
whole contract and its cancellation. If we had gotten to the 
bottom of it or if someone some day is able to get to the bottom 
of this story, there would be a big political scandal that would 
greatly affect the credibility of the government and of all 
politicians who were here in the 1980s doing business that way.
<P>
	It is traditional in those parties. Whether it is the Liberals or 
the Conservatives, they act the same way and there are other 
agreements made in all sorts of other ways that the people 
mistrust, perhaps rightly, because when something is rotten in a 
deal, they refuse to clear it up.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	For once we would have had an opportunity to start over on a 
sound footing, to find the causes and sources of these problems, 
why politicians are subject to all sorts of-how should I say 
this?-temptations that make them do deals which are far from 
beneficial for everyone.
<P>
	The original idea behind all this of turning airport 
management over to the community was not necessarily bad. 
Except that when we see how it is done in practice, we realize 
that there are many problems. It now casts great doubt on the 
whole process of privatizing airports or conceding them to 
community corporations. Now everyone is on the defensive 
about the process. This is what I had to say regarding comments 
made a little earlier in the debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5291"> 5291 </A></B>
<P>
	As for the amendment tabled by the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency, it has the effect of abolishing clause 
10 of the bill. In order to put things in perspective, I will read 
clauses 9 and 10, and then explain why we propose that the latter 
be deleted. Clause 9 reads: ``No one is entitled to any 
compensation from Her Majesty in connection with the coming 
into force of this Act''. Good! That clause is just fine; the 
problem is clause 10, which says: ``If the Minister considers it 
appropriate to do so, the Minister may, with the approval of the 
Governor in Council, enter into agreements on behalf of Her 
Majesty to provide for the payment of such amounts as the 
Minister considers appropriate in connection with the coming 
into force of this Act, subject to the terms and conditions that the 
Minister considers appropriate''.
<P>
	That clause includes the expressions ``If the Minister 
considers it appropriate'' and ``the approval of the Governor in 
Council''. In other words, the cabinet could and will grant 
compensation, because the hon. member for Hamilton West said 
earlier that we must compensate those who incurred costs 
related to this project. Is it normal in the private sector to 
compensate people who, for all sorts of reasons, try to get a 
contract or work on a project, when their efforts are fruitless?
<P>
	Some hard thinking is in order because if we did that with 
every public contract, regardless of the outcome, we would open 
the door to an endless process. That clause is terrible and it sets a 
rather serious precedent. After all, no compensation was 
provided in other cases. In the case of the helicopter contract, 
for example, any compensation must be approved by cabinet and 
the Governor in Council. All this is very worrisome.
<P>
	Who does the government want to protect with this clause? 
You can be sure that some evidence will have to be produced, or 
that requests will have to be made by those who participated in 
the project. Two groups were involved: Claridge and Paxport. 
One is closely identified with friends of the Liberals, while the 
other has closer ties with the Conservatives. I am prepared to say 
that the requests made will not be reviewed in the same way, and 
this is why it would be appropriate to have a much more open 
and transparent process. I understand that some information is 
of a private nature. In reference to the public domain and 
compensation paid by taxpayers-these same taxpayers, whom 
the government must represent by cancelling the Pearson 
Airport contract, will have to pay compensation at the discretion 
of Cabinet. This is scandalous.
<P>
	We have seen some of these enemies with Claridge, 
specifically all of those people who are closely identified with 
the Liberal Party, such as Senator Kolber, Peter Coughlin, Herb 
Metcalfe and others. Those people are not identified with the 
Conservative Party, and a way will be found to compensate them 
in a bill. So I think the thrust of our amendment-in fact, I am 
convinced of this-is that there will be no question of 
compensation in a completely crooked process. Particularly 
since, in the  light of the work of the Committee-as my 
colleague mentioned earlier-it was never clearly demonstrated 
that compensation should be paid. The whole story is very 
nebulous, and there has been a refusal to get to the bottom of it.
<P>
	Behind the scenes, it is said in secret said that it will be 
possible to shed more light on all this and get the clarification 
necessary to provide appropriate compensation, although we 
know full well that lobbying fees are tax deductible anyway. 
This is the kind of thing that the public finds extremely 
irritating. It makes people mad to see this type of process, to see 
the government caught red-handed in the act of compensating 
its friends. We cannot subscribe to such a policy.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Why should Canadians and Quebecers pay compensation for a 
project that was poorly managed, a project that has now been 
cancelled and that some day will be back on the agenda. The 
public will have to pay, but it is not unlikely the same parties 
will resurface in some other form. They will be the big winners. 
Do not believe for one minute that these people will just 
disappear. They are still around. Do not be surprised if they 
become players in the same project, in some other 
configuration. They will find a way. No one in this group is 
going to be on the bread line tomorrow morning.
<P>
	I think it is important to tell the public that the government 
tried to sneak this bill through. At every stage, in committee, 
and at second and third reading, we had to go to the very limit of 
the time available for debate to show there were a number of 
discrepancies and give people with a more than casual interest 
more time to take a close look at what was happening. The 
government is trying to get this bill through the House in record 
time, and that alone is sufficient cause for concern, both for the 
public and the opposition parties. I hope the government will 
wake up and support the amendment that would delete clause 10 
of the bill.

security of marine transportation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa))</B> Mr. Speaker, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-38, an act to provide for the security of marine transportation, be 
referred forthwith to the Standing Committee on Transport.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of introducing 
into this House a bill to provide for the security of marine 
transportation known as the Marine Transportation Security 
Act.
<P>
	The introduction of this bill marks the first occasion on which 
the government is proposing to use the streamlined process 
agreed to by Parliament on February 7 of this year in order to 
expedite the consideration of bills while at the same time 
improving the parliamentary ability to scrutinize legislative 
proposals.
<P>
	Let me take this opportunity to thank all members of this 
House and all parties for allowing this bill to be the first under 
the new parliamentary reform package.
<P>
	The motion before us will send this bill directly to the 
Standing Committee on Transport before second reading. I trust 
members of all parties will support this proposal, as they have, 
and I am looking forward to the process as a good test of the new 
approach and the resolve of House members to make it work 
well.
<P>
	I would now like to turn to the rationale for the proposals 
before this House today. The Marine Transportation Security 
Act is intended to address a long standing omission in federal 
regulatory powers and in so doing better equip the government 
and the marine transportation industry to respond to any threat 
to the security of people, goods, vessels, ports and facilities in 
the Canadian maritime marine environment.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport has had the legal power to address 
security issues in civil aviation and rail transportation for some 
time. Conspicuous by its absence, however, is a similar power 
for the minister with respect to marine transportation in Canada.
<P>
	We must not be seduced into thinking that Canada or 
Canadian marine transportation is immune from terrorist 
threats. As members of the House know, the evidence available 
with respect to an Air India disaster, while not conclusive, 
indicates that the most likely cause of the tragedy was a bomb 
aboard the aircraft. While we have not had any similar incidents 
in the marine field, the experiences of other countries such as 
Greece have not been so fortunate.
<P>
	Apart from the tragic loss of life that occurred in two separate 
and totally unanticipated incidents, the effect on the Greek 
cruise shipping trade and tourism in general was to cause losses 
measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	As a result of these incidents, the International Maritime 
Organization, IMO, the United Nations agency that deals with 
maritime matters, passed a recommendation that cruise ships on 
international voyages carry out security screening of 
passengers, analogous to that at airports, together with a variety 
of other complementary measures.
<P>
	Canada was a strong supporter of that recommendation but 
has lacked the legislative authority to require the considerable 
cruise ship trade in Canada to comply. Attempts to achieve 
broad compliance with these measures on a voluntary basis have 
also been unsuccessful. These same IMO recommendations 
called on governments to review their national legislation to 
determine its adequacy.
<P>
	Having raised the issue of economic advantage, I would like 
at this point to turn briefly to the concerns that might arise with 
respect to how this initiative could affect our relationship with 
our trading partners and  competitors, in particular the United 
States, with whom we have so much maritime exchange.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5293"> 5293 </A></B>
<P>
	Members of the House should be aware that the U.S. 
government already possesses the legislative authority that this 
bill seeks for our government. Furthermore, the United States 
has signalled its intention to bring in a regulatory regime for 
cruise vessels and ports based on existing voluntary IMO 
standards.
<P>
	The U.S. is not the only western nation which has decided to 
respond in a vigorous manner. Greece has had a security regime 
for cruise vessels and ports in place for a number of years. The 
United Kingdom has enacted broad based legislation and many 
western European nations are actively pursuing a variety of 
initiatives to improve the security of their maritime 
transportation systems.
<P>
	The international standards are intended to be the basis for the 
major element of a Canadian regulatory regime. Even apart from 
the primary concern of protecting the travelling public, if we 
were to fail to provide for a level of security equivalent to that 
offered by the American industry, Canada could find itself in 
danger of losing traffic to American ports. That is big tourist 
business for Canada.
<P>
	More than 80 per cent of passengers in Canadian cruise trade 
are U.S. citizens. The value of this trade, which is expected to 
grow by more than 11 per cent on the west coast alone, already 
exceeds $500 million each and every year. The government has 
good reason to believe therefore that this legislation will in its 
long term effects be a positive enhancement to trade rather than 
an inhibitor.
<P>
	I am not suggesting that there is currently a threat against 
Canadian marine transportation. There is not, but this could 
change at any time. I am suggesting that it would be imprudent, 
even derelict, to fail to take basic, simple precautions on the 
grounds that we have no evidence of a direct threat today. If and 
when that threat does change, it is too late to start the long, 
deliberate process of developing legislation.
<P>
	In the immediate past one only has to recall the bombing of 
New York's World Trade Centre and the mortar attacks on 
Heathrow airport to understand how the dynamics of terrorist 
action can shift without warning.
<P>
	As I have pointed out, the ability to respond effectively to any 
possible acts of unlawful interference with marine 
transportation must start with the capability of the government 
to organize a response. It is thus the view of the government that 
the creation of a legal framework to provide for effective marine 
security is the initial priority in ensuring that Canada is well 
equipped to deal with security in the marine environment.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House that this bill, the Marine 
Transportation Security Act, provides the government only with 
enabling authority to create an appropriate regulatory regime, 
together with a  compliance monitoring and enforcement 
scheme backed by suitable sanctions.
<P>
	As such the bill, if and when enacted into law, will of itself 
impose no obligations on industry. Those will await the 
subsequent regulatory regimes. The bill is designed to apply to 
vessels, ports and marine facilities in Canada and to Canadian 
registered vessels anywhere, as well as to marine installations 
and structures, primarily drilling rigs and platforms on the 
continental shelf.
<P>
	As in the case of aviation, vessels and facilities under the 
authority of the Minister of National Defence are exempt from 
the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	Within this structure the government will have the authority 
to implement the necessary features of a security regime, many 
of which will be familiar to members of the House from air 
travel.
<P>
	These include the ability to screen passengers, their 
possessions and goods going aboard a ship, the ability to 
segregate passengers and goods which have been screened from 
those that have not, the capability to control entry to a ship, the 
authority to require identified staff to be trained with respect to 
security matters, and the ability to require contingency plans for 
such matters as the response to bomb threats to be developed and 
exercised.
<P>
	It is not the intent, however, that these powers be applied to 
their fullest extent under normal conditions. The situation does 
not warrant such action and the industry, understandably, given 
the current threat conditions, would oppose such action. The 
premium will be put on bringing in a framework which responds 
to Canadian requirements as they currently exist but with the 
flexibility to enhance them in the future should the threat 
change.
<P>
	These requirements are simply put and I anticipate that they 
will find strong support within the industry affected. They are 
three in number: first, making mandatory the existing 
international standards for passenger vessels and associated 
port facilities; second, ensuring that major cargo vessels and 
associated ports have in place basic security consistent with 
industry's best practices; and third, the implementation of a 
system of measures capable of being used by all regulated 
segments of the industry in the event of an increased threat 
situation.
<P>
	My colleagues and I are well aware that these are difficult 
financial times for the maritime industry in this country. We are 
confident that, except for some particular segments of the cruise 
vessel industry that fall significantly short of the existing 
international standards, the above objectives can be realized 
with little or no additional financial burden on the industry.
<P>
	The result will be a more secure marine transportation system 
that is appropriately protected from potential security incidents 
and with the ability to adjust to changing scenarios in an 
unstable global environment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5294"> 5294 </A></B>
<P>
	On the requirement for such legislation, industry has 
endorsed the principle that the Minister of Transport requires 
adequate legal authority to address legitimate security concerns.
<P>
	That being said, it is recognized that industry remains 
concerned given the current absence of an identifiable threat in 
Canadian waters about the requirement for regulations at this 
time and about the financial and operational implications of any 
regulatory framework.
<P>
	For this reason, any regulatory scheme which is developed 
must take into account three important factors. There must be 
full and active industry involvement in the development of these 
regulations to ensure that both government and industry are in 
agreement and that the resulting approach represents the least 
cost approach to achieving what is absolutely necessary.
<P>
	Second, the requirements must be based to the extent practical 
on performance standards as opposed to detailed technical 
specifications to provide the maximum flexibility to industry in 
meeting them, thus keeping costs again at a minimum.
<P>
	Third, requirements with respect to basic security must be 
predicated on the existing best practices of the industry, thereby 
ensuring that the degree of adjustment necessary to achieve 
compliance is again minimal.
<P>
	With these three precepts as the basis for regulatory 
development I am confident that we can arrive at a framework 
that stands the test of security while not inhibiting 
competitiveness or operational efficiency.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to summarize for members the 
proposals contained in Bill C-38, the Marine Transportation 
Security Act. The act is designed to provide enabling authority 
to the government, consistent with that already available for 
aviation and rail transportation, governing security in the 
marine transportation sector.
<P>
	This enabling authority would be used to create a regulatory 
regime providing for the security of cruise ship industry 
commensurate with that of the international community at large, 
and the United States in particular, thus ensuring the continual 
economic viability of the Canadian market.
<P>
	Regulatory requirements with respect to cargo vessels and 
ports would focus on codifying existing security practices and 
ensuring that planning is done to respond to possible changes in 
threat. In implementing this regime the Department of Transport 
will carry out detailed consultation with maritime interests in 
Canada on the need and the approach that should be taken 
hopefully during the summer.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I urge members to consider the additional security that this act 
will provide in Canadian marine transportation, security that is 
necessary for the protection of Canadians  and those who travel 
on the Canadian system as well as for the long term economic 
advantage of our industry.
<P>
	I ask members of all parties to consider this legislation 
carefully, both in the committee and in the House, with a view to 
offering any improvements they deem necessary to this 
important initiative and to support the final package which 
emerges from the parliamentary process.
<P>
	Finally, I return to my point of departure, to ask the members 
to join with me in making this an historic occasion in employing 
the new procedures which the House laboured long and hard to 
produce and supporting the motion to refer this bill to the 
Standing Committee on Transport before second reading.
<P>
	I look forward to working with all parties to ensure that this 
bill becomes reality some time in the fall.

something which is overdue and is largely housekeeping in

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-OrlÃ©ans):</B> Mr. Speaker, on June 
7, the government tabled in the House of Commons a bill to 
provide for the security of marine transportation, further to the 
security measures for cruise ships and ports prepared by the 
International Maritime Organization.
<P>
	Although the implementation of such measures was not 
compulsory, in 1993, the previous government ratified the IMO 
Convention and Protocol, following the drafting of an 
international convention and protocol on unlawful threats to 
marine transportation.
<P>
	Such action had become necessary as a result of acts of 
terrorism that occurred in the mid-eighties. Hon. members will 
recall what happened to the <I>Achille Lauro</I> and the <I>City of Porros</I> 
in the Mediterranean.
<P>
	This bill provides for a number of positive measures. First of 
all, it confers powers similar to those that apply to air and rail 
transportation; it reinforces the security of passengers and the 
marine transportation industry; and it gives the minister the 
authority to call for stricter security measures when 
circumstances warrant.
<P>
	Better security will above all help to keep the industry 
competitive with other countries that have taken similar 
measures. That is the strong point of this bill. As you know, we 
must make sure we remain competitive. Today, the United States 
has full authority over marine transportation security, and this 
year, it will implement IMO measures for cruise ships.
<P>
	We all know that the United States has the authority to issue 
advisories indicating that foreign ports are dangerous. It has 
very active inspection program abroad. Since 85 per cent of 
cruise ship passengers are U.S. citizens, we must ensure that 
these tourists are treated according to the same standards in 
Canada as they are in the United States. The Port of Vancouver, 
for instance, has an interest in developing its tourist industry as 
does the Port of Quebec City, which receives increasing 
numbers of foreign tourists.
<P>
	We cannot run the risk of losing money in an industry that is 
worth $500 million today. An interesting point is that this 
legislation will cover ships, ports and marine facilities in 
Canada and ships registered in Canada anywhere else in the 
world.
<P>
	Perhaps this would be a good time to urge Canadian 
shipowners to register their ships in Canada and to fly the 
Canadian flag. Above all, the Government of Canada which 
owns Marine Atlantic, among other things, must be called to 
order and it must display its pride by flying the Canadian flag 
and hiring Canadian 
<P>

<P>
sailors. This would mean work for many sailors and would help 
us to ease the tax burden of our citizens.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the scope of Bill C-38 extends to 
drilling facilities and platforms.
<P>
	Several provisions in this bill give the government the 
authority to develop measures respecting the security of 
maritime transportation. The enactment also provides, when the 
regulations are contravened, for large fines and imprisonment in 
the case of an individual and for hefty fines in the case of a 
corporation.
<P>
	It should be noted that the cost to the industry of 
implementing these provisions is acceptable. Vessels and ports 
which already comply with IMO measures will incur no costs in 
respect of this enactment, while those not already in compliance 
with these measures will incur costs of roughly $150,000. The 
cost to the government of implementing security and inspection 
measures and of enforcing the regulations will also be negligible 
since inspection resources currently handling transportation 
security will be reassigned.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	While I did say that the costs involved were acceptable to the 
industry, I would like to temper my remarks somewhat. Pursuant 
to the new rules, this bill will be referred to a committee and I 
hope that my colleague and chairman of the transport 
committee, the hon. member for Hamilton West, will have the 
presence of mind to invite representatives of the industry to 
appear so that they can reassure us that this bill poses no major 
inconveniences or does not impede the development of ports in 
Quebec or in Canada as far as the cruise ship industry is 
concerned. Therefore, when I say that the costs involved are 
acceptable, I mean they are, subject to review by the parties 
concerned.
<P>
	If the legislation passes, as I hope it will, the government will 
first have to ensure that the regulations provided for in the bill 
are drafted as soon as possible, taking care to duly consult with 
the industry and government departments. Many have already 
voiced their support for this bill and want to participate in the 
drafting of the regulations to ensure that they are consistent with 
the high standards of their members.
<P>
	Second, it is important that the government move to have the 
legislation take effect as soon as possible. Failure to do so could 
result in the following problems: a lack of appropriate 
regulatory authority, a vulnerable transportation system and 
adverse effects on competition.
<P>
	For this reason, our party supports the fast-track approach 
and agrees with the spirit of the bill.
<P>
	In conclusion, as I mentioned, the official opposition supports 
the bill, on condition that regulations are adopted after the 
interested parties have been consulted and that the legislation 
and regulations take effect as soon as possible.

	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, in an 
ever-changing world where money is tight, we must make it our 
duty to expend boundless imagination in discharging our 
responsibilities towards Canadians.
<P>
	The loan guarantee program put forward by our government 
flows from a lengthy analysis of the requirements of the film and 
video industry and is a clear indication of our commitment to 
dole Canadian taxpayers money out sparingly to maximize their 
return on investment.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	A fledgling industry 20 years ago, the Canadian independent 
film and video industry has grown into a major employer which 
produces high quality entertainment programs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5297"> 5297 </A></B>
<P>
	The economic significance of the film and video industry is 
beyond doubt. Since 1980, 700 per cent growth was recorded in 
this industry, with a similar growth in employment, as shown by 
1993 figures from Statistics Canada according to which the 
industry provided over 51,600 direct and indirect jobs, which 
translated in terms of direct and indirect benefits, into a 
contribution to the gross domestic product in excess of $1.8 
billion.
<P>
	The growth of the film and video industry is linked mostly to 
the federal government's support policies and programs in this 
area. The federal government has a dual responsibility. First, not 
to endanger 20 years of constant efforts to develop an industry 
whose growth prospects are not in doubt and second, to continue 
to act in an efficient manner by taking budget constraints into 
account.
<P>
	The Loan Guarantee Program proposed by the government 
meets these criteria for it is fiscally neutral for the government 
while providing easier access to interim financing for television 
programs and films produced by Canadian companies.
<P>
	Historically, Canadian financial institutions did not help 
finance the film and video industry mainly because of their 
unfamiliarity with the industry and its commercial practices. We 
think a $25 million Loan Guarantee Program could generate, if 
used to its full potential, up to $143 million in film and video 
production activity and up to $300 in the Canadian economy as a 
whole.
<P>
	The Loan Guarantee Program proposed today demonstrates 
the government's commitment to protecting Canadian cultural 
sovereignty while promoting optimum use of Telefilm Canada 
resources and expertise. It also meets specific needs by 
optimizing the performance of available resources and fostering 
a promising business partnership.
<P>
	It also shows our confidence in the Canadian film and video 
industry and its entrepreneurs who, as we know, support our 
initiative. It is through this type of measure that the government 
intends to promote the development of a growing industry in the 
best interests of Canadian culture and unity. We think this 
program will be successful and are even considering extending 
the concept to other cultural industries.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think it has been agreed that in the 
absence of the Official Opposition spokesperson, Reform 
members would have the floor.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to oppose Bill C-31. In my judgment Bill C-31 simply 
perpetuates the myth that without massive government 
interference there would be no culture in Canada. That is 
something my party does not believe.
<P>
	When we look at all the agencies that the Canadian 
government subsidizes, from CBC to the National Film Board, 
to Telefilm, to the Canada Council, it amounts to well over two 
billion in taxpayer dollars a year. This money is spent on those 
things bureaucrats in this country identify as culture.
<P>
	I have to wonder what would happen if we removed this 
massive subsidization and allowed that $2 billion plus to stay in 
the hands of taxpayers and allow them to use that money to 
spend on the things they identified as culture.
<P>
	Initially we would have a smaller cultural industry but it 
would be based on quality and not quantity. It would reward and 
recognize merit. When we walked into a bookstore and went to 
the Canadiana section we would be assured that whoever 
published any of the Canadian books had put their money into it 
feeling they were probably going to get money back out of it 
because it is a good book and not because they were being 
subsidized by the government to make sure it got on the shelves.
<P>
	Consumers would like to know when they go into a bookstore 
that the books they are going to buy are there because they are 
good books and not because some government bureaucrat 
somewhere decreed this is a good way to spend taxpayers' 
money.
<P>
	By subsidizing Canadian culture in all the different areas we 
send a message that our government does not feel our artists in 
all the different aspects of the art community can compete with 
artists from around the world. Why else would we be 
subsidizing them if the government is not sending that implicit 
message?
<P>
	I have a great deal of concern about allowing bureaucrats to 
decide what pieces of culture are worthy of subsidization. In a 
free country and a free market generally speaking consumers are 
allowed to make those judgments and I think they make very 
good ones. They can decide what constitutes good art. They can 
decide what they want to purchase based on what interests them.
<P>
	In Canada we let bureaucrats make those decisions many 
times. We let them hand out grants to all kinds of groups, like 
Buddies in Bad Times. This is a group that has been in the news 
recently. It is a homosexual theatre group and a very radically 
intolerant one. Recently when a Toronto <I>Sun</I> columnist, 
Christina Blizzard, questioned whether $377,000 in Canada 
Council grants should go toward this group, not only did this 
group get very upset and take her to the media board in the 
province of Ontario, to the newspaper board, not only did it 
abuse her in the media, it also produced a play called ``Dinner 
with Christina'' in which it advocated raping her.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5298"> 5298 </A></B>
<P>
	That is complete garbage. To me it speaks volumes about the 
wisdom of some of the bureaucrats in this country who make 
those decisions. We do not have to stop there. There is a list as 
long as your arm of grants that go to groups like this.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Give us a federal example.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> I will give a federal example. Canada Council 
recently spent money handing out a grant to a project called ``A 
Linguistic History of Swahili''. Another grant went out to 
something called ``Anatomy of a Seance''. Another grant went 
out to translate a book called <I>I Lost it All in Montreal</I>. Another 
went out to publish <I>Poems Released on a Nuclear Wind</I>. Of 
course the big one, there was $3.3 million that went into that 
famous museum in Montreal, the Montreal Museum of Humour.
<P>
	I would argue that if any taxpayer walked through the 
National Gallery through some of the huge rooms, some as big 
as a high school gymnasium, and looked around and in one 
corner saw a box of Brillo pads stacked up to the roof they would 
question whether that was a good use of their public money. 
Frankly, I did. I think it is ridiculous. Taxpayers would make a 
lot better choices if that money were left in their pockets to make 
decisions about what is art.
<P>
	If they walked into another room a saw a bunch of bricks 
laying on the floor and somebody from the National Gallery told 
them that was art, they would say that is crazy. If they walked 
into another room and saw 256 pieces of felt laying on the floor 
they would probably conclude that they were renovating, 
putting in a new carpet. In fact, that is what they call art. That is 
ridiculous.
<P>
	Any time we start handing out more and more money to the 
government so that it can then decide who should get that money 
based on its determination of what constitutes art, it is 
absolutely ridiculous.
<P>
	We have to look at the situation with the CBC. Here we are 
again rewarding failure. Not only are its ratings dropping, not 
only is it programming all kinds of American programs 
throughout the day, in light of the fact it is undergoing a review 
of its programming right now, here we are suggesting it should 
be granted the right to borrow money.
<P>
	That is exactly what we are considering doing with Telefilm 
as well. That is a crazy idea. I do not think we need to get into 
that. We should let the taxpayers decide. Does the government 
not have faith in the ability of taxpayers to decide what 
constitutes art? Why not leave the money in their pockets?
<P>
	Let me conclude by suggesting a great hoax is being 
perpetrated by bureaucrats in this country, by the government 
and by so-called artists. They are telling people: ``If you give us 
money, we will give you art''. They produce things they indeed 
call art. In the judgment of most Canadians I would argue this is 
not art. In fact in many cases it is garbage, absolute garbage.
<P>
	Let us leave that $2 billion plus in the hands of the taxpayers. 
Let us not support those kinds of things any more. Let us allow 
the people of Canada to make those decisions themselves.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is no debate. The first three 
speakers have a free shot at the hon. parliamentary secretary. No 
questions or comments.
<P>
	Because of a reversal-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-in the order of speakers, it is now the Official Opposition's 
turn. The hon. member for Richelieu has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would say 
to the hon. member that we will be pleased to hear him right 
after Question Period, even though we know that his objectivity 
is sometimes questionable; however, that does not stop me from 
being on very good terms with him, as I have been for a long 
time.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois supports this bill. As I said on second 
reading, it is the result of three years of negotiations. It began 
under the Conservative government and continued under the 
present government between the Department of 
Communications, Treasury Board, the Department of Finance 
and Telefilm Canada. It finally meets the expectations of the 
creative community. It is pretty much what the stakeholders 
concerned wanted.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I will be very brief in explaining the support that we want to 
give because I think this is not the time for speeches. The parties 
gave their positions very clearly on second reading. We are at 
last finalizing this issue and ensuring that Telefilm Canada will 
have the wherewithal to support the creative artists but not to 
stray from the goals for which it was created.
<P>
	Remember that its purpose is to help not only more 
commercial productions but also more specialized creative 
work with narrower appeal that still falls within the principles 
which the House of Commons defended when Telefilm Canada 
was founded.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5299"> 5299 </A></B>
<P>
	At this point, I have only one question about this bill, namely 
that this very important aspect of more limited and specialized 
creative work is overlooked and too much emphasis is put on 
subsidizing big commercial projects and that with the funds 
made available by this borrowing authority, the part that is too 
commercial could be favoured.
<P>
	I would point out that Quebec's SOGIC worked in the same 
way, trying to promote equity between commercial and 
documentary productions. I hope that Telefilm Canada will take 
the same course as Quebec's SOGIC. Bill C-31 will be a healing 
balm for producers in Quebec and Canada who are waiting for 
the government to bring forth another essential measure for the 
survival of this industry.
<P>
	As I said last time in my speech, this measure is a tax credit to 
replace the current tax shelter for depreciation. A tax credit 
would directly and totally benefit Canadian production of films 
and videos, unlike the present tax shelter.
<P>
	It is estimated that only 7 per cent of the cost of this tax 
measure is reinvested in actual Canadian production and the tax 
credit requires no investment of additional funds. So, I urge the 
government to take heed of this request concerning the tax 
credit. It would not cost anything, it would not require any 
additional funds nor any guarantee, and it would ensure that this 
change concerning support to Telefilm Canada will provide a lot 
of funds to a corporation which represents us so well and which 
produces a lot of quality work. As I said earlier, we hope that it 
will not neglect the type of documentaries which it has produced 
so far; indeed, it might be tempted to get away from such 
production, given the measures announced today.
<P>
	The tax credit, which was created in 1990, is a real success 
story and it truly serves the interests of the Quebec film 
industry. Once again, I want to congratulate the minister 
responsible and the government for dealing promptly with an 
issue which had been pending for three years. Instead of creating 
a new committee, as is so often the case, the government started 
with the solid base already in place and added the last element to 
provide a concrete solution which meets the expectations of 
Telefilm Canada.
<P>
	We should have proceeded like this with several other issues. 
We could, of course, find other possible amendments. However, 
I will conclude by reiterating our support and by hoping that this 
bill will be passed as quickly as possible. For this reason, I think 
that once the three speakers representing the government, the 
Reform Party and the Bloc are finished, there will be no point in 
discussing this legislation any longer.
<P>
	The people at Telefilm Canada expect a concrete measure 
before we adjourn for the summer, since this will have an impact 
on their activities in September. Consequently, we should deal 
with this bill right away.
<P>
	I will be the last speaker for the Bloc Quebecois regarding this 
issue. I think that the Reform Party will also conclude, and we 
expect the government to do the same, so that we can proceed 
with the vote as quickly as possible.
<P>
	Once again, I wish luck to Telefilm Canada and I hope that the 
government will take into consideration this aspect of the tax 
credit which is really a success with the Quebec corporation 
SOGIC.

integral to Reform Party policy. This principle must apply to the 
family in Canada. In particular single parent families are hard 
pressed to make ends meet. According to yesterday's CTV 
Angus Reid poll only a third receive the support payments 
ordered by the courts.
<P>
	To ensure that single parents receive adequate provision for 
their needs we recommend two courses of action. First, we 
recommend a study to determine the real cost of raising a child. 
This study could be used by the courts to more accurately 
determine the level of support required.
<P>
	Second, we advocate that stronger action be taken against 
parents who are delinquent on their support payments. 
Government ought to provide more effective legal tools to 
single parents that would help them recover missing support 
payments anywhere in Canada, not just provincially.
<P>
	Reformers are sensitive to the needs of single parent families 
across our nation and call upon the government to respond to 
their needs fairly and consistently.

	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, Julian 
Waites was a boy who found himself in trouble with the law. He 
faced over 40 charges in youth court, mostly theft related. He 
played the Young Offenders Act like a harp knowing precisely 
which strings he could pull and when.
<P>
	His mother, Mary, desperately wanted the courts to punish her 
son so he would be deterred from repeat offending. She wanted 
the courts to give him a jail sentence, send him to work camps, 
anything that would make the young boy think twice about 
repeat offending.
<P>
	Julian was incorrigible. He resisted help from his family and 
the law allowed him to continue his life of crime. Today Julian 
Waites faces charges of sexual assault, assault with a weapon, 
and uttering threats.
<P>
	Mrs. Waites largely blames the inadequacies of the Young 
Offenders Act for her son's current troubles. He was not 
punished for the crimes he committed as a youth and his mother 
says the Young Offenders Act actually encouraged him to repeat 
offend. Mrs. Waites is convinced that a tougher Young 
Offenders Act might have given her son a chance at a normal 
life.

ensuring that Canadians will live without fear for their personal 
safety.

<P>
	The red book has outlined many measures which will ensure 
our safety and security. A tough line on violence, stricter 
penalties, the reform of the Young Offenders Act and further 
control of violent pornography were all included in our 
campaign promises.
<P>
	The government must continue to take the lead on addressing 
root causes of crime. Unemployment, hopelessness, the 
breakdown of families and the use of illegal drugs all contribute 
to a more violent and unsafe society.
<P>
	Canadians are a non-violent and peace loving people. We 
must continue to respond with comprehensive, effective 
approaches to the issues of crime and punishment.

regarding further regulations for rifles and guns. There is a great 
deal of misinformation being circulated with regard to the 
government's intention.
<P>
	The government is considering options that will address the 
issue in a fair and responsible matter. These include tough jail 
sentences for gun related crimes, increased border controls to 
combat smuggling, a universal firearms registration system to 
track gun ownership, additional restrictions on handguns, a 
possible ban on military assault weapons and tighter controls on 
the sale of ammunition.
<P>
	I understand the government does not want to ban ordinary 
rifles and shotguns owned by law-abiding citizens. In fact the 
Minister of Justice stated in the House last week that he had no

<P>
	Last December Christina Blizzard of the <I>Sun</I> wrote a story 
questioning whether public funding should be going to Buddies 
in Bad Times Theatre in Toronto, a group which advertises live 
sex acts and violent sado-masochistic seminars.
<P>
	The actors reacted by encouraging members to spit on Ms.

Times was made possible by $60,000 a year in Canada Council

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government has asked Canadian nationals 
to leave Haiti by June 25, in other words, before air 
communications between Canada and Haiti are suspended. 
However, we still do not know Ottawa's position on the use of 
military intervention to drive out the junta and allow the return 
of president Aristide.
<P>
	I want to ask the Minister of Foreign Affairs to indicate 
whether Canada is among the countries that are putting pressure 
on the United States to send a force for military intervention in 
Haiti.
<P>
	<B>Hon. AndrÃ© Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition asked a similar question 
some time ago, when he spoke out in favour of military 
intervention. We prefer a peaceful solution. We want to avoid 
killing people, if at all possible. There has already been too 
much of that in Haiti. We hope that we will be able to make the 
military listen to reason and persuade them to leave and let 
president Aristide come back to his country, but without 
endangering the lives of the Haitian people who are now very 
vulnerable, in a situation that could degenerate into armed 
conflict.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government's efforts to bring about a peaceful 
solution in Haiti are not without merit, but we must remember 
that what is happening there today is not very peaceful and that 
in some situations, we must know how to act effectively with the 
means at our disposal.
<P>
	I want to ask the minister why he still believes that reinforcing 
trade sanctions could bring about a peaceful solution to the 
Haitian question, since so far, strengthening trading sanctions 
has had no effect at all on the military junta.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. AndrÃ© Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition for 
supporting the government's action which is aimed at 
convincing the military that it is in the interests of the Haitian 
people and in their own interests to yield to president Aristide 
and to do so as soon as possible.
<P>
	I am encouraged by the energetic action taken by the 
Organization for American States which unanimously embraced 
the position proposed by the personal representative of the 
Secretary General of the UN, Mr. Caputo. Second, I am also 
encouraged by the decision of the authorities of the Dominican 
Republic to establish a more secure and effective system to 
control the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
<P>
	On that basis, I believe that the total embargo will be effective 
and will convince the military to yield.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one can decide on a strategy and hope it will succeed, 
but one must also realize the strategy may fail and plan 
accordingly.
<P>
	In this case, the military junta has not budged so far. In fact, it 
has hardened its position and become out and out arrogant, 
witness the recent inauguration of a puppet president to head a 
puppet government.
<P>
	I want to ask the minister whether all this hesitation on his 
part merely means that he will probably wait until the Haitian 
president's term is up and then realize that nothing more can be 
done and that all these measures were strictly dilatory measures.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. AndrÃ© Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canada has supported unequivocally President 
Aristide. We are working with other countries, particularly the 
four friends of Haiti, in order to bring about as quickly as 
possible the return of President Aristide. I think the Leader of 
the Opposition knows this very well. Whatever the implications 
are, they are unfounded.
<P>
	It is quite clear that in co-operation with others, particularly 
France, the United States and Venezuela, we are hoping to 
achieve total sanctions, a policy that will bring about the 
departure of the military forces and the return of President 
Aristide.

	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Transport is proclaiming the end of the 
great Canadian national dream. His intent is clear. Rather than 
make our national rail system more efficient, the Minister has 
decided to pull out of the rail transportation sector, arguing that 
it is more important for Canadians and Quebecers to keep their 
social programs.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Transport confirm if the planned 
abandonment of rail lines is part of his own department's 
expenditure reduction plan and will he concede that his desire to 
rationalize the rail system is fundamentally tied to his goal of 
eliminating nearly 15,000 jobs at Transport Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the future of Canada's rail system depends primarily on the 
public's use of this mode of transportation.
<P>
	My hon. colleague knows full well how important it is to 
maintain an adequate level of service for all modes of 
transportation, including passenger rail service. However, the 
cost of these operations cannot be ignored and we are currently 
con-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5304"> 5304 </A></B>
<P>
ducting a review of Canada's entire transportation system, 
including VIA Rail.
<P>
	I want to assure my colleague that any decisions that will be 
taken will be in the best interests of all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the frequency and quality of services obviously 
influences passenger traffic.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the government is preparing to 
abandon major railway lines in several regions without directly 
consulting the people affected or involving them in the 
decision-making process and without consulting the Standing 
Committee on Transport?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is a very well established process for the abandonment of 
rail lines or passenger services. On the question of CN and CP, it 
is through the National Transportation Agency. With respect to 
VIA rail there is a system in place where abandonment can only 
be achieved through order in council.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	There is no imminent decision with respect to the closure of 
any services that are currently being offered by VIA Rail 
because as VIA Rail officials are waiting for the results of their 
negotiations with their employees, so is the Government of 
Canada. Any rationalization of services with respect to VIA in 
Canada will only be decided upon after we have seen what the 
result of these current labour negotiations are.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to begin by welcoming the Prime Minister back home 
and thanking him for his moving representation of Canada at the 
D-Day ceremonies.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> And now down to business. On his trip the 
Prime Minister visited Bosnia. He expressed dissatisfaction 
with the situation there and threatened to remove Canadian 
troops. This comes at a time when American proposals to lift 
sanctions against Bosnian Muslims have caused the Russian 
foreign minister to threaten that such action might bring the 
world back to the cold war.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is what criteria will 
determine whether or not Canadian peacekeeping troops remain 
in Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Leader of the Reform Party for his kind words.
<P>
	I was in Bosnia and found the situation there terrible. I think 
that everybody there wants peace. I had occasion to meet with 
the soldiers, who are doing a fantastic job. By the way, they are a 
regiment from Calgary. I talked with them. In talking with the 
citizens there, I found that everybody wants peace.
<P>
	If we were at this time to lift the arms embargo, the war would 
start again. We believe that we have to be there to maintain 
peace. I said to the Prime Minister that they have to sit down and 
negotiate an honourable peace for everybody. Lifting the arms 
embargo would be conducive to more war.
<P>
	We have troops there, as do the French and the English. It is 
easy for the United States Congress to lift the embargo. They do 
not have soldiers in the field. We do.
<P>
	I want to make it very clear that we are there to maintain 
peace, but if the war starts again, we will have to review the 
decision. We have had two votes on this issue here in this House 
of Commons and I am grateful that the members sustained the 
position of the government.
<P>
	After consultation with my colleagues the President of 
France, the Prime Minister of Great Britain and others during 
my visit to England and France, I came to the conclusion that 
lifting the embargo was the wrong decision. We want peace. The 
best way to keep peace is not to arm the people but to foster a 
situation where there will be real disarmament and to have a 
negotiated settlement between the people who live there and 
who want to live peacefully.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question.
<P>
	Many Canadians are concerned that Canadian foreign policy 
in regard to UN peacekeeping operations is either adrift or is 
being made up on a peace by peace basis. They would like the 
government to be more precise on the criteria and guiding 
principles which determine whether Canada supports UN 
sanctions or peacekeeping operations in particular situations.
<P>
	The next hot spot in which Canada could find itself enmeshed 
is Korea. Northern Korea has said it would consider any 
imposition of UN sanctions as a declaration of war.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister tell us what criteria the government 
is applying to determine what role Canada should be playing to 
ensure a peaceful and positive outcome on the Korean 
peninsula?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the criteria are very simple. We come to the  House and ask the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5305"> 5305 </A></B>
<P>
views of members of Parliament. The basic approach is common 
sense. We look at the situation and we decide if it makes sense to 
carry on.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	We are there as peacekeepers. We have to make sure we are 
there under the umbrella of the United Nations. When the United 
Nations proposes rules that should apply against some nations 
we respect them. These are the criteria we respect. It is very 
simple. The basic criteria is what makes sense. I do not think to 
carry on with the war in Bosnia makes any sense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure it is important for the government to know it has public 
support for whatever criteria it uses to determine Canada's role 
in supporting UN sanctions or peacekeeping operations.
<P>
	Recently Switzerland in its democratic decision making 
tradition conducted a national referendum on whether or not to 
play a more active role in United Nations sponsored 
peacekeeping.
<P>
	What plans does the government have for securing public 
understanding and public endorsation of its criteria for 
determining how Canada will respond to future United Nations 
peacekeeping requests?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the best way is to consult members of Parliament who have been 
duly elected by the people of Canada.

	<B>Mr. Antoine DubÃ© (LÃ©vis):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Prime Minister.
<P>
	According to an analysis by the MIL Davie survival 
committee, this Quebec shipyard received only 8 per cent of 
shipbuilding contracts awarded by Ottawa in Eastern Canada 
since 1986. After submitting a business plan to the government, 
MIL Davie is still waiting for an answer regarding the project to 
build a new ferry for the Magdalen Islands.
<P>
	Given the underrepresentation of MIL Davie in federal 
contracts since 1986, does the Prime Minister admit that the 
federal government itself put the shipyard in a difficult position 
and that one way to correct the situation would be to award the 
ferry construction contract to this company immediately?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member refers to the recovery plan, the business plan 
for the MIL Davie shipyard.
<P>
	Last week, I had the opportunity to speak with the company's 
president and I then explained to him the Canadian 
government's position, namely that the business plan, the 
recovery plan proposed by the company's management has not 
yet been approved by the employees because we know the 
results and what  happened with the vote taken by the employees 
at management's request.
<P>
	We are still at that stage and are waiting to see if we can really 
help maintain jobs at MIL Davie, either by having a ship built to 
replace the <I>Lucy Maud Montgomery</I> or by other means. We are 
still waiting for a final plan that has been approved not only by 
the company's management but also by its employees.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine DubÃ© (LÃ©vis):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is again 
for the Prime Minister as the MIL Davie workers have been 
waiting to hear from him since his election campaign visit.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not admit that, while Quebec was 
rationalizing its shipyards, the federal government itself 
compounded the LÃ©vis shipyard's difficulties by continuing to 
support Eastern shipyards and by building from scratch, at a cost 
of tens of millions of dollars, the new Bull Arm shipyard in 
Newfoundland, as part of the Hibernia project?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
essentially the member is asking about the application of the 
rationalization of shipbuilding policy which was effected by the 
previous government and supported of course by the current 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	This policy has seen the rationalization of shipyards not only 
in Quebec-and I see he is agreeing with that-but also in 
British Columbia, and in the recent announcement of a closing 
in Pictou. We are seeing that the rationalization policy has its 
impact throughout Canada. There is a continuing need for it. It is 
unfair of the member to suggest that the effect of that policy has 
fallen on only one province.
<P>
	It is difficult for Canadian shipbuilders to compete in a very 
competitive international environment where they face 
significant subsidy challenges from other countries. It is in 
dealing with those challenges that we are trying to arrive at the 
best possible solution for MIL Davie as well as for the Canadian 
shipbuilding industry.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

portfolio with her colleague from Calgary. She therefore knows 
that one of the working groups on the consultations is looking at 
the definition of family.
<P>
	There are definitions of the nuclear family. Other peoples, and 
other cultures of the world have the extended family. Some 
people are suggesting the dependency age should be changed 
from where it is at 19. This valuable discussion is ongoing. We 
await the results of the consultation process to look at how 
Canadians have dealt with that issue across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I understand the Liberals may be slightly confused 
with the nature of family because it is really not part of the red 
book concept.
<P>
	Although historic and current legal definitions world-wide 
agree on what a family is, the government seems to be waffling 
on this vital issue. Given that many statutes and regulations 
refer to the family, can the Prime Minister tell us if he agrees 
that the family should be open to redefinition.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, if there is any confusion, it is 
clearly in the minds of members of the hon. member's party.

does not understand there is a working group. She does not 
understand there are public hearings. She does not understand or

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Last week the minister confirmed that section 43 of the 
Criminal Code, which allows parents to use reasonable physical 
discipline, was being reviewed. The former Minister of Justice 
stated in May 1993 that the general direction of the departmental 
review was to investigate the possibility of children receiving 
the same protection against assault as adults have under the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Would the minister tell us if the department is still following 
this direction? Would such protection effectively make it illegal 
for parents to use reasonable discipline with their children?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the review that is now under 
way in the Department of Justice was undertaken following this 
country's signing of the UN accord with respect to the rights of 
children. This international convention committed Canada 
along with other civilized countries of the world to prohibitions 
against the use of excessive force toward children in any 
context.
<P>
	As a signatory to that UN convention, Canada became 
obligated to review its own domestic laws to ensure they reflect 
that international principle of basic decency. That is the reason 
for the review. That is its purpose and that is its scope.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week the minister stated that the review of section 
43 was merely part of a general review. In June 1991 the former 
Minister of Justice stated that $7.1  million would be devoted to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5307"> 5307 </A></B>
<P>
a three-year study. The three years is now up. In March the 
Toronto <I>Star</I> reported that 70 per cent of Canadian parents felt 
that physical discipline was sometimes needed for effective 
parenting.
<P>
	What are the reasons for the government to interfere with the 
freedom of parents to effectively raise their children by 
spending significant amounts of taxpayers' money on reviewing 
legislation which a majority of parents feel should remain the 
same?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have no intention of 
elaborating upon objectives that may have been in the mind of 
the last government or a previous minister.
<P>
	Instead, I will concentrate on the purpose of the study at the 
justice department. As I have said, it is linked directly to our 
international obligations to ensure that our domestic laws 
reflect the accord among all civilized nations of the world that 
we prohibit the use of excessive force against children. That is 
exactly what we are looking at in this study.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (QuÃ©bec):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice. On April 20, the Federal 
Court rendered a decision on Ms. Pitawanakwat's case. She was 
dismissed by the former Department of the Secretary of State in 
March 1986. The court concluded that her dismissal was illegal 
and due only to racial discrimination against this native woman. 
Despite this victory and eight years of legal proceedings, the 
government still refuses to reach a negotiated settlement on the 
amount of compensation, among other things.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Justice tell us if he intends to settle with 
Mary Pitawanakwat before the deadline of June 17 set by the 
parties for reaching an agreement?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can tell the hon. member 
that we are very much aware of the need to reach a resolution of 
this case at the earliest possible time.
<P>
	I met with Mary Pitawanakwat last Thursday in Regina and 
yesterday here in Ottawa when she was present for the National 
Action Committee on the Status of Women meeting. I assured 
her that through counsel at the Department of Justice and her 
own lawyer we are committed to the negotiation of the 
resolution of all outstanding claims as soon as possible. I have 
satisfied myself that those negotiations are continuing.
<P>
	Following the court judgment in April we received 
instructions from the client department, the department of 
heritage, to enter into negotiations which have resulted already 
in some measure of agreement. There are still issues outstanding 
and we are working toward their resolution at the earliest 
possible time.

acknowledge the very hard work on the BST issue that was done 
earlier this spring by the standing committee of agriculture of 
this House.
<P>
	On the precise issue of licensing or the matter of whether to 
issue a notice of compliance, I would advise the House that issue 
is fully and entirely within the jurisdiction of the Minister of

	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Finance. The present tax 
system is unfair in its treatment of families. A victim of the 
current tax system is single income families. The difference in 
taxation between the single income family in which one parent 
stays at home to care for their children and the family in which 
both parents work is substantial and can range from $3,000 to 
$6,000 per year when the family income is $60,000.
<P>
	When will the government start to treat all families fairly?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, the tax system in our 
country has been based on an individual tax system. It is not a 
family tax system. We do not have joint returns in this family 
and we do treat all taxpayers as fairly as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
recent Angus Reid CTV poll indicated that whenever possible 
caring for children in their homes was the preferred method of 
child care by Canadians. However, by interfering with family 
choices and penalizing families with stay at home parents, the 
current tax system prevents Canadians from achieving their 
preferred care for children at home.
<P>
	Will the government introduce a bill to rectify this inequity?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, the matter that is 
referred to by the hon. member is a question that has come up 
previously.
<P>
	I do not think we are going to introduce bills on that particular 
basis. We have a number of family systems in this country. A 
large number of people operate from single families, single 
person families, families in which both parents are working, and 
the child support part of our tax system is an important aspect to 
them.

federal government ships were flying a Bahamian flag of 
convenience. On June 11, the director of public affairs with 
Marine Atlantic, Mr. Ted Bartlett, confirmed that three of his 
ships were registered abroad and were flying a foreign flag.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Transport. Since we now 
have confirmation that three ships from Marine Atlantic, which 
is wholly-owned by the federal government, are flying a foreign 
flag, will the minister explain why this is the case?
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first I want to thank the hon. member for raising this issue again, 
since I just had the opportunity to review it.
<P>
	It is true that three ships from Marine Atlantic are registered 
in the Bahamas, but I should point out to the hon. member that 
this has been the case for several years. I was not aware of that 
when the issue was first raised in the House. The hon. member 
could certainly have discussed it with the Leader of the 
Opposition, since the situation already existed when he was a 
cabinet member.
<P>
	We will review the issue, but it is easy to see how it came 
about. The measure was taken precisely to avoid costs for the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-OrlÃ©ans):</B> Mr. Speaker, could 
you remind the Minister of Transport that the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition left the Conservative Party in May 1990, while I will 
inform the minister that the <I>Bluenose</I> was bought in 1982 and 
the <I>Marine Evangeline</I> in 1978, under Liberal governments.
<P>
	Since that dubious practice dates from the Liberal 
governments of the time, will the minister pledge to this House 
that such practices will no longer be used?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
to make sure we are clear, there is no question this matter has 
been ongoing. The ships in question have been flying the 
Bahamian flag. It is true that it has been going on for a long time. 
I am aware of when the Leader of the Opposition resigned his 
position and changed his allegiance.
<P>
	What I do want to make very clear is that the three ships in 
question were under Bahamian flag throughout the period when 
the hon. Leader of the Opposition was a member of the 
government. We have been here for seven months. I am glad it 
has been brought to our attention. We will see if we can do

plant? If so, will she encourage those provincial counterparts to 
stop playing politics and support the construction of this plant at 
the chosen site in the province of Nova Scotia?
<P>

thank the hon. member for his question.

However, my role and the role of Health Canada is that of a 
regulator. We licence and inspect such a facility wherever it is

<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I direct my question to the Minister of Justice 
whom I hope will be equally strong in his defence of women. 
Today in the Supreme Court, once again the federal government 
has taken the unusual and extraordinary measure in having 
important court cases related to taxation of child support, 
particularly as it applies to women and children living in 
poverty, quashed. First the government appealed the 
Thibaudeau case and now it is seeking to quash other similar 
cases.
<P>
	Why is the minister's department wasting money on lawyers 
appealing these cases instead of addressing the real issue, 
women and children living in poverty?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the steps we took today in 
asking the Supreme Court of Canada to suspend the operation of 
the Court of Appeals' judgment in Thibaudeau until the changes 
have been introduced in the law will save money that would 
otherwise be spent on lawyers. The Thibaudeau judgment in the 
Federal Court of Appeal created an abrupt and incomplete 
change in the tax treatment of child support payments.
<P>
	Today we asked the Supreme Court of Canada, until it hears 
the appeal on the merits of the case, to suspend the operation of 
that judgment. Otherwise, all across the country people trying to 
negotiate or abide by agreements or court orders for the payment 
of child support will be left in uncertainty as to their rights and 
would be obliged to seek legal advice, paying money to lawyers 
to help them solve the uncertainty.
<P>
	By seeking the stay today, we avoided that result. At the same 
time, through my colleague, the Secretary of State for the Status 
of Women, we have a task force touring the country soliciting 
the views of Canadians on the most appropriate changes to 
achieve fair and equitable tax treatment for child support 
payments.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANFILMDEVELOPMENTCORPORATIONACT">CANADIAN FILM DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION 
ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-31, an act to amend the Canadian Film Development 
Corporation Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not want the remarks of the 
Reform Party member for Medicine Hat to go by without some 
mention.
<P>
	As I mentioned, the hon. member for Medicine Hat talked 
about the fact that we subsidize the film industry in this country. 
The member has to be very careful about using the word subsidy 
because the energy sector in this country probably receives more 
subsidy than any other sector in the economy.
<P>
	We do this through tax preferences buried in the tax act. The 
member stood in the House of Commons and talked about close 
to $2 billion in subsidies that go into culture related industry. He 
basically condemned that. He should know that the energy 
sector receives a lot more than that. The difference is it receives 
those subsidies buried in tax preferences and the tax act.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	I feel very defensive when members stand in this House and 
take on the cultural industries because in my riding there are 
close to 5,800 people who work in the motion picture industry.
<P>
	In the motion picture industry we do not just have actors and 
actresses. We have cameramen and women, craftsmen and 
women who do set designs, lens grinders and costume makers. 
In the last 10 years we have managed to build a world class 
motion picture industry.
<P>
	We now have products that we are exporting all over the 
world. I think of ``Degrassi Junior High'' which was developed 
and produced here and is now being exported to over50 countries. It has been cancelled on the Canadian networks but 
this product is still being exported.
<P>
	When we go to the 500 channel universe we will have an 
opportunity to manufacture all kinds of Canadian products. In 
addition, there are several motion picture producers that come to 
Canada now and have their motion pictures made in Canada.
<P>
	The member gave the example of Buddies in Bad Times, a city 
of Toronto arts grant which I do not want to debate with him 
today. I do not think he should take one example like that and 
brandish the whole cultural industry in this country. It is not 
really fair. It is like taking the CBC and only looking at it for the 
work it does as a unit. You have to look at the CBC in the sense 
that it has been a training ground. Many people have left the 
CBC and gone on to work in the private sector. It has been an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5315"> 5315 </A></B>
<P>
apprenticeship centre which has created the tremendous 
inventory of talent that supports the motion picture industry.
<P>
	I could also say to the member for Medicine Hat the CBC is 
one of the few galvanizing agents in this country. It is very 
sensitive to bringing together not only information and culture 
from every region of this country but providing service to 
remote regions which sometimes may not be seen as profitable 
for the private sector.
<P>
	I am not putting down the private sector for not getting 
involved in unprofitable ventures in this country, but the 
responsibility for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is to 
make sure that every region of this country is covered. We do not 
run the CBC like a business. It is not like a business. Whether it 
be the post office, the CBC, or Petro-Canada, if we dealt with 
them strictly on an earnings per share per quarter basis we would 
not have the type of service that these agencies of government 
have provided over the years. They really have been able to 
bring this country together.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	With the 500-channel universe just around the corner from us, 
we have invested so much in training, in the motion picture 
industry, we now have a talent pool that is recognized as world 
class. More than ever as we come close to that period where we 
have the opportunity to fill that 500-channel universe with 
Canadian product, we should make sure we do not pull away 
from supporting the motion picture industry. If anything, I 
would encourage members of the House to urge the government 
to not only continue to support it, but to increase its support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate some of 
what the hon. member said. However, I would really like to 
challenge his thinking and the thinking of other members on the 
other side of the House with respect to the necessity of having to 
pluck money from the pockets of supporters of these programs 
in the form of taxation. If a program is really good, if it is really 
quality, it will win. If it is not, then it should not be subsidized.
<P>
	I believe that too for businesses and other industries, some of 
which he mentioned. If we were to have a level playing field tax 
wise, we could compete very easily right around the world and 
that is the missing link.
<P>
	Specifically with respect to the CBC, I have on numerous 
occasions had people ask me why we support it. They then use 
words which I am sure are unparliamentary-they are not in my 
personal vocabulary in any case-about the things they have 
heard.
<P>
	I was tremendously offended one Sunday evening when, as we 
were finishing our day, I switched on my radio as I often do and 
chose the CBC. Sometimes it has some nice classical music 
which I enjoy at the end of the day. I cannot relate to you in the 
House what I heard because it was so offensive. It was 
tremendously offensive  to women and to men, and the 
explicitness of what was being broadcast at midnight on a 
Sunday got me so upset that I immediately ran downstairs, 
turned on my tape recorder in order to have it on record even 
though I could hardly stand to hear it.
<P>
	My response was why should I as a taxpayer be forced to fund 
this without any choice at all. If it were another station I can turn 
away, it's ratings go down and, as happened to one of the radio 
stations in Edmonton, it would go out of business.
<P>
	The CBC should be subject to that same kind of continual 
scrutiny on a personal basis by all taxpayers, by all the people 
who are listening. I really think we ought to very quickly phase 
out the funding of the CBC and many of these other cultural 
organizations which, very frankly, appeal to a very narrow group 
of people and are far away from and, in many cases, opposed to 
what the majority of Canadians want to hear and want to see.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member and I really do not know where to begin 
because I think we basically have an ideological difference. 
Nothing personal intended to the member, but I see it in just the 
opposite light. I see the CBC as an instrument of national unity. I 
know you do not. I know the member does not.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I appreciate that members 
always feel very strongly about their views, but I think it is in the 
best interests of all of us if we direct our comments through the 
Chair.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member talks about job creation. The CBC has been a training 
ground for thousands of Canadian men and women who have 
gone on to work in the private sector, whether it is radio or 
television or the motion picture industry. I happen to think there 
is a lot of the quality in CBC productions, for example, in a 
production like ``The Journal''. I am not talking about ``Prime 
Time'' but ``The Journal''.
<P>
	The man behind ``The Journal'', Mark Starowicz, is probably 
respected as one of the geniuses in television public affairs 
programming right now in the world. This is a man who came 
through the system and that format is being copied by various 
units all over the world.
<P>
	I guess my point is that we should not just measure the 
contribution of the CBC in terms of its ratings. We have to look 
at the CBC's macroeconomic contribution, the contribution of 
its training, the contribution of it holding the country together as 
an agent. I am not saying it is the only thing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5316"> 5316 </A></B>
<P>
	I have to speak about my riding for just a second. I have 5,700 
people in my riding that are employed in the motion picture 
industry. We are exporting motion pictures right now. We are 
manufacturing American written productions. We are producing 
these major motion pictures because our cameramen, our set 
designers, our sound men and women are outstanding. All of 
these people are Canadians who have worked with the CBC film 
production operation.
<P>
	This has expanded into the Toronto film festival which is 
respected now as one of the best in the world. I am appealing to 
the members of the Reform Party to not look at the CBC in 
narrow terms but to look at the contribution the motion picture 
industry makes in the macroeconomic sense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very interested in the hon. member's comments. Many 
people appreciate the CBC and the cultural programs that are 
provided.
<P>
	The difficulty right now is that we are in a financial crunch in 
which Canadians are feeling overburdened by the taxes they 
have to pay. As we line up priorities they are simply not prepared 
to pay more taxes for items such as those being argued for by the 
hon. member, particularly when they do not represent their 
views, their culture and are seen as an added expense.
<P>
	There is a great impatience by Canadians. When I was a boy 
on the ranch one of my chores was to milk cows. I did not ask the 
cow if she wanted to be milked. I just put her in her stall and sat 
down and milked her. Canadians are feeling as though they are 
being lined up in the stall like milk cows, being milked for all 
they are worth.
<P>
	We have a tax system and an economy that has been ordered 
by the government. It now makes it necessary for most families 
to have both partners in the workforce, even though one may like 
to stay home and look after the home and care for the children in 
the traditional way. The economy is such, the tax system is such, 
that it is not advantageous for them to do that. The opportunity is 
not there for them to do that.
<P>
	There is a huge reaction to the cost of government. The 
government must look seriously at the expenses, at what it is 
spending. This is what Canadians are demanding. This is why 
there is such a large objection to the cultural programs on CBC. 
It is seen as one more expenditure that we cannot afford.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
want to get into an agricultural analogy with him, but I do want 
to challenge the member. I do not want to challenge you, Mr. 
Speaker, I want to challenge the member on his commitment to 
tax reform.
<P>
	I happen to agree with the member. I believe all members in 
the House agree that the current tax act is unfair, inefficient, 
complex and no longer globally competitive.
<P>
	The Reform Party should have stuck to its campaign promise 
during the last election, which was basically to promote the 
notion of tax reform that would go a long way in generating the 
kind of entrepreneurial activity which would generate enough 
tax revenue for this country. This would not only reduce the 
deficit and ultimately pay down the debt but it would also 
provide enough money to make sure that galvanizing 
instruments like the CBC or the motion picture industry did not 
have to be touched.
<P>
	I would say this, with great respect to the Reform Party, when 
are we going to start hearing about its commitment to tax reform 
that we heard about all during the last election?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg-Official languages; the hon. 
member for Saint John-VIA Rail; the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake-Aboriginal veterans; the hon. 
member for Chicoutimi-CRTC.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise to speak during the third reading of Bill 
C-31. It was quite interesting to see how we moved through the 
previous discussion regarding the CBC.
<P>
	I am going to make the comment at the start of my remarks 
that the CBC is indeed a billion dollar boondoggle. It is really 
unfortunate that we do not have a longer period of time to 
discuss the CBC, that we have not had the opportunity in this 
session of Parliament to have the full discussion that is required.
<P>
	This opportunity permits me also to set the record straight 
with respect to the Reform Party's interest in advancing 
Canadian cultural industries and encouraging artistic freedom. 
Many people in the House have a definitive opinion, but there 
definitely is a clear lack of understanding. I am not sure if it is 
intentional or otherwise, but there seems to be this perception 
that we are disinterested in Canadian culture. That really is a 
rather simplistic criticism because we have been suggesting and 
encouraging less government involvement. Since we stood in 
the House in the early days of this Parliament, we have been 
consistent in that message; we want to see less government 
involvement. That is particularly elemental to this discussion.
<P>
	We advance the idea that the cultural community be given the 
tools necessary to flourish in an open, competitive and changing 
marketplace. That includes less government intervention, less 
taxation and regulatory controls that permit competition, not 
strangle it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5317"> 5317 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member across the floor talked about the CBC and 
the CRTC. The CRTC is an excellent example of how the 
television and radio production sectors are impeded by an 
inconsistent regulatory environment.
<P>
	Quite frankly the CRTC was quite arbitrary and paternalistic 
in its selection process and granting of licences only last week. 
Imagine 500 channels. We are moving toward that environment 
like a sputtering Model T. It is a ridiculous licensing process that 
does not do anything to promote the richness of our industries as 
indeed it could.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Our approach recognizes that Canadian cultural policy must 
be sustainable in a world of rapid technological change and is 
fostered in an environment in which individuals are free to 
choose.
<P>
	The intent of the bill is to foster better relationships between 
Canadian producers and Canadian financial institutions. On this 
side of the House in the Reform Party we have to question 
whether there is a poor relationship between these groups. My 
colleagues spoke of their concern about that issue during second 
reading of the bill.
<P>
	A bit later I will provide information to the House that will 
demonstrate why this question is worthy of an answer. The 
evidence I have would suggest that the industry has been 
thriving and is in no need of government guaranteed loans. We 
do not have the money to go forward with proposals like this 
one. We need to ensure the industry can make it on its own by 
less regulation and less taxation.
<P>
	In the face of the overwhelming evidence that supports this 
conclusion we must question the motivation of the government 
and all the supporters of the bill, one of which is the Royal Bank 
of Canada interestingly enough.
<P>
	I should like to go through the process of taking the bill into 
committee and the discussion that took place there. It was my 
very first experience in this kind of an environment. What 
happened there was of particular interest to me. At committee 
after second reading representatives of the Royal Bank of 
Canada appeared as impartial witnesses to give testimony on 
their appreciation of Bill C-31. The Royal Bank is the bank with 
which the Department of Canadian Heritage has been 
negotiating to establish the parameters of the bill.
<P>
	I suggest they had a vested interest in speaking at committee 
in favour of the legislation. When other financial players were 
asked if they would like to address the committee on the bill they 
declined the opportunity, not because they were in favour of the 
bill but because they did not want to be seen as opposing it for 
fear that it would be perceived to be anti-culture. Now what a 
sorry comment.
<P>
	We have come to a point in time where individuals and 
corporations do not speak their minds on an issue because they 
are concerned about possible recrimination. The powerful 
cultural lobbies and special interest groups in Canada have had 
such a profound impact that witnesses now feel uncomfortable 
to appear at committee to speak frankly. This is an issue that 
directly affects the operations of their businesses.
<P>
	That kind of special interest pressure has little or no effect on 
members of my party or members of my caucus. We were 
elected with a mandate from our constituents to bring to this 
public forum their comments and their concerns, and we will not 
be intimidated by special interest groups. We do not support the 
bill in principle. Nor do we support it as it was presented.
<P>
	Members of the government and people from the Department 
of Canadian Heritage continually reassure us that the bill will 
not result in financial losses for the government and that its 
effectiveness will be reviewed after two years.
<P>
	Despite the fact that we do not agree with the principle of the 
bill we proposed a reasonable amendment to it. The bill states 
that loans will be for a maximum of 18 months. In order to 
provide an accurate evaluation of the performance of the 
program we proposed an amendment which, although defeated, 
I still believe to be a necessary legislative tool to evaluate the 
bill at some future time.
<P>
	I moved that after 36 months the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage should review the progress of the guaranteed 
loan program introduced by the bill and report on that progress 
to the House. This amendment was simply a review and report 
amendment, which is quite similar to a sunset clause. If included 
as an amendment within the bill it would have legislatively 
assured the program of loan guarantees would receive a formal 
review.
<P>
	The 36-month review I proposed provided a longer review 
period than even the government was requesting. It would allow 
for two full sets of loans to be completed before review, a review 
the government states it will conduct. How could a review be 
completed after only 24 months as the government suggests? 
There will have been only a handful of loans, the success of 
which we are to use to judge and evaluate the program. Why not 
make the trial period a little longer to give the program a solid 
evaluation based on historical trends? I fail to understand how 
the government could not support such a common sense focus 
within the amendment. I would like to read it for the record:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Three years after the coming into force of this act, a comprehensive review of 
the application and operation of the amendments to the <I>Canadian Film 
Development Corporation Act</I> as enacted by this act shall be undertaken by such 
committee of the House of Commons as may be designated or established by the 
House for that purpose.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5318"> 5318 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	That was to be subclause 3(1). Subclause 3(2) read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The committee referred to in subsection (1) shall, within three months after the 
review is undertaken or within such further time as the House of Commons may 
authorize, submit a report on the review to the House including a statement of any 
changes the committee recommends.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Further, if there will be a review, why not require the review to 
be in the statutes? Is the government sincere about its intention 
to conduct such a review? Why not open the process to the 
committee to evaluate the performance of the program? Such a 
review would provide the standing committee with the 
opportunity to be involved at a more effective level, something 
the Prime Minister continues to talk about. Despite the Prime 
Minister's commitments to greater committee involvement, his 
caucus continues to keep standing committees from being 
involved.
<P>
	As it now stands this legislative review and report stage will 
not take place. The amendment was lost. We have only the 
verbal assurances that this evaluation is inherent within the bill. 
We know from experience in the House what kind of trouble 
occurs on the basis of verbal assurances. Who can say if the bill 
will ever be addressed again?
<P>
	Let me return to the question of the intent of the bill. We have 
heard the government, the producers and the banks that seem to 
be speaking in favour of the bill. If I had someone who would 
assume 85 per cent liability for a loan for me I would be very 
pleased. I would be running to the first bank that would support 
it.
<P>
	The reality is that in the private sector and for individual 
taxpayers like you and me, Mr. Speaker, we do not have the 
government to intervene and assume liability for our business 
endeavours. The point is that the government should not be in 
the business of guaranteeing loans, period, be they for small 
business, big business or for cultural agencies.
<P>
	The bill presupposes an ineffective working relationship 
between Canadian producers and Canadian financial 
institutions. This assumption is quite simply a false one. There 
is sufficient evidence to suggest that the production industry has 
been booming in recent years. This increase in the production 
industry has transpired despite the difficult economic times we 
face.
<P>
	How can the government dispute the following facts that 
clearly demonstrate how well the industry is doing? We 
certainly heard our colleague across the floor talk about how 
much help the CBC needs. It has a billion dollars out there every 
year and it still needs more help. Its offices still need to expand 
more.
<P>
	Let me remind the House that the increased performance of 
the industry has come without any federally guaranteed loans. 
Here are some statistics I would like to present which 
demonstrate its healthy performance. Since 1987-88 the film 
industry has experienced an overall growth of 34 per cent in the 
number of production companies. A 39 per cent increase in full 
and part time employment accompanied the rise in the number 
of production companies since 1987-88. This growth was 
largely due to the creation of part time jobs, jobs which more 
than doubled over this period to 2,500 in 1991-92.
<P>
	Interestingly the number of producers specializing in 
television production increased substantially from 119 in 
1990-91 to 137 in 1991-92. The number of television 
productions measured separately for the first time in 1991-92 
accounted for 38 per cent of all films produced in Canada. 
Corporate videos and television commercials each represented a 
further 20 per cent of the total volume of production. Overall 
between 1990-91 and 1991-92 the level of film, video and 
audio-visual production jumped from 17,634 to 19,891. It was 
an increase of 13 per cent. Feature film production remained 
steady in 1992 with 20 companies producing 56 theatrical 
productions.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The overall profitability of Canadian film producers 
improved dramatically in 1991-92. The profit margin of 
production companies jumped to 11.1 per cent from a 10-year 
low of 1.5 per cent the previous year. The industry is booming 
and it is booming on its own. It is making it on its own in the 
private sector without government intervention.
<P>
	After accounting for inflation in the motion picture laboratory 
operations area, operating revenues in this sector increased by 
$11.9 million despite the drop in the number of films from170 to 162. Its revenues reach $286.7 million. The level of full 
and part time employment has increased steadily in the film 
laboratory and post-production services industry since 
1987-88. In 1991-92 it was up by 33 per cent. These statistics 
cannot be denied. This industry is thriving and is indeed a 
vibrant one.
<P>
	On the share of film distribution revenues it is interesting that 
the overall foreign controlled market share remained fairly 
stable between 1991 and 1992 levels at 57 per cent. Right now 
we have a great deal of involvement from outside our country.
<P>
	Bill C-31 will entrench the strongest players in the market. It 
will allow the strong companies access to more loans in order 
that they may even get stronger. This is a concern certainly for 
those smaller production companies. This will choke off new 
players in the market.
<P>
	What is the rationale here? How will it create jobs? I 
challenge the government to come up with a program without 
grants, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5319"> 5319 </A></B>
<P>
without subsidies and without loan guarantees that will treat all 
players equally. We cannot  be passing legislation that will help 
companies that do not need help.
<P>
	In closing, I am going to comment on an experience I had in 
Calgary. I guess it is in response to the Bloc member who 
suggested earlier that we have put too much importance on the 
subsidization of overprivileged commercial enterprises and not 
on the artistic community.
<P>
	In Calgary this spring there was an arts award luncheon that 
was fully and totally funded between the private sector and the 
arts community. The city of Calgary, through its mayor and 
council working with the arts community, the business sector, 
the private sector and the patrons of Calgary, developed bridge 
funding for the arts community to continue to thrive through the 
Banff School of Management. That model is an excellent one. It 
is an outstanding one that others in the country could use and not 
have to come rushing to the government for a handout.
<P>
	The industry does not need that kind of financial support. It is 
thriving quite well on its own. Once again I can only say that we 
cannot pass legislation to help companies that do not need help.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (for Mr. Hanger)</B> moved that Bill S-5, 
an act to incorporate the Canadian Association of Lutheran 
Congregations, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity to speak 
on behalf of my colleague from Calgary Northeast regarding the 
Canadian Association of Lutheran Congregations.
<P>
	Lutheranism in Canada has been a long and honourable 
tradition. The first Lutheran service was conducted in 1619 by 
Chaplain Rasmus Jensen at Port Churchill, Manitoba as part of 
Jens Munk Expedition.
<P>
	The first Lutheran congregation was organized at Halifax in 
1752. Lutherans have made a valuable contribution to the 
cultural heritage of Canadians and currently Lutherans in 
Canada form the fourth largest Christian church.
<P>
	It is as a part of this proud tradition in Canada that the 
Canadian Association of Lutheran Congregations seeks 
incorporation. This association was organized in October of 
1992 and currently has functioned as an unincorporated 
non-profit association of congregations and individuals.
<P>
	Currently there are over 1,000 persons throughout the three 
western provinces and six congregations in the association and 
its organization.
<P>
	The organization is intended to have two functions. First, it 
will act as a denomination for congregations wishing to join it. 
As well, there may be associate members, either persons or 
congregations, agreeing with the goals, aims and theology of the 
association. This association seeks a return to Lutheran roots 
with its emphasis on Scripture, missions and Lutheran theology.
<P>
	I raise that point and know that we can dispose of this as 
quickly as possible so it may be incorporated as quickly as the 
House can deal with it.
<P>
	I suspect there is unanimous consent for the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That notwithstanding any standing order and the usual practices of the 
House, Bill S-5, an act to incorporate the Canadian Association of Lutheran 
Congregations, be now called for second reading and that the House proceed to 
dispose of the said bill at all stages, including committee of the whole.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to say, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, that we support Bill 
S-5, which was presented in the other place.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to incorporate the Canadian 
Association of Lutheran Congregations, thereby enabling this 
organization to better achieve the religious objectives of its 
members.
<P>
	Canada has always respected freedom of religious choice, and 
it has a long tradition of doing so. The Canadian Association of 
Lutheran Congregations, in my opinion, fully meets the criteria 
for serious religious organizations. Giving this association the 
corporate status necessary for its development would benefit its 
members. Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois will vote in avour of 
adopting this bill.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of my colleagues in the national Liberal 
caucus I too want to indicate that we intend to support this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased today to support this bill. I need not point out that 
we do not intend to take up a great deal of the House's time to 
discuss this initiative. The bill now under debate was initially 
tabled in the Senate and is now duly before this House.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	I would like to take a few moments to point out the 
contribution made to Canada by the Lutheran Church and to 
state that we intend to support this bill and pass it as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	Some other members of this House will be bringing forward 
another bill in a few moments. We will therefore be brief in our 
remarks concerning this important parliamentary initiative.
<P>
	As I was saying, the bill was presented in the Senate, but many 
members of this House had not been told about it. I know that the 
member for Calgary Northeast wanted to sponsor the bill, and I 
am certain that it is very important to him. He agreed to let 
another member present it, and I congratulate him on doing so in 
order that this bill might pass today and become law.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That being said, I want to indicate our agreement to pass this 
bill not only at second reading but at committee of the whole and 
third reading as well in order to have this bill disposed of 
forthwith.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>

committee, reported, concurred in and, by unanimous consent, 
read the third time and passed.)
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I believe you 
will find unanimous consent to proceed now with Private 
Members' Hour.
<P>
	I would also want to inquire if you could determine whether 
there is unanimous consent to proceed with the adjournment 
debate one hour after the commencement of Private Members' 
Hour which we are about to commence; in other words, perhaps 
we could immediately call it 5.30 p.m. in order for members to 
prepare and to arrive in the House at that time.
<P>
	The purpose of that would be to ensure that the late show 
would not be held at 10.30 p.m., which would otherwise be the 
case, creating, needless to say, a costly and not very useful 
delay.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-210 which we are looking at 
now is my bill and we are certainly prepared to go on that. We 
appreciate the spirit of harmony that we have just experienced 
on Bill S-5 which I sponsored. Perhaps we can look forward to 
Bill C-210 going through at all stages just as quickly and 
harmoniously as that.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="RECALLACT">RECALL ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from April 29 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-210, an act to provide for the recall of members of 
the House of Commons, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
indeed a pleasure to speak to Bill C-210 which is not just 
another private member's bill. This bill put forward by my 
colleague from Beaver River speaks to a fundamental 
philosophy of the Reform Party and, I hope, all other parties of 
this House. It what all of us as members of Parliament really are 
all about: listening to the will of the people. This bill represents 
a chance for members of all parties to make a real difference in 
the way this country is run.
<P>
	Today voters are naturally angry and cynical because they 
often feel helpless about the process of government in Canada. 
When the government says we have an opportunity to have our 
voices heard at the next election it is really missing the point 
because the next election is not soon enough. In case the 
government has not noticed, the world is a smaller place than it 
ever was before. Everything moves faster than it did the year 
before. People nowadays expect action and action means now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5321"> 5321 </A></B>
<P>
	If it becomes evident after an election that a vast majority of 
constituents in any constituency want their MP out, or at least 
want another election for valid reasons, then they should have 
that right.
<P>
	What difference will recall make? Many people ask that and 
we talk about it for year after year it seems. Let us look at the 
comments and results of a conference held at the University of 
Lethbridge on February 25 and 26 of this year. It was entitled, if 
you can imagine: Re-inventing Parliament. After 125 years, we 
are going to re-invent Parliament.
<P>
	Over 100 Canadians from across Canada met to discuss issues 
such as recall. Quoting from a report resulting from that 
conference, this is what was said: ``Every workshop 
recommended to the conference that governments in Canada 
allow for the recall of elected members. On no item of direct 
democracy did a more clear consensus emerge''.
<P>
	What was the rationale for that significant consensus? The 
conference participants felt that recall would go a long way in 
addressing some of the current ailments of the parliamentary 
system.
<P>
	The most important reason cited by over half of the 
workshops is that recall provides for more accountable MPs, and 
MLAs in the provincial sense. It ensures elected members act on 
and listen to constituents' concerns. Recall provides a direct 
link between citizens and politicians that exists on a continual 
basis, not just during the 30 or 40-day campaign period, once 
every four or five years.
<P>
	It is quite likely that a relaxation of party discipline will 
accompany recall. Governments will see the need to allow their 
members more freedom of action in light of the threat that recall 
presents to MPs.
<P>
	Recall also serves as an early warning system for 
governments. If recall petitions become a common occurrence 
in government members' ridings, it signals to the government 
that a change in direction should be seriously considered.
<P>
	It was also mentioned by some in this report from the 
conference that the threat of recall alone is just as important, if 
not more important than the actual process itself. There is 
nothing better than holding a little threat over politicians' heads 
once in awhile.
<P>
	At this conference the majority of attendees from across this 
nation supported the right of Canadians to recall their elected 
members. Why is it that so many people want recall and this 
government, like the last arrogant government, chooses to 
ignore the will of the people? What is it that Liberal and Bloc 
politicians are afraid of? Why are we hearing such feeble 
excuses from our government colleagues? Let me give you a few 
quotes from <I>Hansard</I> when we debated this matter previously.
<P>
	I will start with a quote from the Liberal member for 
Vancouver Quadra: ``This can be a House that will literally 
reform itself''. You have to talk with the hon. member who made 
such a statement. If this House would reform itself, we would 
not have 52 Reformers trying to reform it today. If the hon. 
member thinks like so many others on this and other issues, why 
not stand up and be counted?
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	Another quote comes from the hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe of the Bloc party: ``This bill would be 
impossible to enforce'' but nowhere in his speech does he 
explain why. It is just a statement that this bill would be 
impossible to enforce.
<P>
	The final quote is from the Liberal Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Public Works and Government Services who in 
his brilliance said: ``But we still do not have any proof that it 
would work''. Of course we do not; we have not adopted the bill 
yet.
<P>
	We know Reformers stand apart from the other parties when it 
comes to participative democracy. The concepts of free votes 
and recall for instance are interconnected. We need them both. 
What would the results be if we had free votes and recall? That is 
simple: Elected officials who vote according to their 
constituents' wishes and according to the merits of the 
particular bill. Is that so strange? Is that so difficult to 
understand?
<P>
	We should have no fear about this. If a party performs poorly 
it will be rejected at the next election. However, when a sitting 
member significantly breaches the trust of his or her 
constituents we need a mechanism in place in the House to get 
him or her out of that position.
<P>
	The government's use of fear to attack the idea of recall is 
really an expression of its own fear. The government keeps 
throwing out the bogeyman about the dangers of unscrupulous 
factions trying to oust an MP. Government members are pushing 
the panic button and this tactic is based more on fear for their 
own jobs than anything else.
<P>
	The process of petition and recall election gives the MP ample 
opportunity to present his or her case to the electorate. This is 
direct democracy, a concept I understand but perhaps some 
members do not. Whether the government likes it or not, it is an 
idea whose time has come.
<P>
	Recall forces MPs to be more accountable to their 
constituents. That is what my colleague wants to achieve with 
this bill. That is what the Reform Party wants. Most important, 
and what this government ignores at its own peril, it is what the 
people want.
<P>
	A famous former Prime Minister once said that opposition 
MPs were nobodies as soon as they walked 100 yards away from 
Parliament Hill. I wonder what party that individual was from. I 
agree with Peter McCormick who said that the former Prime 
Minister could not have been more wrong. Given the way the  
Canadian parliamentary system operates, our MPs are people of 
some significance in their communities and may become nobo-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5322"> 5322 </A></B>
<P>
dies when they arrive on Parliament Hill. That is what I believe 
if they do not stand up for what they believe in and vote the 
wishes of their constituents instead of being a minor mouthpiece 
of their party.
<P>
	The last Parliament was called one of the best by the media 
and why is that? Because it was good theatre with lots of bad 
actors. If you look at the acrimony, the accusations, the asinine 
behaviour, if that is what the media wanted, that is what it got. 
What you did not hear so much about is the cold hard facts that 
Canadian public opinion of the institution of Parliament reached 
an all-time low during the 34th session.
<P>
	I call upon those members who are sitting in the back rows to 
join us in this cause. Show the Canadian people that you are here 
to make a real difference. If you are looking for the opportunity 
to be truly different, truly representative of your constituents 
and truly a person of principle, then you should speak up now by 
supporting this bill.
<P>
	Here is your chance to do more for those who really count and 
they are the people who put us all here. Do something a little 
different: Make a stand and choose to play the real role of 
reforming the way this country is run. This recall bill could be 
the first step.
<P>
	In closing, all Canadians and government backbenchers know 
we need their vote to carry this issue. I would like to see what 
they are really made of. I would like to see that vote carry. Recall 
represents strong MPs, not weak ones. Therefore, please 
consider this reform necessary, a reform that Canadian people 
want. Do not turn it down just because the party is afraid of a 
little recall.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-210 providing for the recall of members of the House of 
Commons can be summed up as follows: ``Any elector 
ordinarily resident in an electoral district who wishes to seek the 
recall of the member for that district may file with the Clerk an 
application for the recall of the member in the prescribed form''.
<P>
	This recall procedure exists in 15 American states and makes 
it possible to dismiss a member of Parliament or a public 
official. A similar system is in effect in four Swiss cantons. It is 
important to note that this procedure is allowed only in a very 
narrow socio-political context. Even then, its actual use is 
extremely restricted. In the United States, the system only 
works at the municipal level. At a higher level, only one case is 
mentioned: that of an Oregon governor who was recalled in 
1921.
<P>
	To better define the Bloc Quebecois's position on this issue 
and explain to the House the political origin of the recall 
concept, I think it is important to return to the late 18th century. 
On the European continent, it is the age of enlightenment, this 
philosophical movement which dominated the world of ideas 
and gave birth to the great democratic principles that have 
governed Western societies to this day. In Europe, it is the time 
when sovereignty was transferred from an all-powerful 
monarch to the people. The movement had actually started two 
centuries earlier in England, France and Germany but it was 
gathering momentum and taking on a more universal dimension.
<P>
	For Jean-Jacques Rousseau, for instance, sovereignty is 
embodied in the ``general will'' which is always fair and 
equitable and therefore most effective at the human level. Thus 
emerged the very idea of democracy whereby decisions are 
made by the people as a whole. But is democracy as people 
power the best form of government? In this regard, is the right of 
recall resulting from the notion of people power a good way to 
offset politicians' actions? If people had the right to recall their 
members, would politicians become more accountable to their 
constituents for their actions?
<P>
	As the basis for the legitimacy of state power, once royal 
power was abolished in the late 18th century, in Rousseau's 
mind, the ultimate power to make decisions would rest with the 
people. That is why he refuted the idea of representative 
democracy whereby the people can only exert their influence at 
regular intervals. About the English people, he said this: ``The 
people think they are free, they are sorely mistaken; they are 
only free during elections. As soon as the members of 
Parliament are elected, the people revert to being slaves, to 
being nothing''. That is why Rousseau wanted to give people the 
right to recall their representatives on a daily basis.
<P>
	As we can see, recalling elected representatives is not a new 
idea. I think the main flaws of representative democracy, in 
particular the principle that citizens can only exercise their right 
to vote once every four or five years, deeply troubles all 
democrats since the beginning of universal suffrage. So, the 
question raised at the dawn of representative democracy can still 
be raised today: ``How can the sovereign power exercised by a 
few parliamentary dignitaries result from sovereignty of the 
people?'' The democratic ideal expressed through the 
sovereignty of the people, through the notion that every citizen 
of a sovereign state can influence the decision-making process, 
that everyone wields political power, will quickly take the form 
of state sovereignty with the application of democracy.
<P>
	Throughout the 18th century, and especially since the advent 
of universal suffrage, we see that the will of the people 
expressed through the election process does not coincide with 
the general will. As we move away from the great revolutionary 
movements that swept Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5323"> 5323 </A></B>
<P>
notion of sovereignty of the  people gradually gives way to the 
more absolutist concept of sovereignty of Parliament.
<P>
	Given what I just said, the Bloc Quebecois considers this bill 
to be fully justified; it is symptomatic both of people's 
misgivings about their representatives and of the massive 
failure of the Canadian political system.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Actually, this bill would be impossible to enforce, but it 
shows a democratic conscience deeply disillusioned by over100 years of a system that simply does not work.
<P>
	Parliamentary sovereignty has lost all credibility and just 
making members of Parliament subject to recall will not restore 
its credibility. Clause 4.<I>(d)</I> of Bill C-210 says that a statement 
of 200 words or less would be sufficient to trigger the recall 
process. This provision would necessarily lead to anarchy in 
many ridings.
<P>
	That statement of 200 words or less must set out the reasons 
why the recall of the member is warranted. Reasons? But who 
will determine the value of those reasons? Which reasons will be 
good ones and which will be bad ones? I believe this clause sets 
a dangerous precedent in terms of judging situations and 
deciding who will make such judgments.
<P>
	If, for example, the promoters of a recall manage to get the 
majority of electors to sign their petition and argue that, based 
on solid economic indicators, the member is incapable of 
supporting economic recovery in his or her riding, will that be a 
valid reason or not?
<P>
	Who will decide? Are MPs responsible for the situation? Do 
they have real power regarding the economy? If a majority of 
electors have signed the petition, will they be told that they are 
right or wrong? This is a very serious issue which leads me to 
believe that it would not be possible to implement this 
legislation and, more importantly, that such legislation would 
not achieve its goal.
<P>
	I am convinced that such an act would make elected 
representatives vulnerable to conspiracies, to blackmail and to 
all kinds of secret dealings. I think that the whole process 
suggested by the Reform Party member would put undesirable 
additional pressure which would considerably affect the work of 
elected representatives, as well as the services they are meant to 
provide. I do not think that a member who would have to 
campaign against a recall in his or her riding would, at the same 
time, be able to adequately serve those who want to kick him 
out. This would be quite the paradox!
<P>
	Our whole electoral and democratic process is not structured 
to serve in a positive way the intent of Bill C-210. Such a 
procedure would make the democratic process too perilous and 
costly, as well as totally uncontrollable.
<P>
	This bill is not practical throughout a country whose 
population numbers in the millions. It results from a nostalgic 
feeling about the democratic idealism which arose in the 
18th-century Europe. The Bloc Quebecois is totally opposed to 
this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am a little reluctant to take part in the debate today because this 
matter of recall is being studied as we speak by the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs which I have the 
honour to chair.
<P>
	In spite of that, I have views on the subject which I will be 
making known in the committee I suspect on Thursday when the 
committee discusses this matter. I wanted to state those views 
for the record today since there was an opportunity to debate this 
bill which is very important. I acknowledge that it is an 
important one.
<P>
	I know when the hon. member for Fraser Valley West was 
speaking he referred to the fact that there had been a conference 
in Lethbridge and there was considerable opinion at that 
conference that recall was a good thing. I had the honour to 
attend that conference. I must say that the workshop that I 
attended did have a straw vote and supported the notion of recall 
but it was not one that I supported at the time. I expressed my 
views on the matter at the conference.
<P>
	I invite members of the House in reflecting on whether the bill 
should be adopted by the House or not to consider two or three 
points. The first one of great importance is the fact that this 
institution, the House of Commons of Canada, has one of the 
highest rates of turnover of any similar legislative body in the 
western world.
<P>
	The average in electoral turnover for this House certainly 
since the war and for a longer period-I do not have the figures 
here for the longer period-has been at least a third of the House 
on average that has changed hands in every election. I am sure 
that number has increased as a result of the very significant 
turnover in the election in October last year when two-thirds of 
the members of the House were replaced. That kind of rate of 
turnover is one that is frankly intimidating to anyone seeking to 
enter a career in politics because it indicates that the nature of 
the position is so transient that members once elected can hardly 
be allowed to stay on for any reasonable period of time. Most 
members obviously serve less than two terms. They usually only 
serve one.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	That rate of turnover in my view not only renders the House 
somewhat less effective than it might otherwise be because it 
lacks a stable number of members who have experience and are 
able to transmit that experience to others so that the House 
functions better as a legislature which is the case in some other 
legislatures in the world, but it also makes it more difficult for 
parties to operate as national organs of the state and major 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5324"> 5324 </A></B>
<P>
players in the political process because they are unable to 
depend on having a reasonable number of members in the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	One can only look today at the Progressive Conservative 
Party which, while some members opposite may wish that it 
were not a national party, still is in some sense a national party. 
However, it has no representation effectively in this House. Of 
course I would not want to detract from the abilities of the two 
members who are here but the fact is that it is lacking national 
representation in this House.
<P>
	Bear in mind that we have in Canada a Parliament with a 
massive rate of turnover. I turn to other foreign legislatures like 
the House of Commons and ask is there a power of recall in any 
of them? The answer is no, there is not.
<P>
	I invite the hon. member for Beaver River to tell me of another 
national legislature, not a state one and not some municipality, 
that has recall. I do not know of any. I do not think there is a 
single one.
<P>
	Why should Canada be a leader in this field and change its 
electoral process when nobody else thinks this is smart? 
Everyone else thinks it is not a good idea and I suspect that 
Canadians probably on reflection ought to think very long and 
hard before they make this kind of change.
<P>
	The third factor I think is important is the length of the term to 
which members are elected to this House. It is a maximum term 
of five years. In the scheme of things that is not very long. 
Human civilization has been around for a few thousand years. 
Parliaments have been elected in the United Kingdom for 
something over 900 years. Five years in the scheme of things is 
not a long term and most terms are less than that. Five is the 
maximum and very few parliaments run to the maximum term.
<P>
	We know that Mr. Mulroney ran to a full term because he was 
afraid of a trouncing that he deservedly got at the polls. But most 
governments can approach elections with a little more 
confidence than old Mr. Mulroney could do. Of course he was so 
nervous he got out and got a successor who was less competent 
than he was in terms of electoral success. The fact that she is not 
here and that he is not here bear testimony to the fact that their 
success rate was poor.
<P>
	Again, we do not have lengthy terms in Canada. Most 
members of the House serve for a four year term and sometimes 
it is less than that. In minority parliaments it is frequently less 
than that.
<P>
	Again, why should we have recall added as an extra burden to 
members of Parliament? Imagine the situation. I invite the hon. 
member for Beaver River to consider this. In fact the hon. 
member for Edmonton North in a brilliant Standing Order 31 
yesterday pointed out that since the election in October last year 
the polls in the province of Alberta indicated that the Liberals 
have moved from 25 per cent in the actual vote to 52 per cent  of 
the electorate in Alberta. She should be quaking in her boots 
with news like that because if her bill was law now everybody 
would be running around her riding signing up people to get her 
out. I do not think that is reasonable.
<P>
	I like the hon. member for Beaver River. I would feel badly if 
she were not here. The fact is she has been elected for a term and 
I am delighted that she is here to serve her term. I look forward 
to the next election. Maybe one or both of us will not be here to 
serve in the House after that. Why should she be put in the 
position of having to run to Beaver River and work in her riding 
day and night to get petitions signed to stop people from getting 
her out on a recall? I do not think that is a reasonable 
expenditure of time on her part. I would rather see her here 
having her ideas exposed in the House so the voters of Beaver 
River and the voters of Canada can understand Reform policy. 
The longer she is here, frankly the better it is for us.
<P>
	I think she knows that. She would not want to face recall. 
Maybe that is why it is being proposed. I do not know. But that is 
being mischievous.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	The other argument that I think is important in this is that the 
notion of recall is founded on the idea that members of 
Parliament are delegates for their communities. In other words 
the member of Parliament is not to think an independent thought 
ever. The member of Parliament is to voice the concerns of the 
majority of his or her community only and never think an 
original thought.
<P>
	I do not agree that that is the case. I think many members of 
the public vote for a member of Parliament not because they 
think the person is a great delegate or will do exactly as they say. 
They choose a member of Parliament because they expect the 
MP to exercise some judgment on issues that cannot be foretold 
at an election but are not expected to come up and expect the MP 
to exercise his or her best judgment and make a decision that is 
in the interests not just of their own community, which of course 
is important, but in the interests of Canada as a whole.
<P>
	I realize that with two opposition parties that are very 
regionalized in their approach this is a tough argument to make 
in this House, but it is a very important argument because 
members of Parliament are elected to represent not just their 
own communities but to represent all of Canada.
<P>
	Each one of us assumes some national responsibility. We 
exemplify it in our travels across this country when we speak to 
Canadians in every part of our land.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5325"> 5325 </A></B>
<P>
	I am proud as an MP for Kingston and the Islands to go to 
British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Prince 
Edward Island or Beaver River and speak to electors in those 
areas and learn about their concerns and appreciate them so that 
when I exercise my judgment in voting for government 
estimates and for bills in this House I can give some expression 
to what I think is in the national interest.
<P>
	It may not always be fully in accord with everything my 
constituents tell me but it normally is something that is in the 
best interests of Canadians as a whole.
<P>
	Hon. members laugh but I tell them we have had more 
members on this side of the House vote different ways on issues 
than we have had from that party. Every vote in this House has 
been unanimous as far as the Reform Party is concerned and it is 
the party of the free vote.
<P>
	Is that really free? I do not want to get into free votes but I am 
telling hon. members that if they listen to the concerns of other 
Canadians, if they go around the country as I have done and as I 
know some of them do, they will hear about these concerns. 
They will realize that if they are going to express the national 
will sometimes they are going to have to change their views.
<P>
	We see these views changing now. We see the views of the 
Reform Party change from day to day and week to week. Frankly 
some of us are delighted to see that.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Several times a day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I think my hon. friend is being unkind to say 
several times a day.
<P>
	The other thing we have to stress is the need for members of 
Parliament when elected to withstand the ups and downs of 
popularity. I know that the hon. member for Beaver River must 
be suffering a little now because if the Liberals are 52 per cent 
the Reform must be at something else in Alberta and it has to be 
something considerably less than 52. I do not know what it is. 
Maybe she knows the figures and would like to tell us about that 
in a subsequent speech.
<P>
	The fact is our popularity will go up and down. I know that our 
popularity stayed very high for a long time. My suspicion is it 
will stay high for a while yet but there will be a day, I am sure, 
when our popularity will go down. However, I do not think that 
parties and members of Parliament should be put in a position 
where they can be recalled, particularly at the nadir, when things 
are in real trouble for the party because things have gone wrong.
<P>
	In a cycle of four or five years there are ups and down. I 
believe that members should be free to serve their term to the 
end and express the views of their constituents and of the 
country and vote in accordance with that combination of wishes 
that are known to them by Canadians across this land.
<P>
	I hope that would be the case and that we would not seek to 
regionalize our party structure, our representation, by 
instituting recall on members so that at times of difficulty they 
face recall.
<P>
	I urge members on all sides of the House to consider that very 
carefully in their votes on this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the beginning 
of my address to the assembly I would like to remind the Bloc 
member who spoke a while back of the incident of the recall that 
occurred in Arizona approximately eight years ago.
<P>
	We do not have to go back to 1920 to see the power of recall in 
the state of Arizona where the governor of that state was recalled 
when the people would no longer accept his leadership.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe that the collective wisdom of the people is always 
greater and superior to that of a handful of politicians, 
regardless of how wise or intelligent they may appear to be. 
Therefore, whenever it is practical and possible we ought to be 
doing the business of the people by the voice of the people.
<P>
	I know of a country with a population of less than seven 
million people with very few natural resources, a harsh climate 
and 25 per cent of its land area covered by mountains. It has four 
official language groups, many ethnic sub-groups and large 
regional economic disparities. You would think that this country 
would be riddled with economic and social strife but nothing 
could be further from the truth. This country has had the highest 
standard of living in the world for the past 50 years, never more 
than 1.5 per cent unemployment. Inflation is never higher than4 per cent and interest rates are always about 6 per cent.
<P>
	It has the extensive high quality health and educational 
services, generous social services, which I might add are for the 
truly needy, especially the handicapped, and world class public 
transportation.
<P>
	In proportion to population this country has a smallest civil 
service in Europe, the lowest tax rates and the smallest national 
budget.
<P>
	Why does this country enjoy such economic and social 
success which is currently such a contrast to the Canadian 
situation? Switzerland, has a recipe for success. It is called the 
devolution of power. The Swiss have government of the people, 
by the people and for the people. What a novel idea this country, 
Switzerland. It is a democracy. The power is literally in the 
hands of the people. I rise today in support of private member's 
Bill C-210 which seeks to move the power to where it belongs 
by providing the electorate with a higher degree of involvement 
and responsibility within the political process. I support what 
may be considered the first step toward the devolution of power

in a country where for too long we have had government of the 
politicians, by the politicians, for the politicians.
<P>
	What have we in Canada? We have top down rule. If the 
system worked, we would support it but this system has 
produced a debt of half a trillion dollars. We are promised 
another hundred billion in debt over the next three years. We 
have a criminal justice system that does not protect society and a 
parole system that turns murderers and rapists back on to the 
streets to conduct their criminal activities over and over again. 
The system is simply not working and it has to be reformed.
<P>
	The tendency of previous governments has been to increase 
their own power by employing closed door policies. Only an 
exclusive few, the cabinet of the federal government, influenced 
by special interest and lobby groups, have formed the policy 
making functions. Canadian citizens have been excluded from 
participating in the forum which decides how their daily lives 
will be affected.
<P>
	The effective communication between citizens and their 
representatives has been cut off. Politicians are not accountable 
to their electorate on a day to day basis and rather than seeking 
to gain public confidence through listening and accommodating 
public concerns, elected officials have spent their time selling 
the government's programs and legislation to the people. 
Ottawa spends millions of dollars on advertising to convince 
Canadians that the policies are good. The media blitz on the 
GST, the Charlottetown referendum and the little known Canada 
buy into it scheme never amounted to anything but another 
waste of taxpayers' money. This would never happen in 
Switzerland.
<P>
	I am committed to changing this autocratic means of decision 
making by restoring power to its rightful owners, the people.
<P>
	Recall, a procedure that allows the voters to call their 
representatives to account before the end of their normal term, is 
but one step in many to putting the power back in the hands of 
the electorate. I do not know of any other job in Canada where a 
person cannot be removed from their position for improper 
conduct or for not doing their job, except for the positions 
occupied by politicians. The people of Canada must have the 
right to fire their hired hands.
<P>
	Elected officials cannot be fired by the very people who hired 
them to do the job except every four or five years at election 
time. This leaves the impression that politicians are above the 
rules and regulations that govern the average Canadian worker. 
Allowing an elected official immunity from misconduct or 
incompetence is an absurdity which has added to the current 
level of political apathy.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	Recall offers voters the chance to compel their 
representatives to do their jobs and to account for their actions. 
It offers them the opportunity to remove elected officials from 
their positions if they fail to measure up. We believe in the 
people's right to govern themselves through truly representative 
and responsible institutions  and that the duty of elected 
representatives to their constituents should supersede their 
obligation to their political parties.
<P>
	When MPs vanish into the disciplinary maw of the 
parliamentary hierarchies, becoming indifferent to 
constituents' beliefs and preferences, the electorate becomes 
disillusioned about the prospect for democracy.
<P>
	Author William Mishler says: ``Political attitudes and 
behaviour are learned. The political apathy and inactivity 
characteristic of large segments of the Canadian public are not 
intrinsic to man's basic nature. They are neither inevitable or 
immutable. The decision to participate in or abstain from 
politics is to a substantial degree a conditioned response to the 
political environment''.
<P>
	Our political system has bred the attitude that the government 
does not care what people think and that those elected to 
Parliament have lost touch with the people. The political 
environment has produced a nation of cynics who hold 
politicians in contempt. The Tories learned this lesson all too 
well during the last election.
<P>
	Recall will force elected representatives to open the doors of 
communication with their constituents, thereby enhancing the 
dialogue between them, a dialogue which lies at the core of the 
representative process. It will also help restore mutual respect 
between the electorate and the politicians.
<P>
	Recall would put in place the checks and balances to remove 
the monopoly of power held by Parliament today. Recall will be 
the beginning of increased citizen participation whereby 
representatives become responsible and accountable to those 
who work for them on a day to day basis rather than every four of 
five years at election time.
<P>
	The Swiss know that if democracy is to be meaningful, it has 
to be a bottom up system of popular government. They are not 
content with mere parliamentary sovereignty like ours in which 
all the power is delegated to their representatives. The Swiss can 
force a vote on all legislation and have the power to initiate 
legislation.
<P>
	You would never have a situation in Switzerland where, as 
here, 80 per cent of the people want less government spending 
but Parliament increases it or the people do not want to dish out 
money to interest groups but the government does it anyway.
<P>
	The Swiss have had a system of initiative, referendum and 
recall since 1874 and the value of this process is seen in the 
results. The federal debt in Switzerland is 16.3 per cent of the 
GDP. Compare that to our federal debt and GDP ratio of 67.6 per 
cent. We have a debt of over half a trillion dollars, growing 
every minute of the day.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5327"> 5327 </A></B>
<P>
	It appalls me even to mention what the overall GDP debt ratio 
is in this country. Our combined federal-provincial-territorial 
debt is 97.7 per cent of GDP. The overall Swiss debt is 36.6 per 
cent. Switzerland has very low taxes and an unemployment rate 
that never goes much above 1.5 per cent while we have one of 
the highest taxation rates in the world, and an unemployment 
rate of 10.6 per cent. If we want the same results, perhaps it is 
time we started giving the power back to the people.
<P>
	Recall is but one step, the first step toward government of the 
people, by the people and for the people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it had not initially been my intention to speak on Bill 
C-210-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> But you are provoked.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> -but as the hon. member for Kingston and the 
Islands has just said so eloquently, I feel provoked into saying 
something about what the members have said. The last speaker 
made our country sound as though crime was rampant 
everywhere, that we have so much debt that this is the worst 
place that anyone would want to go to and has described such our 
great country of Canada.
<P>
	Where he has said that apathy is rampant among voters, 80 per 
cent of Canadians vote compared to roughly half of that amount 
in the United States, that great bastion of recall in the few places 
where it exists. The member makes no apologies for making 
those kinds of statements to the House days after the United 
Nations has said that this is the best place in the world to live, 
not the worst. We are talking about this business of recall and 
how recall would, in the opinion of the member who has just 
spoken, increase the sense of belonging of Canadians. What I 
see is one party on the government side with representatives 
from all parts of the country. I say to hon. members that the party 
that is in government now represents all parts of the country and 
therefore represents the views of at least the majority, and 
hopefully even more than that, of Canadians. At least recent 
public opinion polls seem to suggest that.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	On the other hand the members who have made disparaging 
remarks about everything from this parliamentary institution to 
the country as a whole are now saying: ``Give us recall and 
Canadians will want to belong''. There is something wrong with 
the argument. We have two opposition parties, each one of them 
being regional in nature, each one of them, may I respectfully 
suggest, not having what I consider-and I know this is a 
question of debate-the best interests of the country at heart.
<P>
	They may argue that they have. As I say, it is a question of 
debate. Certainly in the case of one party they want to destroy 
the country as we know it. In the other case it is a little less clear.
<P>
	Needless to say, both opposition parties, and in particular the 
one which is pushing for the recall, acknowledge or at least they 
should acknowledge that their view is a minority one at best. 
They claim that recall is the view of the majority but they are 
suggesting it from a minority standpoint where they are 
themselves situated. I have some difficulty in trying to follow 
the logic in their thinking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It is illogical.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Maybe it is illogical.
<P>
	They are saying in this bill that if one-half of the voters in the 
last election who cast their votes asked for a recall, then there 
should be one.
<P>
	Let us see what is wrong with that argument, if we can get into 
the technical merits of the bill. We have a country where we had 
14 political parties at the last election. In most constituencies 
across the way, may I suggest, members were elected with less 
than 50 per cent of the votes.
<P>
	This means that anyone who did not vote for them in the last 
election could immediately initiate a recall afterward for every 
single member that was elected with less than 50 per cent of the 
vote.
<P>
	We have five political parties represented in the House. How 
many members, particularly on the opposition side, were 
elected with more than 50 per cent of the votes in their ridings? 
Some were and some were not. For everyone who was not 
elected with 50 per cent or more of the votes, is that in itself 
grounds for recall? It would be under this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Read the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I have read the bill. I could give the Table a 
copy of the red book. It has more than 200 words in it. Say that a 
copy of the red book is tabled along with a covering letter. I have 
provided the 200 words necessary to initiate recall in a riding of 
an hon. member that got less than 50 per cent of the votes. I am 
indicating a way in which members who are democratically 
elected could be turfed out.
<P>
	How would we measure the performance of a member of 
Parliament? Perhaps a member of Parliament said something 
really dumb either here or elsewhere. As a hypothetical 
situation, say someone said, not that anyone ever would, that 
this country is too Frenchified or that people have certain south 
seas tendencies or that people have some other behavioural 
deficiencies as measured by such an hon. member, were such a 
member to exist.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5328"> 5328 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	What then? Are those grounds to initiate a recall? Let us say a 
party took a nosedive in the public opinion poll in western 
Canada. It is a hypothetical proposition, but would it be grounds 
for initiating a recall?
<P>
	It certainly could be grounds for recall. After all, they have 
taken a nosedive in public opinion in western Canada, just as a 
hypothetical proposition of course. It seems that many people do 
not want them now and if they do not want them maybe they 
should be removed from office.
<P>
	What kind of sense does that make? None. That is why the bill 
makes no sense.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I have no intention whatsoever of endorsing, 
voting for or otherwise expressing support for such an initiative. 
This idea which we can liken to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's belief 
that there is an omnipresent common will is false. It is 
especially false in a country as vast as ours. The party opposite 
compares Canada with Switzerland, a country only slightly 
larger that the Island of Montreal. This is the kind of comparison 
it wants to make. If it flies in Switzerland, surely it will fly in 
Canada, they say. Well, in many respects, this argument does not 
wash.
<P>
	Hon. members, in particular those from more remote regions, 
know full well that what is good for one riding is not necessarily 
good for another and that what is good for one town in a riding is 
not necessarily so for another community in the same riding. 
There is a flaw in the argument that one should always vote as a 
delegate, instead of exercising some leadership. This approach 
would not work in a country with many political parties, even if 
the other criteria were to apply.
<P>
	Many people are of this opinion. Speaking before a 
parliamentary committee the other day, Dr. Robert Jackson, a 
professor at Carleton University, had this to say, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Would introducing recall of MPs, more referenda and 
decreasing party discipline increase the prestige, especially the 
functioning of the House of Commons?''. The answer is no.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
So said Dr. Robert Jackson while testifying before a 
parliamentary committee.
<P>
	If members want to gain more esteem in the public's eye, they 
will accomplish this goal by doing their job, by being vigilant, 
by assuming leadership, moral or otherwise, when leadership is 
called for. Heaven knows that in this day and age, what we need 
is leadership, not people who change their minds every day, or 
even three or four times a day, on the same issue. That is not the 
way for this House to gain the respect of Canadians.
<P>
	I have had the honour of being elected several times to this 
House, of serving at the provincial and municipal levels and of 
working in other capacities. I do not know if I will be re-elected, 
since that is for the people to decide, but I am sure about one 
thing. We cannot gauge public opinion each morning by sticking 
our finger out the window to see which way the wind is blowing. 
That is not the way to provide leadership in Canada. We are 
providing leadership by setting out a program and by coming to 
Ottawa to do what is best for the people of Canada, the most 
beautiful and one of the largest countries in the world, and, 
according to the UN, the best country in the world in which to 
live.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate 
with the hon. member for Laval East, I want to express my 
thanks to the member for Beaver River and her colleagues for 
their co-operation.
<P>
	Due to an oversight I failed to recognize the hon. member for 
Laval East in a previous round and I extend my thanks again to 
the hon. member for Beaver River and her colleagues.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first 
like to thank the member for Beaver River for initiating this 
debate on the recall of members of the House of Commons. We 
feel it is important, in the present political context, to question 
whether the behaviour and actions of elected officials are in line 
with the concerns and expectations of citizens.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	It is essential that we consider this issue, because Canadians 
and Quebecers are losing faith in the ability of politicians to 
solve current problems. The disillusionment and cynicism of the 
electorate may be related to the behaviour of some elected 
officials.
<P>
	Bill C-210 obliges all parliamentarians to ask themselves 
what are the great democratic principles to which Quebecers and 
Canadians subscribe. As the member for Beaver River noted on 
April 29, citizens ``are demanding that political institutions and 
politicians listen to them, consult with them, and ultimately be 
accountable to them''.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, itself born of the will of a people 
marching towards sovereignty, shares this ideal. I want to 
remind members of this House that we are very attentive to and 
concerned about the shortcomings in the Canadian 
representation process. The will of the people is sometimes not 
reflected in this process. Yet, we are elected by our constituents. 
They pay for our decisions and consequently we should 
represent them during our term in office.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5329"> 5329 </A></B>
<P>
	I feel that these same observations and legitimate concerns 
led the Reform Party to adopt what they have termed the 
``recall'' principle and to bring this bill to the attention of the 
House today. Despite the good intentions behind the Reform 
Party's demands, I must ask members of this House to oppose 
Bill C-210.
<P>
	Once adopted, this kind of legislation might not produce the 
desired results. The result might be the political instability so 
dreaded by some federalists. When we realize that many 
members were elected without obtaining an absolute majority, 
that is, 50 per cent of the votes, this is indeed a concern.
<P>
	The political rivals of elected representatives might get 
together and have a petition signed to recall embers elected with 
less than 50 per cent of the popular vote. How can we ensure that 
member recall does not become a partisan tool to get rid of 
political opponents?
<P>
	This bill raises more questions than it answers. For instance, 
in section 10, it says, and I quote: ``The Clerk shall not accept an 
application for the recall of any one member more than once 
during the duration of a Parliament''. Does this mean that a 
member who wants to make sure he is not recalled by his 
constituents can set up a bogus petition that would immediately 
be considered inadmissible?
<P>
	Another point which the Reform Party did not raise but which 
we think is essential is the funding of the activities involved in a 
petition for recall. The serious issue of political party financing 
and the financing of groups that organize petitions does not 
appear to interest the federalist parties, but to us it is crucial.
<P>
	We must not try to usurp the powers of elected representatives 
and hand them over to interest groups that are prepared to invest 
enough money and are able to threaten or actually organize 
petitions for recall.
<P>
	I would urge hon. members who are concerned about respect 
for democratic principles to read carefully and support 
vigorously motion No. 155 tabled in this House by the hon. 
member for Richelieu.
<P>
	In any event, I would also urge hon. members to consider what 
happened to the only bill similar to the one presented today by 
the Reform Party, which was ever passed in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	In 1936, the Legislative Assembly (Recall) Act was brought 
in by the Social Credit Premier of Alberta, William Aberhart. 
The very next year, citizens of Alberta tried to exercise this 
power of recall against their Premier. Feeling trapped, the 
Socred government eventually repealed the act and declared 
void all ongoing recall procedures. This Canadian experience 
alone clearly shows the vulnerability of such a bill.
<P>
	This procedure is said to exist in many American States but is 
so seldom used that one can wonder about its reliability. As for 
recall being a sword of Damocles dangling over the heads of 
members of Parliament, I am of the opinion that the respect I 
owe my constituents should not be a matter of the carrot and the 
stick. Instead, a relationship based on trust and respect must be 
established between the voters and their elected representatives.
<P>
	I will repeat that the reason the Bloc opposes Bill C-210 is 
because it considers the proposed recall procedure both 
impractical and impracticable. Other ways must be sought to 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the democratic 
process. And I would say that the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs is doing just that; it is examining a 
number of ways to do so.
<P>
	Our opposition to recall through petition must not be 
construed as support for the current system. We are fully aware 
of the failure of politicians in terms of representativeness at the 
federal level. We are the first to disparage this failed system.
<P>
	Until the Bloc Quebecois arrived in this House, Quebecers 
sent members to defend their interests in the House of Commons 
year after year. Quebec politicians of great merit and with lofty 
ideals came to Ottawa to ensure that Quebec finally got its share 
within this federation. One after the other, they got caught up in 
a system that made them forget why Quebecers elected them. 
Our members changed. They came here as Quebecers' 
representatives to the federal government. After a while, they 
became the federal government's representatives to the Quebec 
people. They sometimes reluctantly neglected Quebec's 
interests in order to please their leaders, their officials, their 
colleagues from the nine other provinces or their caucus.
<P>
	Quebecers in the four major national parties could only count 
on one member out of four to defend their interests. Politicians 
were destroyed by the vicious circle of the federal system 
putting Quebec at a disadvantage. However, since the Canadian 
federal steamroller was stronger, they resigned themselves or 
went home completely disillusioned.
<P>
	It took time but Quebecers managed to end this vicious circle. 
Without having to use petitions for recall, Quebecers in a 
democratic vote last October 25 decided to send to Ottawa54 elected members fundamentally dedicated to the defence of 
Quebec's interests. We intend to continue to defend their 
interests and to be vigilant.
<P>
	Nevertheless, we do not want a partisan debate on whether or 
not members should be recalled on the basis of citizens' 
petitions. I would simply remind my friends in the Reform Party 
that we share their fears about certain elected members not 
meeting their basic commitments. However, recalling such 
members is not a solution; on the contrary, it is likely to make 
the problems of Canada's political system worse.

<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="OFFICIALLANGUAGES">OFFICIAL LANGUAGES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to discuss the status of official languages, particularly in the 
Department of National Defence and in the Canadian Armed 
Forces. In recent months, and especially since the closure of the 
military college in Saint-Jean, a lot has been said on the current 
language situation in the armed forces, as well as on the 
somewhat idealistic intentions and promises of the defence 
minister concerning the future of French in the armed forces.
<P>
	In 1963, through the royal commission on bilingualism, 
Prime Minister Pearson made substantial changes to the drafting 
of the Official Languages Act. As early as 1966, General Allard, 
who was the first French-Canadian to become Chief of Staff, 
published directives recognizing the equal status of the French 
and English languages in the armed forces, as well as the right of 
every person to serve his country in his own language.
<P>
	At the time, the Canadian forces were spearheading the 
linguistic efforts which were to follow in federal institutions. In 
1972, these efforts resulted in the first official languages plan 
for the armed forces. This was a 15-year plan. Unfortunately, in 
1987, it was discovered that several objectives had not been 
reached, in spite of all the good intentions and valiant efforts. 
That same year, a new 15-year plan, to 2002, was drafted.
<P>
	In November 1992, a report commissioned by the 
then-Minister of Defence again found flagrant and 
near-unresolvable shortcomings. Here again, with a great deal 
of good will, the armed forces had prepared incentive standards 
and changes in their official languages plan and its 
implementation. Unfortunately, we must now face the following 
facts: 40 out of68 military-career-related courses are given in both 
languages-4 out of 4 military training courses, 9 out of 14 for 
the navy, 8 out of 14 for the air force, and 19 out of the 36 
courses applicable to all three branches of the armed forces. It 
goes without saying that all 68 courses are available in English.
<P>
	There is also a shortage of French-language military training 
manuals, and bilingual instructors are in short supply; the 
majority of bilingual instructors are Francophones. The number 
of bilingual Anglophones even declined from 1972 to the end of 
1993. The number of bilingual Anglophones has now slipped to 
4,200 from 5,000 in 1972. In the officers' ranks, 18 per cent of 
senior officers are Francophones-all of them functionally 
bilingual. Only 12 per cent of anglophone officers are bilingual, 
and most learned French at the CollÃ¨ge militaire royal de 
Saint-Jean.
<P>
	It is impossible for me to list, in so little time, all of the 
shortcomings that exist, but I observed first-hand, during 
meetings and visits with the joint defence committee, that the 
army operates in English, and in both languages in Quebec. At 
the base in Saint-Hubert, Quebec, all of the briefings given to 
the defence committee were in one language only: English. So 
let us, once and for all, be realistic. Fine principles are laid out 
and dreams that, despite little success in the past-although 
commendable efforts were made, I must admit-this time, 
according to the minister, it will be allright.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the decision to close the military college in 
Saint-Jean will only exacerbate the problems which have been 
noted in the application of the department's fine principles. For 
us, it is just one more piece of evidence that the gulf between the 
two founding peoples continues to widen and that the present 
government seems to take perverse pleasure in widening that 
gulf through its harebrained decision to close the military 
college in Saint-Jean, which represented hope for the official 
languages in the Canadian armed forces.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Intergovernmental Relations and President of the Privy 
Council):</B> Mr. Speaker, the concept of a bilingual officers corps 
was adopted by the Armed Forces Council on June 28, 1988, to 
meet the needs of senior officials who had to be able to lead their 
subordinates in both official languages.
<P>
	The ``working language'' remains the main pillar of the 
official languages program, set up to allow French speaking 
soldiers to work in French and English speaking soldiers to work 
in English.
<P>
	Job and operational requirements of all units must be 
respected. There are three distinct types of units: the French 
language units, the English language units and the bilingual 
units.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A departmental committee studied the matter of language of 
work in 1992 and concluded that in the case of bilingual units, 
civilian and military personnel must be able to communicate 
with their subordinates in whichever official language those 
subordinates prefer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5331"> 5331 </A></B>
<P>
	The most recent report of the Commissioner of Official 
Languages acknowledges that progress has been made over the 
past year in the three pillars of the official languages program, 
even though according to Commissioner Goldbloom this 
progress has sometimes been slow, no doubt because of the 
complexity of the organization involved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="VIARAIL">VIA RAIL</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to pursue 
a question I asked the Minister of Transport last month about 
passenger rail service.
<P>
	In answering my question the Minister of Transport assured 
me that the government would expedite whatever measures were 
necessary to accommodate good railway service, both passenger 
and freight, in New Brunswick and in the rest of Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	In previous years members of this government protested 
loudly whenever the previous government announced any and 
all cuts to VIA. Now they seem to have no compunction about 
carrying out cuts of their own. What no one in this government 
has ever said is that it was a Liberal government which first took 
VIA service away from the people of Saint John and it was the 
Tory government which gave it back. Now our train is once 
again under the axe.
<P>
	Back in 1989 when he was a member of the opposition, the 
current minister of government services said that VIA cuts will 
separate Canadians geographically, economically and socially. 
He is absolutely right.
<P>
	In the same year the current Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
called the previous government's cuts to VIA a short-sighted 
policy that not only will deny in the short term the people of 
Canada a rail passenger service which in itself is important and 
devastating for the communities to be affected, but more 
fundamentally, it is denying Canadians as we move into the 
nineties and in the year 2000, the future.
<P>
	In 1991 the current government House leader called the 
previous government's cuts to VIA and other institutions a 
blueprint for de-Confederation.
<P>
	After making statements such as these I fail to understand 
why this government believes it can credibly defend its 
miraculous change of heart. This is also the reason I take small 
comfort in the Minister of Transport's assurances when he says 
he and his government will do what is necessary to preserve 
good railway service.
<P>
	In his speech on June 3 in Thunder Bay, Ontario, the Minister 
of Transport said that the rail industry is gripped by problems of 
overregulation, of mismanagement, of overcapacity, of 
financial losses, of archaic work practices, of out of date 
legislation. Later on the same day the minister said: Canadians 
over the decades have constructed one of the most sophisticated 
and successful transportation systems in the world.
<P>
	If one is not left unsure about what the minister actually 
thinks about our rail industry, one is at least forced to ask: If the 
minister believes his first statement, why does he not help 
reorganize the railway instead of walking away from the 
problem? Instead of cutting back on services and allowing the 
abandonment of lines, why does he not make the industry put its 
house in order?
<P>
	I do not feel that all the blame about the problems facing the 
railway industry should be put on the shoulders of the unions.
<P>
	In the same speech the minister said Canada needs a 
transportation system that contributes constructively to 
Canada's economic well-being. He also said that within Canada 
itself the cost of transporting goods is equally important. Forty 
per cent of provincial exports are sold in regions of Canada other 
than where they are produced. Transportation is an integral part 
of the everyday lives of millions of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	I would argue that maintaining the entire line from Saint John 
to Sherbrooke is vital if we want manufacturers in the region and 
users of our port to have adequate access to central Canada and 
northeastern American markets, the bread and butter of our 
exports.
<P>
	Although there is expectation that a shortline operator will 
purchase and operate part or perhaps all of the line from Saint 
John to Sherbrooke, the people of Saint John feel that the status 
quo should be maintained. Abandonment is wrong. For the 
economic well-being of our entire region a direct line is vital.
<P>
	I repeat now what I said when I originally asked the minister 
the question a month ago. VIA's Atlantic train between Halifax 
and Montreal is well used and important to the people of Saint 
John. With this in mind, I ask the minister to further clarify how 
his government plans to ensure good railway service in our 
region.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the question of VIA nothing could 
be further from the truth than what the member has just said. 
This government has not announced any service cutbacks to VIA 
nor will it until the negotiations are finalized.
<P>
	I want to deal with the specific question of May 12, 1994 
regarding the possible requirement for an amendment to the 
National Transportation Act to allow for the continuation of 
VIA passenger operations over the lines of a provincial shortline 
railway.
<P>
	CP has narrowed down its list of potential new operators for 
its Canadian Atlantic railway lines to two: Cantrak and 
Guilford. Although I am not privy to CP's plans, we have all 
heard that CP may be announcing the successful finalist 
sometime in June.
<P>
	Details about a conveyance agreement between CP and the 
new operator are unknown to this government at this time. If an 
agreement is reached and filed with the National Transportation 
Agency before the end of 1994  when the abandonment order 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5332"> 5332 </A></B>
<P>
takes effect, then the agreement information becomes public 
and will shed light on the issue of federal-provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	With an agreement being filed, the agency as required under 
the National Transportation Act would have up to six months to 
approve the conveyance agreement, if it is in the public interest 
and if the purchaser is authorized to operate a railway.
<P>
	If no agreement is filed before January 1995, then the 
Canadian rail line segments which have been approved for 
abandonment would no longer come under federal jurisdiction. 
In this case the contents of the conveyance agreement would 
become known if CP Limited chose to reveal any of this 
information. Hence we may not know until then whether or not 
the new operator will come under the legislative authority of 
Parliament or under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	At the present time VIA operates over CP lines under a train 
service agreement. The NTA provides protection of existing 
VIA passenger service in the event that the conveyance by 
vesting any obligations related to VIA services with the new 
owner of the conveyed line. Under these circumstances 
accommodation for VIA would have to be built into an 
agreement between CP and the rail company to which the lines 
are conveyed.
<P>
	The National Transportation Act would not prevent VIA from 
operating over the lines of a rail company that is not within the 
legislative authority of Parliament. After all, VIA currently 
operates over trackage through Maine which is under U.S. 
federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	In closing, owing to the speculative nature of the question and 
lack of a clear demonstration that legislative amendments or 
other changes will be required at this time, I can only reiterate 
the minister's assurance to the hon. member for Saint John. The 
government will expedite legislative changes or other 
regulatory modifications if and when they are required to 
accommodate good passenger and freight railway service in 
New Brunswick and the rest of Atlantic Canada.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on June 3 I rose in the House during Question Period to 
ask the federal government to address the grievances of Indian 
veterans.
<P>
	At this time when Canadians from coast to coast are beginning 
to celebrate the 50th anniversary of various events that led up to 
the end of the second world war in 1944, it seems unreasonable 
to leave the grievances of aboriginal veterans unresolved. These 
grievances concern the benefits aboriginal veterans received for 
their services in the first world war, the second world war, and 
the Korean war and these grievances are long standing.
<P>
	The National Indian Veterans Association and the 
Saskatchewan Indian Veterans Association have worked hard to 
bring these issues to the attention of the public. Aboriginal 
veterans have told their stories many times before. They have 
told about Canada's demand that a person of aboriginal descent 
had to give up their Indian status to contribute to the war efforts. 
They have told about the bureaucratic nightmare that resulted 
from the clash of Canadian laws and policies derived from the 
Indian Act, the Soldier Settlement Act and the Veterans Act.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	Aboriginal leaders have told about the uneven distribution of 
veterans benefits to First Nation and aboriginal veterans. They 
have told about the educational and vocational assistance that 
was not provided to them and they have told about the unequal 
granting of hospital and medical benefits because they were 
Indians under the jurisdiction of the Indian Act.
<P>
	These grievances are not easily dismissed. We have even been 
told about the surrender of First Nations land that was later used 
for soldiers settlements after the war, the surrender of land that 
was Indian land to begin with.
<P>
	A number of proposals have been put forward to help resolve 
these issues and I would like to ask the government to respond to 
these requests immediately. The first short term 
recommendation is that Canada make available resources in 
order for the aboriginal war veterans associations, the Legions 
and other organizations in the regions of Canada to be annually 
represented at ceremonies in the nation's capital on 
Remembrance Day.
<P>
	In the longer term Canada must continue to address the 
benefits issues and make available to all aboriginal veterans the 
same benefits that were available to all returning Canadian war 
veterans. This must be researched and reimbursement of those 
lost benefits must be paid to these people if they are living and if 
not, to their descendants.
<P>
	I think there are other remedies that must be considered, not 
the least of which are the payment of compensation for 
expropriated land and the reinstatement of offspring of First 
Nations aboriginal war veterans who were affected by the 
involuntary loss of status associated with their joining up with 
the forces.
<P>
	First Nations people willingly volunteered their services in 
the belief that they were helping Canada. Now Canada must take 
the opportunity to right the wrongs and the injustices.
<P>
	When I first raised this question in the House of Commons 
earlier this month the minister responsible for veterans said that 
he was not aware of any such injustices. As we speak, Mr. 
Speaker, you and most members of this House are aware that the 
members of the Senate are conducting public hearings on this 
very important subject and in just a few days the Indian veterans 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5333"> 5333 </A></B>
<P>
are meeting in  conference in Saskatoon to further add to the 
growing evidence in support of their arguments.
<P>
	In this regard I call upon the government, not just the minister 
responsible for veterans, but the entire government, the Prime 
Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of National 
Defence, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, any minister in the government across the way to 
recognize the seriousness of this question and take steps 
immediately to begin the process of resolving these important 
matters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have 
the opportunity to respond in greater detail to the concerns 
raised by the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake 
that aboriginal veterans have not been treated the same as other 
war veterans.
<P>
	When the National Aboriginal Veterans Association first 
raised allegations of unfair treatment in the early 1980s Veterans 
Affairs Canada asked it to bring forward any case in which a 
veteran believed that unfair discriminatory treatment had been 
received.
<P>
	Several hundred cases have been put forward since that time. 
All were thoroughly reviewed and not one provided any 
evidence to suggest that there had been any unfair or 
discriminatory treatment.
<P>
	In addition to these file reviews the National Aboriginal 
Veterans Association was provided office space and 
administrative help by Veterans Affairs to assist it with the 
development of its report to the royal commission on aboriginal 
peoples.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the association's extensive research and file 
reviews, no evidence of maladministration was cited by the 
National Aboriginal Veterans Association in its report to the 
royal commission.
<P>
	Turning to the legislation itself, if hon. members review any 
of the veterans legislation they will find that the definition of 
veteran makes no distinction between aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal veterans. Simply put, a veteran is anyone who 
has served in the armed forces or the merchant navy during 
wartime.
<P>
	The one instance in which it was necessary to make special 
reference to aboriginal veterans was in the Veterans Land Act. 
The purpose of that reference was to ensure that Indian veterans 
living on Indian reserves were able to obtain benefits under that 
act.
<P>
	The fact is that no allegation of discrimination has any basis 
in veterans legislation. There is no discrimination in the law and 
again the report submitted by the National Aboriginal Veterans 
Association to the royal commission confirmed the conclusion 
that veterans legislation does not discriminate against 
aboriginal veterans.
<P>
	In view of this background and in view of the comments of the 
hon. member, the position taken by the Secretary of State for 
Veterans in response to the hon. member's question earlier and 
today is the best possible approach.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	If the hon. member is aware of any veteran's case as he 
suggested that he is today, aboriginal or non-aboriginal, any 
case in which discrimination or unfair treatment is alleged, 
bring that case to the secretary's attention and it will be, I assure 
members, thoroughly reviewed and any appropriate action taken 
without delay.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to take this opportunity to address again the subject of 
pay-per-view television.
<P>
	Two proposals were submitted to the CRTC: one by Astral and 
one by Chapiteau, a consortium formed by the CBC's French 
network, TVA, TQS, Radio-QuÃ©bec and Cogeco. Neither 
proposal was accepted. The commissioners, who could not agree 
among themselves, refused to issue a licence for one of the two 
tv proposals aimed at francophones.
<P>
	Three commissioners, two francophones and chairman Keith 
Spicer, agreed with Chapiteau, but they were the minority. 
However, we are talking about a vital instrument for the 
development of French culture, which would have competed 
with English language specialized channels and new U.S. tv 
content.
<P>
	Pay-per-view television is a relative newcomer to Canadian 
tv. In March 1991, Viewer's Choice Canada, a joint venture, 
obtained a network licence to offer a pay-per-view television 
service.
<P>
	In Montreal, VidÃ©otron subscribers, the majority of whom are 
francophones, already have access to English-language 
pay-per-view television via the Viewer's Choice channel, in 
which Astral has a majority interest.
<P>
	The Quebec Minister of Culture has asked the federal 
government to review the CRTC's decision. It is unacceptable 
that francophones should be deprived of this service. We are 
being deprived of an optional cultural channel that is an 
indispensable adjunct to developing the creative potential of 
Quebecers and francophones in Canada.
<P>
	This decision totally ignores Quebec's position on the 
development of new tv services. This comes in addition to the 
judgment by the Supreme Court on telephone services and the 
federal government's failure to allow Quebec to control its own 
instruments for economic and cultural development.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5334"> 5334 </A></B>
<P>
	We cannot tolerate this situation. The minister must 
intervene, first in cabinet, and then demand that the CRTC, as 
provided under section 28(1) of the Broadcasting Act, amend its 
recent decision.
<P>
	We cannot tolerate that the CRTC, as a result of this decision, 
should treat francophones differently. We are simply asking for 
fair treatment.
<P>
	At the same time, the CRTC issued eight out of ten licences to 
English-language channels, which means francophones have to 
pay for channels whose programming does not necessarily 
reflect their concerns or cultural interests.
<P>
	Not surprisingly, we are not satisfied with this outcome, and 
our conclusion is that our interests are not well served. I would 
therefore ask the minister to refer the issue to cabinet and have 
the CRTC review its recent decision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Intergovernmental Relations and President of the Privy 
Council):</B> Mr. Speaker, concerning the request by the hon. 
member for Chicoutimi that the minister personally call upon 
Cabinet to enforce section 28(1) of the Broadcast Act and to 
change the CRTC's decision, I would like to inform the hon. 
member that when the CRTC refuses to grant a broadcasting 
license, the government cannot invoke the provisions of the 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	However, I would like to indicate that the refusal of the two 
pay-per-view television proposals does not mean that the CRTC 
has no intention of encouraging French language television 
services. On the contrary, I am pleased to note that the 
francophone market will have the benefit of two new French 
language services.
<P>
	In addition, the CRTC has clearly let it be known that it is 
ready to receive and consider new applications to offer French 
language television services and specifically French language 
pay-per-view services.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, when an application has been refused, as was the 
case with the applications submitted by Canal PremiÃ¨re and 
Chapiteau, the government has no authority to cancel or 
overturn the CRTC's decision.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.55 p.m., this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
