<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN MILLENNIUM SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I am now ready to rule on the question of 
privilege raised by the House Leader of the Official Opposition 
on October 19, 1998, concerning the Canada Millennium Scolarship 
Foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to thank all the hon. members who made 
comments on this matter: the Leader of the Government in the 
House, the hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill and the hon. member 
for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader of the official opposition has recalled a 
matter which had been previously raised by the hon. member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill on February 26, 1998 concerning the Canada 
millennium scholarship foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his submission the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford argued 
that an issue relating to the February 26 question of privilege 
remained unresolved.  That issue was the allocation of money for 
the establishment of the foundation before parliament had the 
opportunity to consider the matter. He deplored the fact that 
there had been no legislation setting up this foundation, nor had 
the budget announcement allocating $2.5 billion to the foundation 
been adopted.  In his opinion this constitutes a contempt of 
parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been several months since this matter was first raised and 
I took it upon myself to refresh my memory as to the sequence of 
events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Millennium Scholarship Foundation was refferred to in 
general terms in the Speech from the Throne in September 1997, 
and was subsequently a provision of the Budget presented on 
February 24, 1998. This Budget was adopted by the House on March 
10, 1998, and Bill C-36, the legislation implementing its 
provisions, was introduced on March 19, 1998, and was given Royal 
Assent on June 18, 1998. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budgets by nature refer to actions the government intends to 
take and often include the proposed amount of money to be 
allocated.  The announcement of such policies does not preclude 
parliament from making a decision on the subsequent implementing 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In support of his argument the hon. member referred to new 
evidence relating to this matter.  In particular, he alluded to 
the auditor general's report to parliament as well as an article 
that appeared in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> on October 18, 1998.  The 
member quoted from this article in support of the view that the 
government had not followed proper accounting practices when it 
charged the costs for the millennium scholarship fund to fiscal 
year 1997-98 when the expenditures would not take place until a 
year later.  The hon. member noted how this action by the 
government was being portrayed as a contempt of the House.  The 
member went on to state correctly that contempt of the House is a 
matter that must be resolved here in the House of Commons and 
nowhere else.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair always takes very seriously any allegation of 
contempt.  On the subject of contempt, Maingot states at page 229 
of the 2nd Edition of his work, <I>Parliamentary Privilege in 
Canada</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of 
Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which 
obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House in the 
discharge of his “parliamentary” duty, or which has a tendency, 
directly or indirectly to produce such results may be treated as 
a contempt even though there is no precedent for the offence.” 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues, in the matter before us the hon. member argues 
that the government by its accounting practice of charging the 
costs of the millennium scholarship foundation to fiscal year 
1997-98 before legislative action is taken by the House is making 
a mockery of our parliamentary system and that this constitutes 
contempt of the House.  However, as Maingot indicates, the test 
is whether the action of the government obstructs or impedes the 
House in the discharge of its parliamentary duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe the House has been obstructed or its members 
impeded in the discharge of their parliamentary duties.  Members 
have not been prevented from debating the matter at issue here, 
nor has the authority of the House been brought into question or 
circumvented.  Indeed the auditor general's reports on these 
matters are permanently referred to the Standing Committee on 
Public Accounts pursuant to Standing Order 108(3)(e) and that 
committee can pursue these matters at length and report to the 
House thereon if it so wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether or not the accounting practices of the government are 
appropriate is a matter for political debate and it is also a 
subject that members may choose to raise.  Notwithstanding the 
previous debates on the budget and the implementation 
legislation, members are not precluded from bringing up this 
issue for consideration by the House through the usual procedures 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view it is not the Speaker's role to comment on the 
government's accounting practices and interfere thereby with 
matters which the House has given to the auditor general by 
statute and to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts by 
standing order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion the information offered by the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford does not represent evidence, prima facie, of 
a contempt of parliament or a breach of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for having brought his matter to the 
attention of the House.

understand the concept of marriage as only the voluntary union of 
a single, that is, unmarried male and a single, that is, 
unmarried female, it is the duty of parliament to ensure that 
marriage, as it has always been known and understood in Canada,

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FOREIGN PUBLISHERS ADVERTISING SERVICES ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK28">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 27 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-55, an act respecting advertising services supplied 
by foreign periodical publishers, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise 
today to express my support for Bill C-55, an act respecting 
advertising services supplied by foreign periodical publishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time with the member for Parkdale—High Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenues from the sale of advertising services are part of the 
economic fabric and the very foundation of the Canadian 
periodical industry.  They play a pivotal role in supporting and 
guaranteeing the survival of the Canadian periodical industry, 
and of its Canadian content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are also one of the primary means of ensuring the vitality 
and viability of this Canadian cultural resource. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1950s less than a quarter of all magazines circulating in 
Canada were produced by Canadian publishers.  Today that number 
is nearly three-quarters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A provider of over 6,000 Canadian jobs and more than $194 
million in salaries, wages and fees, the Canadian periodical 
industry is comprised of over 1,000 small and medium sized 
companies. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will help make Canadian advertising revenues accessible 
to more Canadian publishers, a group which includes a growing 
number of young Canadians, all of them creative and talented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian periodical industry is an important vehicle for 
Canadians' ideas, values, dreams, and pride.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without continued access to revenues from the sale of 
advertising services, this success could be seriously eroded. 
Low incremental costs would allow foreign publishers to sell 
advertising services directed at the Canadian market at discount 
rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign publishers simply do not incur the costs of Canadian 
publishers because foreign publishers do not invest in producing 
content for the Canadian market.  Foreign publishers do not hire 
Canadian writers, engage Canadian photographers or other Canadian 
creative talents. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament and as Canadians, we have the duty to 
ensure that our children and grandchildren see, hear, read and 
discover the stories of their country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before the House today meets a pivotal challenge in our 
pursuit of that important promise.  The foreign publishers 
advertising services act establishes a fair and effective 
framework for the distribution of advertising dollars in the 
Canadian markets.  It will ensure that Canadian publishers 
continue to have access to the advertising revenues they need to 
thrive.  It will guarantee that only Canadian publishers will be 
able to sell advertising services aimed at Canadians.  It will 
put in place tough penalties for foreign publishers who attempt 
to go against the regulations flowing from this proposed 
legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in Canada, general interest periodicals bring in only 
about 7% of the total advertising revenues available in the 
Canadian market, the lowest share of all advertising revenues of 
the various media.  This situation is due in part to the 
presence of foreign periodicals in Canada and to the fact that 
Canadian advertising goes to foreign periodicals.> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If foreign periodical publishers were given unlimited access to 
the Canadian market, Canadian content periodicals would become 
considerably less visible. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly we need to put in place advertising measures that will 
give our periodicals a fair shake.  Clearly we must do what we 
can to enable our Canadian storytellers to tell our Canadian 
stories.  Clearly we must see to it that Canadian readers have 
the greatest access possible to those stories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister and the Minister of Canadian Heritage have 
stated time and again, Canadians must be able to see themselves 
in the stories we read and in the stories we share with the 
world. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, Canada intends to play by the rules.  So, the measure 
proposed is in keeping with our commitments to international 
trade.  Canada is a bridge builder.  Our commercial and economic 
markets are among the world's most liberalized. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this legislation Canada is upholding these roles and 
responsibilities to the fullest.  In no way will this bill affect 
the importation of foreign magazines into Canada.  In no way will 
this bill impede the access of foreign magazines to the Canadian 
market.  In no way will this bill target current advertising 
operations of foreign publishers already in the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Word for word, the foreign publishers advertising services act 
is consistent with all of Canada's international advertising 
service obligations under the general agreement on trade and 
services. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are reconciling align Canada's cultural objectives and its 
trade objectives.  We are reconciling our roles as citizens of 
Canada and of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to read more than just the articles appearing in 
<I>Maclean's</I>, <I>L'Actualité</I> and <I>Châtelaine</I>, and they also want 
greater access to more periodicals such as <I>Garden West</I> and 
<I>Safarir</I>. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will help maintain a level playing field in Canada to 
preserve a prominent place for Canadians to see their own 
reflection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's periodical industry was built by creative and talented 
individual Canadians and it has been driven to success by the 
powerful collective will of our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign publishers advertising services act honours that 
strength and that drive.  It pays homage to past successes and 
draws strength from that force of will.  The foreign publishers 
advertising services act will guarantee a prominent and sustained 
place for the ideas, dreams and vision of our Canadian children 
and grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I move:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  On questions and 
comments, the hon. member for Medicine Hat. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
my question for the parliamentary secretary has to do with the 
likely retaliation we will get for continually beating our head 
against the wall with this legislation.  We know it was 
substantially defeated the first time it went before the WTO. Now 
we are trying a back door approach which we know will fail again. 
All we are going to do is incite problems with our biggest 
trading partner, a country we trade with to the tune of $1 
billion every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the hon. member tell us why he thinks we are not going to 
face reprisals as we have faced in the past, perhaps in other 
areas such as farming where we already have a huge crisis in this 
country?  Why would the government risk that type of reprisal to 
push through legislation it knows will ultimately fail? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have to disagree 
totally with the member's premise that this will fail.  We 
believe this will sustain any test of the world tribunals for 
exchange in respect of our general agreement on services.  The 
notion that we as a country should not proceed because of the 
threat that our neighbours to the south may not like it is a 
rather sheepish way to deal with our own sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has negotiated international trade agreements that have 
excluded cultural matters entirely.  It is in keeping with this 
strategy that as a country which is somewhat smaller in terms of 
population than our neighbours to the south, our cultural 
sovereignty is not to be put at risk.  It is not to be put on the 
table.  It has been excluded from these agreements.  This is in 
keeping with that strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is quite comfortable that with this legislation 
we will continue to have a thriving periodical industry which we 
would not have if we did not act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is quite clear what the government is attempting to 
do with this bill.  It is attempting to redefine advertising as a 
service instead of as a good.  It is trying to go through the 
back door with this legislation.  It is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned that this bill is consistent with 
Canada's trade obligations.  How in the world can he justify that 
comment given the facts mentioned by my colleague and that this 
legislation in its previous life had no success at the WTO?  It 
is simply bad legislation.  How can he say this is consistent 
with Canada's trade obligations when it goes against NAFTA, an 
agreement this government applauds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member is 
mistaken to say this goes against NAFTA.  Cultural matters have 
been excluded from NAFTA.  Whether or not this is referred to the 
World Trade Organization is a decision our neighbours to the 
south will make.  It would be a rather sheepish way to run a 
country to cower because they threaten to do that.  We are not 
prepared to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is not prepared to understand that there is GATT, 
and GATS where we are talking about services and not products, 
then that is where he is mistaken.  It is the belief of this 
government that this will withstand the test wherever.  Canada's 
cultural sovereignty has to be protected, defended, encouraged 
and promoted.  That is what this government has done and will 
continue to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I find it rather strange that the word culture keeps 
being used when we are talking about advertising and revenues. 
This is commerce.  Through this back door legislation the 
government is trying to bend the intent of NAFTA and other trade 
organizations.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks of cowering.  It is not cowering to maintain 
good faith in international trade regulations.  That is not 
cowering; that is being honest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. parliamentary secretary to tell us if he 
does not feel that Canada is a big enough kid in the world to at 
least behave decently in its trade relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, first regarding this 
notion of the back door, if the member equates the floor of the 
House of Commons as the back door, then he has a problem.  The 
government is not attempting to use any back door here.  It is 
presenting legislation on the floor of the House of Commons, the 
Parliament of Canada.  That is far from a back door, number one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number two, if the member is not prepared to understand that the 
cultural industries need support such as advertising services 
which could be scooped up by foreign publications, then obviously 
he is out of tune and is not in touch. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on behalf 
of Bill C-55, an act that will ensure that a vibrant and 
successful Canadian magazine industry continues to provide 
Canadians with stories that reflect our values, our culture and 
our points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also rise to speak on behalf of all those Canadians who want 
to see themselves, read about themselves and learn about each 
other from other Canadians and not to do so vicariously through 
others, most notably the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 is in keeping with the longstanding policy of this 
government of promoting and investing in Canadian culture.  It is 
a policy that over the past 40 years has clearly been a success 
as there are currently 1,500 Canadian magazines on the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has often been stated that the question is not whether we 
ought to support Canadian culture, but how best to support it. As 
the Right Hon. Kim Campbell, our current consul general in Los 
Angeles said in a speech in March 1997, “Cultural industries are 
our national defence.  A country must be able to articulate its 
own reality in its own voices and it is not always easy in 
Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Support for culture is needed in Canada as the U.S. and Canada 
share the world's largest bilateral trading relationship at over 
$1 billion a day, 365 days a year and the world's longest 
undefended border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Robert Lantos, the former chairman of Alliance so eloquently 
stated last Monday evening, “We must never forget that our 
economic and cultural sovereignty are inextricably intertwined”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet 95% of Canadian movie screens are showing American films. It 
is almost impossible for a Canadian film to be shown on a 
Canadian movie screen.  Eighty per cent of English magazines on 
Canadian newsstands are American. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 ensures that Canadian magazine publishers continue to 
have access to Canadian advertising dollars.  Advertising revenue 
is the lifeblood of this industry, with advertising accounting 
for an average of 60% of total revenues in the magazine sector. 
This is an economic fact. At the same time, Canadian publishers 
are using advertising dollars to produce Canadian stories for 
Canadians. If this revenue were to decline, it would not be long 
before Canadian publications and the Canadian magazine publishing 
industry would suffer and become less viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill were not in place, Canadian magazines would not be 
able to compete with split-run editions of foreign magazines that 
have no editorial costs.  This gives foreign publishers an unfair 
competitive and economic advantage. These foreign magazines would 
be in a position to scoop up Canadian advertising dollars by 
offering lower advertising rates than their domestic competitors. 
Canadian magazines simply cannot survive without sufficient 
advertising revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must not take a short-sighted view of this issue.  If this 
situation were to perpetuate, this would inevitably lead to a 
reduction in the number of Canadian magazines. 
A reduction in the number of magazines would also lessen 
competition and could lead to higher advertising rates in the 
future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who advocate a completely unfettered free market should 
consider the potential long term implications on Canadian culture 
and on our economy.  We care about the survival of our culture 
and our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring in a mailing survey of 50,000 Canadians conducted by 
12 magazines, 84% of respondents said that it is important to 
them to read Canadian stories.  This government wants to ensure 
that Canadians continue to have access to their own ideas, 
stories and information.  This is why Bill C-55 is so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act will only prohibit foreign publishers from supplying 
advertising services directed primarily at the Canadian market to 
a Canadian advertiser. Canadian governments have long maintained 
measures to prevent this from happening. As a result of these 
measures, U.S. publishers have not had access to the Canadian 
advertising services market for over three decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some U.S. publishers are not satisfied with their already very 
generous share of the Canadian magazine market. They also want to 
dominate our advertising services market by producing split-run 
advertising editions of the magazines they already sell here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot overemphasize the fact that this measure deals only 
with supplied advertising services to Canadian advertisers.  It 
will not affect the importation of foreign magazines.  It will 
not affect any Canadian reader's ability to purchase foreign 
magazines at newsstands or through subscriptions. The Canadian 
market will continue to be among the most open in the entire 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition foreign publishers such as <I>Time</I> magazine 
currently operating in Canada will be exempt from this new bill. 
They will be able to maintain their current level of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague was absolutely correct that this bill is fully 
consistent with our international trade obligations under GATS, 
the agreement on services.  Yet culture, as this government has 
said many times, cannot be seen as simply another trade issue. 
This bill is about preserving a Canadian voice in a country that 
shares the world's largest bilateral trading relationship with 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not affect the content of magazines.  Publishers 
will continue to produce editorial content that they consider 
attractive to Canadians.  Nor does Bill C-55 affect the price of 
magazines.  Canadians will continue to enjoy access to foreign 
and domestic magazines that are competitively priced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 provides a mechanism to promote and support Canadian 
culture with no new cost to taxpayers.  Bill C-55 has also 
received strong support from the Canadian Magazine Publishers 
Association and the Canadian Business Press, which together 
represent some 450 consumer magazines from across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over 40 years measures have been in place to prevent 
split-run editions of foreign magazines.  New measures have been 
announced, not new policy.  This law is in keeping with 
longstanding cultural policies.  It ensures that Canadian 
magazine publishers have access to the funds that they need to 
survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill takes nothing away from Canadian advertisers. 
Advertisers will continue to have all the advertising 
opportunities they had in the past, including the right to 
purchase advertising services from foreign publishers, as long as 
the advertising service is not directed primarily at the Canadian 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, Bill C-55 will guarantee that Canadians continue to 
have access to stories about Canada, written by and for Canadians 
and confirms this government's commitment to, and investment in 
Canadian culture. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member mentioned a minute ago that magazines such as 
<I>Time</I> will be grandfathered in this legislation and 
therefore will not have to comply with these new rules that the 
government would propose to push through. I wonder if the member 
can explain why, if the principle of having American magazines in 
Canada not being allowed to pick up Canadian advertisers, she 
thinks that principle of allowing them to have Canadian 
advertising is wrong.

standard?  If it is wrong, it is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Madam Speaker, the legislation is 
aimed at split-run magazines like <I>Sports Illustrated</I> which 
basically takes Canadian advertising dollars with no Canadian 
content.  <I>Time</I> is an exception.  <I>Time</I> has been in 
Canada for years.  <I>Time</I> has Canadian content. <I>Time</I> is 
not a split-run edition.  <I>Time</I> cares about Canadians. 
<I>Time</I> continues to tell Canadian stories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is aimed at split-run magazines that are beamed in by

Canadians about themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would 
like to ask a question about the member's comment that there 
would be no new cost to taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I checked with the heritage department about the removal of 
postal subsidies.  It made the point that as a result of the 
changes required by the WTO, Canada Post would eliminate the 
international publication rate which was higher than the domestic 
rate.  Foreign publishers would therefore benefit from reduced 
postal rates to a tune of an estimated $18 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does the mailing cost come from if not from the taxpayer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member is 
correct that there will now be a level playing field between 
foreign magazines and Canadian magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe there will be additional tax costs for the 
taxpayers of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member seems to talking about split runs. When 
she talks about <I>Time</I> magazine it is more like the splitting 
of hairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member inform the House if she is in general 
support of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or perhaps 
the Canadian bill of rights?  Does she believe in freedom of 
expression, freedom of the press, freedom of association or the 
right to deal in property? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member take seriously, agree with or support any 
of these principles or concepts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Madam Speaker, yes, I do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, if the hon. member believes in free speech, why are they 
putting up protective barriers on a split-run issue in Bill C-55? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Madam Speaker, we are not putting up 
protective measures.  Let us stop talking about protection.  Let 
us talk about what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are promoting and investing in Canadian culture.  We are not 
protectionists.  Where is protectionism when 95% of our films are 
American and 80% of our magazines are American?  It is not 
protectionism.  It is investment and it is promotion of Canada's 
cultural industry and arts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise to address Bill C-55.  I am a bit familiar 
with the bill.  It first came into being three or four years ago 
in a different version.  At that time I was critic of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage so I had the chance to explore 
what the government was up to at that point.  As the Reform Party 
predicted, that legislation was ultimately defeated at the WTO.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go out on a limb and say that this will be pounded down 
again by the WTO, which will leave Canada wide open to 
retaliation on all kinds of trade fronts.  I cannot believe the 
government is so imprudent that it would allow the legislation to 
go through and threaten in many cases other industries that are 
already in great peril.  For instance, I point to the farm 
industry which is important in my riding.   I will get to that in 
more detail later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address a couple of remarks made by my colleague who 
just finished speaking a minute ago.  She mentioned that 
<I>Time</I> cares about Canada.  I point out that it is the Time 
Warner corporation of the United States.  I do not think anyone 
really believes that Time Warner Inc., a huge media conglomerate, 
cares about Canada.  It cares about making money for its 
shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally that is exactly the same thing that drives Ted 
Rogers and the Canadian Magazine Publishers Association that are 
naturally in support of the bill.  They do not care about Canada. 
They want to make a profit.  If the government ensures that they 
can make a profit by protecting them with huge fines, contrary to 
what the member said we should not be very surprised.  They do 
not care about Canada.  They want to make a lot of money.  That 
is their right and we understand it.  We do not think there 
should be government intervention that allows them to do it.  Let 
us see some real competition in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to expand on that point for a moment.  Recently the 
<I>National Post</I> was launched in Canada.  It will be Canada's 
second daily national newspaper, which means that the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I>, an excellent newspaper, has some tough competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Globe and Mail</I> has improved a lot over the last 
several months as it has geared up for this launch.  The 
<I>National Post</I> is producing an excellent newspaper.  What we 
are seeing are the benefits of competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have competition, we have better newspapers all of a 
sudden.  It is amazing but it happens over and over again. 
Everyone has to get better.  I see the same thing happening on 
TV.  We had News 1 launched on CTV and all of a sudden we see 
Newsworld is improving its set and changing its hosts.  What 
would happen in Canada if we had wide open competition in our 
magazine industry?  Canadian magazines would improve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleagues across the way know this is true. Otherwise 
they would not have reversed their stand on NAFTA.  They know 
that real competition makes everyone stronger.  They completely 
changed their stripes on NAFTA because they know that is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they want to have their cake and eat it too with 
protectionism of an industry as my colleague from Swift Current 
pointed out. They can cloak it in language about our sacred 
culture all they want, but this is about making money and my 
colleagues across the way know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to expand on a point I made at the outset.  Under the WTO 
rules if a piece of legislation is struck down, goes back for a 
second time and is struck down, the field will be wide open for 
retaliation from the country which was the target of the 
legislation.  In this case it is the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues across the way have had some experience in dealing 
with the United States and trade problems in the past.  It was 
not very long ago when we saw Canada get into some trouble with 
the U.S. over protection for poultry and dairy.  As a result what 
did the United States do?  It capped exports for durum in the 
west.  It did not go after the industry it was concerned about. 
It picked another weak spot, one that it knew was politically 
sensitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen when this is ultimately defeated again at the 
WTO?  Will the Americans say they will ban our magazines coming 
into the United States?  I do not think so.  That would not be 
very much.  They will go after wheat exports, cattle or something 
that has a profound impact on Canada.  The government knows that. 
It has been warned about it for the last four or five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is going ahead anyway because the minister is so 
stubborn.  Because she cannot spend a bunch of money any more on 
Canadian heritage she has to justify her existence somehow. 
She is going into this area willy-nilly, not caring one bit about 
the damage it will ultimately do to the rest of the country.  She 
knows exactly what the outcome will be but she does not care.

shop, in Aces Cafe; when I go to Bow Island and sit in Grandma's 
Kitchen; or when I go to Medicine Hat and sit in the co-op, I sit 
around the table with my constituents.  We do not talk about the 
horrible tragedy of <I>Sports Illustrated</I> coming into Canada 
with Canadian advertising.  They talk about the fact that they 
will not be able to make their payments for fertilizer, fuel and 
such things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They understand what the government does not understand, that 
people have to make a living.  When they see legislation like 
this which threatens their existence at a time when they are 
already in tremendous danger, they wonder what goes on in Ottawa. 
They call it the puzzle patch.  I do not blame them because I am 
pretty puzzled about what the government is up to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is beyond absurd that the Liberals are preparing to endanger 
trade with the United States, a billion dollars a day, at a time 
when according to the finance minister we are facing an economic 
meltdown, an apocalypse of some kind.  On the other hand they are 
endangering trade with the one partner we can count on. 
Eighty-five per cent of our trade is with the United States.  Yet 
the government is setting us up for a trade war with the United 
States.  How ridiculous can that be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my friends across the way, who are laughing right 
now, would like to come back to Brooks, Alberta, to Bow Island or 
to Vauxhall and sit and laugh when my constituents tell me they 
will not make it through the winter or be able to sow their grain 
in the spring.  It is not a laughing matter; it is deadly 
serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals across the way had better wake up and understand 
that the bill has implications far beyond magazines.  It does not 
make sense to subsidize Ted Rogers.  He already has enough 
millions in the bank.  We do not need to subsidize Philippe de 
Gaspé Beaubien.  He already has enough money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ridiculous that the government has to try to justify its 
existence as a player in Canadian culture by putting in place a 
foolhardy piece of legislation like this one.  It is absurd. It 
is no wonder Canadians are so cynical about this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage government members to wake up, especially rural 
members who know how much this can damage their own constituents. 
I see the industry minister here.  In the past he has had some 
knock-down, drag-'em-outs with the cultural minister on this 
issue because as a businessman he knows that this is bad 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage members across the way to wake up, defeat the 
legislation and ask the minister not to pursue it because it will 
damage Canada a lot more than it could ever help it.

Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to point out 
some of the contradictions the member across does not shy away 
from.  He claimed at one point that people have to make a living. 
We all agree with that.  However he would discard, out of hand, 
without a second thought, the 6,000-plus Canadians who work in 
this field.  He does not seem to care about that field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We care.  A government has to be responsible and take a balanced 
approach.  The government has an incredible reputation worldwide 
as a trading nation.  We have participated in international 
treaties to allow free trade.  We have respected those treaties. 
We have been consistent in saying that cultural matters are not 
to be included.  We protect, enhance and promote Canadian 
cultural industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There does not seem to be a problem over there with people 
making money except when it comes to people working in the 
cultural fields.  There are 6,000 people working in those fields. 
What about the people working in the film industry, the TV 
industry, the book publishing industry and the music industry? 
They would discard them out of hand. They say that they cannot 
make money.  They say it is okay for others to make money but not 
for people in the film industry, the publication field or in 
periodicals.

and will continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not know what to 
say to that other than that is absolute rubbish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government really is as brave as the member suggests, why 
is it putting up huge protection barriers around the magazine 
publishing industry in Canada?  He just said we were cowering. 
It is his government that is putting up the barriers.  It is 
going to impose huge fines on <I>Sports Illustrated</I> or 
whatever because the government would dare to allow Canadian 
advertisers in advertise in those magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ridiculous.  The member argues on the one hand that the 
government is going to protect Canadians.  On the other hand it 
is denying Canadian advertisers a vehicle by which to promote 
their goods and services.  He cannot have it both ways.  We want 
these people to make money too.  We do not make money by giving 
them a subsidy and protecting them from competition.  That is how 
we kill industry.  My friend should know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had protectionism in this country for years.  As an example, 
we had textile producers in southern Quebec.  What happened to 
them?  Ultimately they could not compete when the barriers came 
down.  We need to get rid of those protectionist walls.  We want 
Canadian cultural industries to make money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government to take some of its own advice and 
allow them to make money by allowing free competition so they can 
export around the world.  What we want is to see lower taxes so 
they can compete.  We want to see those people succeed like they 
have already done in other areas of Canadian culture where there 
is no protectionism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to my friend that we have many great Canadian 
novelists.  They send their products far afield.  They do 
extraordinarily well.  We do not have protectionism for them. 
When they produce a novel they sell it around the world and those 
novels come back here.  That is not what the government is 
proposing for the magazine industry.  It wants to create a 
problem not only for the magazine industry by allowing it to 
atrophy because it does not have competition but ultimately it 
will cause all kinds of problems for the rest of the country by 
creating a trade war with our biggest trading partner.  It is 
ridiculous that the government would do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member for Medicine Hat will know where I am 
coming from when I talk about one of the cultural things on the 
prairies, weekly newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody looks forward to a weekly newspaper.  Because of the 
sparse population one of the biggest cost factors this cultural 
avenue has is the high cost of Canada Post.  The hon. member in 
the NDP asked a question about this.  Now we are going to give 
special reductions to some newspapers coming into the country.  I 
cannot wait until my weekly newspapers that have been fighting 
with Canada Post forever about special rates to get their 
cultural piece of information out find out about a special Canada 
Post regulation to bring magazines into Canada. Every small paper 
struggling to survive is going to damn this government if this 
proposal goes through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member for Medicine Hat to comment on our 
cultural activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government thinks Canadian culture is what a lot of people 
might call high culture.  Most people today make connections with 
their neighbours around their province and around the country 
through weekly newspapers and little publications like that.  One 
of the things that works against them is the exorbitant prices 
they have to pay for postage today. The member is absolutely 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point is that these companies are just like any other 
company.  They struggle to make it with crippling payroll taxes. 
In many case they have a lot of employees.  It is labour 
intensive.

their premiums go down by $350 which is entirely within this 
government's ability to do if it would obey the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But sadly this government thinks the answer is to protect these 
business by putting up these high protective walls which 
ultimately are going to be challenged and defeated at the WTO. We 
are going to pay a huge price for it when we are retaliated 
against.  Unfortunately the retaliation will not be in magazines. 
We will be hit where it hurts, in the big industries such as 
agriculture and lumber. My colleague shakes his head but I will 
bet him $20 that is exactly what is going to happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about political interference and about retribution. 
Indeed that goes on.  He talked about regulation and 
protectionism and the Liberals in this country being wall 
builders.  But the thing the member did not touch on, the thing 
the member left out of his speech, was the type of corporate 
welfare we have in this country, the type of corporate welfare 
the Liberals have been engaging in. The Liberals cut health care 
and education and they give billions of dollars to their friends 
such as Bombardier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member for Medicine Hat to touch on what 
goes on in this country in terms of corporate welfare and 
subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member threw me a 
hardball but let me see what I can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have noted that Bombardier gets a little help from this 
government.  I also noted that Bombardier made a profit last year 
in the range of $235 million.  But we also know, thanks to the 
Canadian Taxpayers Federation, that but several aerospace 
concerns have received not hundreds of millions but over $1 
billion in subsidies. To me that is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much of these repayable loans have been paid back?  I see 
the minister of industry is in the House. A fraction get paid 
back, 2% or 3%.  I think it is unbelievable that this government 
will slash health care, attack all the programs that are 
extraordinarily important to Canadians but still pump billions of 
dollars into corporate welfare for companies such as Bombardier 
and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I have adequately answered the question from my colleague 
for Calgary West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Tell us about Ted Rogers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  The member mentions Ted Rogers. I am 
glad he pointed that out because under this legislation what this 
government is doing is pumping more money into the pocket of Ted 
Rogers, a media mogul in this country, a multimillionaire who 
hardly needs the help.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, as my 
party's critic for culture and communications I am pleased to 
have the opportunity to speak to the contents of Bill C-55, an 
act representing advertising services supplied by foreign 
periodical publishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not able to be in the House to speak on this bill on first 
reading last Thursday but our member for Winnipeg—Transcona with 
his usual eloquence and clarity spoke to the bill so I will, in 
my own fashion, try to add to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To refresh members on the contents, Bill C-55 will make it an 
offence for a publisher to provide advertising services aimed at 
the Canadian market to be placed in foreign periodic publications 
except for those currently receiving Canadian advertising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offence is enforceable by a Canadian court after an 
investigation ordered by the Minister of Canadian Heritage using 
powers of investigation borrowed from the Criminal Code.  The 
penalties range anywhere from $20,000 to $250,000 for a corporate 
offender on indictment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offences that take place outside of Canada by foreign 
individuals or corporations are deemed to have taken place in 
Canada for the purposes of endorsement of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here in effect and without doubt with Bill C-55 is 
an eleventh hour effort to protect the Canadian magazine industry 
from being truly swamped and I would say possibly sunk by the 
thousands of shiny, glossy, glitzy, sexy American magazines which 
we all see row by row, bicep by bicep, cleavage by cleavage in 
our airport bookstores and in the chains of American bookstores 
we now have all over our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that I do not like American magazines.  I like them a 
great deal and I have a tremendous admiration for American 
writers, the political commentators, the satirists, the sports 
writers, the poets and the playwrights.  I like a whole lot about 
the United States and its talent and its spirit.  But it is the 
volume and the velocity of the American product and the 
unrelenting manner with which it floods the Canadian shores which 
concerns me.  It obviously concerns the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage as well or she would not be putting forward Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the first effort and I doubt it will be the last 
effort to protect the Canadian magazine industry from the 
American tidal wave of publications.  Nor is it the last effort 
probably to keep Canadian advertising dollars in Canadian 
publications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1976 passage in parliament of Bill C-58, a statute which 
disallowed tax deductions by Canadian companies for their 
advertising expenditures in foreign periodicals and broadcasting 
outlets, obviously enhanced the attractiveness of advertising in 
Canadian media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982 postal subsidies instituted for Canadian magazines 
helped to stabilize Canadian periodical competitive position 
vis-a-vis American magazines whose overrun copies were simply 
dumped in the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982 the Canadian Periodical Publishers Association termed 
the postal subsidy not only the oldest but in some ways the most 
effective of all the many kinds of cultural assistance created by 
the taxpayers of Canada. Postal subsidies were considered a true 
grant in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it is 1998 and a lot of water has gone under the bridge. Now 
we have Bill C-55 and it is a direct result of a GATT panel 
overturning the Canadian policy on split run magazines, magazines 
which contain mostly American content but run in separate 
editions for Canada containing Canadian ads. <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I>, <I>Readers' Digest</I> and <I>Time</I> magazine are 
the best known examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighteen months ago a Canadian conference for the arts report on 
this ruling on the GATT case said: “World trade organization 
decision on magazines advances the cultural sovereignty doomsday 
clock”. What an ominous concept.  The CCA strongly recommended 
immediate action in a number of areas and it is still very 
relevant to today and I am going to quote some. Number one is, 
not surprisingly, fix the magazine industry policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Canada must aggressively promote and secure an effective 
and durable cultural exemption in all existing and proposed 
international agreements. Third, develop a systematic 
understanding of the constraints and challenges in cultural 
sovereignty posed by existing trade agreements. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the federal government understands the impact 
of international trade agreements on culture as poorly as the 
rest of us.  Who can forget the assurances that the former 
minister of Canadian heritage, the Hon. Michael Dupuy, gave to 
the Senate that officials in his and other departments assured 
him that C-103, the split-run legislation, was fully consistent 
with our international trade obligations.  This has proven to be 
far from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nature of the case made by the international trade officials 
at the WTO appears to provide abundant evidence that the 
situation has not improved.  The government must move with 
dispatch to ensure that we have a clear and solid appreciation of 
the constraints and opportunities presented in the full network 
of international trade agreements and their impact on cultural 
sovereignty.  We must develop a solid base of knowledge and 
talent in foreign affairs and international trade as well as 
within all government departments active in this area and the 
cultural sector itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were some comments from the CCA bulletin, the Canadian 
Conference of the Arts bulletin, of July 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighteen months later I look at those cautionary remarks and I 
would say that we still have not gained the kind of understanding 
and self-knowledge that we need to pull this critical cultural 
issue out of the fire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, with Bill C-55 we see the failure of the Liberals to 
adequately protect the Canadian magazine industry under 
international trade agreements or admit, more to the point, where 
the problem lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the panel has proclaimed that Canadian policy cannot 
discriminate against foreign-owned goods, such as the product on 
paper of split-run magazines, the government will now try it 
under the definition of services such as the placing of 
advertising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will it work?  Will it save the Canadian magazine industry?  I 
am afraid this bill will likely be challenged as well, possibly 
under the NAFTA or under the FTA.  I might add that it would 
definitely have been disallowed under the MAI which the Canadian 
government fought to keep alive until the end, which came last 
week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-55 we see the disappearance of the postal subsidies 
for Canadian magazines which were described in 1982 as a true 
grant in the public interest.  As a result of the changes 
required by the WTO, Canada Post will eliminate the international 
publication rate which was higher than the domestic rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign publishers will therefore benefit from reduced postal 
rates.  There will be an estimated $18 million reduction in 
mailing costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last section of the bill, section 24, the grandfather 
clause, is a legal surrender to American magazines which have 
already broken into the Canadian market.  The NDP will closely 
examine that exemption in committee with a view to opening up new 
opportunities for Canadian publications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect, this bill entrenches the status quo.  There is 
nothing in the bill to promote Canadian content, to encourage 
more community periodicals or to bring forward new Canadian or 
regional voices.  But it is an effort by the government and any 
effort cannot be spurned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to reiterate the central point made by my 
colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona that this is an effort to 
please, to kowtow to trade agreements and not, first and 
foremost, to protect and nurture our culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to reiterate his point that government members 
are not critical enough of the agreements in which they find 
themselves.  I am talking particularly about the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fundamental contradiction between the ideology, the 
world view embodied in the WTO, and the whole notion of 
protection of culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the fundamental contradiction between culture and free 
trade as it is understood by the WTO and the NAFTA.  The fact is 
that our previous policy has been tested against the ideology and 
the world view of the WTO and has been shot down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for our government and our Minister of Canadian 
Heritage to admit to the fact that there are fundamental problems 
with these trade agreements.  It is important that they recognize 
that their hands are tied by the rules of trade agreements which 
they were deeply involved in formulating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are in a box right now.  The country and our 
culture is now in a box which is of our own government's making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have Bill C-55, a quick fix which will likely be 
challenged as well by the trade agreements which the Liberals and 
Tories before them were intricately involved in formulating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is trying to provide a quick fix for a much 
larger problem which it had a hand in creating, the sacrificing 
of culture at trade negotiation tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55, inadequate as it is, does represent a small effort on 
behalf of the government to protect our magazine industry, an 
industry that supports thousands of cultural workers, writers, 
publishers, copy editors, photographers and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an industry that continues to go a long way, despite the 
onslaught of American magazines, to tell Canadian stories to 
Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the NDP will support the principles of the bill 
and we will be voting in favour of it at second reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member 
for Dartmouth for her comments.  I welcome some of the 
criticisms, some of which may not be as accurate as one would 
like.  However, I welcome the constructive approach and I look 
forward to looking at this legislation in greater detail with her 
at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will correct one of the slight inaccuracies.  The member was 
essentially saying that this government was insisting that 
cultural matters be within the MAI.  I not only have to disagree, 
but the minister who was spearheading the Canadian efforts 
vis-à-vis the MAI was quite explicit a number of times in this 
House that culture was to be excluded from it.  It would 
preferably be a sector exclusion and it would certainly be a 
Canadian exclusion.  To say that the government was trying to put 
culture on the table with the MAI is not quite accurate.  I hope 
the member will accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return to comments made by Reform about postal subsidies 
for small newspapers.  This government supports that.  We support 
small newspapers, in some cases to the tune of 75% of the cost of 
their postal rates.  Postal subsidization is one of the ways the 
Government of Canada supports the periodical industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the members of the Reform Party have us continue in one 
case and not in the other?  Surely to goodness they do not 
support such double standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the parliamentary 
secretary for his comments.  I agree that the minister of 
heritage has a real commitment to preserving culture.  I believe 
she was carrying the flame in that respect with regard to the MAI 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I asked the Minister for International Trade twice in 
this House to be very specific about the wording around “Would 
you guarantee a complete cultural carve-out?”  One day the 
answer was yes and then two days later, when I read the script of 
a dinner speech made by the minister, the wording was quite 
different.  It had sort of backed down on cultural exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the devil is in the wording.  That is what has been 
confounding this whole issue all along.  Whether we are talking 
carve-out or exemption, at the 11th hour at these tables what 
exactly is given away?  I do not believe for a minute that the 
spirit of the MAI is dead, but I am still not convinced that if 
the MAI had continued on in the present realm of negotiations 
that we would have had what we wanted at the end of the day in 
terms of real cultural protection.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, many more people in Canada subscribe to the weekly 
newspaper industry than they do to magazines.  I want to make 
that clear.  I am talking in particular about my province, but no 
matter what province people live in, most get their culture from 
the weekly newspaper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned that Canada Post was going to 
relinquish something in the order of $18 million to drop the rate 
of postage for items coming into Canada.  Because of Canada Post 
some weekly newspapers have to drive or truck their papers to 
different locations.  Through Canada Post it would take a week or 
so before the papers reached their destination.  Those sending 
items to Canada have to pay the same rate as if they were mailing 
it at a local post office.  Why?  There is an inconsistency in 
losing $18 million.  The answer was that it will not cost the 
Canadian taxpayers.  Canada Post is losing $18 million and there 
will be no cost to the Canadian taxpayers?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does the hon. member think they are going to find this $18 
million?  Will it be done by putting a higher postage rate on our 
weeklies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I too have some concerns 
about where the $18 million will come from.  I will turn that 
question back to my hon. colleague opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am still not clear.  That $18 million will not come out of the 
air.  It obviously will come out of Canada Post, and we know who 
pays for Canada Post.  Maybe the parliamentary secretary could 
answer that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  They cannot answer it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, what I find 
interesting in this debate is that the Reform Party, on the one 
hand, is saying that we have to respect our international trade 
obligations and, on the other hand, is saying that we cannot do 
that.  This is indeed the result of a decision made at the WTO. 
The postal rate on foreign magazines will reflect the WTO 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that the government is respecting all foreign 
decisions of the WTO, which is why Bill C-55 is before us.  Will 
it have an impact?  Of course it will have an impact.  Of course 
there will have to be adjustments made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will it be done on the backs of small newspapers?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am worried about the 
word “adjustments”.  That is a word that usually means job 
losses.  It means money being taken from places that are not 
immediately evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this whole bill, I must say that it still looks 
to me like a quick fix and an effort in some respect to save the 
magazine industry.  In many ways it is still in denial of the 
root causes of the problem that we are now facing, which has to 
do with our engaging in trade agreements without sufficiently 
understanding the impact they are going to have on our cultural 
industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, in response to the 
comments from the member, it is indeed a difficult situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one country that is essentially dominating in many 
areas, such as the movie industry, magazines, television and so 
forth.  The government is perfectly aware of that.  As a matter 
of fact, the Minister of Canadian Heritage as early as last 
June—and the member might recall because she attended some of 
the functions—welcomed a delegation from some 20 countries to 
discuss this very difficult situation.  It is not unique to 
Canada.  It is a situation that is also of concern to France, 
Greece, Mexico, Italy and a number of countries around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This monoculturalism, if you will, is a reflection of the 
strength of American cultural products which are swamping, in 
some areas, certain countries' attempts to have their own culture 
reflected in their own vehicles.  The Government of Canada, 
through the Minister of Canadian Heritage, is tackling that.  It 
is very difficult and it will be a drawn out effort which we will 
not be able to achieve alone as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries which have that same preoccupation are now 
joining hands to make sure that indeed their cultural 
sovereignty, which in some cases is seriously threatened, is 
protected, encouraged, defended and promoted.  This government 
fully intends to be intrinsically involved in that effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We welcome comments from the member opposite, who is perfectly 
aware of the difficulties that this kind of effort involves.  We 
will welcome her continued support and the continued support of 
her party in attempting to resolve, in perhaps a larger fashion, 
this whole difficulty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would have to say that 
our party is on record as not being in favour at all of the MAI 
in its present configuration.  When I say I am in support of 
cultural carve outs in terms of international trade agreements, I 
would have to say that this is in terms of a new kind of 
international trade agreement which in fact supports 
environmental concerns, labour concerns and social concerns, as 
well as cultural concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish that our government had been right in front of the 
Government of France in pulling out of the MAI negotiations and 
killing that particularly egregious trade agreement. 
Unfortunately that was not the case, but I wish it had been.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in the debate on Bill C-55, an act respecting 
advertising services supplied by foreign periodical publishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In giving an historic overview of the issue before us today, we 
should point out that, since 1965, the Canadian magazine 
industry has always enjoyed the support of the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the Royal Commission on Publications, set up in 1961 
under the Right Hon. John Diefenbaker, recommended that measures 
be taken to protect the Canadian magazine industry against 
dumping. 
To that end, measures prohibiting the import of split run 
magazines were finally implemented in 1965. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Measures were also taken to provide reduced postal rates for 
Canadian magazines, thus helping them lower their shipping 
costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that the Progressive Conservative government 
promoted strong growth for the Canadian owned magazine industry. 
Indeed, during the negotiations on the Free Trade Agreement, we 
made sure that an exemption provision would be included for the 
cultural industry as a whole. A similar provision was also 
included in the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in 1993, the magazine <I>Sports Illustrated</I> managed to 
circumvent the ban on imports by electronically transmitting a 
split run edition to a Canadian printer. 
The Progressive Conservative government took speedy action, 
forming a task force to bring policy into line with the 
electronic era. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the recommendations contained in the task force's 
interim report, the Hon. Jean Charest, then the minister 
responsible for Investment Canada, issued ministerial directives 
under the Investment Canada Act that eliminated the loophole by 
which Time Warner had introduced a split run of <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I> into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final report of the task force led, in 1995, to Bill C-3, 
the purpose of which was to strengthen the position of the 
Canadian periodical industry by means of measures to discourage 
split run editions of periodicals, particularly American ones, 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures included an excise tax of 80% on the total value 
of advertising space in split run editions, and a customs tariff 
making it illegal to import split run periodicals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, in October 1997, the World Trade Organization 
ruled that levying customs and excise taxes on split run 
periodicals went against international free trade agreements. 
Canada was given until the end of October 1998 to bring its 
policy into line with the provisions of the General Agreement on 
Trade in Services, failing which the United States would take 
retaliatory measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Publishers of Canadian periodicals maintain that American 
publishers, who cover their costs in the United States, can 
offer lower advertising rates to Canadian business. 
Canadian periodicals depend heavily on advertising revenue, 
which is estimated at $350 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has therefore introduced this bill as a response 
to this request, taking care to protect Canadians' ability to 
express themselves through Canadian cultural vehicles, such as 
those offered by this country's periodical industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, the World Trade Organization's decision did not 
challenge the ability of member countries to take action to 
protect their cultural identify.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed measures provide among other things that only 
Canadian periodical publishers will be able to sell advertising 
services aimed primarily at the Canadian market and that stiff 
fines as high as $250,000 will be imposed on foreign publishers 
who contravene this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us also specifies that both the customs tariff 
preventing split runs magazines from entering the country and 
the excise tax on the distribution of such magazines in Canada 
are removed. From now on, foreign publishers will have access to 
the postal subsidy program, and commercial postage rates for 
Canadian and foreign publications will be harmonized 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concludes the historical overview. Now I would like to 
remind the hon. members that the party I have the honour to 
represent in this House has always been committed to ensuring 
future of the Canadian publishing industry, which is closely 
tied to advertizing income. It is indeed essential that this 
industry be promoted and protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, the government must give Canadian 
publishers the assurance that the new measures will not result 
in another trade crisis. Canada cannot afford another fiasco 
like the one caused recently by the flip-flop over MMT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 is a very important piece of legislation. Aside from 
providing much needed support to our Canadian magazine 
publishers, it shows publicly that we are intent on protecting 
and maintaining our cultural sovereignty in the midst of 
ever-increasing pressures from global forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protecting our cultural integrity in Canada has always been a 
major priority of any trade discussion Canada participated in. 
Just think that plans for the multilateral investment agreement 
are being wrecked in part by the fact that both Canada and 
France refuse to put cultural industries on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous Progressive Conservative government was deeply 
committed to the protection of cultural industries. In 
negotiating the Free Trade Agreement, we ensured all cultural 
industries were excluded from the operation of the FTA, an 
exclusion that was carried over into NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to note that the WTO in its decision was 
not questioning Canada's right to protect its cultural 
industries; it objected to a policy that directly targeted U.S. 
magazines. 
So, rather than specifically target U.S. magazines, Bill C-55 
seeks to put restraints on advertising services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, Bill C-55 will restrict the sale of advertising 
directed at the Canadian market to Canadian publications. It 
should be noted that U.S. magazines will still be able to sell 
advertising aimed at the Canadian market. However, these 
advertisements will have to appear in all North American 
publications. They cannot appear solely in magazines aimed at 
the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people may wonder why we should impose measures to protect 
our Canadian magazine industry. There are very important reasons 
for us to do that. The Canadian magazine industry employs 
thousands of Canadians and pumps millions of dollars into our 
economy. 
Many distinguished Canadian writers publish in our magazines 
insightful and interesting articles on people, places and things 
that reflect our unique culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian market is one of the most open markets in the world 
for imported magazines. According to the Canadian Magazine 
Publishers Association, imports account for 50% of magazine 
sales in Canada and over 80% of newsstand space. Despite this 
intense competition from foreign magazines, Canadian magazines 
continue to attract their share of readers, allowing them to 
hold their own in a very competitive industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian magazine industry plays an important cultural role 
in helping to define who we are as a people and where we stand 
as a nation. Culture defines our beliefs and our values. We are 
not automatically born with a culture. 
We may be born into a culture, but it is something we learn. We 
need Canada's magazine industry, so that future generations have 
the opportunity to learn and appreciate this culture that 
distinguishes us and that is the envy of the rest of the world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, for some thirty years now, government 
after government in Canada has passed laws designed to help 
Canadian publishers earn enough in advertising revenues to 
remain competitive on the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When <I>Sports Illustrated</I> managed to circumvent import 
restrictions by electronically sending its publication to a 
printer in Canada, it basically opened the door to unfair 
business practices by American publishers, who began to produce 
their magazines with split runs and to reap the benefits of 
bundling the editorial content of their American editions with 
Canadian advertising, which they could sell at a much better 
price than their Canadian competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian publishers count on advertising to generate 65% of 
their revenues.  It is therefore urgent to act to protect them 
against the possibility of unfair business practices by their 
American competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Advertising has not just recently become a powerful influence on 
the course of our society.  Before printing was invented, criers 
were hired to announce upcoming events. 
I know of a member of government who would have made an 
excellent one had he been born a few centuries ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the advent of radio and television, magazines drew most 
of their revenues from advertising.  Since then, they struggle 
to create their own niche and ensure their survival. 
Advertising has changed more in the past 10 years than in the 
past 60 years because of new technologies and market 
developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Advertising revenues amount to over $350 million annually. 
Canadian publishers depend on these revenues to survive.  A stop 
must be put to any threat of unfair and grasping practices. 
Canadian publishers need our support in order to remain 
competitive in the new world economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is far from perfect. Even after a full year to consult 
with international trade experts, countless legal advisers and 
representatives from Canada's publishing industry, a number of 
issues still need to be clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, as I mentioned earlier, the postal rate changes could 
have adverse effects on small community based publications. 
Legion branches, which previously enjoyed postal rate subsidies, 
could be in danger of losing this assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same could be said for church organizations that provide 
their congregations with regular updates of church activities. 
Because these organizations are not charging their members for 
their materials, they are no longer entitled to preferential 
postal rates as are other Canadian magazine publishers. 
This issue must be addressed by the minister either through 
amendments or regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last section of the bill, which relates to the 
grandfathering clause, must be more clearly defined. As it 
stands, the bill appears to restrict important contributors to 
our Canadian magazine industry, such as Reader's Digest and Time 
Warner, from expanding their present interests, including future 
investment possibilities. While I realize that was not the 
intent of the bill, the wording could lead to such an 
interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid the bill might not survive another WTO challenge. I 
also wonder about a possible challenge under the Canadian 
charter of rights by the advertising industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though I was told by Heritage Canada officials that all 
possible avenues had been properly explored, I simply cannot 
forget the government's incompetence in the MMT issue, the 
gasoline additive, which is now costing Canadian taxpayers $13 
million U.S. Canadian taxpayers cannot afford another costly 
mistake by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, even though Bill C-55 is far from perfect, we 
should support it at second reading, so that it can be 
immediately referred to a committee for further review. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

Shefford for her comments.  She covered the issue and its 
background very well.  She has raised legitimate concerns and I 
hope that the committee will be able to shed some light on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I urge the House to return the bill to 
committee after passing it, in principle, at second reading, so 
that specific aspects can be considered in greater depth.  I am 
looking forward to some good discussions with her colleague from 
West Nova in committee.  Again, I thank her for her comments.

Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have something here that goes beyond what this bill attempts 
to do. If my figures are correct, 80% of all Canadians live 
closer to the United States than they do their neighbouring 
province.  As a result of that population to the south, we have 
always been in a war with our struggle to prevent the sellout of 
Canadian culture. To many Canadians, culture means different 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill needs total re-examination.  Just as sure as what 
happened a few months ago in a retaliatory measure by the U.S. 
farmers against allegations that this government dumped wheat 
illegally into the United States all of which took place within 
my constituency, and as sure as I am standing here, the World 
Trade Organization is going to strike this bill down. In doing 
so, some Canadian industry somewhere is going to pay the price. I 
am getting tired of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We produce commodities which are superior in every detail; we 
produce better wheat; we produce better durum; we produce better 
hogs; we produce better cattle.  All of those things are in my 
area of the country. The retaliation will probably not fall 
against anyone but western Canada and we will pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put this back.  Let us see if we cannot come up with 
something in negotiations before passing legislation that 
irritates the World Trade Organization and we in western Canada 
take it on the nose again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
comments.  I note that, like us, he is concerned about certain

</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see it passed at second reading and referred to

<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
to set off my comments I would like to read an article that 
appeared in today's Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>.  It is by Terence 
Corcoran, the editor of the <I>Financial Post</I> under the 
headline that the minister's bill kills magazines: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the next 48 hours, (the minister) will charge about 
Ottawa executing her duties as Minister of Illegal Protectionism. 
To meet a world trade deadline Friday, she will formally 
announce the end of Ottawa's illegal 80 per cent excise tax on 
advertising in split-run magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then she will redirect Ottawa's illegal $50 million annual 
magazine postal subsidy so that it falls right into the hands of 
Ted Rogers, Philippe de Gaspé Beaubien and other needy Canadian 
magazine publishers.  Simultaneously, (the minister) will be 
pushing Bill C-55, her illegal ban on Canadian advertising in 
foreign magazines, through second reading tonight in the Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It's a lot of lawlessness for one minister to handle, but if any 
minister is up to the challenge of breaking constitutional and 
trade law, it's (this minister).  In the course of making a hash 
of her stint as environment minister, (the minister) orchestrated 
Ottawa's illegal ban on the export of PCBs for incineration.  The 
sole purpose of the export ban was to force Canadians to destroy 
PCBs at high cost in Canada rather than cheaply in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another adventure (of the minister) in trade protectionism was 
an attempt to ban the use of the gasoline additive MMT.  In the 
MMT case, (the minister) was in the pocket of the big auto firms, 
on whose behalf she parroted the claim that failure to ban MMT 
would add $3,000 to the price of new cars sold in Canada.  No 
such price increase materialized.  In the end, the illegal MMT 
ban cost Canadian taxpayers $13 million, money Ottawa had to pay 
in compensation to Ethyl Corp., the U.S. maker of MMT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Illegal Protectionism is in the pocket of 
Canada's two major magazine publishers, Ted Rogers' Maclean 
Hunter and Philippe de Gaspé Beaubien's Telemedia.  Their 
magazines—<I>Maclean's</I>, <I>Chatelaine</I>, <I>TV Guide</I>—and 
the publications of a couple of other companies account for an 
estimated 50 per cent of the $350 million Canadian magazine 
advertising market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill (the minister) is pushing through second reading today 
is the latest in a string of mostly unlawful federal measures to 
restrict the freedom of Canadian advertisers to use and 
journalists to produce magazines, and of readers to read more 
Canadian content.  The (minister's) bill, however, is the most 
Draconian.  It gives the minister power to send out magazine 
police to seize documents and make sure Canadians are not placing 
ads in foreign publications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To justify the magazine laws, Heritage Canada spins a 
contradictory story.  On the one hand, it claims the years of 
protectionism have been hugely successful, with the proportion of 
Canadian magazines rising from 25 per cent of sales and 
circulation in the 1950s to 65 per cent today.  Then it claims 
that the industry is still being swamped with foreign magazines 
and needs more protection and subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what the government's own studies actually show is that the 
Canadian magazine industry has been crippled by the magazine 
laws. Growth in magazine advertising has been stagnant for years 
compared with other markets and other countries, mainly because 
there are not enough Canadian magazines or magazine advertising 
opportunities.  A government-sponsored study conducted by outside 
consultants concluded that if Ottawa allowed U.S. magazines to 
develop Canadian versions, or split-runs, the total volume of 
advertising dollars going to the English magazine market would 
jump 60 per cent from $212 million to $342 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if Ottawa lifted the ban on split-runs, magazine 
advertising by Canadian firms would jump 60 per cent.  Where 
would the money go?  The government study said most of it would 
probably go to U.S. magazines, although that's debatable.  But 
even so, the split-runs would generate more Canadian journalism, 
more work for writers, more Canadian content, and more business 
for Canadian ad creators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also far from certain that all the money would end up in 
the hands of U.S. publishers.  The real crimp in the Canadian 
magazine market has been a failure to develop Canadian magazines 
in key growth fields.  The government study (by Harrison Young 
Pesonen and Newell Inc.) identified four key magazine 
sectors—men's, sports, fashion and youth—that Canadian 
publishers have ignored.  Why?  Because the advertising flow is 
cut off by Ottawa, and because the existing Canadian 
giants—Maclean Hunter and Telemedia—have a stranglehold on most 
of the existing ad market. They and others have no competitive 
incentive to develop new Canadian magazines.  And foreign 
magazines are banned from actually serving Canadian interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Magazine protectionism has killed growth in the Canadian 
magazine advertising market, and thereby has hampered magazine 
growth. What is supposed to be saving magazines in Canada is 
actually crippling the industry.  This new law (by the minister) 
the Commons is expected to vote on tonight will continue to 
prevent growth in the industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left>So says Mr. Corcoran.  Quite frankly it is pretty obvious the 
reason why I have read the article is that I happen to agree 
completely with the content of what Mr. Corcoran has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of being on the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage in the last parliament.  I was involved in what 
became the copyright war. I can mention one of the poorly thought 
out sections of copyright law that was perhaps sold to the 
Liberal members, although I expect that they would have voted 
according to the minister's wishes in any event.  It was sold to 
them and sold to Canadians on one level and it turns out that it 
is totally different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the blank tape levy under copyright law. The blank 
tape levy was designed to say that Canadians who purchase blank 
tapes will in all likelihood be using them for illegal purposes. 
Rather than being innocent until proven guilty, a fee is going to 
be charged on these blank tapes because naughty Canadian people 
are going to be using them to illegally copy things that are 
subject to copyright.  This goes completely and totally against 
anything in Canadian law.  We should be deemed to be innocent 
until found guilty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister attempted to sell this on the basis that it was 
only going to be 25 cents.  Perhaps members can help me here. Was 
it 25 cents or 35 cents?  Now it turns out it is going to be 
dollars per tape, not 25 cents per tape. This is fairly typical 
for the minister; $1 billion here, $1 billion there might add up, 
but a dollar here, a dollar there does not really make any 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at this specific legislation. I know in terms of 
relevance the Speaker would want me to do that. The redefinition 
of advertising as a service instead of a good is contrived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My background is in sales and marketing.  I am very well aware 
of the fact that one may purchase some plastic and put some 
lights behind it and that is called an illuminated sign.  One may 
go to a magazine or a newspaper publisher and purchase a certain 
amount of blank space and then go to an advertising agency which 
will perform the service of actually creating what is going to be 
going on that piece of paper.  To suggest that it is a service to 
provide a piece of blank paper that will appear with whatever one 
chooses to put on it is such a stretch, that the bill falls on 
its nose right there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most onerous though in this bill is the fact that it creates a 
new class of investigator.  The province of Quebec has language 
police.  I guess the minister has learned something from the 
province of Quebec because now under this legislation we are 
going to have a magazine police force. This is really beyond the 
pale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned with respect to the blank tape levy, the 
legislation the minister managed to push through did say that all 
Canadians who purchased blank tapes obviously were going to be 
doing something illegal and therefore they were guilty and should 
pay a fee. In this particular case the minister goes one step 
further and actually creates a magazine police force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Into the hands of this minister, providing she does not get her 
UNESCO appointment before this comes through, we find that the 
minister will also be able to make trade law by order in council. 
That is a direction the Liberals absolutely love. The Liberals do 
not like the inconvenience of the democratic process which takes 
place in this House.  The Liberals like to pass legislation so 
that they will be able to go behind cabinet doors, behind closed 
doors, with advice from nameless bureaucrats and concoct whatever 
laws they want without having to come back to this place where 
the people of Canada through their elected representatives such 
as myself and the other 300 members in this House, have a say in 
the democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition this bill puts print media under federal 
jurisdiction.  It is ultra vires of parliament.  We cannot just 
simply say that in 1867 we happened to forget that what we wanted 
to do was to put print media under the control of parliament so 
therefore we are going to arbitrarily do that with this 
particular law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This law, if it was not so serious, would be funny.  This law is 
ultra vires of the fundamental freedoms of the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms, sections 2, 7 and 8 and the Canadian Bill 
of Rights 1960, section 1. This law violates especially the 
freedoms of expression, the press and association provided for in 
both statutes and the enjoyment of property provisions in the 
Canadian Bill of Rights 1960 and common law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also violates charter security rights under sections 7 and 8. 
The freeze on business in clause 21 deprives affected 
corporations of future property and the effect of the entire bill 
is to hobble publishers' ability to enter into contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister really enjoys her version of Canadiana.  She 
certainly comes across as a very sincere and earnest person. With 
a feeling of generosity I am prepared to give that the minister 
actually believes in what she is doing.  I think she really does 
believe in what she is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that we are not in 1867.  The last time I 
looked the date on the calendar was 1998.  This government and 
its predecessor the Conservatives have entered into international 
trading agreements that impact my friend's wheat, the auto pact 
and the entire trade we do around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that we trade on a daily basis with the 
United States alone over $1 billion a day back and forth.  What 
is the size of the cultural trade?  The size of the cultural 
export in Canada is slightly under $1 billion.  I am not talking 
about only magazines.  I am talking about television, recordings, 
publishings, our authors and everything in the entire cultural 
component.  By taking this one tiny section, $350 million of 
revenue, what this minister is doing is throwing it to the wind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, not if but when this bill is trashed by the 
World Trade Organization because it is so flawed, we will end up 
with the situation that we will have punitive action against us 
by our most significant trading partner.  It will be able to take 
that punitive action in whatever field it so chooses.  It could 
be against steel from Hamilton.  It could be against computers 
from Kanata.  It could be against wheat from the west.  It could 
be against softwood lumber from British Columbia.  It could be 
against nickel in Newfoundland if it every gets going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that this bill is so egregiously flawed.  There can 
be no question that this bill will be struck down.  What we are 
doing is inviting retaliation against the entire package of 
imports and exports that Canada is involved in.  For what?  For a 
misguided attempt on the part of the heritage minister to protect 
something that cannot be protected in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reflect back on Mr. Corcoran's column.  If we take a look at 
what has happened historically in Canada, when we have permitted 
true free trade we have ended up seeing what Canadians are 
capable of doing which is to rise to the top to become the best 
in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, the revenue minister might recall that in the 
Okanagan Valley there was subsidy on subsidy and protection for 
the wine industry.  Some of our friends from Niagara will also 
remember that.  At that time under the North American Free Trade 
Agreement or the FTA we ended up with having to trash those 
subsidies.  The sky was going to fall.  Everything was going to 
fall apart.  Canadians are so good at anything we set our mind, 
hand and resources to that we now have quality wine in Canada 
that will compete with any wine anywhere in the world.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  Because we were forced away from the subsidies.  We were 
forced away from the protection and we gave Canadians the 
opportunity to rise to the occasion and create the very best in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this kind of protectionism by the Liberals who say my 
goodness, if we are not protecting, if we are not making sure 
there are subsidies or the government can have some control 
because after all the government knows best, it is this kind of 
smother love that creates mediocrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very fundamental difference.  The Reform Party of 
Canada believes in the excellence and the superiority of 
Canadians in anything they set their hands to.  Just get the 
government out of their face.  Get the government out of trying 
to smother, control and protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the document the minister has brought forward, how in the 
world can that happen?  First, she has come forward with 
legislation that is fundamentally flawed because she calls 
advertising a service instead of a good.  The bill should fail on 
that one right off the bat.  Second, she is coming forward with a 
magazine police force.  I cannot imagine anything worse than 
having a bunch of cops around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister may make trade law by order in council.  She can go 
behind closed doors and make those laws.  I hope she does get her 
UNESCO appointment before that happens.  It is ultra vires of 
parliament.  Nothing in section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867 
or case law puts print media under federal jurisdiction.  She is 
reaching beyond the power of parliament.  She is reaching beyond 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine any right thinking person who would come to 
this House, unless they happened to be taking lessons from the 
animals that were grazing in the front yard of this building 
yesterday, who would end up voting in favour of this legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I enjoyed listening to my colleague's most excellent 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier we heard from the parliamentary secretary that there was 
nothing in this legislation which would inhibit Canada from 
fulfilling its international trade obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague agree or disagree with what the parliamentary 
secretary said earlier on whether this bill does in fact affect 
Canada's opportunity to meet its international trade obligations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this bill is a result of the 
World Trade Organization's striking down previous legislation. 
The bill does not fill the bill of being able to get around the 
restrictions of the World Trade Organization in any way, shape or 
form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be no other answer than the bill will be struck down 
as being outside the control or ability of Canada to act in this 
way.  The problem with that, in my limited knowledge of the World 
Trade Organization and the way these activities happen, is that 
if a bill or legislation is struck down and the affected country 
comes back with another piece of legislation that is also deemed 
to be inappropriate then the complainant, in this case the United 
States, would be able to pick off Hamilton steel, wheat, softwood 
lumber or be able to interfere with the auto pact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the severity of that, the challenge from the United 
States in the face of this unbelievably weak legislation leads me 
to a very deep level of concern.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are a number of 
fallacies we just heard that I think ought to be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it should be noted by all members that even the WTO 
recognizes that advertising is a service and is to be treated as 
such.  It falls under that agreement.  To say otherwise is simply 
inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it was rather interesting that the member would mention 
the article that appeared in one of the dailies today. The author 
uses a government study and accepts one of its conclusions that 
such a scenario would generate so much more revenue.  The same 
study reaches a conclusion that he does not share, therefore he 
does not agree with it.  He cannot have it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone either accepts what a study says, all of it, or not. The 
person cannot pick and choose, which is what the author was doing 
to justify his premise.  The member shares the premise that if 
foreign magazines were allowed to purchase advertising services 
in the country they could not or would not offer deeply 
discounted service.  Therefore they would essentially skim that 
industry and cripple the Canadian periodical industry which is 
exactly what this bill intends to prevent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it rather interesting that he would bring up the 
copyright matter.  The matter of tape levy has not been decided 
by the copyright board.  The member should be aware of that.  To 
say otherwise is just not accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I found most fascinating about his raising the copyright 
legislation, Bill C-32 at the time, as he will remember from 
committee, is that what happened then is happening again here 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party of Canada, as he was talking about smother 
love, is so enamoured with things American that it builds a 
bogeyman and says if we do this, they will do that.  They will 
quash us here and they will do this and that to other industries. 
It is prepared to treat cultural industries as second class 
industries in favour of others.  We are not prepared to do that. 
As government, we will stand for Canadian values and Canadian 
culture with respect to our trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most fascinating thing about the member's bringing up the 
copyright debate is that the Reform Party, as today, was then 
isolated.  It could not see beyond its blinkers that there are 
industries that have to be protected and promoted in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the crunch came, it was not even at the table.  It left the 
table. It was isolated then. I suspect we will see through the 
committee studies of this bill it will be isolated then as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party was right 
on the split-run bill before it.  We opposed the split-run bill 
and we were right, therefore we may be isolated but that does not 
stop us from speaking about what is the truth and what are the 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, with respect to the study, every study goes through a 
certain number of processes but a study arrives at a conclusion. 
It does not mean that a person cannot take a section of the study 
that is a valid exploration of certain detail and report on that 
exploration of detail and not arrive at the same conclusion as 
the authors of the study.  The member's point is not well taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the issue of copyright and being isolated, I can 
report to this House very clearly that what occurred in that 
instance, because of the support of the Bloc Quebecois as the 
official opposition for the government of the day, it was in a 
position of having a hammer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a collusion between the parliamentary secretary to the 
minister of the day and the lead hand for the Bloc Quebecois 
where there were meetings. This member will recall that there 
were informal meetings occurring in the hallway  What are we 
going to do now?  They came back to the table.  They would then 
go through a little tap dance and then they would go back into 
the hall again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reached the point of absolute frustration because of the 
collusion between the Liberals and the Bloc Quebecois to see that 
bill go through.  It was one of the low points of my time in 
parliamentary life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did not even have the decency to go around the corner. They 
just went out of earshot to concoct what was going on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately for the House the constituents of both those former 
members saw fit not to return them to the Chamber.  I do not know 
whether it had anything to do with the kind of activity that was 
going on in the hallway, but the point is that I was not going to 
be part of that process.  It was slanted in favour of the 
minister jamming Bill C-32 through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us is cut out of exactly the same piece of 
cloth.  The minister will see her backbenchers acting like 
grazing animals to make sure she gets the bill through. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately Bill C-55 is all about regulation.  It is about 
Canadian content “Copps”.  It saddens me to think that a fine 
Canadian performer like Bryan Adams, due to Canadian content 
rules brought down by the minister of heritage, is not considered 
a Canadian artist because he has produced in the United States. 
Shame on the minister.  The government does not have the decency 
to recognize Canadian artists who are well known around the world 
because they produce in the United States or some other such 
thing.  Enough of the Canadian content “Copps”.  No more 
regulation.  It does not help Canadian artists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will state again, as I did 
in my speech, that the Reform Party is absolutely committed to 
the fundamental concept that Canadians as a nation and as 
individuals are the greatest nation and the greatest people in 
the world.  Given a challenge, Canadians will always rise to the 
top.  Canadians will always be superior.  Canadians will always 
perform at a level far beyond what they even imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we need is for the Liberals to get out of smothering the 
initiative of Canadians with all sorts of unnecessary protection. 
We should be given freedom so that we can get on with the job of 
being the great people and the great nation we are. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to address Bill C-55 which reminds me of eating too 
much spicy sausage.  It keeps coming back again and again.  Just 
when we think cooler heads have prevailed and the Pepto-Bismol of 
the World Trade Organization has soothed the savage lining of the 
Liberal tummy, we find that it regurgitated.  It comes back up 
from the bowels of somebody's desk.  Here we are again in 
parliament debating a bill with new a number and a bit different 
tangent, Bill C-55 which was formerly Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must do something.  We must protect something.  If we are 
honest about it, we all know in our hearts that Canadian culture 
does not need protection.  It needs promotion.  In this case we 
are discussing Canadian magazines but not just them.  It is a 
broad cultural issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to understand that Canadian culture is worth promoting. 
It is worth unshackling from government regulation.  This great 
country with its multitude of cultural facets is worth selling to 
the world.  It is worth bragging about.  It is worth telling 
others in the world that if they want a cultural experience par 
excellence Canada is a good place to find it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of a Canadian cultural minister admitting that she does 
not even know what Canadian culture is, Liberal members need to 
say that we have great Canadian culture.  It has much variety. 
It goes from bagpipes to traditional dances, to native 
ceremonies, to opera, to whatever.  We have the whole 
smorgasbord.  It does not scare us on this side of the House to 
think that a smorgasbord is hard to digest.  We think it is a 
wonderful thing.  Canadians and others in the world think it is 
something to be proud of.  It is a good thing.  It does not give 
me indigestion and the rest of the world finds it very palatable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in support of the Canadian cultural industry.  It is a 
wonderful industry.  It produces lots of jobs with a good future. 
They are not just hewers of wood or carriers of water.  It is an 
expanding market.  It has huge potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is in the computer industry, the animation industry, 
the newspaper industry as we are seeing on the front pages of our 
papers today, or the magazine industry, people want to come here 
and invest their money not because of protection but because they 
see it as a viable growing industry with a Canadian flavour that 
sells not only in Canada but around the world.  My hat is off to 
this industry.  Good for it.  It is doing its job and I 
appreciate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to see this industry blossom and thrive, but what is the 
government's response?   A press release of the minister 
indicated that only Canadian periodical publishers would be able 
to sell advertising services aimed primarily at the Canadian 
market to Canadian advertisers.  In other words, any split-run 
magazines like <I>Time</I> or <I>Sports Illustrated</I> whose 
editorial content is similar to their foreign original will not 
be able to bring their wares into Canada and solicit advertising 
space to Canadian companies.  That is pretty ironic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leaf through the latest edition of <I>Maclean's</I> 
magazine.  Let me just crack it open.  This is supposedly our 
national magazine.  On the first full page is a Jaguar 
commercial, one of those great Canadian corporations, I guess. 
Then there is the next one, a full page Toyota ad.  That is good. 
I do not mind that.  There is one from Sheridan, a good Canadian 
company.  Then there is one from Continental Airlines Express and 
a full page for Scotch whiskey.  That is good.  Anyway on and on 
and on it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The magazine attracts international advertisers with 
headquarters that may be in other countries.  Why?  It is not 
because they are forced to advertise.  They are not forced to 
advertise. If they want to address Canadians they had better 
speak to Canadians and use Canadian magazines to do it.  Nobody 
could tell Jaguar that if it wants to sell Jaguars to Canadians 
it should advertise in the Los Angeles <I>Times</I> or a Los 
Angeles daily newspaper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People advertise in Canadian products because they think that 
somebody will read it and that somebody will be Canadian.  They 
do not need to be told about that.  It is just a natural business 
decision and that is what they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to help <I>Maclean's</I> or any other magazine, we 
should make it so attractive to advertise and do business in 
Canada that no on in their right mind would consider not spending 
a portion of their international dollars on Canadian run 
magazines.  We want to be able to convince them that doing 
business in Canada is good.  That is the way to help the Canadian 
cultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A committee has been travelling around and meeting for months. 
It is wringing its collective hands about the future of 
professional hockey in Canada.  We could argue it is a sporting 
event which is sort of cultural.  I have always thought it was 
pretty much a part of the Canadian mosaic.  I love Canadian 
hockey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we wanted to hurt Canadian hockey how would we do it?  Over 
the last 25 years through successive free spending governments we 
have managed to drive the value of the Canadian dollar down to 64 
cents.  I use the royal we here.  I am including myself only 
because, I guess, I was a voter at that time.  As much as many 
Canadians were upset about it, the spiral of debt and deficit 
financing for years and years and years created an atmosphere in 
Canada that has driven our dollar down to 64 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess what?  Some Canadian businesses are in trouble over that. 
A hockey player has to be paid in American currency.  What will 
happen?  Canadian hockey teams, the ones situated in Canada, 
cannot hang on to their best players.  They are paid in American 
dollars.  Our dollar is in the toilet.  Their dollar is sky high 
because of differing policies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this sense our cultural activity is heading south.  What a 
shame.  One after the other Canadian markets are being shut down. 
We cannot compete primarily because of the dollar.  Our arenas 
are full.  Hockey programs are full.  Television networks are 
willing to sell it.  The bottom line is we cannot compete because 
our business structure is so out of whack in Canada that people 
cannot refuse a much better offer in the States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier we talked about the wine industry in my province.  It 
wins awards around the world, not because it is subsidized.  In 
fact it did not happen until the subsidy was removed.   It tore 
out all the old grapes.  It tore out all the old orchards that 
were heavily subsidized.  It planted a market driven grape, if we 
want to call it that, which I am told produces a wine that 
is—and I am not a wine drinker—one of the best in the world. 
British Columbia is sold and touted around the world as one of 
the finest places to grow wine. That is not a cultural activity 
but it is another example of people going where the good product 
is, not necessarily where the subsidies are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again and again when Canadians are allowed to trade freely and 
are unencumbered by government they do pretty well.  We are not 
going to win all the battles.  It is not like 100% of the game is 
always won 100% of the time by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another prime example is the softwood lumber agreement.  The 
parliamentary secretary mentioned earlier that the Reform Party 
was isolated on the softwood lumber agreement.  We were the only 
party in the House that stood and said “Warning, if you follow 
through on this you are going to put hundreds and thousands of 
people out of work”.  Nobody listened.  We were told we were all 
by ourselves over here and asked if we understood that the 
magnanimous government was to put together some trading, not free 
trade but an agreement that restricts trade to a few quota 
holders and so on.  The government was to manage it and tell us 
what could be sold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding every innovative softwood mill will be shut down. 
Most of them are shut down now and they will all be shut down 
within a year.  It is a sad prediction. Every time they create a 
new value added product they are told “Sorry, you cannot sell it 
because of the softwood lumber agreement”, no matter what they 
do or how inventive they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have even tried to saw boards into boards for little 
retaining walls to hold landscaping in place.  There is a huge 
market for them in the United States.  Even though it is a new 
product and a value added product, because they are joined 
together and treated, guess what?  “Park it in your warehouse as 
you are not allowed to sell it”.  Why?  Because the government 
tells them what they can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not free trade.  It is not access to a market with 300 
million people.  It is a market that says the government knows 
best.  The mills in my riding have been told one after another 
“So, you have millions of dollars invested.  So, you are opening 
markets in new value added products.  We will shut all that 
down”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we end up with is a guy who saws 2x4s and ships them in 
bulk.  He gets to keep shipping.  However, the fellow that is 
putting energy and creativity into the value added product and 
doing what we have been told is the future, the right thing to 
do, has been told to shut down his business down and lose his 
investment.  That is what happens when there is interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to the example on the cultural side, the federal 
government is saying that to promote Canadian culture and to make 
it stronger it has to use its legislative muscle to keep Canadian 
magazines from international competition, which we believe Canada 
can and has met in the past and will again in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that Bill C-55 is not needed.  I cannot in my 
wildest imagination think that because of some advertising 
content or a split-run edition I am going to rush off and change 
my subscription to Canada's national magazine because somebody 
from Los Angeles has a magazine with Wayne Gretzky on the cover.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do Canadians not have enough grey matter to understand the 
difference between advertising and what they want to read?  When 
I look at the table of contents I want to read how things affect 
Canadians.  I am not going to find an American magazine that 
states “Canada, the high stakes tug of war on the environment. 
Nova Scotia's Liberals on shaky ground”.  I kind of like that 
one.  I read it twice because it was a good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's involvement in Kosovo, what is our future in Kosovo? 
What is going to happen to businesses like Northern Telecom and 
Nortel?  Those are Canadian questions I would like to have 
answered.  What is happening in health care with the waiting 
lists and so on, which was largely caused by this government?  I 
would like to read about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read book reviews about Canadian authors and 
Canadian subjects.  The reason I get that magazine is it deals 
with Canadian issues.  I do not dial up CNN on my television 
because I think it would be great to listen to some announcer 
from Chicago tell me about the weather patterns in Florida.  I 
dial in Canadian programming because I want to listen to Canadian 
stuff that affects me as a Canadian. I do not need advertising 
dollars to make me do that.  I do it because it is the right 
thing to watch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, guess what happens in this magazine? 
International organizations repeatedly advertise in a Canadian 
magazine with Canadian content not because they are told they 
have to but because the realize that Canadians read it.  If it is 
garbage it should not be subsidized or protected.  It basically 
can put out the same magazine 12 months of the year because 
nobody reads it anyway.  If that what we have here it does not 
matter how much regulation is put on it because it will not sell. 
Canadians will not buy it and advertisers will not advertise in 
it.  Nobody will care because the magazine is not worth reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if the magazine deals with Canadian issues the 
advertisers will advertise.  If you build it, they will come, 
culturally speaking.  That is what will happen.  They are looking 
for good quality magazines so they can say show us the product 
and we will advertise in it.  Anybody who thinks differently has 
not looked at the latest <I>Maclean's</I> magazine.  They are 
certainly not thinking on a whole realm of things, why, for 
example, <I>Canadian Gardener</I> might be of more interest to the 
latest gardening schemes in southern Florida. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that stuff does not grow in my garden I will not buy that 
magazine because I want the magazine to deal with Canadian stuff. 
Most Canadians understand the difference between reading about 
the latest adobe styles in southern California and the fact that 
west coast architecture is a little different.  They understand 
it and gravitate to it because it is what they want to read.  It 
is not because it is supported by advertisers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders why the federal government is putting so much energy 
and resources into this kind of initiative, an initiative that 
unfortunately may backfire again at the World Trade Organization 
as it did last time.  One wonders why this government thinks that 
putting this misplaced energy into protecting the split-run 
magazines is a vote getter or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a $1.4 billion a day trade deal with the Americans and 
it has been growing rapidly since NAFTA and the free trade 
agreement and now expanded to the WTO.  They are our best trading 
partners.  Contrary to what the Liberals tried to sell us in 
1993, they realized as soon as they were in power, within about 
two weeks they signed an agreement saying that Canada's economic 
well-being was based on access to the 300 million person U.S. 
market. They signed the agreement, as we knew they would and as 
we said they would in 1993 when we campaigned against them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the Liberals standing at an all-candidates meeting 
and saying—in our case it was article 2(c) of the World Trade 
Organization agreement which dealt with supply management—“we 
will never sign that without a strengthened article 2(c), you can 
count on it”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal candidate I was running against said “I would 
lay on the railroad tracks and stop the trains before we would 
sign that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks after the Liberals were elected in 1993 guess what? 
The Liberals signed the agreement.  Guess what?  Article 11 
(2)(c) is just the way it was when the Conservatives negotiated 
it. I warned our farmers not to trust these guys.  As it turned 
out I was absolutely right. This government did exactly as I knew 
it would and it signed the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  Because we live in an international rules based trading 
economy.  The government is half way there, half pregnant.  The 
government sort of wants to go but does not know what the 
gestation period is.  This government wants to do it but does not 
want to admit it.  It is sort of free trade but it cannot simply 
come out and say it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like the reciprocity campaign of 1911. Interestingly the 
Liberals at that time said the future lies in reciprocity. The 
future lies in free trade because Canadians can take on the 
Americans at their game and can win our share and more.  We have 
enough assets to pull it off, human and otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is $1.4 billion of trade between Canada and the U.S. and 
what are we doing?  In one minute we are poking the Americans in 
the eye.  We are saying “oh yeah, watch this”.  We are telling 
the Americans let's go, let's go.  We are taking on our best 
trading partner and saying let's go to the WTO. They are going to 
win again. The Americans will come back and kick our sorry 
economy all over the map because of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Americans win this the second time, the second time 
means they come back and the softwood lumber industry in my 
riding could be affected.  It could be grain shipments into the 
States. It might just be magazines and cultural activities.  But 
it could be anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can imagine the American negotiators saying “Oh boy, the 
election is coming up.  Get a little presidential butt kicking 
going here. Let us see what we can do to those Canadians because 
we won it again. Let us pick our spot. What is the best vote 
getter?  Let's knock the snot out of those Canadians for being 
lippy again for the second time when they knew full well and they 
were warned by the official opposition that this was going to 
happen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some American presidential candidate is going to use the 
opportunity of a WTO ruling on this bill and they are going to 
come back and hurt Canada bad for political reasons.  That is a 
shame.  It is unnecessary and should not be happening.  This bill 
should not pass.

the government would take this measure. I am wondering if my

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting how we want to have our cake and eat it too. 
There is a reciprocity agreement over there.  They want a free 
trade agreement except they do not want a free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One Canadian publisher, the proprietor of <I>Saturday Night</I>, 
said this about Bill C-55: “I have been a relentless opponent of 
these restrictive rules all the time.  I have been in business 
nearly 30 years.  I am opposed to the restrictions that 
representatives of the magazine are advancing on American 
publications.  We have been well received in those foreign 
countries, the U.K., the U.S.A. and Israel, where we do business. 
Canada should behave as those other countries do”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries say to Canada “If our guys want to advertise in 
your magazines and you want to sell into our markets go ahead. It 
is not a bad magazine and you are going to penetrate our market a 
bit, but some of our people like to read about Canadian stuff. 
Some of them are transplanted Canadians.  Some of them want to go 
to Canada”.  There is a market.  Sell into that market.  What an 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have 30 million people, a little country by world standards. 
Somebody says to us that in their country there are 200 million, 
300 million or a billion people like in India and they will let 
us sell into their market.  What we should be saying is thanks 
for the opportunity to expand our business.  Thank you for 
letting us sell into their market.  Let us hope for a .5% market 
penetration.  All of a sudden the circulation on the Canadian 
magazine goes through the roof.  With a free trade access like 
that there is access to billions of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, Canada wants to keep Canadian magazines in Canada and 
get a 10% market penetration on 30 million people.  There will be 
three million people who have ever seen the magazine.  It will 
never be more than that.  The business is restricted.  It cannot 
expand.  We will not let it expand.  It is the tit for tat thing 
in international trade.  If they will not let us go into their 
markets we will not let them come into ours.  That is the deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse than that, under the WTO arrangement it understands that 
other countries may choose to retaliate, but not on the magazine. 
They might say they were willing to let the magazine come in.  It 
is not that big of a deal and there will be some market 
penetration.  But may the best magazine win.  They are willing to 
try that.  They are willing to offer that.  They may come back 
and say they have had trouble with our textile industry because 
it takes them on and beats them half the time. So they get back 
at the Canadian government for its intransigence by 
countervailing on textiles.  Or they might come back to the 
softwood lumber agreement that has already put thousands of 
people out of jobs in my province and expand it a little.  They 
might put another tariff on top of all of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the Asian market has gone into decline, our primary 
market is in America right now for software lumber and a lot of 
our grains. What if they came up and said that the wheat does not 
go south of that border, that imaginary 49th parallel on the 
map?  They tell us to keep our wheat.  They give their subsidies 
to their farmers, pump them up and get them in business.  But 
that industry is going to suffer because of a magazine bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of a strained logic on that side over there would say 
they are going to take this to the WTO, poke the people in the 
eyes until they get them nice and mad like boiled owls.  They are 
going to be all claws, beaks, feathers and scratches.  They are 
going to come out of there like a broken helicopter.  They will 
come out of there mad.  They will say “did we not deal with the 
split-run issue once already?”.  A similar panel is going to get 
this.  It will not have an epiphany, a road to Damascus 
experience.

that next one.  It is going to crack open the magazine and say 
“Guess what folks, the rules are the same as the last time and 
will be the same the next time, but there will not be a next time 
because we ruled in favour of the plaintiff”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of creating jobs in Canada and encouraging diversity and

industry that is innocent of what the government is doing.

one of the industries in my riding, I do not know what it will do 
to the federal buildings in my riding as there are not many left 
in my riding anyway because they have all been transferred to 
Liberal ridings elsewhere.  They will be some upset and I 
understand why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the minister of culture figures she has not had enough of 
the spotlight lately.  Maybe she wants to by all stretches of the

isolated.  It had to do with the MMT legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sat on this side of the House and begged the government not 
to put restrictive legislation on that octane enhancer for those 
who are not familiar with the issue.  We said that if the 
government did that, the government would be taken to court and 
would have to pay because it had not tabled the evidence in this 
place which showed that it should be restricted. What did the 
government do?  It thumbed its nose at the official opposition. 
That is fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals do not agree with us because they like to be wrong a 
good part of the time.  They did not agree with us and what 
happened?  I wonder if the Liberal caucus even had a discussion 
about this. Guess what happened.  Back it came.  It did not go to 
court though.  We settled out of court.  Tens of millions of 
dollars were given to the Ethyl Corporation, an American 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said that for whatever these dollars were worth, 
and the dollar is not worth that much, it being down to 64 cents, 
as much as we can gather together we will throw at Ethyl 
Corporation.  Why?  Because members over there do not believe in 
free trade.  They mouth the words when it suits them and the rest 
of the time they restrict business; they put them under their 
thumb. Business that could be thriving and adding value is told 
it is not welcome in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tens of millions of taxpayers' dollars went to pay Ethyl 
Corporation in an out of court settlement.  I wonder if the 
Liberal caucus had a little talk about that with their minister. 
I wonder if they said that the Reform Party was right, again. 
Yes, we were isolated on that and we were right again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Bill C-55 and the split-run magazine issue, we will be proven 
right again.  The Liberals will come whining back into this 
House.  The favourite whine on the Liberal side is “I want to 
tax and put on some more red tape”.

it is a pleasure to enter into this debate on this piece of 
legislation which has been so clearly illustrated by the official 
opposition as lacking in so many ways and so many areas. I will 
focus my comments on a few points.  There are so many comments I 
would like to get on the record that I am afraid I might not have 
a chance to get them all on but I will try. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some particular portions of Bill C-55 should be very alarming 
for everybody in this place, particularly the section which goes 
into establishing an investigative branch that can explore people 
who violate this law.  That violation would be Canadian 
advertisers selling advertisements to American magazines and 
things of that sort.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of problems in our country.  There are a lot of 
things happening.  I know that this government wants to address 
the serious issues in our country.  We would think and hope that. 
After all, it is the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead what we see is a bill being presented which simply 
addresses one issue of magazines.  We can only imagine that it 
might be because the minister of heritage is not getting into the 
spotlight very much in the last little while and needs, as one of 
my colleagues pointed out earlier, a reason to justify her 
department and what she is doing there. Perhaps that is why she 
has created this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that in Vancouver there are some serious problems going 
on.  This bill would introduce some police force powers to 
individuals to investigate the selling of advertising in 
magazines.  I do not think that is an issue that is resonating 
across the country. I am not getting calls in my office about 
this issue. I am getting calls about a lot of other issues.  I am 
getting calls in my office about a serious drug problem happening 
in Vancouver, about problems with the immigration system and the 
government's refusal to address those kinds of problems.  I am 
getting calls in my office about cuts to the RCMP budgets in 
British Columbia and how that is having a profound impact on 
every citizen in British Columbia and across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet this government sees fit to introduce a bill that was 
defeated once already by the WTO ruling. This government knows 
that, yet it is proceeding with this.  It does not make any sense 
as to why the government would clearly go ahead again with this 
type of bill which cannot stand on its own merits. That has been 
proven and it is going to happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a government brings forward a bill, we would expect it would 
check into what might be the ramifications of enacting the 
legislation.  The government knows that a similar bill was 
defeated once before.  It knows what the ramifications were when 
it was defeated, when it was appealed and lost at the WTO.  Yet 
the government has gone ahead again. We would think the 
government might have caught on that this is not a bill that is 
going to be able to do what it is intended to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that we need to protect Canadian culture. We 
say we need to promote Canadian culture.  We have heard 
government members who want it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Liberal government who were in opposition at the 
time spoke long and hard against free trade.  Yet when they 
formed the government in 1993 they rapidly signed that agreement. 
We see here with this bill the true colours of where the Liberals 
stand on trade.  They are not really supportive of a free trade 
agreement that would allow for the movement of goods and services 
across the border to our biggest trading partner and we are 
trading over $1 billion per day. In this bill the minister of 
heritage is putting forth a protectionist act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear and it has been demonstrated before.  We have 
been pointing it out all day long and in past days as well. We 
will continue to say it and forewarn the government of what might 
happen by the actions of this bill.  The government has to get 
the message on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the heritage minister really wanted to do something for 
Canadian magazines she would listen to one of her colleagues. The 
minister of defence said in a speech on January 27, 1997, 
“Perhaps in the new digital world policies of cultural promotion 
make more sense than traditional policies of protection”.  What 
a surprise.  One of the minister's own colleagues gave some good 
advice which she obviously has not heeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there is quite a stir going on in cabinet. We can only 
imagine what is happening.  The Minister for International Trade, 
the Minister of Industry and perhaps the Minister of Finance in 
talking to the Minister of Canadian Heritage might be saying 
“What in the world are you doing with this?  We lost it once 
before.  We are going to lose it again and there are some pretty 
serious ramifications”. But no, she is going ahead with the bill 
in the face of its obvious inadequacies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is putting at risk industries in our country, 
people in our country, workers in our country who face possible 
retaliation when this is struck down once again by the WTO.  We 
heard the parliamentary secretary say that this will go through 
the WTO, that we have met all the obligations, that everything is 
fine and not to worry about it.  I would disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention a few remarks in response to this bill when it 
was introduced.  These remarks were released in Geneva by the 
U.S. trade representative in response to Bill C-55, the bill we 
are debating today which was introduced by the minister of 
heritage.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 8, the Canadian government introduced a bill in 
parliament that, if enacted, would ban foreign-owned publishers 
from using the magazines they publish to carry any advertisement 
aimed primarily at Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, it leaves foreign-produced split-run periodicals 
precisely where they have been for the past 30 years—shut out of 
the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is also disturbing about the bill is that it apparently 
represents Canada's idea of compliance with the panel and 
Appellate Body reports on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada seems to believe that while it may violate the GATT for a 
government to confiscate 80 percent of the advertising revenues 
generated by imported split-run magazines, it is perfectly 
acceptable to ban those advertisements altogether. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the trade representative for the United States.  We are 
not looking into a crystal ball and saying that we think this 
might happen, that the Americans might voice opposition to this 
bill.  One of their senior people is saying what they are going 
to do, yet this government still proceeds with this bill. I will 
continue to quote this representative: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian officials are justifying their new bill on the grounds 
that it is governed by the anti-discrimination provisions of the 
GATS rather than the GATT.  Conveniently, Canada has made no 
commitments regarding advertising under the GATS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is surprising that Canada would believe its GATT v GATS 
argument which the panel and the Appellate Body so soundly 
rejected in 1997 has taken on credibility in 1998. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the same arguments which were defeated previously now 
being put forward as valid?  The U.S. trade representative 
mentioned this.  He continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clear and intended effect of Canada's proposed legislation is 
to prevent imported magazines from being used to carry 
advertisements aimed at the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is precisely what Canada's 80 percent tax prevents as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taken together, the bill introduced on October 8, and the 
perpetuation of Canada's postal subsidy scheme, which the 
Canadian Government has also announced, send a very troubling 
signal regarding Canada's seriousness in abiding by its 
international obligations and, in particular, in observing both 
the letter and spirit of the WTO's dispute settlement rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For well over a year Canada steadfastly refused to disclose any 
of the alternatives it was considering or to consult with 
interested governments regarding its compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, after dragging out its response for almost 15 months, the 
Canadian Government has suddenly announced proposed replacement 
measures that are still discriminatory and protectionist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We strongly urge Canada to reconsider the course it has chosen. 
the United States intends to react vigorously if that is not the 
case. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government will not listen to members of the opposition, 
perhaps it will listen to the American representatives who have 
the power and the ability to go ahead and challenge the WTO 
agreement.  They have announced— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Phone the ambassador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, members opposite are not 
interested in listening.  They do not want to listen to advice. 
They want to heckle; they want to read papers.  They are not 
interested.  They are not interested in the concerns of 
Canadians. They do not want to listen to any advice because they 
think they have it all worked out. They say “Everything is fine, 
throw us the keys, we will drive the bus, do not worry about 
it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House are not going to do that. 
We are not going to toss them the keys and let them drive the car 
off the road as they have done the last 30 years, with a few 
intermissions.  No, we are going to point out the deficiencies in 
their bills.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  The member says “Go ahead”.  If he 
had put his paper down long enough he might have heard some of 
the earlier comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are obviously problems with this bill.  They have been 
pointed out by members of the opposition, and not just by the 
official opposition but by other parties as well.  U.S. trade 
representatives have said that there are problems with this bill. 
They have clearly signalled their intention to challenge it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they challenge this and win is when the trouble will start 
for the industries across this country.  We do not know where the 
retaliation will take place, whether it will be western Canadian 
grain producers or an industry in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are over 100 members of the Liberal caucus representing 
Ontario.  I would have thought they would have some concerns 
about this.  I do not see members standing on the opposite side 
voicing their concerns.  They will have to pay the price when 
this legislation goes through, when the challenge is made and 
this bill is soundly defeated in the World Trade Organization as 
being unfair, discriminatory and protectionist, as it most 
obviously is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the members opposite who will be responsible.  They will 
have to answer.  They have been forewarned, as they have been 
forewarned on many things before but have not taken the advice. 
Unfortunately, they do not like to take advice from members of 
the official opposition.  We know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we would hope that in the interests of Canada, in the 
interests of their constituents, in the interests of all of our 
industries across this country that they would have a plan of 
action before putting something in place.  We would hope that 
they would take a look at the legislation they are bringing 
forward to see how it will impact the people of this country and 
the economy of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that we are seeing the Canadian dollar dropping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is responsible in a large way for providing an 
economic climate to allow industries to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see this government introducing this type of bill rather than 
dealing with some other major priorities that we have been asking 
it to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to remind my colleagues opposite that this bill is badly 
flawed.  I think members opposite know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing to proceed on a course of action, whatever it 
might be, if we truly believe something to be so, and to proceed 
on that course of action that will provide some benefit in the 
future.  It is another thing to proceed on a course of action 
when we know full well that that course of action is not a good 
course of action, that there are obstacles in the way, that it 
will not be of benefit.  There are other terms to describe that 
way of thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why the government is proceeding in this 
manner, with this legislation, in a way that will imperil 
Canadians working in many other fields across the country.  We do 
not know what the retaliation is going to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply do not understand why it is that we would proceed to 
try to disrupt, maybe unintentionally—and I will give the 
government the benefit of the doubt—and to aggravate our biggest 
trading partner on this issue.  They can obviously retaliate in a 
number of ways.  It could affect the softwood lumber industry in 
my province of British Columbia.  It could affect those involved 
in farming, in the prairies in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father-in-law is a former farmer.  These are the people who 
are talking about what it is we are dealing with in this place. 
What are the government's priorities?  That is what I hear from 
people when I talk to them about what is happening in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not ask me about the minister of heritage and Bill C-55, 
and what a great impact that will have on their daily lives. 
They are not raising those concerns.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just unbelievable that in the face of good advice somebody 
would proceed in a way that would not benefit the country.  The 
governing party is responsible for setting out a course for the 
country.  I do not see that happening in this piece of 
legislation.  What I see is exactly the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only encourage the members of the government who are here 
today and the government in general to re-look this piece of 
legislation to see the potential damage that it could cause. They 
should do the right thing and not proceed with it, but proceed in 
other areas of priority across this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that members of the government will reconsider moving on 
this bill and not stubbornly move ahead on a piece of legislation 
that is doomed for failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear loud heckling from members opposite.  I am sad to say 
that, once again, it looks as though a few of the members are not 
even willing to listen.  That is upsetting, not to me because I 
am used to it, but it is upsetting to the people of Canada, their 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is just not going to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  The members continue to heckle.  They 
seem to have no interest in wanting to listen to good advice, but 
that is their prerogative.  They laugh at good advice. They laugh 
at a serious issue that is going to affect a lot of industries, 
not just in my riding but in their ridings right across this 
country.  What do they do?  They sit in their seats and laugh. We 
must surmise that they are laughing at Canadians because this 
bill will impact Canadians across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that instead of laughter we might hear intelligent 
debate in this place from members on the other side, because we 
know it is coming from this side.  We would like to hear some 
other ideas from members opposite because this one is simply not 
a good idea.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know where to 
start.  That was one single argument, repeated 1,500 times.  I 
guess repetition does not necessarily make an argument any 
better, but we will leave that for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment a bit on some of the comments made by the 
member for Fraser Valley.  He was touting a magazine and quoting 
from it, telling us that he liked to read Canadian stories in 
Canadian magazines.  We all agree.  He then made a statement to 
the effect that he does not need advertising.  We all know that, 
but that is the point of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For him to be able to read those Canadian magazines and read 
those Canadian stories, those magazines need advertising dollars. 
That is the point of this legislation.  I think he might be 
starting to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the longstanding policies of the Government of Canada has 
been to help the magazine industry in securing enough advertising 
dollars by not helping split runs.  If we allow foreign magazines 
without any Canadian content, without any expenses on that side, 
to come and skim advertising dollars and services, then we will 
indeed cripple our Canadian magazine industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather heartening to see that one of the members of the 
Reform Party understands that somebody might need advertising 
dollars in order to put out these magazines.  That is the purpose 
of the bill.  We hope to get it through second reading and to 
committee and, with the help of the opposition parties, we will 
move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to all of the speeches from Reform members and 
there is a theme coming out.  I thought initially it might have 
been sheepishness on their part in that they were raising these 
bogeymen.  They say that we are poking our American neighbours in 
the eye and they are going to retaliate.  They say that we should 
not aggravate them because they will then come around and kill 
our wheat industry, the hog industry and softwood lumber.  They 
threw in hockey and a lot of other things.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I was not accurate about them being sheepish, because the 
more I listened the more things came out, such as “We should 
listen more to the American trade secretary saying this and that. 
We will not win.  We will go to the WTO and they will quash it”. 
It seems that members of the Reform Party are not here to defend 
Canadian interests.  They seem to be here to defend American 
interests.  They seem to be defending anything that is foreign, 
but not Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to help an industry that has grown over the past 30 
years, an industry which consists of 1,000 small businesses and 
employs over 6,000 Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members are giving me the impression that they may not be 
sheepish, but they seem to be Americans in sheep's clothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I know with all of those sheep in there that 
there was a question.  I am going to give the hon. member a 
chance to comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was trying hard to 
detect a question, as I know you were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned that I repeated things several times. 
I must admit that I did repeat things several times because I was 
hoping that the message would get through.  Obviously it has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about here is a protectionist measure that 
the government is putting in place.  The parliamentary secretary, 
and I think he knows it, tries to paint Reform in a light that is 
just simply not accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to my comments about the American trade 
representative, in fact this is something that he stated will 
happen.  This is a high ranking official saying that they are 
going to go ahead and challenge this.  It was defeated once 
before.  To not address that, to not give that some weight in 
their considerations before moving ahead I think is just unwise. 
That is why I made the comment.  It was made to let the 
government know that this is a weak piece of legislation.  It is 
going to be challenged.  The government is going to lose.  It 
lost once before.  That is the reason I mentioned it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, very quickly, Canadians value freedom of contract.  This 
bill authorizes the Minister of Canadian Heritage to make trade 
law without going through regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking at this from the standpoint of an advertiser.  An 
advertiser wants certainty in terms of planning their advertising 
dollars.  There is no certainty when we have a ministerial 
prerogative such as that.  Besides not liking it as a 
parliamentarian, I am thinking of it as an advertiser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to comment on that aspect of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a concern.  This 
bill of course limits who Canadian advertisers are going to be 
able to put their advertising dollars with.  I do not understand 
that principle.  That is a principle that seems contrary to other 
government policy, particularly in light of free trade.  So I 
simply do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that the bill is weak in a number of areas.  The 
area that my colleague points out I did not mention.  Absolutely 
it is a problem.  There should be freedom of the press and 
freedom of individuals to go ahead and advertise with whomever 
they like.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
if I may, I will just make a few comments and ask a short 
question to conclude this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate really is about democracy, freedom of speech and 
freedom of expression.  On the opposition benches it is about 
trying to keep the government out of trouble.  We have heard the 
arguments that were aired in terms of retaliation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of North American society is that we depend on the 
Americans for a healthy economy.  There are two things we agree 
on.  One is that Canadians love Canadian content in whatever they 
hear, read or watch.  I am sure all sides of the House agree to 
that.  The other statement I can make is that our economy depends 
on that of the United States.  We are fortunate with the Asian 
flu that the American economy probably shelters us from a greater 
impact in light of the weak dollar in this country.  Those are 
the two points that I am sure we all agree on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of freedom of speech I believe that when the bill 
becomes law it will be subject to the courts' judgment.  As soon 
as it becomes law the private sector will take it to the courts. 
There is no doubt about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to comment on the important points made 
by my colleague.  I hope the government is listening to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the bill is weak and my colleague has 
pointed out another weakness.  I know he is the critic for the 
area.  He has studied the legislation in depth.  He has tried to 
make interventions with the minister to advise her that this is 
not a good way to proceed.  It was not for his own gain but 
because he sees this piece of legislation as flawed.  This is 
another flaw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be problems with the legislation.  There will be some 
court challenges because the bill limits the rights of Canadian 
advertisers to advertise where they would like to advertise. That 
is clearly infringing on people's freedoms.  We hope the 
government will listen to the points that we make before 
proceeding on this course. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for the last hour or so I have been somewhat appalled by 
the cavalier attitude of the parliamentary secretary and some of 
his yappy cohorts toward the well-being and the opportunities 
that may be lost to earn a living by tens of thousands of 
Canadians who will be affected if we get ourselves into a trade 
war over this stupid piece of legislation.  This is not a joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are frightened as to what may happen if this position is 
overturned by the WTO, and I think it probably will be.  We will 
be vulnerable.  We will be open.  To use a certain amount of care 
is not, with due respect, being sheepish.  It is being sane and 
sensible.  The bill can really hurt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary says that 6,000 people will be 
directly affected by the legislation.  I question that.  There 
are 6,000 people working in the industry.  There are not 6,000 
people who will be directly affected by the legislation because 
we are dealing with a rather small segment of the magazine 
market.  This is not as big an issue as the parliamentary 
secretary would like to make out.  The potential for damage from 
this unimportant piece of legislation is enormous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It behooves the parliamentary secretary to be a little more 
thoughtful and respectful of the hundreds of thousands of people 
employed in basic industries such as the agricultural industry. 
They are vulnerable.  They have been attacked before by the 
Americans under trade rules.  In some cases those who study this 
sort of thing are quivering in their shoes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used to have a very large German shepherd—this is a true 
story by the way, not a parable—that I kept fenced in my 
backyard.  There was a little boy in the neighbourhood, who was 
not a bad kid, who could not resist tormenting my dog. 
He would go down the ally on his bicycle, run a stick along the 
fence and rattle the boards.  Then he would get off his bicycle, 
look through the fence and torment my dog.  One day he did that 
but did not realize that the back gate was open.  This big dog 
ran out, grabbed the poor kid by the leg and gave him a pretty 
serious bite.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States is a very mean big dog.  We should not torment 
this beast, unless we see some real benefit or some potential 
advantage in doing so, because he will bite.  He has bitten us 
before and he will bite us again.  We should not mess around for 
a trivial reason and endanger something which is terribly 
important to ordinary working people in this country.  We can 
make light of this problem as much as we want, but it is not 
something to be taken lightly.  These are very serious concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have walked down this road before on the split-run issue.  We 
lost.  If we lose a second time, the game is over and we are 
vulnerable for retaliation.  Those guys play rough.  I think a 
bit of common sense should be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from the practicalities of the question, I get a little 
tired of members opposite who seem to believe that Canadians are 
children, that Canadians are incapable of managing their own 
affairs, that Canadians left to their own devices will buy out 
all the <I>Playboy</I> magazines in the cornerstore but will not 
read <I>Saturday Night</I>.  This is rather a low view of our 
population but it seems to be what drives the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member beside me made a comment a little earlier about 
smother love.  This is a typical example of smother love, trying 
to control what people read and what people hear.  It is thought 
control.  <I>Nineteen Eighty-Four</I> may not be very long behind 
us, but we still seem to have some of the ideas Mr. Orwell 
brought forward in his book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free speech, freedom to do business with whom we wish, freedom 
to own property and control it any way we like, free press by all 
means and freedom of contract, do these things not matter at all? 
Why are we throwing out these important aspects of our culture 
ostensibly to protect our culture?  It is a contradiction of 
terms and I will not accept it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed earlier the hon. member for Brampton Centre, while my 
colleague was speaking, was very busily reading a newspaper.  I 
did not notice what newspaper it was.  However it occurred to me 
that hon. member probably would not be too happy if the media 
police or “Copps” cops were to say to him that he could not 
read that paper any more because it was published in the wrong 
city, never mind country.  If they said they wanted him to read 
the Toronto <I>Star</I> whether or not he liked it and would pass 
legislation which would make, for example, the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> sit up and take notice because it is not always 
very nice to the government, how would he feel? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like people to think about such things.  Sure, it is a 
stretch but not a very long one because this is the sort of thing 
the government is proposing to do.  It is telling Canadians what 
they may or may not read by using the big economic hammer on 
advertisers. 
This is shameful.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Extraterritorial legislation, which is what this is if we look 
at it closely, has a very bad smell in this country.  Do members 
remember the Helms—Burton bill and how everyone from all parties 
was up in arms about it?   Now we are coming up with our very own 
version of extraterritorial legislation and it is okay in the 
eyes of the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are they coming from?  Where is the consistency?  Where is 
the basic concept of free trade which members of the government, 
having had their epiphany, claim now to support?  They support it 
when it is convenient to them, but when it interferes with some 
of their elitist ideas they say “None of this free trade 
stuff”.  That is bad.

more from the hon. parliamentary secretary.  I hope he will rise

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was deeply affected by the story the member told about the little 
boy and the dog, but he left us dangling.  My question to the 
member is very simple.  What happened to the dog? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He shot the dog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, actually I did not put the 
dog down.  The parents of the boy were very understanding.  They 
realized that the boy had been doing something he should not have 
been doing.  He had been tempting fate so they said “It 
happened, it happened”.  The dog lived to a ripe old age.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question for my colleague deals with the way in which 
the bill changes how we look at split runs as opposed to the 
previous legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crux of the way the bill is different from the previous one 
in many respects is the changing of a definition by legislation. 
Indeed this is a very weak way to redefine something and 
ultimately very challengeable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has the effect of changing advertising from a service 
to a good.  It is very construed and artificial.  Would the 
member like to comment on that in an intellectual spirit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we talked a few minutes 
ago about stretching things.  I would submit that calling 
advertising a service rather than a good is an extremely long 
stretch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have purchased a lot of advertising and I never thought of it 
as a service.  I was buying space in a piece of paper.  That is a 
good.  That is the principal reason that the legislation will be 
thrown out when it is challenged as it unquestionably will be 
challenged by the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to rewrite the English language by legislation. We 
cannot do that.  Language is something fluid, but we cannot 
change the rules.  We cannot change the language.  Advertising is 
not a service.  Advertising is a good.  It is something we buy. 
We can touch it on the printed page.  I am sorry, but I would 
have to say to my hon. colleague that this is the biggest weak 
point in the bill.  This is why it is subject to challenge.

Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a very simple 
question for the member opposite. Is he aware that the WTO 
recognizes that advertising is a service? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the WTO recognizes that 
advertising agencies provide a service.  The WTO does not 
recognize an advertisement, which is what we are talking about. 
That is what we buy.  We buy an advertisement in a magazine. That 
is not a service.  That is a good. The hon. member is 
equivocating.

under subclause 20(c) of this bill the minister is authorized to 
make regulations respecting “criteria to determine whether 
advertising services are directed at the Canadian market”.  This 
amounts to authorizing the Minister of Canadian Heritage to make 
trade laws without passing them through parliament. Will this 
undermine the authority of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my response to my 
colleague is, what else is new? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When in living memory has this government ever passed any 
legislation that could not be abused in that way?  Passing 
legislation with clauses that allow bureaucrats or people in the 
minister's department to step in and do whatever they please is 
the Liberal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not even answer my colleague's question directly except 
to say that the principle of what he is describing is despicable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (for the Minister of Canadian Heritage)</B> 
moved that Bill C-48, an act respecting marine conservation 
areas, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the motto “from sea to sea” is a fitting description 
of the country's geography.  We are bounded by three of the great 
oceans of the world, the Atlantic, the Pacific and the Arctic. 
Much of our southern border is demarcated by the world's largest 
freshwater inland lake system, the Great Lakes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With 243,000 kilometres of ocean coastline and an additional 
9,500 kilometres along the Great Lakes, Canada has the longest 
coastline of any country in the world.  This coastline includes 
some of the most spectacular scenery in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along the west coast there are endless miles of long, deep 
wilderness fiords.  The bays and coves of the Atlantic shelter 
the fishing outports and villages of the maritimes.  The Arctic 
although cold, barren and windswept is nonetheless strikingly 
beautiful.  It includes some of the least visited and unspoiled 
natural areas in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clear waters and rugged inland strewn shores of Canada's 
Great Lakes attract recreational sailors from around the globe. 
They have also served as a backdrop for the famous paintings of 
the group of seven.  Dramatic cliffs, the highest tides, 
spectacular icebergs, majestic fiords and the overall timeless 
essence of the sea are ours to enjoy as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's oceans and Great Lakes have played a large role in 
shaping the country's economy, culture and identity.  They 
contribute not only to our economic prosperity but also to our 
spiritual well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An act respecting marine conservation areas fulfils two 
commitments made by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first commitment was made by the Prime Minister to the 1996 
congress of the World Conservation Union which was held in 
Montreal. The Prime Minister stated “Our government will 
introduce legislation for the creation of a national marine 
conservation system, the marine equivalent of our land based 
national parks system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In “Securing Our Future Together” which set out this 
government's plans for this mandate, the government made the 
commitment “to establish new marine conservation areas and 
develop legislation and policies for a marine conservation 
system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The marine conservation areas act will protect and conserve for 
all time marine areas that are representative of Canada's Arctic, 
Atlantic and Pacific oceans and the Great Lakes.  It will also 
encourage public understanding, appreciation and enjoyment of our 
marine heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to highlight some of the reasons why it is important for 
Canada and indeed for the world that we move forward as quickly 
as possible with the establishment of a system of marine 
protected areas and how we are responding to that challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are, after all, a maritime nation.  The vast marine 
ecosystems off Canada's coasts are precious, varied and highly 
productive.  Given this rich diversity, Canada has a 
responsibility both nationally and internationally to protect 
examples of this marine heritage for present and future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is growing concern about the health of the planet's oceans 
and inland seas.  There is concern that our efforts to protect 
and conserve marine environments are out of step with our 
dependence on them.  There is concern that these waters remain 
largely out of sight and out of mind, and for too long a 
convenient place to dispose of our wastes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marine conservation areas have a role to play in striking a 
better balance between the protection and use of our marine 
environment.  Equally important, they have a role to play in 
increasing public understanding and appreciation of the 
importance of maintaining healthy lakes and oceans for the 
well-being of the entire planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada with its extensive coastline and the second largest 
continental shelf has much to gain from a comprehensive system of 
marine protected areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marine conservation areas will join our cherished national 
parks, historic sites, canals and rivers in representing our rich 
collective history and culture.  They will add to our sense of 
national identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of marine conservation areas responds directly to 
several national and international calls for action.  For 
example, the establishment of marine protected areas is an 
important strategic direction in the 1995 Canadian biodiversity 
strategy.  This strategy, endorsed by federal and provincial 
governments, will guide the implementation of the 1992 United 
Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A resolution of the 1994 general assembly of the International 
Union for the Conservation of Nature and its action plan call on 
coastal nations to establish representative systems of marine 
protected areas under national legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of marine conservation areas will make a 
significant contribution to implementing the sustainable 
development strategy of the Department of Canadian Heritage. That 
strategy, “Sustaining our Heritage”, was tabled in the House of 
Commons in December 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marine conservation areas established in Canada's exclusive 
economic zone will help to fulfil Canada's obligation in 
international law to take steps to protect and to preserve our 
marine environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now explain how Canada is meeting these calls to action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is committed to the establishment of a system of marine 
conservation areas that will provide a representative sampling of 
the full range of marine environments found in Canada's Pacific, 
Arctic, and Atlantic oceans and in the Great Lakes. To accomplish 
this, Parks Canada has classified Canada's marine environment 
into 29 distinctive regions.  The long term goal is to establish 
a system of marine conservation areas that represent each one of 
these regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada through its programs and in partnership with others 
will ensure that high quality marine interpretive programs and 
visitor facilities are provided to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of these areas will signal to Canadians and 
international visitors alike that these sites are the best that 
Canada has to offer, world class ecotourism destinations for 
those who wish to experience firsthand our unique marine natural 
and cultural heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-48 includes strong protection measures.  These are in 
keeping with international standards to ensure that marine 
ecosystems remain healthy and intact while at the same time 
allowing for the sustainable use of renewable resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be places where through collaborative research 
programs special efforts will be made to understand the nature of 
marine ecosystems and the effects of human activity on them. The 
research results, together with the traditional knowledge of 
local people, will be used to better manage our use of marine 
resources both within marine conservation areas and elsewhere. In 
this way, it is expected that marine conservation areas will 
serve an important function as models of ecologically sustainable 
use of marine resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada is the ideal organization to play the lead role in 
establishing and managing a national system of marine 
conservation areas in which all Canadians can take enormous 
pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada already manages a wide range of national parks and 
historic sites including 19 national parks on our coasts.  Parks 
Canada is an organization with considerable knowledge and 
expertise to apply to the protection and presentation of Canada's 
natural and cultural heritages. Just think of our national parks 
so admired around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Parks Canada cannot plan and manage these areas alone. 
To ensure success, Parks Canada must work with many government 
and non-government agencies that have responsibilities or 
interests in the planning or management of these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me assure Canadians that the shared stewardship in the 
planning and management of marine conservation areas has been a 
key consideration in drafting the legislation before the House 
today. Extensive public consultation has been central to the 
approach taken by Parks Canada for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the first policy on the planning and management of 
these areas was tabled in this House in 1986, more than 12 years 
ago after much public discussion. Similarly, current policy 
direction contained in the “Parks Canada Guiding Principles and 
Operational Policies” benefited from public input.  These were 
tabled in the House in March 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada also held wide ranging discussions with 
stakeholders prior to the implementation of Bill C-48.  In 
February 1997 “Charting the Course Towards a Marine Conservation 
Area Act” was released and invited public comments and 
suggestions from a variety of stakeholders.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking a proactive approach, this discussion paper was sent to 
more than 3,000 stakeholders.  Those consulted included 
provincial governments, aboriginal organizations, environmental 
groups, fishing and shipping associations, unions and the oil, 
gas and mining sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Parks Canada held a number of public meetings, as 
well as meetings with provincial governments and stakeholders. 
Drafting of the legislation benefited greatly from the 
presentations made at these meetings and the written briefs which 
we received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I want to reiterate that this government is 
firmly committed to the establishment of new marine conservation 
areas.  The passage of Bill C-48 is essential for us to fulfil 
this commitment.  Establishing a system of marine protected areas 
is central to the achievement of several national and 
international obligations of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The marine conservation area program is a new and challenging 
initiative for us and for all Canadians.  It was through a 
process of extensive consultation with Canadians that we were 
able to develop this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge all hon. members to support this bill.  I urge 
all hon. members to work with us on the government side to ensure 
passage of this bill, to work toward ensuring that what we have 
been able to accomplish with our terrestrial parks, beginning 
over 100 years ago with Banff, the tradition of protection, the 
tradition of foresight, the tradition of presenting Canadians 
with the very best that we have to offer can be brought forward 
in terms of our marine conservation areas. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is my privilege to intervene as critic for Canadian heritage 
on behalf of the official opposition on Bill C-48, the marine 
conservation act at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by saying that we oppose this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state has certainly painted a beautiful picture 
of a country called Canada which all of us in this House love and 
hold dear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the opposition agree with the principle of ecosystem 
protection.  That is not the issue and not the problem.  What we 
disagree with is the process and how it is being done.  This bill 
is poorly written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state has indicated that he feels this bill 
belongs to parks, but there really is no connection between land, 
parks and water and marine conservation districts or areas.  When 
most people hear about parks they think about places they can go 
to and experience with their families.  They think about 
protected areas that will be around for centuries so that all 
future generations will benefit from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a marine conservation act that is really 
about the conservation of marine areas.  In other words, it 
really should be in the hands of the environment minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is also about fulfilling, in a rushed manner, the 
obligations this country has in terms of United Nations 
initiatives on ecosystem protection.  Australia has quite a 
comprehensive program and plan, but it spent a lot of years doing 
extensive consultation, study and research.  This government, I 
believe, is rushing it this time to fulfil a requirement on its 
part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest reason we object to this bill is that it is really a 
grab for power again.  We find that a lot of bills that come 
before this House, after reading them, have too many places where 
the minister has the power by order in council to change the 
bill.  This bill is another one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will debate this a little later, but I am surprised that there 
is no schedule in terms of the areas that the government wishes 
to establish. 
In other words, we need to be more definitive in terms of what 
will happen if this bill becomes law.  There is no doubt that 
this is another bill that will leave Canadians with the short end 
of the stick while the government will end up with most of the 
stick.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultation is another problem.  Consultation is quite a word. 
Everybody has a different definition of consultation.  The 
secretary of state indicated that they sent out 3,000 pieces of 
mail to various groups in the country.  It would be interesting 
to see the types of responses they received.  It is all right to 
consult people, but let the people you are consulting with know 
what the results are.  If this is the same kind of consultation 
that the former justice minister had with Bill C-68, I am afraid 
I do not have a lot of faith in this government's consultation 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I travelled extensively throughout the summer.  I talked to 
people from different parts of the country.  I was asking them 
about this government's consultation process.  Lo and behold I 
found out that people are invited to meetings, but they get 
responses like “Sorry you cannot make it in the middle of the 
week because you have a job” or “It is too bad it is snowing. 
There is a storm, but the meeting has to take place anyway”.  A 
lot of questions were raised over the summer that made me believe 
people do not have a lot of faith in the consultative process of 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We appreciate the amount of work done by the Secretary of State 
for Parks, his officials and staff in preparing this bill.  The 
senior minister, the Minister of Canadian Heritage, really cares 
about parks.  Banff is probably a good example.  She makes 
comments here and there in her travels.  She has travelled 
extensively on the issue.  I assume that is why she travels all 
over the world.  During the first six months of this year she 
must have been preparing herself and her department.  The 
minister must have thought it so important that she and her staff 
used one of the Department of National Defence Challenger jets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 6 and February 7 the heritage minister travelled by 
Challenger corporate jet from Ottawa to Charlottetown and back at 
a cited cost of $7,439 and at an extended cost of $31,933.  The 
cited cost is what National Defence gives as a cost apart from 
all the overhead and capital costs of maintaining the jet.  The 
extended cost takes into account maintenance, salaries, overhead 
and other expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 12 and February 13 the heritage minister travelled 
by Challenger jet from Ottawa to Winnipeg and back at a cited 
cost of $26,000 and at an extended cost of about $54,474. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 25 and March 26 the heritage minister, or should I say 
the minister of Challenger jets, travelled from Ottawa to that 
great national park of Toronto at a cited cost of $4,157 and at 
an extended cost of $17,845. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 1 through May 4 the Challenger jet minister travelled 
from Ottawa to Hamilton to see the hockey coliseum of the famous 
name.  She went on to Barbados, to Recife in Brazil, back to 
Barbados and back to Ottawa.  This little fact finding tour set 
taxpayers back a cited cost of $45,510 and an extended cost of 
$195,354. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am doing this to show that we need more accountability and 
more credibility from the minister of heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 9 the minister travelled from Ottawa to Yarmouth, to 
Greenwood and back at a cited cost of $7,658 and at an extended 
cost of—

expressed now by the hon. member have anything to do with the 
topic of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know that the hon. member for 
Dauphin—Swan River will want to ensure that his remarks are 
relevant to the bill.  I think he is attempting to draw them into 
the bill and I am sure he will do that in the course of his 
remarks.  I would invite him to do that as he proceeds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that I am 
trying to connect the bill with the minister.  We are talking 
about credibility.  We are talking about the government side 
wanting the opposition benches to believe in the information 
presented in the bill.  I am saying, let us first look at the 
credibility of the department before I lead into the bill.  I 
certainly will be addressing the bill as soon as I go through 
this short exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From May 14 to May 17 the minister travelled, the jet set again, 
from Ottawa to Cork, on to Tunis and Santa Maria and then back to

faceless women who have stayed at home in their roles as wives

<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister would have Canadians bow and scrape before him 
because he has tinkered over the last while with employment 
insurance premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he knows that insurance premiums are still way too high 
and the average Canadian worker is paying $350 per worker per 
year too much.  The average business is paying $500 a year too 
much every single year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister knows it is against the law to use this in 
general revenue.  The Employment Insurance Act states this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and I want to know from the Prime Minister why he is 
planning to skim the employment insurance fund when the law 
states that he is not allowed to do it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, since our first budget, our policy has been to reduce 
the EI premium.  We did not follow the advice of Reform Party 
members who were telling us at that time to use the surplus to 
reduce the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite our deficit, we reduced EI premiums every year in a 
systematic, reasonable and responsible way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI surpluses have come into the government's consolidated 
revenue fund since the time the auditor general asked— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Fraser Valley. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am certainly glad the Prime Minister wants to listen to the 
auditor general.  The auditor general says that it is illegal, 
and he will report to parliament that it is illegal, to use the 
employment insurance funds for general revenue.  He says that 
money has to be used for insurance reasons and if it is not he 
will report it as illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor for the EI fund says that it is wrong to use the 
funds this way.  The auditor general says it is illegal to use 
the funds this way.  Why is the Prime Minister going to use the 
EI funds illegally when Canadians deserve a break and deserve it 
today? 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am surprised to hear the auditor general say that it 
is illegal to do what his predecessor asked the previous 
government to do.  We will wait for the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a policy of not listening to Reform members because they 
always change their policy.  When we first used the money to 
reduce the premiums, they wanted us to use the surplus to reduce 
the deficit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what the Reform Party has said is that those premiums and those 
benefits belong to Canadian workers and Canadian businesses and 
that the Prime Minister should keep his claws off them. Every 
single paycheque workers have EI reductions which amount to $350 
a year.  This is too much taken from their paycheques. Every year 
businesses have $500 in deductions.  This is too much taken off 
those paycheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized labour and the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business want a cut in employment insurance premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister not quit breaking the law and give a 
break to businesses and Canadian workers who deserve a break 
today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, the word “illegal” was a bit 
close but “breaking the law” I think is over the line.  I would 
prefer that we not use it anymore. 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on the other hand, we have BCNI and other business 
organizations telling us that rather than reducing the EI 
premiums we should give a tax reduction to the public.  They are 
telling us that rather than deducting money for corporations, it 
would be better deduct money for the employees.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are listening to representations from everybody.  One thing is 
for sure.  In the last five years we did not follow the advice of 
the Reform Party.  We did not use the EI surplus to reduce the 
deficit. We have used it to reduce the premiums.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I ask the hon. member to withdraw those last

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I ask the hon. member to go directly to his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the fact is no matter what 
the Prime Minister says and no matter what kind of rosy picture 
he paints, workers are being looted $350 a year out of their 
pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister rank spending almost $3 billion for 
a personal millennium monument higher than giving workers $350 a 
year to buy school supplies and snow boots for their kids? 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think there will be a lot, of the 100,000 
students, who will be receiving in the next 10 years a bursary 
from this government because of the millennium scholarship 
program who will think that we have not acted in the best 
interests of preparing the young people of Canada to be best 
equipped to face the challenges of the 21st century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, 5% of Canadian post-secondary students are far more 
important than millions of Canadian children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian workers need a break.  The Liberals have taxed away 
155% of any wage gains they have had in the last five years. 
Now they want to take another $350 a year from their EI surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister give Canadian workers a raise by letting 
them keep their money? 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I said and I repeat the Reform Party was asking us not 
to reduce the premiums but use the money to reduce the deficit 
and eventually the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As usual it has changed its position.  What is unbelievable is 
that when we are preoccupied with making sure the young people of 
tomorrow will be able to earn a good living because of good 
education, I note with pleasure the Reform Party is opposed to 
that.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
weekend, the Prime Minister said that he had met all Quebec's 
traditional demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, the day before yesterday, he did a complete about-face, 
opened up the door to the general store and said that, if 
Quebeckers voted for Jean Charest, he might have some 
constitutional amendments to offer them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the Prime Minister explain that his recent message of 
support for Quebec's Liberal Party has apparently not reached 
Jean Charest, who this morning was calling for the Prime 
Minister to change his attitude or quit? 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what I like is that, since yesterday, when the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and I said we had made changes, the 
Leader of the Bloc Quebecois and the Leader of the Parti 
Quebecois have been taking the credit.  The same people who say 
we are not making any changes are now taking the credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is good about this election campaign is that finally the 
truth is coming out.  Yesterday, the Leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois said that a vote for the PQ was a vote for a future 
referendum in Quebec.  Quebeckers are glad to see that the old 
tricks are over and the truth is coming to light. 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
said that there would be a winning referendum because there will 
be winning conditions and because the PQ will win the election.

floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, after the election, Canadians 
will realize that the Prime Minister is once again deluding 
himself with his predictions that sovereignty is headed nowhere. 
It is not the old tricks that will disappear, it is this Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister may well brag about everything he has done 
for Quebec, yet even his ally, Jean Charest, is calling for him 
to quit.  He has had enough too.  What does the Prime Minister 
make of that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am glad that an election has been called, because now the truth 
will begin to come out.  Yesterday, he talked about a 
referendum, but now he says only if the conditions are right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Quebeckers truly want to have winning conditions in order to 
have the wishes they have expressed in the last two referendums 
respected, in order to bring about real changes, they should 
vote for a Liberal government that wants to remain in Canada and 
not for a party that wants Quebec to separate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister has a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His ally in Quebec, his protégé 
Jean Charest, the one all the ministers want to canvas for, the 
one the Prime Minister again yesterday described as reasonable, 
wants him to adapt or leave.  What has he to say? 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what the Prime Minister has to say is that he, in this House, 
had a resolution passed on distinct society, which the members 
of the Bloc Quebecois opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a law passed in parliament giving a veto to all the 
regions in Canada, including Quebec, and the Bloc Quebecois 
opposed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time we have made changes in order to improve things for 
all Quebeckers who want to remain Canadian, the Parti Quebecois 
has opposed a true presence for Quebeckers within Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister's memory is fragile.  Not even Jean Charest came to 
vote for his empty resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> We have a Prime Minister who says he has 
met Quebec's demands.  He has just said so again.  Then we have 
Jean Charest, his ally, who says, on the front page of the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I>, that if the Prime Minister blocks change, he must 
leave. The two of them are contradicting each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is really speaking for the federalists? 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are the ones making the changes.  For 30 years we had 
problems with manpower in Canada.  Who managed to resolve this 
problem?  Our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It was the PQ. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B> Quebec, for 30 years, wanted to 
resolve the problem in education, which required a 
constitutional amendment.  Who helped Quebec resolve this 
problem by changing the Constitution?  It was the federal 
Liberal Party, here, in parliament.

We have put in place a very thorough safety net system in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time we are reviewing that.  I have called a 
meeting of the key farm leaders and the provincial agriculture

<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is 
a crisis.  We are talking about a crisis and in a crisis 
Americans do not just talk, they put their money where their 
mouths are.  Congress has just approved $6 billion more for 
emergency farm aid while this government says to Canadian farmers 
“You are on your own”.

the serious crisis on Canadian farms?

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting and I might inform the hon. member that the 
United States Department of Agriculture has been and continues to 
be in Canada to look at the system we have put in place for our

when the situation gets like it is.

defence minister says that pilots who are not comfortable flying 
Labradors have been told they do not have to.  But retired 
Lieutenant Colonel Dennis Hopping, a former Labrador pilot and 
CFB Greenwood base commander, said “It is very difficult as a 
member of an air crew team to say no, I won't launch an 
operational mission to save someone's life.  What a terrible 
position to put a professional pilot in”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister put these pilots in that position?  If one 
of them gets hurt flying the aging Labradors before the final 
report comes in as to what happened with that Labrador crash in 
Quebec, will he accept full responsibility for it?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

utmost concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not fly unsafe aircraft.  Air crews will not be forced

is still the perception that everybody else is flying. There is a 
perceived pressure to get back flying”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence minister said on Tuesday that Canada has other 
aircraft to do search and rescue. Why then is the minister

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the <I>Defence Policy Review</I> magazine is reporting that 
Brigadier General Walter Holmes, the military's central area land 
forces commander, told a meeting last weekend that the army is 
running a budgetary shortfall of $170 million. It is impossible 
for the military to operate even on the budget it has been given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the defence minister is, how much of this 
shortfall is a result of excessive government cutbacks? 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Department of 
National Defence, like all other government departments, has 
experienced significant budget reductions throughout this decade 
as a result of the government's commitment to fiscal restraint.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These reductions have had an impact on all budgets within the 
department, including that of land forces.  This has meant that 
all elements of the Canadian forces and the department have faced 
significant funding pressures and have been required to reduce 
expenditures to match available funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the overall resource planning process within the 
department, we aim to achieve a better balance between programs 
and resources. 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the problem gets worse.  Brigadier General Holmes also said that 
the overall national defence budgetary shortfall for the next 
fiscal year will amount to $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my way of thinking, the minister has a choice to make.  He 
can commit the necessary resources for a combat capable defence 
force, or he can tear the heart out of the Canadian military even 
further with manpower cuts.  Which is it going to be?

government's constitutional track record is assessed very 
differently depending on who makes the assessment: the Prime

Quebec's demands have been met, while the other maintains that 
everything remains to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Prime Minister tell us what message his ministers will

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and Minister

that, in the past few years, the agent of change in Canada and 
Quebec has been the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the federal government passed a resolution recognizing 
distinct society and gave back to Quebec the veto the PQ was 
responsible for losing. Finally, people in Quebec will have a 
real choice: the PQ and the Bloc Quebecois, which plan to hold 
yet another referendum that will surely kill investment and

economic growth and job creation.

the Bloc Quebecois and the PQ, which would have Quebeckers 
believe that they have generated economic growth, when in fact 
all they have produced is more unemployment and fewer

They have been playing the referendum card. They are losing

hampering growth and job creation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
let me set the record straight for the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of National Defence. The Reform Party has always 
advocated increased defence spending.  Now, back to the question. 
What choice will the Minister of National Defence make?  He can 
commit the necessary resources for a combat capable force to 
cover the shortfall of $1 billion, or he can tear the heart out 
further from the military by cutting back on manpower.  What is 
it going to be? 
<P><A NAME="LINK149"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, something is not right 
here.  The Leader of the Official Opposition, the hon. member's 
boss said on February 25, 1998 that Reform's alternative budget 
plan calls for holding the line on government spending for three 
years while dedicating the entire budget surplus to lowering the 
debt and tax relief.  Which is it going to be? 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence 
should get his facts straight and maybe hire a new researcher. 
His man does not know what he is talking about. The parliamentary 
secretary is lying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would ask the hon. member for Calgary 
Northeast to withdraw those words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will withdraw those words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would ask the hon. member to put his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National 
Defence has a choice to make.  He can either tear the heart out 
of the military further by reducing manpower, or commit the 
appropriate resources for a combat capable force.  Which is it 
going to be?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of

has always been to have a very competent army that was combat 
capable.  That is what we want and that is what we will continue 
to strive for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the leader of 
the federalist forces in Quebec noted that the Prime Minister's 
one-step-at-a-time strategy is completely unacceptable and 
ineffective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the Prime Minister's very credibility not suffered a blow

<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
were successful at having a resolution on distinct society 
passed, establishing a veto for the regions, resolving the 
manpower problem, resolving the problem of Quebec's school 
system by means of a constitutional amendment, and clarifying 
the situation with respect to mining, forestry, tourism and 
other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made much progress.  There are far fewer disagreements 
between the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party and myself than 
there are between the member for Roberval and the leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois. 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not 
think the Prime Minister would drag out the resolutions again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind him that even Jean Charest, a former federal member of 
parliament, preferred to be away from the House partying rather 
than have to vote on these resolutions the Prime Minister is 
boasting about.  That is the fact of the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the turn events are taking between the Prime Minister and 
the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, does the Prime Minister 
not find himself in a paradoxical situation promising us four 
years of bliss with his friend Mr. Charest? 
<P><A NAME="LINK156"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are making considerable progress.  That is why I am happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that Mr. Parizeau, who is back, told Mr. Bouchard that 
what was needed was a clear, not an ambiguous, question.  That 
is what we are calling for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want people to know very clearly that the Bloc Quebecois and 
the Parti Quebecois want to hold a referendum, whereas two 
thirds of Quebeckers are opposed, because they know that a 
referendum is bad for economic growth and employment, and means 
less revenue to put towards health and education.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I know the hon. member would not want to mislead the public into 
thinking that BST has been approved in Canada.  It has not been 
approved in Canada.  It may have been approved in the United 
States, but in this country we take our time to examine an 
application for approval.  BST will not be approved in this 
country unless and until it is proven to be safe.  We have been 
looking at it for nine years.  We are looking at it very 
carefully.  We will not approve BST in this country unless we are 
satisfied it is safe for use.

of our rural communities and it will not only continue to 
provide traditional services to the public, but also introduce 
government services, thanks to the new technology. For example, 
we are currently setting up DHRD employment and training 
information booths, in Quebec and in Newfoundland, and we will 
soon be announcing other additional services throughout the 
country, to serve Canadians wherever they live.

question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will know that in 1993 Canada agreed to reduce its 
subsidies under the WTO by 20% over six years, but instead of 
doing that we gutted our farm support program by more than 60% in 
that period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that U.S. wheat farmers now receive five times 
more in subsidies than Canadian farmers, making it impossible for 
our farmers to compete.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The work that was done on the WTO, the World Trade Organization, 
which reduced a number of tariffs to 85%, referred specifically 
to our supply managed area.  In the other areas we worked in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr.

Americans at the international trade talks.  They raced right 
home to chop farm subsidies and the Crow rate while the Europeans 
and Americans chopped nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's gullibility would be laughable if the 
consequences were not so serious for our farmers.  European 
parliamentarians told me there was no way they were sacrificing 
their farmers.

strong independent position when we go to the new talks coming

</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, when the government says “Don't worry” it

swept it into the shredder.  The minister obviously misses the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps the member did not hear my earlier response when I said 
that it is true a complaint has been made.  I think in fact it 
was a Tory staffer in the Senate who made the complaint to which 
the member has referred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information commissioner is looking into it.  The deputy 
minister has instructed the department to co-operate fully. 
Therefore, matters will be clarified in due course.

indeed it is substantiated, then I assure the House that

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is indeed a very serious matter.  It is like shutting the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Monsanto has contacted departmental officials with concerns that 
the Senate committee disclosed confidential information.  The

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  All the noise coming from the various

the first nations land bill and adding if necessary Bill C-56,

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>REQUEST FOR TABLING OF DOCUMENTS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  During question period the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence was reading 
from two documents when he was answering questions from the 
opposition.  I would seek to have those documents tabled in the 
House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know that one of the documents 
from which the hon. member was reading was the cabinet briefing 
note to which parliamentary secretaries and ministers refer to 
and which are not tabled in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was another document from which he was quoting.  It was a 
press release from the leader of the Reform Party.  I will 
endeavour to have that press release tabled forthwith, because I 
know that all members will want to see very clearly the cutbacks 
the Reform Party wanted to inflict upon the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I trust that settles the matter. 
Given the undertaking of the government House leader, I assume 
the point of order has been answered.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, far be it for me to 
determine whether or not that was a briefing note through his 
office.  I seek to have both those documents on the table because 
he was reading directly from both of them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think hon. members know that 
documents of this sort are not normally tabled in the House.  I 
agree that if a member is reading from a document it should be 
tabled.  The government House leader indicated what the 
parliamentary secretary referred to.  I suppose it might be 
helpful if the parliamentary secretary himself clarified the 
position, but we have the word of the minister and I think that 
should end the matter for the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see what document is tabled as a result of the 
undertaking given.  If that is not satisfactory to the hon. 
member for Calgary Northeast, I am sure he will raise the matter 
again and we will hear from him at that time.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MARINE CONSERVATION AREAS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK201">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-48, an 
act to respecting marine conservation areas, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
prior to being interrupted by question period, I was giving 
members of the House examples of irresponsibility on the part of 
the minister in terms of how she travelled around the world and 
around the country in Challenger jets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is hurting for financial support.  Taxes are being raised 
through people who use national parks to make up for the 
government's shortfall.  We just need to ask park employees about 
the cuts in the maintenance schedules, programs and 
infrastructure upgrades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a minister who spends tonnes of money utilizing 
corporate jets that are a lot more expensive than the way most 
members in the House travel.  I have said enough today about the 
minister's travels and would like to move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the Secretary of State for Parks for having spoken to 
many users of the parks system this summer.  He does a good job, 
but the problem is that there is very little linkage between his 
efforts and those of the minister and the bureaucracy.  I applaud 
the secretary of state for doing his best to resolve problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-48, the marine conservation areas act, is 
to establish marine conservation areas and reserves under the 
authority of the Minister of Canadian Heritage, the minister 
chiefly responsible for national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made comment earlier in my debate that the bill had no 
business being under the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  It is 
not about parks.  It is about conservation areas.  In principle 
all Canadians believe that our ecosystems need protection on both 
land and on water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make a number of observations on the bill.  It 
is not properly a parks bill but an environmental bill.  Bill 
C-48 seems to be the Government of Canada's response to the 
convention on biodiversity.  The government signed the convention 
on biodiversity in 1994 in the last parliament when the heritage 
minister was the minister of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I was not a member in the last parliament, the voters 
of Dauphin—Swan River very kindly sent me here in June 1997.  I 
understand the heritage minister did not have an easy time as 
minister of the environment.  I even heard that a minister of the 
government had to resign because of her government's policy on 
the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the minister had trouble getting along with her 
counterparts in provincial governments.  I heard that when the 
heritage minister was the environment minister she got very 
little done.  I am not against a minister getting very little 
done if a minister is trying to do the wrong things.  It is 
better to do nothing than to do the wrong thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know why the Minister of Canadian Heritage is 
pushing a bill on the environment.  Where is the current Minister 
of the Environment?  To paraphrase a great Chinese playwright, 
“a rose by any other name is still a rose” and an environment 
bill by any other name is still an environment bill, not a parks 
bill. 
With this bill the heritage minister expands her domain and 
encroaches on what is more properly the responsibility of the 
minister of environment, her old portfolio.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition believes in balance.  The official 
opposition wants a balance in the management of the environment 
to preserve biodiversity and to conserve the environment for the 
enjoyment of all Canadians balanced with sustainable development. 
The bill has not balanced these priorities in any way, shape or 
form.  Frankly the bill is preservationist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill takes no account of future needs for development of 
resources in a marine environment.  The bill would even require 
fishermen to seek and get special permission to carry on their 
work in areas designated under the bill.  The bill controls not 
only the water but the air above the water and everything below 
the water.  The bill would require special licensing for 
recreational activities and academic research in designated 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the designated areas would no longer be available for 
sustainable resource development and given all the hoops through 
which fishermen, recreational users and academic researchers 
would have to jump, Canadians might assume that before the 
heritage minister designated a marine conservation area the 
minister would have to do so by amendment of the act with debate 
at all stages in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A change in the use of marine territory should be fully reviewed 
by parliament.  However the heritage minister does not want a 
full review by parliament.  The minister has instructed her 
officials to write what is known in legal circles as Henry VIII 
clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Henry VIII seems to have so shaped the minister's approach to 
parliament that she has included three Henry VIII clauses.  I 
will have more to say on that if the bill passes second reading. 
The heritage minister is already well aware of Henry VIII and his 
attitude toward parliament.  I am sure some members of parliament 
will be interested to hear that.  They will not be pleased, 
however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Henry VIII believed in the divine right of kings.  His motto was 
“God and my right”.  Henry VIII did not like parliament since 
it tended to get in the way of what he wanted.  Whether it was 
marrying wife number two, three or four or raising taxes, Henry 
VIII did not want to be bothered with parliament and the House of 
Commons.  He looked for ways to side step parliament and its 
authority to pass laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has learned a lesson well from old Henry Tudor 
about how to side step the proper law making authority of 
parliament.  We wish she would learn some lessons on democracy. 
It is hard to learn anything these days about democratic rights 
in the Liberal Party.  The minister wants to side step the proper 
role of parliament with the insertion of Henry VIII clauses that 
allow the cabinet to amend the act more or less at will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is bad enough that the heritage minister is still trying to 
be the environment minister.  The minister's attitude toward 
parliament is even worse.  What is left?  Too much, far too much. 
Bill C-48 would shrink the federal crown territory available for 
ordinary use or occupation, for resource exploration and for 
extraction for dumping any substance.  The bill requires specific 
authorization by permit for any activity in the areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old joke that goes something like this.  How many 
Canadians does it take to change a light bulb?  The answer is one 
but she has to have a licence.  If there is one thing that makes 
Canadians less competitive and lowers their standard of living it 
is overregulation.  The bill would create yet another layer of 
regulation between Canadian resources and the ability of 
Canadians to do research, to fish, to create tourist recreation 
venues, and to engage in sustainable development of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-48 seems to make clear there is not a regulation the 
minister has seen but does not like.  There is one thing I would 
like to know.  What is the minister telling the steel industry 
situated in her riding on the edge of one of the largest marine 
environments in North America?  What is she telling the 
steelworkers will keep their industry from being shut down?  One 
of her officials or a future heritage minister decided at whim 
that the western end of Lake Ontario should become a marine 
conservation area.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet this is the kind of bill the heritage minister has brought 
to this House.  In fact, they have not scheduled any areas that 
would become effective immediately.  They basically took a big 
swath of all the coastal areas east, west and north and all the 
inland waters as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill fails to balance preservation of biodiversity with the 
principle of sustainable development.  This bill sidestepped the 
proper role and authority of parliament.  Even if there were not 
problems with the bill on those counts, this bill is not properly 
a parks bill, it is an environment bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me repeat very slowly for the heritage minister's benefit 
she is no longer the minister of the environment.  She should 
stop trying to enact environmental legislation and should 
withdraw this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind I would like to propose the following reasoned 
amendment which I believe you will find completely in order. I 
move: 
<A NAME="LINK203">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “That” and substituting the following therefor: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-48, an act 
respecting marine conservation areas, because the bill fails not 
only to strike a proper balance between the preservation of 
`bio-diversity' and sustainable development, but takes no account 
of future sustainable development in designated marine 
conservation areas. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question is on the amendment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to speak to my Reform colleague's amendment to Bill C-48, the 
Marine Conservation Areas Act, at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in the week, I ran the Bloc Quebecois' draft amendment 
by my Reform colleague, who was considering not moving an 
amendment if ours suited him. Obviously, he changed his mind, 
but our goal is basically the same: that the bill not be debated 
at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc would have requested that the objectives of the bill be 
referred to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. 
The Reform Party is taking a different approach by asking that 
the House decline to give second reading to Bill C-48 as it does 
not take into account a number of fundamental elements that the 
Reform Party considers important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, let us take a closer look at this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to provide a legal framework for the 
establishment and eventual development of 28 marine conservation 
areas, including eight in Quebec, representing each of the 
ecosystems identified to date in Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay-St. Lawrence marine park is the 29th marine 
conservation area, but this park is not included in this bill 
because it is covered by ad hoc legislation both in Canada and 
in Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before the House today, Bill C-48, is part of a 
commitment made by the Prime Minister of Canada at the 1996 
convention of the World Conservation Union, held in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the members of this House, I will digress to 
say a few words about this World Conservation Union. It is an 
organization representing 74 governments, 105 government 
agencies and more than 700 NGOs. 
It was founded in France in 1958 and will soon establish its 
first permanent secretariat in Montreal, which is already home 
to a number of international environmental agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At its annual convention in 1996, as was the case in 1994, the 
World Conservation Union passed resolutions asking all coastal 
nations to put marine conservation measures in place quickly. 
For its part, the UN decreed that 1998 was the year of the 
oceans, and so exceptional acts were required in recognition of 
this event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most significant initiatives—some of them should be 
recalled—include, first: the world's fair in Lisbon, Portugal, 
held from September 22 to 30, 1998, the last great international 
exposition of the 20th century.  This celebration coincided with 
the 500th anniversary of the voyage to India of the great 
Portuguese navigator Vasco de Gama and its theme was “The 
Oceans, a heritage for the future”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we must take note of UNESCO's adoption of the ocean 
charter.  This charter was presented to the summit on the seas 
held in St. John's, Newfoundland, in September 1997.  The 
document is not legally binding, but as we see in it at the 
UNESCO web site, it is a statement of principle, a commitment to 
undertake and continue co-operative efforts to preserve the 
oceans and coastal regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, the creation of marine conservation areas meets 
an objective put forward in many international forums and 
documents, such as the World Conservation Strategy, which 
appeared in 1980, the report entitled “Caring for the Earth”, 
which was released in 1991 and drafted by the World Conservation 
Union, the UN program for the environment and the Worldwide Fund 
for Nature, funded in part by the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should therefore be very clear that the Bloc Quebecois 
supports measures to protect the environment.  I would remind 
you that the Bloc Quebecois did not hesitate to support the 
government when it proposed passing mirror legislation to create 
the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park and to establish a legal 
framework to ensure co-management by the two levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Bloc Quebecois knows that the Quebec government is 
launching initiatives aimed at protecting the environment, 
particularly the marine floor. The Quebec government is also 
open to working in co-operation or in partnership with the 
federal government, on any project designed to ensure or promote 
the protection of the environment, as evidenced by the agreement 
signed by the two governments on the third phase of the St. 
Lawrence action plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-48 for the 
following reasons: first, instead of relying on dialogue, as in 
the case of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, the federal 
government wants to create marine conservation areas, regardless 
of the fact that Quebec has jurisdiction over the protection of 
its territory and of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Department of Canadian Heritage is proposing the 
establishment of a new structure, the marine conservation areas, 
that will duplicate the marine protected areas of the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans, and Environment Canada's protected 
offshore areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the federal government, which claims to have met all 
of Quebec's demands, and which states in its Speech from the 
Throne that it is putting an end to overlap and to interference 
in areas of provincial jurisdiction, has now found a way to 
divide itself into three components and to actually overlap 
itself, so as to be absolutely certain to meddle, in one way or 
another, in areas that come under the jurisdiction of Quebec and 
the other provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-48 fails to respect the integrity of the territory of 
Quebec and the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the conditions essential to the establishment of a marine 
conservation area is federal ownership of the land where the 
conservation area will be established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 5(2) of the bill provides that the minister can 
establish a marine conservation area only if he is satisfied 
“that clear title to the lands to be included in the marine 
conservation area is vested in Her Majesty in Right of Canada, 
excluding any such lands situated within the exclusive economic 
zone of Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 92(5) of the Constitution Act, 1867, recognizes that 
the management and sale of crown land are matters of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec legislation on crown lands, passed by the Quebec National 
Assembly, applies to all crown lands in Quebec, including beds 
of waterways and lakes and the bed of the St. Lawrence river, 
estuary and gulf, which belong to Quebec by sovereign right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this legislation provides that Quebec cannot 
transfer its lands to the federal government. 
The only thing it can do within this legislation is to 
authorize, by order, the federal government to use them only in 
connection with matters under federal jurisdiction. However, the 
protection of habitats and fauna is a matter of joint federal 
and provincial jurisdiction, and the Government of Quebec plans 
to establish a framework for the protection of marine areas in 
the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the notes provided us by the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage with regard to Bill C-48, marine conservation areas are 
planned for the St. Lawrence, the St. Lawrence estuary and the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence.  These are three areas in which the ocean 
floor is under Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, co-operative mechanisms already exist to protect ecosystems 
in the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, and in the St. Lawrence 
River under the agreement entitled “St. Lawrence action plan, 
phase III” which was signed by all federal and provincial 
departments concerned, and which provides for an investment of 
$250 million, over a period of five years, in various activities 
relating to the St. Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Department of Canadian Heritage acting with such 
arrogance this time, by claiming to own the marine floor where 
it wants to create marine conservation areas, instead of 
resorting to bilateral agreements with the Quebec government and 
thus avoiding having Canada once again trample Quebec's areas of 
jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment is a jurisdiction shared by the two governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Constitutional Act of 1867, the governments of Canada 
and Quebec share responsibility for the environment. 
Under paragraphs 10, 11, 12 and 13 of section 91, the federal 
government has control over a number of areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 91, the exclusive legislative authority of the 
Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the 
following classes of subjects: navigation and shipping, in 
paragraph 10; quarantine and the establishment and maintenance 
of marine hospitals, in paragraph 11; sea coast and inland 
fisheries, in paragraph 12; and ferries between a province and 
any British or foreign country or between two provinces, in 
paragraph 13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's exclusive powers are also recognized in the British 
North America Act, 1967, under sections 92 and 92A. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 92 provides that, in each province, the legislature may 
exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the 
following classes of subjects: the management and sale of the 
public lands belonging to the province and of the timber and 
wood thereon, in paragraph 5; property and civil rights in the 
province, in paragraph 13; and generally all matters of a merely 
local or private nature in the province, in paragraph 16.

non-renewable natural resources in the province; (b) development, 
conservation and management of non-renewable natural resources 
and forestry resources in the province, including laws in 
relation to the rate of primary production therefrom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, section 2 of the legislation passed by Quebec's 
National Assembly with respect to conservation and development 
of wildlife sets out the role of the province's minister of the 
environment and wildlife, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of the environment and wildlife is responsible for 
the conservation and management of wildlife and its habitat. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Quebec's legislation, the minister also has authority to 
appoint conservation officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to follow the example of the Saguenay-St. Lawrence 
Marine Park Act and by making ownership of the territory an 
essential condition for the creation of marine conservation 
areas, the federal government is behaving, as Robert Bourassa 
used to say, like a centralizing government that wants control 
over everything, regardless of recognized jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-48 creates overlap within the federal administration 
itself. 
Let us look at how ridiculous it gets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the Department of Canadian Heritage, the federal 
government intends to create marine conservation areas.  Through 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, it has already created 
marine protected areas.  Through the Department of the 
Environment, it wants to create marine wildlife reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that a single site could find itself 
protected under more than one category.  The Department of 
Canadian Heritage sets out its reasons for creating marine 
conservation areas in the preamble to the bill. 
Heritage Canada is establishing marine conservation areas to 
protect natural, self-regulating marine ecosystems for the 
maintenance of biological diversity; establish a representative 
system of marine conservation areas; ensure that Canada 
contributes to international efforts for the establishment of a 
worldwide network of representative marine areas; provide 
opportunities for the people of Canada and of the world to 
appreciate Canada's natural and cultural marine heritage; and 
provide opportunities within marine conservation areas for the 
ecologically sustainable use of marine resources for the lasting 
benefit of coastal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Fisheries and Oceans Canada, it proposed the 
establishment of marine protected areas. However, in a 
discussion paper released by Fisheries and Oceans in January 
1997 and entitled “An Approach to the establishment and 
Management of Marine Protected Areas under the Oceans Act”, the 
purpose of marine conservation areas is describes as follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These zones are established to ensure the conservation of: 
commercial and non-commercial fisheries resources and their 
habitats, endangered or threatened species and their habitats, 
unique habitats, productive ecosystems and biodiversity, any 
other marine resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both documents, departmental officials indicate that local 
people will have a significant involvement in the establishment 
of marine protected areas. The Bloc Quebecois wonders how many 
information or organization meetings local people will be 
invited to, serving bureaucracy instead of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following DFO's consultation meetings on marine protection zones 
in Quebec in June 1998, federal officials wrote the following in 
their minutes of these meetings: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still a great deal of confusion among stakeholders 
regarding the various federal programs on protected marine areas 
(marine protection zones, national marine conservation areas, 
wildlife marine preserves, etc.). The departments concerned 
should harmonize their actions and co-operate to create protected 
marine areas. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois shares the view of those who participated in 
those meetings and feels that this is an abuse of democracy that 
will be prejudicial to the public which, incidentally, is not at 
all reassured by the existence of an interdepartmental committee 
made up of officials from these various departments. 
Indeed, we know from experience that having a number of 
departments involved in the same project makes it difficult for 
them to work together and ends up costing taxpayers a lot of 
money.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would have been better advised to have a single 
department oversee the protection of ecosystems and the 
departments concerned conclude a framework agreement delegating 
their responsibilities to the one chosen to be accountable in 
this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, Environment Canada is proposing to establish marine 
conservation zones, that could also be called natural marine 
reserves, expanding the notion of the national wildlife 
sanctuary beyond the territorial sea to the 200 mile limit 
within the exclusive economic zone under the Canada Oceans Act. 
These zones are also subject to the Canadian Wildlife Act, but 
require a different set of regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, let us summarize, because the triple federal overlap 
at the federal level—setting aside its overlap with provincial 
jurisdictions—becomes almost a federal maze where people can get 
lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, under the various laws, the Government of Canada is 
proposing to create marine conservation areas, marine protection 
zones and natural marine reserves.  The same territory could, 
according to Fisheries and Oceans, be zoned in various ways and 
subject to various regulations that could simply confuse users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that remains for me to do is extend to the ordinary citizen 
a most cordial welcome to the real world of Kafka. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is even more confusion really possible?  The answer, 
unfortunately, is yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the bill provides that each federal department retain 
jurisdiction over its own marine conservation areas. 
However, when Heritage Canada deems it appropriate, it may, in 
co-operation with the minister concerned, pass regulations 
regarding a marine conservation area that differ from the 
existing provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, the amendment agreed to between Heritage Canada 
and the minister concerned takes priority over the regulations 
under other legislation:  the Fisheries Act, the Coastal 
Fisheries Protection Act, the Canada Shipping Act, the Arctic 
Waters Pollution Prevention Act, the Navigable Waters Protection 
Act, and the Aeronautics Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this might seen normal in other circumstances, the 
difficulties can only increase when Heritage Canada regulations 
are enforced in marine protected areas, marine wildlife reserves 
and marine conservation areas, each with their own regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preliminary consultation on the bill was a resounding failure, 
but Heritage Canada points to it as proof that it has public 
support to go ahead with the bill.  Here are a few facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1997, Heritage Canada released a consultation 
document entitled “Charting the Course—Towards a Marine 
Conservation Areas Act”.  This document was sent to 3,000 groups 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1998, Heritage Canada boasted about its consultation in 
the document “Towards a Marine Conservation Areas Act.”  It 
wrote, and I quote:  “The discussion paper was circulated to 
over 3000 stakeholders across the country— 
Over 300 sheets and briefs were submitted providing comments and 
suggestions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois requested copies of these 300 sheets, which 
really fill only 73 pages that I have right here. The vast 
majority of these pages are nothing more than the reply coupon 
attached to the discussion paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Privacy Act, the names and addresses of respondents 
cannot be disclosed, and Heritage Canada rightly withheld this 
information. However, of the 62 replies we received from the 
department, only one was in French.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it be unreasonable to conclude that Quebec did not 
participate in the consultations conducted by Heritage Canada? 
After looking into Heritage Canada's consultations on its draft 
bill, the Bloc Quebecois came to the conclusion it was a 
miserable failure and it was really too bad that, with all the 
resources at its disposal, the department did not see fit to 
conduct real consultations, which would have exposed all the 
flaws in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultations conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada in 
Quebec on the establishment of marine protected areas were also 
a miserable failure. 
According to the report on the working sessions on the marine 
protection zones program, prepared by officials of Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada in January 1997, the working document was sent to 
650 organizations in Quebec.  Working sessions were planned in a 
variety of cities in Quebec. A number had to be cancelled 
because of the considerable tension in the fishing industry at 
the moment.  In the opinion of the officials, participation at 
these sessions was low—5% on the average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fishing sector, nothing is resolved.  The Heritage Canada 
bill arrived at the moment Fisheries and Oceans and Human 
Resources Development Canada raised an outcry over their 
streamlining of the fishing industry, which is out of synch with 
the needs and the reality of the industry and the communities 
affected by the moratorium on fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry still does not know the plans of the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans for its future and the number of fishers 
who will remain active.  In addition, the industry claims the 
federal government has badly handled the fishing industry and 
criticizes it for its part in the collapse of the groundfish 
stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So as relations between the coastal communities and the federal 
government are strained with respect to the livelihood of these 
communities, especially in Quebec, where there is a dispute over 
our right to our historical fishing quotas, the Bloc Quebecois 
fails to see how the federal government will be able to convince 
these people to co-operate in the establishment of marine 
conservation zones, marine conservation areas or marine wildlife 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since co-operation with coastal communities is essential to 
protect ecosystems, the Bloc Quebecois urges the government to 
find workable solutions to the economic woes of coastal 
communities, if it really wants to eventually co-operate with 
them to protect the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the Bloc Quebecois' objections to this bill? The 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park is a model. In 1997, the 
governments of Quebec and Canada agreed on an act to create the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. This resulted in the creation 
of Canada's first marine conservation area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main features of that legislation is that the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park is the first marine park to be 
created jointly by the federal and Quebec governments, without 
any transfer of territory. The two governments will continue to 
fulfil their respective responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The park includes only marine areas. It covers 1,138 square 
kilometres. Its boundaries may be changed through an agreement 
between the two governments, provided there is joint public 
consultation in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to promote local involvement, the acts passed by the 
Quebec and federal governments confirm the creation of a 
co-ordinating committee, whose membership is to be determined by 
the federal and provincial ministers. The committee's mandate is 
to recommend to the ministers responsible measures to achieve 
the master plan's objectives. The plan is to be reviewed jointly 
by the two governments, at least once every seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any exploration, utilization or development of resources for 
mining or energy related purposes, including the building of oil 
lines, gas lines or power lines, is prohibited within park 
boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By means of regulations, the governments of Quebec and of Canada 
will be able to determine measures for protecting the park's 
ecosystems and resources and for protecting the public.  More 
specifically, they will be able to define how each category of 
area will be used and for how long such use shall apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This first partnership initiative should have served as a model 
to the federal government for the creation of other marine 
conservation areas.  Rather than demonstrating open-mindedness 
and co-operation, the federal government is still taking an 
arrogant, aggressive, invasive approach that overlaps other 
jurisdictions and that is hardly calculated to encourage us to 
work with them another time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Phase III of the St. Lawrence action plan could have served as 
another model.  Let us look at what actually happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 8, 1998, the environment ministers of Quebec and of 
Canada announced phase III of the St. Lawrence development plan, 
representing a total bill of $230 million to be shared equally 
by both levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the objectives of this action plan is to increase the 
area of protected habitats by 100% from 12,000 hectares to 
120,000 hectares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Phase III follows on the first two phases, in which both 
governments invested over $300 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Government of Canada is not happy when everything is 
running smoothly. 
They prefer to stir up trouble, ill feelings and even discontent 
in the population. They do not understand that Quebeckers have 
had it with their arrogant policies that cost a fortune, and the 
people will let them know unequivocally in a very short time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of abuse of power is the incredible arrogance 
displayed by Heritage Canada in stating in the bill that it will 
have a say in the selection of advisors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 11 provides for the establishment of advisory committees 
for each marine conservation area. Subclause 11(3) reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) The minister shall consult with such ministers or agencies 
of the government of Canada or a province or other persons or 
bodies as the minister considers appropriate with respect to the 
composition of advisory committees. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this government's centralizing view, all these or's do not 
sound very good. The minister made sure she could consult 
whomever she wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of concerns about this bill. Clause 11 provides 
that the federal government will establish the boundaries of the 
marine conservation areas in each region of Canada in 
consultation with the local communities. We know what kind of 
“consultations” they conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 9 states that “The minister shall, within five years 
after a marine conservation area is established, 
in consultation with any...parties that the minister considers 
appropriate”—I repeat, any parties that the minister considers 
appropriate—“prepare a management plan”. This plan is reviewed 
every five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 9(4) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4) Provisions of a management plan respecting fishing, 
aquaculture, fisheries management, marine navigation and marine 
safety are subject to agreement between the minister and the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, I must point out that, in our experience to date, this 
sharing of responsibilities by two ministers has always proved 
catastrophic in this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every two years, the heritage minister will table a report on 
the state of marine conservation areas. The minister establishes 
a management advisory committee for each marine area created. 
Since, as it will be recalled, clause 11 allows her to consult 
whomever she wishes, the department will, once again, be able to 
appoint whomever it wishes to its management committees to suit 
its own purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the prerequisites for creating a marine conservation area 
is ownership of the territory by the federal government. 
According to preliminary information we have obtained, the 
federal government would own the ocean floor in areas 7, 8 and 9 
of the Arctic Ocean and area 1 of the Atlantic Ocean.  The 
Government of Quebec, however, owns the ocean floor in areas 4, 
5, 6 and 7 of the Atlantic Ocean region, that is to say the 
region taking in the St. Lawrence Estuary, the Gaspé and the 
Magdalen Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill gives the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of 
the ministers of Fisheries and Oceans and Canadian Heritage, the 
right to limit or prohibit activities in commercial zones in 
order to protect the resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the relations that now exist between the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans and fishers, there is reason for concern 
about the enforcement of this clause of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also gives the Governor in Council, on the 
recommendation of the ministers of Transport and Canadian 
Heritage, the right to limit or prohibit transportation in 
marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all the pressure to keep airplanes out of certain areas, 
there is also reason to be concerned about relations between the 
Department of Canadian Heritage and the Department of Transport 
with respect to these marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also makes provision for orders-in-council regarding 
public safety, research activities and so on in these 
territories.  All government orders-in-council are suspect in 
principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides that anyone who pollutes these marine 
conservation areas will have to pay clean-up costs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, we cannot, in the limited time at our disposal, 
mention all the concerns we have regarding this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the Bloc Quebecois will have to oppose the 
amendment proposed by the Reform Party, because it does not deal 
with issues we feel are truly important. Our reading of the act, 
in fact, leads us to believe that the reasons mentioned by the 
Reform Party are not acceptable. In fact, I was even surprised 
that the amendment was deemed in order, because it is not 
consistent with the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also oppose the bill, primarily because it is an 
intrusion into the jurisdictions of Quebec, and of the other 
provinces, when they are concerned. Quebec cannot function in 
that system. 
We were very open with the federal government when we dealt with 
managing the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, and we regret 
that the government did not act in a similar fashion this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way, we are pleased about that, because it gives us yet 
another reason to want to leave this intrusive country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Cree.</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will be dividing my time with my colleague, the 
member for Halifax West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Cree.</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today on behalf of the riding of Churchill River in 
Saskatchewan, and the New Democratic caucus, on Bill C-48, an act 
respecting marine conservation areas.  The bill provides 
legislation to establish and manage a system of national marine 
conservation areas representative of the 29 marine areas in 
Canada. The 29 conservation areas represent unique biological and 
oceanographic features.  These areas include fresh and salt 
waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Parks Canada systems approach has identified 29 areas within 
Canada's Great Lakes, internal waters which are tidal, and the 
territorial sea and also the exclusive economic zone known as the 
EEZ 200 mile limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process to establish the conservation areas began in 1986 
with ministerial approval to establish national marine parks. 
This decision led to a 1987 agreement with Ontario to establish 
Fathom Five in Georgian Bay; a 1988 agreement with British 
Columbia for a marine park at South Moresby in the Queen 
Charlotte Islands, the Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation 
Area.  An agreement with Quebec to examine the feasibility of a 
federal-provincial marine park at the confluence of the Saguenay 
fiord and the St. Lawrence Seaway, the Saguenay-St. Lawrence 
Marine Park, became Bill C-7.  The New Democratic Party supported 
this bill which established the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine 
Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The years of consultation between governments and communities 
were successful.  Consultation is a major part of creating 
conservation areas in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Sackville—Eastern Shore noted, a hallmark 
of intergovernmental co-operation took place when Bill C-7 was 
under way. The Government of Quebec and the federal government 
both looked at their unique responsibilities and jurisdictions in 
dealing with the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park and came up 
with the unique opportunity to have a consultation that looked at 
the tourism aspect, the economic aspect and the environmental 
aspect of the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 was an important step toward fulfilling a commitment to 
future generations.  Today we mark the next step in the marine 
ecosystem protection, Bill C-48.  This bill will set the template 
for marine conservation areas for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several key points that the New Democratic Party has raised 
throughout the parks and environment debates and the legislation 
are contained in Bill C-48.  There are two main parts we can 
focus on. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT71"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT71"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The precautionary principle and ecosystem protection are 
specifically defined in this bill.  This is an improvement over 
previous legislation introduced by the Liberal government, bills 
which affect all Canadians in all regions of this great country 
where an ecosystem approach, the precautionary principle and 
ecological integrity were barely mentioned, if even described at 
all.  It is nice to see that the precautionary principle and 
ecosystem protection are major components of this bill. This 
shows progress which we must acknowledge as parliamentarians.  We 
must ensure the goals of sustainability, conservation and 
preservation of Canada's vital marine areas are achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Bill C-7 the New Democratic Party raised the issue of 
monitoring in the Saguenay-St. Lawrence, monitoring where 
necessary the pollution impacts of critical areas and the flow of 
the rivers.  We must be willing to monitor the pollution impacts 
of industries further upstream on the Saguenay and further 
upstream on the St. Lawrence.  Pollution will impact this 
conservation area.  The monitoring aspect must not be taken 
lightly.  These noble conservation objectives can be met but they 
must be monitored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adequate resources must be defined and committed to pollution 
monitoring.  The Liberal government's repeated statement to 
Canadians that the high standards of environmental protection are 
being met is not true.  There is continued devolution and 
abdication of environmental responsibilities.  This government 
can sign a piece of paper and have a photo opportunity for the 
news. Then the government has a program review and always cuts 
the budget and at the same time says that things are going great. 
This cannot continue with Bill C-48. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adequate resources for feasibility studies must be defined and 
allocated to the marine sciences, to community consultation and 
to education and interpretive programs.  All these issues require 
adequate resources.  Will this government commit to additional 
resources?  Will this government commit to action on Bill C-48, 
or will it sign this bill, establish one or two conservation 
areas and rely on skimpy laurels and continue to mislead 
Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our communities need a future based on sustainable development. 
Communities depend on our marine environment for income, for food 
sustenance and as a source of our biological diversity.  This is 
for our physical and spiritual well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-48 provides the opportunity to reverse the outrageous 
decimation and degradation that mismanagement has created. 
Unsustainable practices destroy Canadian communities; they do not 
build and strengthen them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party calls on the Liberal government to 
prove that this bill is not simply paper in the next budget. 
Proof of the Liberal government's commitment to marine 
conservation and preservation and sustainable practices does not 
mean continued cuts to a once proud Canadian Coast Guard.  It 
does not mean continued cuts to the pollution prevention 
capabilities of the environment department. These budget cuts 
have been cloaked in the auspices of program review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commitment is not the continuance of understaffed, overworked 
and rarely appreciated departments with the major 
responsibilities of the atmosphere and ocean sciences. Commitment 
is not continually ignoring advice that is based on scientific 
evidence or the precautionary principles in favour of a political 
agenda.  The DFO is a fine example of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The marine conservation areas will be a key component of the 
proposed representative system of marine protected areas.  Three 
departments have been identified as working on the marine 
protected areas, the departments of fisheries, environment and 
Canadian heritage.  This system could be in place along all of 
Canada's coasts and the Great Lakes by the year 2010. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope this bill is not another noble opportunity lost by lack 
of leadership and commitment.  Lost but not forgotten, such as 
another Liberal promise to complete our national parks system 
with 39 representative terrestrial zones by the new millennium. 
This is far from being complete.  They are big words that create 
big hopes but Canadians are used to dashed hopes with this 
Liberal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the committee of the New Democratic Party we will raise 
a number of concerns that will improve Bill C-48.  Some concerns 
are minimum protection standards to include prohibition of fin 
fish aquaculture and bottom trawling, ballast water dumping and 
recreational artificial reefs, better controls for outfalls of 
waste discharge and pollution prevention, and complete 
consultation with communities, provincial jurisdictions and 
aboriginal territories and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must define and identify the issue of no take zones within 
marine boundaries, critical zone 1 areas to be expanded to reduce 
impacts through calving, spawning and nursing periods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of DFO and parks is a major concern.  Both are going 
to be participating in conservation areas but one of the worst 
histories and a major area of concern is the history of DFO in 
terms of mismanagement regarding resources.  The NDP will be 
raising these and other concerns forwarded by Canadians through 
the committee process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key question we will also ask is why there was the exclusion 
of other great inland Canadian waters such as Great Bear lake, 
Great Slave lake, Lake Athabasca and Lake Winnipeg.  These are 
unique waters and require protection and conservation measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak on the additional challenges Reform Party

minister announced that the race rocks in Gabriola passage were 
on the way to becoming Canada's first marine protected area. All 
this was well and good for the federal government to identify but 
Chief James Johnny of the Nanaimo First Nations said there was no 
consultation through the band which has aboriginal title to the 
Gabriola passage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak about consultation, I believe that is what the

a full consultation process with provincial governments, with

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very important feature for those of us living in the 
Atlantic provinces.  We realize it is important to have a 
sustainable environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are important principles embodied in this bill.  The 
preamble talks about establishing a representative system of 
marine conservation areas that are of sufficient extent and such 
configuration as to maintain healthy marine ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Halifax where I grew up we have a beautiful harbour.  It is a 
harbour that is sheltered and does not freeze during the winter. 
It is ideally situated for shipping and transporting goods and 
yet this beautiful piece of nature is being polluted daily by 
many runoffs of raw sewage and effluent being dumped directly 
into it. This has gone on for years and years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to imagine in this day and age that we would allow 
such a thing to continue.  There have been studies on the shelf 
and off the shelf, back and forth, about how to clean up the 
harbour and yet today we still remain with that very serious 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we look at marine conservation. Anything 
that can be done to improve those situations is certainly going 
to be welcome in the Atlantic provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble further talks about ensuring that Canada 
contributes to international efforts for the establishment of a 
worldwide network of representative marine protected areas.  It 
emphasizes the globalized nature of our society today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that what happens in one part of the world certainly 
affects what happens in another part of the world.  We have to be 
able to share our environment and to look after our environment 
in a way that will benefit all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It talks about considering implications for ecosystems in the 
planning and management of marine conservation areas to provide 
opportunities for the people of Canada and of the world to 
appreciate and enjoy Canada's natural and cultural marine 
heritage, and provide opportunities, and this is important, 
within marine conservation areas for the ecologically sustainable 
use of marine resources for the lasting benefit of coastal 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Atlantic Canada we are a people who live by the sea so I rise 
on behalf of Atlantic Canadians because we know full well from 
past experiences what can happen from resource exploitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know about the overfishing off the Atlantic coast.  We know 
how the large trawlers have been allowed to come in and deplete 
the fishing stocks.  We know about the mismanagement of the 
fisheries.  We see lost stocks and we see the impact on the 
communities in these areas, people who have come to rely on 
subsidy programs and so forth, people who are unable to find new 
occupations because their livelihood has been destroyed and yet 
they know of no other than fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know full well that the environment must be managed in a 
sensible way.  The marine conservation areas provide 
opportunities for Atlantic Canadians through preservation and 
conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill is implemented properly with some of the 
improvements that have been mentioned by my hon. colleague, we 
know that such things as ecotourism and research will provide 
opportunities for Atlantic Canadians.  There will be 
opportunities in the field of marine biology and the ocean 
sciences and so forth.  We would welcome those opportunities in 
Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic Ocean has 10 identified marine conservation area 
natural regions.  These are Hudson Strait, Labrador shelf, 
Newfoundland shelf, the north gulf shelf, St. Lawrence estuary, 
Magdelan shallows, Laurentian channel, the Grand Banks, Scotian 
shelf and the Bay of Fundy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague has already mentioned the experience of the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, Bill C-7, which the NDP 
supported last fall.  This was indeed a wonderful example of the 
possibilities of co-operation between governments and community 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure my colleagues that the NDP will be encouraging 
community participation on this bill because it is very important 
that we have true consultation, not just a quick hello, how do 
you do with the communities involved but true consultation to 
receive the input from the communities that will be affected by 
this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sea is very important for people in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can recall as a young lad going to the sea with my parents and 
grandparents and digging clams along the seashore, fishing off 
wharfs, that type of activity. We did not worry about whether 
fish were contaminated, if we could eat the fish we caught or 
whether to be concerned about the clams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But nowadays the first thing we think about if we go fishing is 
whether the area is polluted.  It is a shame that our society has 
come to that stage. Certainly we want to encourage marine 
conservation and do everything possible to present a pristine 
environment for people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk a bit about some of the successes that have taken 
place around this issue.  We have the Bonavista and Notre Dame 
Bay project which requires the participation of 32 diverse and 
proud communities with a wealth of experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the memorandum of understanding signed between the 
federal and provincial governments there was a number of 
feasibility studies done and there was initially some skepticism 
around this.  But eventually this was followed by acceptance and 
hope.  There has been a lot of local input and ideas that are now 
being listened to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a remarkable about face on fisheries and ocean matters in 
Newfoundland, a region that has been decimated by government 
interference and bungling. Indeed the entire Atlantic region has 
been interfered with and bungled in terms of the fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see why this initial skepticism in that area was 
warranted but now we see that things are starting to turn around 
as a result of consultation and community input.  Local fishers 
in the community came up with an idea related to local lobster. 
They started the East Port Lobster Conservation Authority and 
designated some of the best lobster areas within the bay as no 
take zones. These types of measures are being taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see this type of community co-operation and this community 
based program works. Catches are up by 97% through proper 
resource management.  It is a combination of conservation and 
common sense based on science. These successes can be carried 
forward through the legislation that is being looked at here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this progress is being made in Newfoundland we have to ask 
ourselves what is stopping this government from proceeding with 
consultation and identification of specific conservation areas 
for the remaining natural marine regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comments that have been received by the New Democratic Party on 
Bill C-48 carry a common theme, conservation and preservation and 
good stewardship of our marine areas.  This is a necessity.  It 
is a requirement for our future generations of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As noted by my hon. colleague, this process began 10 years ago 
but much more needs to be done as we enter the next century.  We 
would trust that this legislation will be carefully examined at 
committee stage.  We trust there will be appropriate improvements 
made and that hopefully at that stage there will be more 
community input, more opportunity for aboriginal people who may 
be affected by these areas, to have their say around what is 
happening as well as others who are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working together we can come up with something that is going to 
make our environment something we will be proud of, something we 
will be pleased to leave to succeeding generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on my colleagues to look at this bill, seriously examine 
it, give input to improvements and do not, once it is passed, 
allow the government to delay when royal assent is given.  Move 
quickly.  Atlantic Canadians deserve our best efforts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
to the advice of my colleagues and I examined the bill.  I will 
speak on two points of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is not a lot of collaboration in this Bill C-48. 
Worse yet, and I would like my colleague's opinion on this, one 
of the prerequisites to the government's establishing a marine 
conservation area is its ownership of the land where the 
conservation area will be established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague was talking earlier about a coastal region and 
about the regions near the major Atlantic ports.  There is 
another interesting clause in this bill, which gives the 
governor in council as well, on the recommendation of the 
transport and heritage ministers, the right to limit or prohibit 
transport activities in marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether he looked at that in detail, but near the 
ports—even if he and I both would like to see all of us live in 
a healthy environment—there may be a problem that needs to be 
considered and resolved.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Madam Speaker, I agree with my hon. 
colleague from the Bloc Quebecois that there are some problems 
with the bill.  At the outset I said we approved the bill in 
principle and went on to explain the kinds of things we want to 
see for the Atlantic region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly there are some obstacles that have to be overcome. The 
hon. member has identified some of them as has my hon. colleague. 
We hope that these can be worked through at the committee stage 
to the point where we are satisfied that what moves forward will 
be in the best interest of all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have to admit I stepped in a bit late and only heard the end of 
the statement made by the hon. member for Halifax West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just for the record I would like the hon. member to tell me if I 
heard correctly that he was actually making a statement in 
support of conservation measures taken in the Newfoundland 
lobster fishery and that they could be applied perhaps in Nova 
Scotia.  I would like some clarification of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically I would like to know if he is supportive of the 
recent conservation measures that have occurred in district 33 
and of which he would hopefully be aware.  If he is supportive of 
those measures I would like to know why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member has asked a 
number of questions and I do not know if I will be able to 
address all of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I was making when I spoke about the Newfoundland 
experience was co-operation.  I was talking about the 
consultation process and the process of people working together 
to try to find a solution.  I was indicating that it must be a 
central part of the bill if we are to move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not particularly endorsing the specifics of any kind of 
agreement, but I was talking about the co-operation principle as 
being necessary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

the member for Halifax West for his comments, as well as his 
colleague from Saskatchewan, for their constructive approach to 
this bill, which is an important one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like them, I am eager for this bill to be referred to the 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage so we can hear 
testimony, continue consultation, examine our colleagues' 
suggestions and improve the bill if necessary.  If improvements 
are needed, we will try to acknowledge this and to make the 
required changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope he will convince our colleagues in the other opposition 
parties to refer the bill to committee so we may begin to 
examine it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Madam Speaker, with regard to 
influencing members of other parties, I firmly believe that each 
individual must decide for himself or herself as to which 
direction they go and how they see it in representing their 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly put forward any suggestions we receive from 
our constituents that might help to improve the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for me to rise in the House to address Bill C-48, an 
act respecting marine conservation areas.  I speak to the bill on 
behalf of the member for West Nova who like myself represents 
many of the coastal communities in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed piece of legislation is designed to protect and 
conserve representative areas of Canada's marine landscape for 
the benefit, education and enjoyment of all Canadians and the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party has always maintained a keen 
interest in helping protect the environment for future 
generations.  Having been born and raised in Nova Scotia, I 
quickly came to appreciate the importance of our natural 
environment and the importance that this environment plays in our 
everyday lives.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my constituents depend upon the ocean or natural 
resources for their livelihood.  Many of our early settlers were 
attracted to this great land by the abundance of fish.  Our 
aboriginal peoples fished these waters long before the arrival of 
any European settler. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia promotes itself as being the ocean playground of 
Canada.  Deriving one's living from the ocean is a cultural way 
of life for many of us.  We depend upon the preservation of this 
large habitat, not only for our survival but for the survival of 
the next generation.  It is incumbent upon us all that we begin 
taking immediate steps toward protecting this ecosystem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to look very far to see the devastation that can 
be caused when we take our natural resources for granted.  The 
maritime provinces, in particular Newfoundland, have been 
decimated by the serious downturn in the fishery.  Tens of 
thousands of fishers have been forced out of this industry 
because of government mismanagement.  Cod stocks have been 
destroyed.  There can be no telling how long or if they will ever 
rebound to previously sustainable levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our marine environment is always under constant use from local 
fishers and under constant threat particularly from foreign 
fishing.  Our efforts to protect our marine ecosystem will prove 
fruitless unless we stop foreign overfishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently our coastal regions have been faced by another menacing 
attack.  This time it comes from illegal lobster fishers who have 
been pillaging the ocean floor almost unabated by Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans officials.  In Nova Scotia, specifically in 
St. Mary's Bay, this lucrative lobster fishery could be in danger 
if strong measures are not immediately taken to put an end to 
this illegal activity.  The federal Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans has an obligation to everyone in Nova Scotia to enforce 
its regulations on behalf of conservation and on behalf of the 
families which this fishery supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party has long been concerned with 
preserving our ecosystem.  In 1986 the PC government approved the 
national marine parks policy.  In 1987 the country's first 
national marine conservation area known as Fathom Five in 
Georgian Bay was established.  Unfortunately it has yet to be 
proclaimed.  There are still outstanding issues to be addressed 
in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 the government signed a federal-provincial agreement 
with the province of British Columbia to create a national marine 
conservation area in the Queen Charlotte Islands.  On April 6, 
1990 the Progressive Conservative government signed an historical 
and unique agreement between Canada and Quebec to create a marine 
park at the confluence of the Saguenay estuary and the St. 
Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1996 the government introduced Bill C-78, an act to 
establish the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park and to make a 
consequential amendment to another act.  Finally the agreement 
and the legislation were given royal assent, culminating with the 
proclamation of the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park on June 8 
of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gave that little history lesson to try to explain to the House 
how long legislation takes and how important it is to begin it 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will provide the legislation needed to establish and 
manage a system of marine conservation areas representative of 
the 29 marine areas in Canada, reflecting the relevant Parks 
Canada guiding principles and operating policies for them.  The 
29 distinct conservation areas identified by the legislation 
represent four broad and very distinct areas of Canada's marine 
ecosystem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 10 specific areas associated with the Atlantic Ocean 
including the Bay of Fundy, Scotia shelf and Labrador shelf.  The 
Arctic Ocean consists of nine specific regions including Hudson 
Bay, Beaufort Sea and Baffin Island shelf.  The Pacific Ocean 
includes such areas as the Vancouver Island shelf and the Strait 
of Georgia.  Finally we have Canada's Great Lakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that although the proposed legislation 
is designed to establish and manage a system of marine 
conservation areas representative of the 29 marine areas, it does 
not specifically identify a precise geographic location to be 
protected.  These sites will have to be chosen through much 
consultation with members of the general public, provincial 
governments and obviously those individuals who earn their 
livelihood from these distinct waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stress the point strong enough that much consultation 
must be undertaken before any particular area is singled out for 
protection.  There must be a balanced approach taken when 
exploring any area.  The interest of our fishing community must 
be protected before any agreements on locations are finalized. 
Conservation is vitally important to all of us but particularly 
to those who make their living on the water.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot simply target a location without exploring the long 
term effect it will have on the fishing industry.  Our fishers 
must have a direct say in the management of their industry.  We 
have already witnessed the disaster than can occur when they are 
excluded from the decision making process.  It is also important 
that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans be involved within 
the consultation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I briefly mentioned our aboriginal people's dependence 
on these waters for their food fishery.  It is important that the 
aboriginal peoples be involved in the negotiations.  With many 
land claims still to be resolved, it is imperative that they be 
consulted on creating any new marine reserve areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill there are restrictions on non-renewable resource 
extraction.  I believe careful examination of any proposed site 
must be explored as to its potential for oil and gas exploration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia is finally going to receive the economic benefits of 
the Sable oil exploration.  This economic boom for our province 
would not have been possible if the Sable area had been 
previously designated as a marine protected area.  That is a 
thought that all of us in the House should carry with us.  That 
is why I propose that as much consultation as possible is 
undertaken with all those who have a vested interest in our ocean 
floors in terms of both renewable and non-renewable resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged by the fact that the department circulated 
discussion papers to over 3,000 stakeholders across the country, 
including fishing and shipping associations and unions; the oil, 
gas and mining sectors; aboriginal and environmental groups; and 
the academic community.  This represents a very strong beginning 
in the consultation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the government had set a goal for itself of 
establishing 10 marine parks by the year 2000.  The clock is 
ticking, but as we approach the new millennium we cannot afford 
not to carefully examine this undertaking.  If it takes longer 
than the year 2000 then so be it.  If we put the legislation in 
place and we actually go out there and establish some marine 
protected areas, let us do it so we do not have to revisit it 
again, renew it or change it in 10 years time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we actually make a national park of a marine protected area 
it may be very difficult to get out of it.  I do not feel there 
should be a deadline in this regard.  It is something we should 
move slowly and carefully but distinctly toward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to send the bill to committee.  Our party 
intends to support it.  I am sure the committee will want to hear 
experts from every sector involved in the process.  Hopefully at 
the end of the day we can put the bill before the House, have it 
voted on, approved, and have a better country because of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He seems to stand up for the fisheries in his region, but there 
is so much duplication in Bill C-48 between Heritage Canada's 
marine conservation areas, Fisheries and Oceans' marine 
protected areas and Environment Canada's marine and wildlife 
reserves that one can wonder who will have the largest 
jurisdiction and be able to protect fisheries the best.

whether or not it should be the responsibility of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage.  Because it is a heritage bill I see no other 
way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly our member for West Nova has been very closely

two very important points of reference in our participation and 
role in the global community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sooner this bill can be moved ahead the better because it 
will take time to implement.  Today we are discussing legislation 
which is enabling, but that is all it does.  It sets the 
foundation for the creation of the marine protected areas.  That 
is the extent of the measure.  It is the first step on the road 
toward a very distant goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also I would like to make a note of caution at this point in 
connection with the ecological integrity of existing parks, such 
as the case of the Pukaskwa National Park where some threats are 
being noticed near the proposed marine park in the form of 
forestry companies which are now asking the Government of Ontario 
for permission to log closer and closer to the park boundaries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the buffer areas around the national parks are 
in need of being firmly protected.  There is, as we all know, a 
strong connection between our land-based parks and our marine 
parks.  Therefore it is incumbent upon us to protect them both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that an agreement signed by Ottawa and 
the Government of British Columbia in July 1995 provides for the 
initiation of marine conservation area feasibility studies for 
two places:  the Strait of Georgia and the Queen Charlotte Sound 
marine regions.  One can see from this how long it takes, even 
when there is joint co-operation between two levels of 
government.  Marine parks cannot be established overnight.  This 
is an undertaking that is time consuming and complex.  Marine 
parks cannot be established by the federal government acting 
alone, as we all know.  It requires the co-operation of 
provincial governments and very much the support of local 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are engaged in an undertaking which is probably the envy of 
the whole world.  We are moving forward toward the establishment 
of a Canadian system in the field of marine conservation areas. 
The momentum is there, but we still have to add more pressure to 
see real movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next step and perhaps the most difficult one is developing 
the management plans which will take into account the need for 
protecting biological diversity, plant and animal, and the need 
for ensuring that marine national parks are immune from the 
encroachment of various industrial pursuits and activities.  In 
this way we can ensure that marine conservation areas become 
effective in achieving the goals of establishing themselves and, 
of course, at the same time preventing pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will note that the preamble of Bill C-48 recognizes the 
role of the marine ecosystem in maintaining biological diversity. 
That is the beauty of such a bill.  However, I noticed that the 
idea of pollution prevention does not appear in the preamble of 
the bill.  Perhaps that is something that can be done at the 
committee level.  I will have some other observations to make to 
this effect later on by way of amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can ask ourselves at this point whether the establishment of 
the protected areas proposed in this bill will create small ocean 
sanctuaries while the rest of the sea and ocean environment 
rapidly deteriorate, or whether we will have a critical mass, the 
beginning of marine conservation areas which will set models for 
the larger sea and ocean surrounding them.  This is something I 
would like to deal with at the end, with future generations in 
mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few minutes ago the hon. member for Churchill River spoke 
about the uses of our oceans in a manner consistent with 
sustainable development.  He is right in doing so.  He also spoke 
about pollution prevention.  These are themes that I would 
commend to the parliamentary secretary in the hope that these 
themes will guide him and his colleagues in committee when it 
comes to the examination of this bill clause by clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble provides a guide for the operation of the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a definition of the precautionary principle, however, 
that is in need of examination because it makes reference to cost 
effectiveness as being a measure to prevent environmental 
degradation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion I would make at second reading is that it would 
be desirable to remove the words cost effective because they can 
be potentially very damaging.  It will not be possible to 
establish parks in conservation areas if we are guided only by 
cost effectiveness principles.  There are many other values that 
come into play when proceeding with the purpose and the intent of 
Bill C-48. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the bill more closely, it seems to me that in the 
preamble the reference to cost effectiveness ought to be revised 
by perhaps just leaving the word “effective”.  It is less 
limiting in scope and it still has value.  It has merit.  But the 
term “cost” is certainly one that will hamper future 
generations of administrators and political decision makers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In examining the bill further, in subclause 4 of clause 9, I 
find that the minister will have to make agreements with the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans when establishing a management 
plan.  This could have some negative effects because the goals of 
the minister in charge of Canadian heritage may differ from the 
goals of the minister in charge of fisheries and oceans.  This 
limitation in the powers of the minister of heritage will not be 
very helpful and ought to be removed if we are to allow for a 
speedy process in the establishment of the conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving on to prohibitions, on page 7 of the bill, it is a bit 
disturbing to read clauses 12, 13, 14 and 15.  It seems to me 
that a bill establishing conservation areas ought not to envisage 
the disposition of dumping.  Dumping should not be allowed in 
marine conservation areas.  It is as basic as that.  Dumping 
ought to take place in a safe manner on the land and subclause 
14(1) ought to be deleted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice also in clause 13 that, while it is desirable that no 
person shall explore or exploit hydrocarbons, minerals, 
aggregates and other organic matters, there is no reference to 
fishing.  Therefore, the question arises:  Is fishing allowed in 
marine conservation areas?  If so, under what restrictions, under 
what limitations and under which criteria?  Obviously fishing in 
an unlimited fashion could not be allowed in a conservation area. 
Therefore, clause 13 needs to be clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 14 has some positive features to it, namely that the 
concurrence of the minister is required before issuing a permit 
under section 71 of CEPA, provided that the role of the minister 
will be as stringent and as disciplined as the role performed by 
the minister in charge of CEPA itself.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we come to clause 15, permits and authorizations, it seems 
to me that the superintendent is given too wide powers. The 
powers given to the superintendent ought to be restricted. The 
issuing of permits should be examined very closely before the 
final decision is made at the higher level because this could 
have a serious and negative impact on the quality of the area 
that is to be conserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the regulations, clause 16(1)(a) is a very good one 
because it is the first and is very strong for the protection of 
ecosystems and the elements of ecosystems.  Clause 16(1)(j) is 
for the control of the flight of aircraft and so on to prevent 
disturbances of wildlife et cetera.  We all know the reasons and 
it is good to find it spelled out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to clause 16(1)(l), authorizing the dumping of 
substances and so on, I would say with all due respect that the 
minister would be well advised in removing this subclause from 
the regulations. We cannot have a conservation area in which we 
dump substances.  It is almost a contradiction in terms. We have 
to be very careful. We all know that there is waste and that 
human waste must be handled, be it industrial, commercial and 
otherwise, but there must be ways of doing it on the land in a 
very well controlled fashion so as to facilitate and enhance the 
quality of the conservation area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In clause 16(4) there is a provision for air navigation that can 
only be made on the recommendation of the minister and the 
Minister of Transport.  Here again it should be a decision by the 
minister alone because of the nature and the purpose of the bill. 
There has to be some degree of autonomy if we are to pursue this 
goal seriously and effectively. The Minister of Transport may 
have very important considerations but sometimes they will have 
to be modified by the will and intent of the minister himself or 
herself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 17 on page 10 indicates that the governor in council may 
exempt from any provision of the regulations a movement of a ship 
or aircraft. Why is that necessary?  Surely a conservation area 
where we want to protect the marine quality ought to be also 
protected from the movement of ship or aircraft. These are not 
immense areas that cannot be bypassed or circumvented.  Surely 
there are alternative navigational routes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again I am appealing to the parliamentary secretary to add 
some words such as “under exceptional circumstances” to clause 
17(a) or (b), to stress the fact that only under specific 
conditions the movement of ships and aircraft ought to be 
allowed.  In other words, it would indicate that the legislators 
are giving a strong signal to the administrators that only under 
special conditions the movement of ships and aircraft is going to 
be tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice clause 29 deals with litigation of environmental 
damage.  It reads something along the lines that any person who 
has management or control of the substance or who causes or 
contributes to the discharge or deposit, in other words, that 
could injure animals, fish or plants in the area, shall take 
reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate such degradation or 
injury.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems an element of urgency is missing in this clause.  The 
word immediate ought to be inserted.  I do not know how the 
courts would interpret the word reasonable in this context, 
whether it would mean mild measures or strong measures.  Clause 
29(1) deserves to be examined in committee. There may be a way to 
strengthen this clause by inserting the element of immediacy and 
urgency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exception on page 16 under clause 29(4) is also a bit 
troublesome.  It reads that no measures may be directed to be 
taken if action is taken under several other acts. Suppose the 
action taken under several other acts is weaker than what the 
minister would like it to be in order to protect and conserve 
these areas.  In that case the loser will be the minister and the 
conservation areas that are being established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A qualifier should be included in the exception, that if the 
action taken under such acts as the Canada Shipping Act, the 
Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, CEPA and so on are 
equally as strong, then this exception applies.  If not, then a 
specific action ought to be identified so as to properly and 
effectively protect the affected area.  Otherwise by leaving it 
to the Canada Shipping Act, the condition of the protected area 
would be in serious danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope what we are doing here today will be the creation not of 
sanctuaries under siege, namely of isolated beautiful areas, 
while the rest of the marine environment degrades and declines in 
quality.  I hope Bill C-48 will create models for proper 
behaviour in the larger picture of the seas and the oceans.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I enjoyed the member's speech.  He went into a lot of 
detail, which sometimes needs to be brought to bear in these 
debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the legislation surrounding protected marine areas, 
there are three federal departments that can protect marine 
areas, Environment Canada, the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, and this bill will enable Heritage Canada to do the same. 
Can the member give me an impression of why he thinks it is that 
way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Davenport is the chair of the environment 
committee.  He made a lot of detailed comments about this bill 
which falls under the heritage department.  My colleague from 
Dauphin—Swan River and I were saying that this is really an 
environment bill and not a parks bill.  I am adding to that same 
question by making that statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about his concern about navigation and the 
question of navigational alternatives.  That is a very 
interesting question for me and the area I represent.  Let us 
think about traffic control and some of the big ships that now 
utilize the inside passage on the west coast from Vancouver up to 
Alaska. 
There is a lot of cruise ship traffic, freight traffic and marine 
traffic of every size and shape.  To control all of that there 
are vessel traffic control centres which are similar to the air 
traffic control centres.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is twofold.  The reality is that we are operating in 
two dimensions only when we are operating on the water.  In the 
air we have three dimensions so things can be a lot more limiting 
and in many respects a lot scarier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another factor has come into being lately. Federal funding for 
the coast guard, federal fisheries and other areas that affect 
all of the marine oriented activities has been chopped to the 
point where we were not navigating for our freight traffic, our 
cruise ships or our large ships for a period of 12 hours just 
about a month ago.  This was very scary indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we cannot do that for everything from cruise ships to oil 
tankers to major log transports and so on, how in heck are we 
going to enforce a new arrangement where we are trying to deal 
with navigation in a specifically declared conservation area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Madam Speaker, I congratulate the 
member for Vancouver Island North for being so effective in 
compressing so many policy statements into one question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one, if I understand it correctly, can perhaps be 
easily answered by saying that there is from time to time a 
reorganization of government structures and it is conceivable 
that one day the Department of Canadian Heritage and the 
Department of the Environment will be merged into one.  It may 
well be that one day the Department of Fisheries and Oceans will 
incorporate certain activities or this particular one and become 
the promoter of conservation areas.  We do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, the member is quite right in pointing to 
this tri-dimensional responsibility.  In a way it seems to me 
quite positive that we should see a conservation area as part of 
our heritage.  Let us see whether it works this way.  Hopefully 
it will, but if it does not, we will have to find a better 
administrative arrangement.  It is only through trial and error 
that this can be established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On his second question, I am glad to learn that the hon. member 
of the Reform Party regrets the cuts in federal funding.  I 
thought that his party was passionately behind the idea of cuts 
in government expenditures.  I am not. Perhaps he and I should 
have lunch more frequently and go over the kinds of cuts we do 
not want to have. Certain damages are being effected.  As to what 
is the public interest and what are the activities that we would 
like to see better protected and better promoted, in that sense, 
he made some very good points. I do not have an easy and quick 
answer to his concern.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would imagine that a partial answer would come from his third 
question, namely that with the lack of funds we ought to rely 
more and more where possible on the education of the public and 
all sectors concerned so we get co-operation through the means of 
a better understanding of the goal that is being pursued with 
this specific type of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This specific type of legislation has some very strong 
provisions for offences and punishment. Under section 24 it is 
not minor and therefore if this section is really enforced some 
of the recommendations of the hon. member may be met and 
satisfied once this legislation becomes operative.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a brief comment 
and a short question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find interesting the notion that, when it came time to pass 
the bill creating the Saguenay-St. Lawrence marine park, few 
members seemed concerned about a three-party administration or 
about any sort of duplication.  I hope members are not using 
scare tactics in order to impede the bill's progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate the member for Davenport on 
his usual fine work, his suggestions, and his very detailed 
recommendations.  It will be not only my duty but also my 
pleasure to forward them to the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage and to the government for consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the parliamentary 
secretary.  I must point out that, with respect to the bill as a 
whole and to his earlier remarks, I am in complete agreement 
with him. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, before I talk about the bill I would like to talk a bit 
about the area I come from.  Almost half the coastline of British 
Columbia would fall into my riding of Vancouver Island North. 
That is half the coastline of Vancouver Island and a good portion 
of the adjacent mainland coastline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the constraints of all that coastline there is a lot of 
activity going on at any given time.  There are certainly a lot 
of aquaculture operations.  There is a lot of fishing activity, 
commercial and recreational.  There is a lot of under sea 
harvesting.  There are a lot of transportation activities.  I 
talked a bit about that during my questioning of the member for 
Davenport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a history of oil and gas exploration. There is as much 
oil and gas identified without major effort on the B.C. coast 
which would exceed the Hibernia area on the east coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have very active waterways.  I mentioned cruise ships. When I 
am at home I very often see six or seven cruise ships go by on 
any given evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to recognize that we have a somewhat 
unique circumstance in British Columbia when it comes to our 
ocean area.  We have established that the Gulf of Georgia, the 
seabed and all that belongs to the province. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That tends to create some new and different wrinkles on things 
because generally in Canadian jurisdictions the oceans are 
federal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great concerns about the politicization of the protection 
of marine areas.  That is one of the reasons I brought up this 
question about why we have three different federal departments 
all involved in one way or another in protecting marine areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many ways to colour the response to that but if people 
really think about it, if they are familiar with the way this 
place operates, it probably has a lot more to do with politics 
than with protecting the marine environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we have three different departments trying to protect 
marine areas is that this is a public relations exercise to 
various degrees for various ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of this bill, we think it is properly an environment 
bill.  It is falling under heritage because we know who the 
minister of heritage is, what she is all about and what she wants 
to promote.  She wants to promote the fact that she is out saving 
marine resources as well as land resources tied in with her parks 
mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment a little about my concerns regarding 
navigation on our waterways because I asked a question about it 
to the previous speaker.  In the response it occurred to me that 
there is a non-understanding on the government side that when it 
comes to monitoring marine traffic we have signed treaties with 
our neighbour the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have signed collective agreements with our employees 
regarding how we are going to monitor marine traffic.  This 
government, this administration chose to break those collective 
agreements and chose to break the terms of that treaty because it 
has mismanaged the funding for the coast guard and the department 
of fisheries for this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to making cuts, the government will make the cuts 
at the place where service delivery is hurt.  It will not make it 
at the place where the comfortable bureaucrat is continued to be 
sheltered, protected and coddled.  It certainly will not make it 
in the minister's office. The spin doctors are all still viably 
employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was one other response I elicited to my question regarding 
why we cannot have all this legislation fall under one mandate. 
Why do there have to be three mandates?  What is the difference 
between these protected areas?  What will the rationale be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we got was “We don't know that.  Maybe they will not all be 
under one mandate.  At some point maybe they will all be under 
the same department”.  Those are all fuzzy, feel good 
statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do know what the current situation is.  We know what today's 
situation is.  This is today's legislation.  Surely to goodness 
we can design legislation that maximizes the current structure of 
government in terms of getting results.  That is all I am 
requesting.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is useful when discussing this bill to think about how this 
came about.  I realize it goes back to the early 1990s, but in 
October 1996 the Prime Minister gave a speech to the World 
Conservation Congress.  He announced the federal government's 
intent to introduce new legislation to establish and administer a 
network of marine conservation areas in the Great Lakes and in 
the Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where did this great initiative start?  Did it start from local 
concerns, ideas expressed and generated by the grassroots, by the 
communities or by the provinces?  No, it started from the need of 
the Prime Minister to polish his international stature at an 
international conference two years ago.  Is that not typical? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Afterward we heard the national parks directorate saying it 
wanted to consult with interested groups and individuals as the 
first step toward developing the legislation. Should the first 
steps not arise from a problem or a perceived need that is 
expressed by those who have a problem?  Must we always have 
legislation imposed on us from above? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of these consultations.  When the 
legislation package came out I sent out a request for comments 
from 22 groups.  All those 22 groups are groups that should have 
been consulted by the government.  These groups found they could 
not comment in a meaningful way on the legislative package 
because they did not know where the marine conservation areas 
were going to be created.  It is that simple. How can any local 
group get its teeth into a piece of legislation that has a vacant 
schedule I and schedule II that are supposed to identify what the 
marine conservation areas are?  It cannot do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there are 29 so-called representative areas in Canada 
with lines arbitrarily drawn on a map.  There would probably be 
at least one marine conservation area established in each of 
these 29 areas.  Where are they within the lines on the map?  How 
big would they be?  No one knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From previous so-called consultation processes we do know that 
the federal government has preconceived ideas about the process 
and about areas it would like to designate that have nothing to 
do with consultation and everything to do with special interest 
groups and squeaky wheels in the maintenance of bureaucracy. 
These are not in keeping with local priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to explain something.  The recreational sector, which 
will be heavily impacted by anything that comes out of this, has 
no effective lobby in many cases.  For example, in my 
constituency fishing is a big thing.  The private sector does not 
include sport fishermen.  This recreational sector is composed 
primarily of individuals anglers.  If the federal bureaucracy 
decides to close a marine area to fishing, this will put a whole 
bunch of local anglers out without no means of effectively 
protesting the government's action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain marine areas are being targeted in northern Vancouver 
Island as sites for marine protection areas because certain 
squeaky wheel groups want to exclude activity from that area. 
However, these special interest groups do not represent the 
general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we invent enabling legislation to create marine conservation 
areas and then we do not create the areas, we get a bureaucracy 
that becomes increasingly uncomfortable because it wants to 
fulfill its minister's agenda for the Prime Minister. So it 
creates as many of these areas as it has to.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect we create a self-perpetuating machine churning out 
regulations that have no business existing in the first place. We 
end up with marine conservation areas that have a very weak 
rationale which flies in the face of common sense and local 
sentiment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be a better way.  We have to make sure local 
government is involved in a meaningful way.  I am aware of how 
local government was involved in the consultations on protected 
areas.  We are talking about a DFO mandate here, not a heritage 
mandate.  They are paid lip service but their concerns are not 
what drives the process.  DFO bureaucracy drives the process in 
that case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the legislation that tells me the 
bureaucracy will be held to account in ensuring that the 
municipal level of government, the one that is in touch with 
local needs, will have any meaningful decision making power. 
Indeed that would be contrary to the philosophy of the government 
and so it is no surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own constituency concerns are primarily about fishing at this 
point.  One thing the legislation does is create a reverse onus, 
the opposite of the current circumstance.  This means that right 
now fishing is always open unless areas are specifically closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-48 will make a marine conservation area a closed area and 
the department or minister will have to take steps to open it for 
fishing.  This is a comfortable place for bureaucrats, but it is 
a terrible place for fishermen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is very good in appearances.  It gives the 
minister the ability to say she has created marine conservation 
areas.  This supports the international speech made by the Prime 
Minister in 1996.  It probably will not cost the federal 
government that much because it is easier to create a water park 
than a land based park.  The real cost of the exercise will be 
the people whose traditional activities have been proven to be 
sustainable activities over the decades or over the generations. 
These people will have a tendency to be dispossessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can be almost certain that no cost benefit analysis and no 
sociological or socioeconomic analysis of the bill has been done 
by the government.  I would guess the government has no idea what 
the program will cost.  In any event it probably does not matter 
because the government's first order of business will be to 
offload any management responsibilities on to everyone but 
itself.  After having taken credit for starting what it has 
brainwashed everyone into believing is the greatest thing, the 
federal government will point fingers at everyone but itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. has had similar legislation since 1972.  It passed the 
marine protection, research and sanctuaries act at a time when 
there was a burgeoning global awareness of environmental issues 
and a real environmental bandwagon.  We were all in the same 
category at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1972 the United States has created 12 national marine 
sanctuaries.  There are five off the east coast, five off the 
west coast, one in Hawaii and one in American Samoa.  The goal in 
creating these 12 areas has been to protect vital pockets of 
distinct and threatened ocean in American territorial waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first such sanctuary made in 1975 consisted of less than one 
square mile off the North Carolina coast surrounding the wreck of 
the <I>Monitor</I> from the Civil War. 
The others include the world's third largest barrier reef, unique 
waters off California, and coral reefs.

annual budget of $11.7 million and volunteers are an essential 
component of making sure its system works.  There is a lot of 
buy-in in the U.S. system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think our government has thought about the cost in 
terms of capital outlay, human effort and the cost of people 
displaced by the system.  We have created 29 zones and no 
realistic budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the problems we have had with our fisheries 
resource and are continuing to have on both coasts, it is very 
clear that we are unable to police effectively overfishing, 
poaching and other associated problems.  Right now on the B.C. 
coast police boats have been taken out of service.  Police 
airplanes have been grounded.  They are under tight budgetary 
constraints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Owikeno, a native village on the mid-coast of British 
Columbia.  It used to get a once a month visit from the RCMP.  It 
does not get any visits any more unless it is an absolute 
emergency.  The police are concerned about drug interdiction. 
They have all kinds of concerns.  They cannot enforce the 
Criminal Code on the water any more, and there are very limited 
resources in other departments.  I am very concerned about all of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-48 will not prevent or assist any of this.  If the funds 
are not provided the legislation cannot be effectively put in 
place.  I could say a lot more, but possibly in the question and 
comment period I will be able to say some of it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the member's comments 
on Bill C-48.  I have a couple of questions based on some of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of his suggestions was that this initiative or the whole 
idea of marine conservation areas simply began when the Prime 
Minister made a speech in 1996.  Perhaps he may want to explain 
to the House how this could be an idea that only started in 1996 
when the first marine conservation area, Fathom Five, was 
established in 1988, a full eight years before the time when he 
claims that this idea came forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member and others who spoke on this matter referred to 
some sort of diabolical plot by the Minister of Heritage to 
include this in her portfolio when it should rightfully belong 
somewhere else.  Maybe he could explain why it is that there are 
already marine conservation areas which are administered by parks 
and have been administered by parks long before the current 
minister assumed her particular position. Perhaps he may want to 
address that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of all I would like to know how the member can blanketly 
oppose the legislation, even putting forward an amendment, after 
voting for a marine conservation area earlier this year at the 
Saguenay-St. Lawrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am opposed to the way 
in which we have such disparate departments promoting legislation 
that does not seem to hang together or tie together and which 
tends to politicize the whole process.  I am not blanketly 
opposing the protection of marine areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of talking about dates and when things happen, I remind 
the parliamentary secretary that in 1957 British Columbia created 
marine parks.  I have been in those marine parks in Montague 
Harbour on Galiano Island and at Rebecca Spit in my riding. Some 
of these marine parks actually contain no water, but they protect 
anchorages and scenic shoreline areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were many activities in the 1960s, the 1970s and the 
1980s.   Now British Columbia manages—this is the west coast 
after all—73 provincial parks and recreation areas and 15 
ecological reserves with marine components.  Parks Canada manages 
155 square kilometres of marine waters in Pacific Rim National 
Park.  I spent seven years in that area.  I am well aware of the 
plan to create 3,000 square kilometres of national marine 
conservation area in the Queen Charlotte Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not germane to the exercise.  It is not whether we have 
protected marine areas.  It is how we go about it.  I am saying 
the legislation is full of holes.  There are lots of concerns. If 
we are to do it, let us make sure we are locally sensitive and 
that the people with the most potential to be displaced have the 
most to say, particularly in the beginning, about how they will 
either be achieved or even whether it is appropriate to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a very short 
question for the member opposite.  Would he tell the House which 
of the 29 areas he or his party do not want to be conservation 
areas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I never indicated that I 
did not want a marine conservation area in any of the 29 areas. 
Dividing Canadian waters into 29 slots told me that the federal 
government must be targeting a minimum of 29 marine conservation 
areas.  When we look at the U.S. experience since the 1970s it 
has only created 12 areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am questioning whatever rationale went into it, whether or not 
it was a realistic rationale.  I will be happy to identify which 
of those 29 areas I would not want to see designated as marine 
conservation areas when the parliamentary secretary tells my 
caucus which industry he would like to see targeted if the 
split-run publishing bill is found wanting by WTO.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his 
speech, the member expressed his concern at the overlaps within 
the federal administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three departments are in fact involved with the same bill.  In 
real life, experience has shown that, when a number of 
departments are involved, they generally do not readily cohabit, 
the exercise is costly and the bureaucracy is extremely 
cumbersome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand the member's observations, because we can end 
up with a single area that is zoned in several ways. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member from the 
Bloc for her question.  I was trying to point out that the 
government has very scarce resources that are already fully 
allocated.  Indeed it is suffering some obvious shortfalls that 
it had not anticipated in the marine field on the west coast. 
So I thank the member for pointing this out.   Indeed when we 
have three different departments we have diffused management and 
it is less effective.  We have seen that very clearly in the 
management of the fishery.  When there is one manager we can 
attempt to manage the fishery.  As soon as there are two or more, 
everything falls apart.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am honoured indeed to rise to speak in support of my colleague's 
Motion No. 380.  The motion brought forward by the official 
opposition's chief critic on foreign affairs, the hon. member for 
Red Deer, asks this House to seek majority support through an 
official vote in the House before Canadian military personnel are 
committed to an active military mission outside the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the House should support this motion.  This is a 
motion that would strengthen our democracy and make the executive 
branch of government more accountable to Canadians. This motion 
attempts to balance the requirements of ruling with the argument 
of accountability.  It is a step forward in redefining 
responsible government as we enter the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems only just and right that we should always debate and 
vote to support our troops before we agree to send them overseas. 
Our troops can then embark on their mission knowing that a 
majority of elected representatives from every part of Canada 
approve and support that mission as they go off to foreign 
destinations to protect freedom and democracy and defend 
defenceless people in so many parts of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If passed, this motion will help inform Canadians. This motion 
will help make the foreign policy process more transparent and 
therefore more legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the foreign policy paper “Canada in the World” the 
government claims it wants a new and broader process for foreign 
policy formulation, but when it comes to practising it the 
government fails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making decisions to commit our troops without debate in this 
House, the government is attempting to prevent itself from being 
held accountable for the lack of equipment and the poor grade of 
equipment our troops are asked to use despite year after year 
defence budget cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 380 asks for a debate to take place in the House 
every time the Liberals want to risk the lives of those who have 
pledged to die for our country so we can compare the capability 
of our armed forces to what the Liberals are asking them to do. 
This House is the very place where Canadians should be consulted. 
Canadians want the days of secret decision making to be gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take note debate takes place only after a decision to dispatch 
our troops has already been made by the Prime Minister while on 
the telephone with another world leader. That is not democratic. 
It is autocratic and shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently in the House we debated military action in Kosovo.  Did 
the Liberal government have any long term plan for dealing with 
Kosovo?  No.  Did we simply have a phony emergency debate to 
affirm the knee-jerk decision made by the Prime Minister? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What plan does the government have to prevent a Kosovo type 
conflict in the future?  What leadership role is this government 
willing to play to handle such a situation in the future in a 
better, more efficient and visionary manner?  The government has 
the habit of inappropriately addressing various issues, whether 
taxes, the economy, justice, national unity and so on.  The take 
note debate regarding the Kosovo decision was all the Liberal 
government allowed members of parliament and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to deal with such problems there should be two plans. 
According to plan A diplomatic initiatives should be aggressively 
pursued at the first signs of a problem.  Kosovo was an example 
of a too little, too late initiative by this Liberal government 
and other world governments. The government did not pursue plan A 
aggressively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we know plan A has failed we can go to plan B which is 
military action.  That is where Motion No. 380 kicks in. Before 
we prescribe this bitter medicine Canadians will need answers to 
many questions.  Why are we choosing a military situation over a 
diplomatic situation?  What are the actions the government has 
taken?  What other possible solutions can we pursue?  What are 
the possibilities of finding a long term solution?  How are we 
dealing with the long term persistent hatred in the minds of 
ethnic people?  How much involvement are we asking from the other 
affected and related countries to deal with an issue that is in 
their backyards? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know whether we are creating more victims by 
sending troops.  They want to know how far we will go, how much 
it will cost, who is paying and what share we will pay.  Did the 
government assess the degree of risk before it committed the men 
and women of the Canadian Armed Forces?  Do they have enough 
equipment and facilities?  What strategy do we have to deal with 
the original security situation?  We look forward to the answers 
as do Canadian forces personnel. These decisions are made before 
we get the answers to these questions from this government. 
Motion No. 380 would make the information available in a timely 
fashion before the decision is made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have repeatedly been serious situations in the world, in 
Rwanda, Somalia, Nigeria, Bosnia, Haiti, Iraq, and the list goes 
on. Such situations will happen again somewhere, someday.  We are 
not prepared to address international conflict situations in 
their infancies.  We should be.  We should be able to monitor and 
perhaps predict when economic, social, cultural, political or 
other factors are creating conflict in different parts of the 
world and we should address the conflicts before we have to use 
costly military force anywhere in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are proud of their tradition of caring and 
intervention for the sake of peace but the world cannot continue 
to merely react to these situations.  We have sent many 
peacekeeping missions around the world.  I ask the foreign 
minister to look into the possibility of peacemaking missions 
rather than peacekeeping missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand how we can keep peace when it is not even 
made yet.  How can we keep something that does not exist?  Let me 
give an analogy.  When a pressure cooker is heated, steam is 
produced.  To contain that steam we put pressure on the pressure 
cooker.  Suppressing the steam under weight might cause the whole 
thing to explode and create another mess.  The best thing would 
be to remove the heat under the pressure cooker.  No steam would 
be produced and we would not have to put any pressure on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we always use military pressure to contain the steam of 
conflict in the world?   Have we ever taken action to remove the 
heat under the pressure cooker?  No.  Would it not be easier to 
address the root cause of the problem?  Why can we not prevent 
problems before they happen?  That is the key question. 
Unfortunately this government has not taken this sort of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our peacekeeping forces were stationed in Cypress for 29 years. 
Still peace was not made when we withdrew.  We should focus on 
peacemaking before peacekeeping.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Conflict resolution is a precursor to peacemaking.  Ethnic 
tensions in many parts of the world can be resolved by equitable, 
democratic and better governance.  Pilferage and smuggling of 
weapons can be stopped.  Child armies can be banned.  Foreign aid 
should be tied to transparency and accountability of recipient 
governments.  Corruption, poverty, illiteracy and education needs 
can and should be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The weak Liberal government lacks a proactive leadership role. 
It is just reactive because it is used to making knee-jerk 
decisions.  Often a humanitarian crisis is the consequence of 
what is fundamentally a political problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the Palestine and Israel conflict in the Middle 
East, to help the refugees we committed $55 million in 1995.  But 
we had already spent more than $136 million and the refugees were 
still be produced the day I was there in 1998.  We tried to 
resolve political problems with financial solutions through 
foreign aid.  This was absolutely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to meet these problems head on.  We should make educated 
and democratic decisions.  One of the best things to do is debate 
it in the House before the decision is made. I urge all members 
of the House to support Motion No. 380. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, speaking about blowing 
steam, the hon. member for Surrey Central did a great job of it. 
Unfortunately he has not read very much history of the evolution 
of peacekeeping in this country, otherwise he would not have 
undertaken to say the things he has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind him that Canada's role in support of the United Nations 
is the most proactive and most forward advance that countries 
around the world have made.  Canada is at the forefront.  Canada 
moved to the forefront again by obtaining a seat on the security 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member accuses this government of not being 
proactive in peacekeeping, I suggest he reread his history books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To speak to the motion more directly, the hon. member for Red 
Deer has proposed that there be a vote every time there is some 
deployment of personnel outside this country.  I would just like 
to bring up a little history for the edification of the hon. 
member for Surrey Central. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the declaration of war in 1939 the government announced the 
approval of the address in reply to the speech from the throne 
which stated the government's decision to support Britain and 
France would constitute approval of the declaration of war.  On 
September 9 the address was approved without a recorded vote and 
war was declared the following day.  This seems to me one of the 
most serious undertakings of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the demand in this modern day and age comes for personnel 
to go into other countries the call is quite instantaneous.  We 
do not want to do anything to undo that which has been 
accomplished by the tireless efforts of thousands of courageous 
Canadian peacekeepers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the era we are in, the era of ethnic cleansing, of internal 
genocide and untold human suffering, it is simply unacceptable to 
propose that Canada, the world leader in peacekeeping, sit back 
and debate endlessly while tragedy unfolds.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, which is proud of Canada's peacekeeping 
tradition and respects the sacrifices of Canadian men and women 
who have worn the blue beret, does not support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadian military deployments in recent decades have been 
contingents for United Nations peacekeeping operations.  But 
there are other occasions when Canadian forces personnel are 
called upon to serve on active duty outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our alliance commitments in NATO and NORAD are founded on the 
promise of immediate action against a threat to any alliance 
partner.  Such promises do not allow for delays and Canada takes 
these promises extremely seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also events such as the Persian Gulf crisis when 
Canada is asked to play a central role in dealing with threats to 
international peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are times for debate and deliberation over principles. But 
there are also times when Canada must respond rapidly to meet its 
commitments and to show its resolve.  This is not to say that 
this government opposes debate.  On the contrary, we recognize 
that debate is essential, especially when men and women of the 
Canadian forces are put in harm's way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debate on important military issues is crucial and the opinion 
of this House is highly valued.  Since its election by the people 
of Canada this government has done much to encourage the debate 
of all Canadian contributions to international peacekeeping 
operations, both within this House and in the public at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discussion has indeed taken place, not only with regard to 
specific operations, but with regard to the principles and 
direction of Canada's peacekeeping policy in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that no area of policy has been more openly 
discussed than Canada's contribution to international security. 
This openness is not only prevalent in this House.  Canadians of 
all walks of life have been given the opportunity to comment on 
Canada's participation in peacekeeping operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of a Department of Foreign Affairs initiative to 
directly involve the Canadian public in our country's foreign 
policy, ordinary Canadians were invited to give their opinions 
and comments on Canada's involvement in the UN mission in Haiti. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was accomplished through an Internet site which allowed 
private citizens to become more informed on Canada's involvement 
in international peacekeeping and to offer their own thoughts. 
The response was extremely positive.  The site received over 500 
visits and two-thirds of those who responded supported our 
involvement in Haiti. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We firmly believe that endeavours such as these go a long way 
toward opening up the foreign policy process to every Canadian 
much further than the mechanism proposed by this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the ability and willingness of the Canadian public to 
voice their concerns with any peacekeeping operation and the 
quality of the frequent debate which takes place in this very 
House, it is clear that this motion is not a step forward.  The 
only possible result would be the undermining of Canada's 
commitment to international security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this era when events unfold rapidly, leaving little time for 
reaction, a motion such as this is simply not viable. The 
government recognizes the need for the international community 
and Canada as one of its leaders to react quickly in times of 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Canadian study toward a rapid reaction capability for the 
United Nations pointed out, the nations of the world must respond 
quickly.  Having urged the international community to react 
promptly through this study, Canada has a responsibility to lead 
the way.  That is precisely what this government intends to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As countless surveys and opinion polls have shown, Canadians 
support our country's role as the world leader in peacekeeping.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest that a vote in the House is necessary to ascertain 
whether or not the Canadian public supports our leadership role 
is, quite simply, inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians support and have confidence in the government's choice 
to keep Canada at the forefront of international peacekeeping and 
security efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent study documenting Canadian opinions on foreign and 
defence policy, 79% of those polled considered peacekeeping 
important for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 1998 study showed that 68% of Canadians want our current 
commitment to international peace and security to be maintained 
or increased and a similar number regard peacekeeping as being a 
very positive source of Canada's international reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the Canadian people support this country's efforts at 
peacekeeping and international security.  To support this motion 
one would have to ignore several very important realities of the 
world around us.  First and foremost, events today unfold rapidly 
and often with tragic consequences.  It is important for 
Canadians, for Canada and for the world to be able to act 
quickly.  Therefore, this motion cannot be supported.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in turn 
to speak to Motion No. M-380 presented by my Reform colleague, 
the member for Red Deer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of this motion is, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should seek 
majority support through an official vote in the House of 
Commons, prior to committing a significant contingent of 
Canadian military personnel to an active military mission beyond 
the boundaries of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have, on several occasions, been emergency debates to 
support, after the fact, a decision to send Canadian troops to 
take part in peacekeeping missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have noted that the Government of Canada has consulted the 
various opposition parties about these missions on several 
occasions, but after the decision was already made.  Today's 
motion calls for one step further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the Bloc Quebecois has already spoken on the matter 
in its dissenting report at the time of the release of the 
government's foreign policy statement in 1994.  The Bloc 
Quebecois felt that one of the primary roles of Canadian forces 
on the international scene is to support peacekeeping missions 
by taking part in them.  This is undoubtedly a Canadian talent 
and a flower, as we put it, in its international reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we wanted Canada's future interventions to be subject 
to more specific criteria, and that is the gist of today's 
motion. 
The motion before us seeks to ensure greater parliamentary 
control over the participation of Canadian military personnel to 
peacekeeping missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that members from our party are delighted 
to have this opportunity to discuss proposed changes to the 
Canadian Forces' activities abroad, during peacekeeping 
missions. We thank the hon. member for Red Deer for providing us 
with this opportunity to show the timeliness of our dissenting 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion M-380 is consistent with the concerns expressed by the 
Bloc Quebecois during the various debates held in the House on 
this issue. Let me briefly mention the position adopted by our 
party regarding the issue before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we think that the Canadian Forces play a major role on 
the international scene, and that they must support and actively 
participate in peacekeeping operations. However, we believe that 
the criteria used to determine Canada's future participation 
must be tightened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, recent peacekeeping missions have experienced 
problems, and Canada must take note of that. The missions to 
Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia and Haiti, for instance, have 
reminded us that we need to base our interventions on democratic 
legitimacy and rigorous planning. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also pointed out in our report that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs and complexity of intervention will require a new 
attitude on the part of the international community. The events 
in Rwanda and Bosnia are eloquent evidence of this. Canada must 
learn from the experience of all these peacekeeping missions. In 
the future, mission objectives and orders will have to be 
carefully established, under the aegis of the United Nations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conflicts to which I just alluded have clearly demonstrated 
the importance of first defining a more explicit framework for 
our interventions. 
The Bloc Quebecois also recognized the need to give the Canadian 
Forces a special configuration to maintain the credibility of 
our intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this stage, I would like to comment on a remark the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs made 
earlier. He said that, while the motion calls for a vote to be 
taken in the House of Commons every time Canada is asked to send 
troops to restore, monitor or maintain peace, this would not be 
possible and that the urgency of the request would not allow us 
to summon the House and to make decisions in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to tell the parliamentary secretary that the 
crises he gave as examples, which would require a timely 
response, never happen overnight. They usually develop over a 
long time. 
Canada has a duty not only to act in times of crisis, but also 
to prepare for crises that, as I just said, do not happen 
overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we believe Canada should review its existing 
military alliances. Let me quote, once again, from the 1994 
dissenting report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois wishes to spell out the direction that Canada 
should take in this area. First, we think—and we still do—that 
Canada should rethink its current military alliances with NATO 
and NORAD so that their strategic missions reflect the UN's 
needs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach would inject new life into these organizations and 
would make them more effective in protecting safety and in 
resolving conflicts. It would also make it possible for Canada 
to meet its public security objectives, which are crucial to its 
own domestic security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Bloc Quebecois considers that Canada should 
encourage the setting up of a permanent contingent available to 
the UN for its peacekeeping missions abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about thousands of Canadians and Quebeckers 
engaged in peacekeeping and peacemaking missions. Of course, 
these soldiers being generally sent on a mission for six months 
or so, there is a rotation. However, since many human lives are 
at stake, we think the motion by the member for Red Deer should 
say something about determining the size of the contingent as 
well as the costs and the objective of the mission. 
Even though Motion M-380 is silent on these issues, it has the 
merit of putting the debate in the proper context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, as we have said many times in previous debates, we 
think Canada should submit any decision to participate in 
peacekeeping missions to a vote in the House of Commons, as 
rapidly as possible, where time allows. I would like to point 
out that we are being realistic, here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are happy to see this proposal being echoed in the motion 
before us today. Since the Bloc Quebecois supports the 
fundamental principles outlined in this motion, we will vote in 
favour of it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT96"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT96"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1800

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to remind the House of the great 
importance the Bloc Quebecois accords to this debate on the 
democratization of government decisions with respect to foreign 
affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The globalization of exchanges we are now seeing, whatever their 
nature, makes the need for control of these activities by the 
people's elected representatives, and therefore by this House, 
all the more pressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increased importance of international organizations such as 
the UN and the European Union, our participation in NORAD and 
NATO, the globalization of social movements, population 
movements, human rights issues, problems related to drug 
trafficking, and environmental abuse, to name just a few 
factors, all have a direct impact on both global security and on 
the sovereignty of nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this motion, the government has an opportunity to take a 
first step and meet the challenge of transparency by involving 
Parliament in decisions about whether to send Canadian military 
personnel abroad. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure for me on behalf of all 
constituents in the great riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke 
to speak to this motion and highlight this government's 
commitment to enhancing the role of parliament in the 
consideration of Canadian defence and foreign policy issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A similar motion was debated in October 1996.  At that time the 
government noted that any additional steps in the deployment 
process would seriously undermine Canada's ability to respond 
rapidly and effectively to international crises. The government's 
view remains unchanged as the nature of international crises does 
not make this motion a viable option for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a comprehensive public discussion of any major Canadian 
forces overseas deployment is a healthy and important activity 
that must be encouraged.  Thus the government has continued its 
active engagement in consultation with parliament on Canadian 
forces troop deployments wherever possible and necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent history shows us that these are not empty words or 
vacuous rhetoric that on occasion is the mantra for some members 
opposite.  I am excluding the member for Sackville—Eastern Shore 
but I could be including the member for Lakeland when I say this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this month the House debated the evolving situation in 
Kosovo and the prospect of Canadian involvement. All parties 
agreed that this was a serious humanitarian crisis and supported 
action if no diplomatic solution could be reached. We all agreed 
that air strikes may be necessary to quell the violence there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April of this year the House was consulted on two highly 
visible international developments.  A special joint meeting of 
the House of Commons defence and foreign affairs committees 
attended by both ministers came to the unanimous conclusion that 
Canadian participation in a peacekeeping force to the Central 
African Republic was necessary. It is worth noting that the 
peacekeeping force was deployed in record time. Later that month 
a House debate led to unanimous House approval of continued 
Canadian participation in the NATO led stabilization force in 
Bosnia. There are many more examples of the government's 
commitment to open debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to consulting parliament on troop deployments, many 
major foreign policy issues have been discussed in parliament. 
The Dayton peace agreement, cruise missile testing, NATO 
enlargement and NORAD renewal have all received consideration by 
parliament. Few areas of public policy receive more open 
discussion than do Canada's contribution to international 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, it has been the policy of this government from the 
beginning that major defence and foreign policy issues be brought 
to the House.  We have kept our word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition the government called on the House for a 
comprehensive review of Canadian defence and foreign policies 
prior to the government reaching decisions on these matters. 
Parliament's recommendations were highly influential in defining 
Canadian policy for the 1990s and beyond.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend's motion might be interpreted by some to imply 
that this government's decision on troop deployments rarely if 
ever involve parliament, that these decisions go against the 
democratic grain in this country.  This is simply not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should all recall that Mackenzie King, a champion of full 
parliamentary sovereignty over Canadian policy, called parliament 
back from recess for an emergency debate on Canadian 
participation in the second world war.  This government also 
strongly believes in parliamentary involvement.  Earlier this 
year our Prime Minister called upon the House for urgent debate 
regarding Canadian involvement in the Persian Gulf, regarding 
Kosovo, and the Central African Republic and SFOR.  Mackenzie 
King's democratic tradition continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also suggested that this motion will lend parliamentary 
support, approval and legitimacy to the deployment of Canadian 
forces abroad, as if these qualities were somehow absent today. 
The fact of the matter is that parliament is consulted on troop 
deployments whenever possible and necessary, and that these 
discussions are taken seriously by the government.  The views of 
this House are taken into consideration when decisions are taken 
by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what of the international environment?  The new 
international security environment is unstable.  Crucial 
developments occur at astonishing speeds.  It has been suggested 
that predicting international crises is relatively easy, that 
nothing comes up overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Collapsing states and ethnic violence are not overnight 
developments but decisions on multinational intervention are. 
These actions, be they through the UN or NATO, are not often 
afforded the luxury of time.  In this era of ethnic cleansing, of 
genocide and of untold human suffering, a few days delay could 
cost hundreds of thousands of lives.  This happened in Rwanda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our ability to deploy rapidly has even more significant 
implications for Canada.  Our NATO and NORAD commitments are 
founded on the promise of immediate action against a threat to 
any alliance partner.  Canada takes these promises extremely 
seriously.  If ever the need to defend our allies arose and our 
troops remained waiting idly by because of undue delay, our 
international reputation would be severely damaged.  Hence the 
need for speed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community's pursuit of a fully functional 
rapid reaction force especially at the UN is well documented. 
Canada has and will continue to build an important role in the 
development of such a force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's 1995 study “Toward a Rapid Reaction Capability for the 
United Nations” was a highly influential examination of how the 
UN and individual countries could improve their ability to 
respond to international crises.  This initiative spawned an 
agreement in principle to develop a rapidly deployable mission 
headquarters. This headquarters will increase the UN's ability to 
get operations under way in a far shorter time. Also related to 
this is the United Nations multinational standby high readiness 
brigade, or SHIRBRIG, a co-operative effort between Canada and 
many European states.  We hope that this brigade will be 
available to the UN by January 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address humanitarian disasters, national defence maintains 
the innovative Canadian forces disaster assistance response team 
under the acronym DART, which is not to be misconstrued with 
another DART, the acronym for Draconian arrant reform truculence. 
The Canadian forces DART is composed of 180 personnel who can be 
deployed for humanitarian and disaster relief within 48 hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's commitment to developing rapid reaction capabilities is 
unparalleled.  But Canada also tries to lead by example.  Our 
quick contribution to address the recent crisis in the Central 
African Republic and the deployment of troops and equipment to 
help Italian regions devastated by mudslides are cases in point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our well earned reputation has been won in part by our 
willingness and our ability to act quickly.  We must do nothing 
that threatens this.  In fact we must do the exact opposite.  It 
would not be wise to add any step in the approval process that 
could hamper our ability to respond. 
Requiring a vote on the deployment of Canadian forces abroad 
could in some circumstances impose delay and the cost of such 
delay would be measured in human suffering.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record of the last five years shows that where a mission is 
about to be launched or the government is considering the renewal 
of an existing commitment, parliament will normally be involved. 
This can take the form of debate in the House or the appearance 
of ministers before standing committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Matters related to the overseas deployment of Canadian forces 
personnel are usually brought before this House for debate. I see 
no sign that the government will stop taking advantage of the 
opportunities to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is vitally important that the government retain the ability 
to act quickly.  To limit its ability to do so in the manner 
proposed in this motion would be incompatible with Canadian 
values and interests.  Given the government's record in 
consulting parliament regarding these matters, I also see little 
practical advantage to be gained by imposing such a requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To support this motion, one would not only have to ignore a 
well-established and consistent record of consultation, one would 
have to ignore the reality of the world around us.  Events today 
are unfolding rapidly and often with tragic consequences.  Rapid 
response is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The now well-established practice of consulting parliament has 
served this House, this government and Canadians very well.  The 
government will continue to consult parliament on major defence 
and foreign policy issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final analysis, the Liberal government's commitment is to 
be strong.  The Liberal government's commitment is to safety. The 
Liberal government's commitment is to save lives.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have to say it is never really fair to follow the 
member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke.  He mentioned speed.  I 
know about his love for horses and he knows a lot about speed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of speed the member talked about the lives that could 
be lost if we brought this motion to parliament.  The fact is 
that lives are being lost now, even without this motion.  Many 
lives have been lost in Kosovo, in Asia and other parts of the 
world because of bureaucratic bungling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in this House the Indian affairs and northern 
development minister stated “This government must be accountable 
and transparent”.  Truer words could not be spoken. The 
unfortunate part is that this government is not acting on what 
she said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 301 elected members of parliament in the House of 
Commons.  Probably each and every single riding has military 
personnel serving in the country, very proudly and very well. It 
only stands to reason that members elected from those ridings 
should have a vote or a say on where we deploy these brave men 
and women around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to digress and mention my family background.  My father 
was in the Dutch resistance during the war, was captured by the 
Germans and put in a prison camp.  He and other members of the 
camp were rescued by the Canadians.  The Canadians valiantly 
liberated the south of Holland and moved north through the rest 
of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1956 my parents decided to immigrate to Canada. I was eight 
months old.  My father said the only place to move in the world 
would be to Canada because it had a brave military and absolutely 
wonderful people.  He said it would be a great opportunity for 
his children to grow up there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty years later I stand in this House as a member of 
parliament.  I came from the country of Holland and am now in 
Canada because my mother and father gave me and my eight brothers 
and sisters that opportunity.  That is what this country has 
done.  This country is based on fundamental democratic policies, 
policies that this motion reflects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our current military is under attack through underutilized 
resources.  The media heavily attacks military concerns.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone here has seen the tapes.  Everyone here has read the 
media articles about our military men and women around the world. 
The unfortunate part is that those articles do not reflect the 
true essence of our military today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Sackville—Eastern Shore there is a town called 
Eastern Passage which has the military base of Shearwater. 
Shearwater has been there for 80 years, serving this country 
proud.  I might note that 80 years has passed since World War I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The men and women of Shearwater do an outstanding job.  The 
problem is that they do that job, literally, on a shoestring. 
They are under attack by their own personal wages, they are under 
attack by the equipment they have and they are under attack by 
their deployment.  Yet the motto of all military people, 
especially those in the navy, is “Ready, aye ready”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker from the Liberal Party indicated that this 
motion would risk or delay their capability of being ready.  I 
would like to remind him and all of his colleagues in the Liberal 
Party that our military stands to be ready at a moment's notice. 
They are proud people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Bloc indicated quite rightly that we are now 
in a globalized world.  There is global uncertainty in other 
parts of the world.  Our forces are traditionally put under UN 
forces to merge with other western nations to assist nations that 
are in conflict.  Many times members of this House, especially in 
opposition and even those in the Liberal government, do not 
really know where the troops are being deployed or whose 
directions they are following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this motion is asking is that all elected members of 
parliament should at least understand where the troops are going 
and what they are doing.  Members should have a say in that 
movement.  I do not believe for a second that in the event of a 
crisis the opposition would purposely delay action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of the suffering that our military personnel are 
going through on a domestic level, they do an outstanding job. On 
November 11 all of us in the country will honour the sacrifices 
of our military personnel, who are buried in over 60 countries 
around the world.  We will remember all of the conflicts which 
they have encountered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be very proud to lay a wreath in my riding on November 11 
on behalf of the people of Canada.  Wreaths will be laid by 
veterans at eight other cenotaphs in my riding on behalf of the 
people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the Reform Party is asking for in this motion, which I 
support, is the chance to have a say.  We just want to have an 
opportunity to speak before we send men and women into areas of 
the world where they may run into conflict.  An ill-fated 
decision which is made too quickly may cause the lives of our 
military men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1990s military action means more than just the deployment 
of troops.  It is about families.  It is about the women and 
children left behind or the men and children left behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a right as members of parliament to decide their 
respective partner's future.  I do not believe that it should be 
just the government that decides.  If the government is fully 
confident in this House of Commons and fully confident in other 
members of parliament, it would bring it to the House for debate. 
It could be a very quick debate if need be, but it should be one 
in which every member of parliament can debate and vote upon the 
situation.  That is all we ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking about veterans, the Liberal government talks about 
the work it has done, yet when it comes to the merchant marines 
it is very slow to react.  We recently had three merchant marines 
on the steps of Parliament Hill, on a hunger strike, fighting for 
compensation for something that should have been dealt with right 
after the war.  But this government waited and waited, and it 
still has not acted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that merchant marines also died in the war.  They 
were abandoned by the government after the war and that situation 
continues today.  I pray to God that this government does not 
abandon them and fulfils its promise to speak with them and deal 
with their concerns.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to continue to have a proud and honoured military 
tradition in this country, we need to have an open and 
transparent debate.  That is true democracy.  That is why I 
support the motion put forward by the member for Red Deer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great regret that an opposition member, with very good 
intentions, has proposed a motion to this House that is extremely 
counterproductive, redundant and does not serve the debate, 
democracy or the country as a whole.  It does not serve the 
country that our armed forces personnel go to.  It does not serve 
humanity.  It does not serve any purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 7 of this year the House had a debate.  Members on 
all sides had a chance to speak out on behalf of their 
constituents and on behalf of Canadians.  A motion was put before 
parliament that would allow the House of Commons to give guidance 
to the government in dealing with a crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time the government clearly stated its intention to work 
in co-operation with the international community, in conjunction 
with the United Nations, our friends and allies, in order to put 
a stop to the tragedy in the Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time that we put partisanship behind us and worked 
collectively, not only as a parliament, not only as a community 
and as a nation, but as a world.  We live in one world.  It is a 
global village.  It is a small world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If any of us had flown as far above the earth as Bondar did and 
looked down, we would not have been able to see a border.  We 
would not have been able to see the colour of people or know 
their religion.  We would not have been able to see a town or a 
city.  We would only have seen the world as one unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to do as a parliament, as a community and as a 
country is to promote the kind of feeling that we are all one. We 
live in one small environment, in one small global community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to put a stop to the horrible things that are taking 
place around the world.  We have to be proactive and vigilant. 
We have to seek venues, such as the United Nations community and 
other venues, to establish a mechanism so that we can begin to 
resolve international disputes and problems through dialogue and 
discussion rather than resorting to violence, attacks and 
torture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world cannot take it any more.  Our resources are 
evaporating at an incredible rate.  One of the most expensive 
resources on this planet is the human resource and we must 
protect it.  We have done damage to our environment.  We have 
burned forests all over the place.  We have eliminated fish 
stocks from different parts of the ocean.  We have created toxic 
waste all over the place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have wars all over the place because of borders and other 
things that may have happened 500, 1,000 or 5,000 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of us owns any part of this world.  This world belongs to 
all of us collectively.  We are the trustees of this world, as my 
colleague would say.  We have a responsibility collectively to 
work in harmony to improve the relationship that exists between 
people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that the Minister of Foreign Affairs has set an 
example by getting this country to take the lead on the land 
mines issue, on the engagement process, trying to engage the 
other side and trying to enter into dialogue with the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous minister of foreign affairs as well as the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and every officer who works in it 
have been very proactive in trying to encourage the United 
Nations to establish a United Nations peace service mechanism, a 
peace force in order to resolve disputes around the world.  We 
have been very proactive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my colleagues in opposition, including those in the New 
Democratic Party, that they should be on board with what this 
government is doing.  They should be supporting what the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs are 
trying to do on behalf of all us as public servants to get this 
country to be proactive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trusted.  We are a middle power.  We do not have any 
colonial interests anywhere.  We are not interested in annexing 
territories. We are a peaceful nation.  There is confidence in 
our nation.  There is confidence in our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to use that confidence around the globe in order to 
promote peace, prosperity and the resolution of problems through 
the mechanism we have spoken about, dialogue.  Let us work 
together in unity.  Let us not use it for a political purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been here for almost ten years. It hurts me to see a 
motion like this trivializing the difficult times of the people 
in that part of the world who need us.  Those on both sides need 
us.  They need us to go in there and create an environment of 
engagement in that part of the world.  The motion says that, in 
the opinion of this House, the government should seek majority 
support, through an official vote in the House of Commons, prior 
to committing a significant contingent of Canadian military 
personnel to an active military mission beyond the boundaries of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are already in that part of the world.  We have been in 
different parts of the world for over 40 years now.  We have 
people who have been engaged pretty well in the vast majority of 
peacekeeping forces that exist in the different parts of the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing new here.  Parliament has consistently been 
engaged in debate.  Parliament has consistently debated issues 
affecting Canada's presence around the world, the peacekeeping 
presence around the world, the United Nations presence around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having a motion like this now is extremely counterproductive and 
not serving the democratic process the way it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of what is taking place at this moment, if I were my 
colleague I would withdraw this motion and do the honourable 
thing and endorse what this government and this nation have been 
doing for the past 50 years or so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent, what we have to do as a House is say we have not 
only four walls and the floor and the ceiling but we have a 
nation.  We have to take care of the business of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we know the government has already made decisions on issues 
like this, when we know the government has international 
obligations, when we know the government has a role to play on 
the international scene as a member of the United Nations, as a 
member of NATO and as a member of the international community, we 
should say collectively that the government is doing the right 
thing.  We should endorse what it is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, as individual members of parliament we must 
continue to call on our friends everywhere, in our constituencies 
and around the globe, to pull aside the valance and come together 
as one people to start dialogue.  This is the only way we can 
come to a conclusion so that we have a better community, a better 
nation and a better globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I want to say thank you very much because you have 
been a model here and in your constituency.  Many members of the

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>WATER EXPORTS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on October 1 of this year I asked a question of the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs about the export of water from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year Nova Group, a Sault Ste. Marie firm, won a 
permit from the Ontario government allowing it to export 600 
million litres of water a year from Lake Superior to certain 
Asian countries.  Not long after, Nova Group saw its permit 
revoked amidst a national debate on the environmental and 
international aspects of allowing the export of our freshwater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July of this year, two months after the initial permit was 
given to Nova Group, the Ontario government passed new 
legislation that banned the bulk export of freshwater, which is a 
reason for Nova Group's licence having been taken away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem lies in the fact that Nova Group is now approaching 
the Environmental Appeal Board fighting to reinstate its permit. 
The environmental minister has already stated that if the 
provinces agree Ottawa would get involved and do something about 
the situation.  Furthermore, the foreign affairs minister has 
asked the United States to agree to refer the situation to the 
international joint committee responsible for boundary waters 
since the water in question is coming from Lake Superior which 
borders both countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario environmental minister, having realized the mistake 
made by giving Nova Group the permit, thinks that the federal 
government should get involved in this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past weekend the United States Great Lakes Commission, an 
American environmental group, joined in the efforts against Nova 
Group.  It stated that if we begin letting one company export our 
freshwater it will turn a trickle into a flood.  During the 
hearings for this case beginning on December 7 of this year, the 
Great Lakes commission will be officially demonstrating support 
for the opposition of selling this natural resource.  According 
to the commission this single permit, if it is returned to the 
Nova Group, would inevitably have a significant impact on the 
future of North America's freshwater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our natural resources are very precious.  We need to think of 
our children and of generations to come.  We need to control this 
very precious resource which is a staple of life and is a very 
serious problem for all Canadians present and future.  The issue 
of water exports needs to be examined and discussed at the 
federal government level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I ask the Minister of Foreign Affairs what is his 
position on this matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the federal government 
is opposed to bulk water exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me clarify that there are no bulk ocean tanker shipments of 
Canadian water taking place now.  The company, Nova Group, hoped 
to export to Asian markets, but the permit issued by the 
Government of Ontario was revoked.  Nova Group has appealed the 
decision to the Ontario Environmental Appeal Board.  That board 
has set its hearings early in the new year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal officials consulted all provinces on options to deal 
with bulk freshwater export proposals.  Considerable progress has 
been made in these discussions which were completed late last 
September. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will layout its strategy for a comprehensive 
approach to water exports before the end of the year, after 
ministers have had an opportunity to consider the results of 
these consultations with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. has agreed to a joint reference to the International 
Joint Commission to investigate the issue of exports from 
boundary waters.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the four short minutes I have to express my feelings on such 
a tragic issue as the totally inadequate funding of our Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police, the best route I could go is to read 
from a recent newspaper column I wrote on this very subject. What 
follows is my weekly column which ran in three dailies and seven 
weeklies in my huge riding of Prince George—Peace River just 
last week.  This column was entitled “Policing Liberal 
Priorities”: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It's been almost three weeks since it was revealed that a serious 
“financial crisis” within the RCMP has forced senior Mounties 
to issue drastic orders.  All RCMP boats remain tied up at the 
docks, all aircraft have been grounded and there is a ban on 
overtime and all training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of weeks ago I discussed how this shortage of funds 
will jeopardize the safety of Canadians, particularly those in 
rural British Columbia.  The Mounties must make up a $14 million 
deficit—$8.5 million of that here in B.C.  This has been good 
news for organized crime—there is no risk of being caught by 
surveillance boats and aircraft—and bad news for small towns who 
normally must rely on overtime to provide 24-hour policing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As safety and security are considered a priority—even a 
right—in our society, filling this gap in policing is our 
government's top priority. Right?  Apparently not, but it should 
be.  The Solicitor General and the Prime Minister's government 
have had plenty of time to search the federal coffers for $14 
million to fulfil an obligation to provide Canadians with 
adequate law enforcement.  The trouble is, they are simply not 
interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So where do the Liberal interests and priorities lie?  In the 
past several days, myself and fellow deputy Justice Critic, the 
member for Langley—Abbotsford, have been able to identify plenty 
of places in which to scrounge up enough cash to restore the 
essential services of the RCMP.  While there are too many to list 
here, I've managed to narrow it down to the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Top Ten Reasons Why the Liberals Can't Pay for Policing in 
Canada”: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>10.  A $145 million spending spree designed to tell Canadians 
that the end of the Millennium is approaching just in case we 
hadn't heard.  That includes $700,000 to build a replica of a 
tall ship in service during the War of 1812-14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>9. “Other plans” for spending the $3.5 billion surplus the 
government had this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>8.  A $10,000 grant for the International Conference on Visual 
Poetry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>7.  $473,000 to reintegrate Malayan soldiers back into their 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>6.  $2 million to promote the use of electrical energy in 
Brazil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>5.  $15.5 million for the heritage minister's free flag handout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>4.  $120,000 for the Prisoners Support Action Network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>3.  $49,216 for the Prison Art Foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2.  A $14.6 million windfall to the Prime Minister's own 
Shawinigan riding to replace an armoury that the Defence 
Department originally said they don't need for another seventeen 
years!  What a coincidence—it just happens to be the exact 
amount needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And, the Number One reason why the Liberals can't pay for 
policing in Canada— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>$1.3 million for the development of a more disease resistant 
banana in Honduras! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that Canadians are truly questioning the 
“screwed-up” priorities of this government?  These are just 
some of the ridiculous places where our tax dollars are spent. 
Tax dollars are supposed to provide us with basic services such 
as police protection and the enforcement of laws designed to 
guarantee a safe and orderly society.  In total, my colleague 
from Langley—Abbotsford offered up $60 million in questionable 
funding priorities in a letter to the Solicitor General to help 
him “find” the $14 million for the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(That) week during Question Period, I informed the House 
frontline Mounties in Prince George—Peace River (had) told me 
there will indeed be an increased safety risk to British 
Columbians, and to the officers themselves, because of these 
drastic budget cutbacks—

</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP is a government funded agency.  Like all government 
entities it is expected to live within its established budgets. 
Decisions concerning the manner in which money is spent by the 
RCMP are operational questions appropriately left to the 
professional management of the RCMP.  As is the case in several 
provinces, the RCMP is a provincial police force in British 
Columbia under contract with the provincial government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, as of December 1, 1998, 4,284 of the 4,286 authorized 
police contract positions in B.C. were filled.  That is an 
average of 99.9%.  It is not a bad batting average.  Second, 
there have been no layoffs of RCMP members.  Third, overtime is 
allowed for critical operational situations.  Fourth, RCMP boats 
and aircraft are being maintained and are available for emergency 
use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote a letter from the RCMP commanding officer 
in British Columbia to the RCMP men and women in a division.  It 
indicated that public safety remained its number one priority and 
would not be compromised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say as parliamentary secretary that I share the priority 
of public safety, not politicking the way the members across are 
doing.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN COAST GUARD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is always refreshing to hear the Liberal Party talk 
about public safety.  The member for Ottawa Centre actually 
admitted in the House of Commons that they were responsible for 
the depletion of the fish stocks.  The member said “we destroyed 
the fish stocks”.  A Liberal member said that.  I wanted to 
reiterate it for the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans will be on the coast guard.  The 
parliamentary secretary was in the meeting of the Standing 
Committee on Fisheries and Oceans when we asked the acting 
commander at that time, Michael Turner, of the coast guard a few 
pointed questions about the serious cuts and erosion of morale at 
the coast guard.  Referring to the coast guard Mr. Turner said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are undergoing a period right now where we're having to 
re-examine some of our present operations.  We are under 
considerable pressure funding wise, the whole department is.  It 
is true that yes we have transferred a fair amount of money over 
the last few years from the coast guard to the rest of DFO. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That figure is $200 million of coast guard money which was sent 
to DFO.  As we all know the DFO does not have a good track record 
when it comes to handling money.  He continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be some additional changes in the maritimes but I can 
confirm the $55 million figure mentioned mentioned in yesterday's 
paper is not correct.  Not at all, nowhere near correct.  We are 
simply looking at a few percent that have to be adjusted. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speed up the clock a bit.  Neil Bellefontaine, regional 
director of DFO in Atlantic Canada, said that his department was 
forced to cut its national operating budget by 5% or $45 million. 
We are almost there.  We are almost reaching the cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the Swissair disaster off Peggy's Cove the brave men and 
women of the <I>Mary Hichens</I>, the first coast guard ship that 
arrived, received a letter weeks later from the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans indicating how proud he was.  I give the 
minister credit for indicating how proud he and the government 
were that these people went through their own private little 
torture chambers after seeing what they saw in the waters that 
night and throughout the following weeks.  However, it is an 
absolute disgrace that in the same envelope they received from 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans was another letter saying 
that the ship they were on would be tied up and they would be 
laid off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot say to these people that they did a great job under 
horrific circumstances and then turn around in another letter and 
say they are to be laid off.  What a wonderful Christmas present 
that was.  It was a major slap in the face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Daily News</I>, a great paper in my riding in Nova Scotia, 
asked a question the other day of their readers saying “Given 
the importance of the service to the Atlantic region, should the 
federal government have left the coast guard alone and found the 
money from another source?”  Seventy-one out of seventy-two 
callers said absolutely yes.  The people in Atlantic Canada know 
the value of a good coast guard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will guard the coast?  Who will look after our three 
coastlines from coast to coast to coast and our inland waters of 
Lake Winnipeg and the Great Lakes, for example? 
The cuts to the coast guard have been absolutely devastating. We 
heard recently here about the cuts to the RCMP.  We heard 
recently about the cuts to the military.  Yet government members 
stand up and say that public safety will not be compromised. It 
will be compromised.

with an answer to those remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
answer the member. I was preoccupied with how wrong the member 
for Sackville—Eastern Shore was in starting his remarks when he 
talked about the cause of the decline of the fishery.  All along 
he has been saying it has been the foreign fishery and he comes 
up with a new line tonight.  The member is eventually going to 
have to get his line straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me speak directly to the concerns of the member regarding 
the work of the Canadian Coast Guard.  He is apparently under the 
impression from our session in committee that the coast guard had 
transferred up to $200 million to other parts of DFO and that 
this would impede it from fulfilling its marine safety 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard I am very pleased to advise the member that he is 
quite mistaken.  The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, who is 
also responsible for the coast guard, has made it very clear on 
several occasions that safety at sea is and will remain a top 
priority of the department.  So is conservation.  It is the coast 
guard which provides the vital at-sea capability necessary to 
meet both these objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister has confirmed on a number of occasions, the 
coast guard is an arm of government that by its very existence 
and its visible presence represents the obligations and authority 
of the nation in our waters, our ports, our territorial seas and 
our fishing zones.  Those opposite need have no fear that the 
Canadian Coast Guard is about to wither away and disappear.
