	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, B.Q.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, following the tragic events in Norway, where a 
five-year-old girl was killed by two six-year-olds, the public is 
entitled to wonder if television violence does not lead to violent 
behaviour in young people.
<P>
	Many are convinced that it does: 1.5 million people have 
signed Virginie Larivière's petition calling for an end to 
violence on television.
<P>
	There is increasing agreement among medical experts as to 
the harmful influence of television violence on the behaviour of 
children.
<P>
	In the face of the CRTC's inertia on this issue, what is the 
federal government waiting for to propose concrete and 
effective measures that address this serious problem, which is 
detrimental to the development of our children?

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
Torontonian applied to bring his bride from Guyana to Canada. 
His file was taken in Etobicoke; another was taken in Port of 
Spain, Trinidad. The files then went to Toronto. Then they went 
to Brampton. Then they went to Mississauga and back to 
Toronto.
<P>
	There his file sat for over six months with no action. Now it 
has to go back to Trinidad with no action taken, but the medicals 
have expired and have to be done over. Then the file will have to 
come back for approval to Mississauga and then go back to Port 
of Spain.
<P>
	With luck the case will be finalized in a few months. That is 
two years of passing the buck for a standard application. That is 
two years of heartbreak and loneliness and that is not unusual. I 
have spousal sponsorships on my desk that have taken four 
years.
<P>
	The system is overwhelmed. This government says that 
family reunification is a priority but to make it work we must cut 
the numbers of extended family sponsorships, cut the backlog 
and make room for those who deserve priority.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to bring to the attention of the House a glaring 
difference between reality and practice in the immigration 
sponsorship program.
<P>
	Ideally under the terms of the program, someone who agrees 
to sponsor a family member also agrees to provide assistance, if 
necessary, for a 10-year period following their arrival. In 
reality, this agreement is of little worth as 62 per cent of all 
sponsored immigrants apply for social assistance within two 
years of their arrival in Canada. While undoubtedly some 
defaults are justifiable, in most cases sponsors simply do not 
live up to their agreements because they are not enforceable.
<P>
	The credibility of the immigration sponsorship program must 
be restored. The creation of a mechanism which would be 
enforceable would give sponsored immigrants the security they 
need while at the same time protecting the Canadian taxpayer.

	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to congratulate the Canadian Labour Market and 
Productivity Centre on its 10th anniversary today. Former 
Minister of Finance Hon. Marc Lalonde was instrumental in 
establishing this unique forum for dialogue and consensus 
building among Canada's business and labour communities.
<P>
	Admittedly, business and labour have distinct and divergent 
agendas on many fronts. However, over these past 10 years the 
CLMPC has brought together leading labour and business 
organizations, such as the Business Council on National Issues, 
the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the Canadian Labour 
Congress, the Canadian Manufacturers Association, and the 
Canadian Federation of Labour. Together they have produced 
many significant consensus reports on important economic 
challenges facing Canada.

	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
his document released last week the Minister of Human 
Resources Development announced the objectives of the reform 
which included helping Canadians get and keep work by 
ensuring they have the knowledge and skills to compete with the 
best labour forces in the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Parti Quebecois government shares this objective and 
sets it out clearly in its chapter on full employment: ``If every 
member of society, on the basis of his abilities and 
determination, is able to find employment that meets his 
expectations, society as a whole stands to gain. In order for 
Quebecers and their economy to attain their full potential, there 
must exist a framework of policies that encourage people to lead 
a productive life''.
<P>
	It is perhaps surprising that the Quebec government shares 
our objective. I would therefore invite it, without delay, to take 
part in the consultations on the reform of social programs. This 
is part and parcel of the responsibilities of the good government 
it has promised us.

<P>
	Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among

to provincial breast cancer screening activities, research, five 
breast cancer exchange projects and fostering high standards of 
care for breast cancer.
<P>
	I would like to applaud the efforts of families, professionals, 
voluntary and self-help groups and others toward reducing the

confirmed this scenario.

	This government's unwillingness to reduce expenditures is 
threatening economic growth, hindering job creation and

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, N.D.P.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Public Service Alliance of Canada 
pointed out the skyrocketing cost of contracting out. Far from 
being a way to save money, contracting out is actually way more 
expensive. A Manitoba example helps to illustrate the point.
<P>
	As Local 704 of the Union of National Defence Employees 
argues, figuring the total cost of the base support budget and 
other costs into the allegedly hourly cost of doing a job currently 
done by DND employees at Camp Shiloh not only grossly 
misrepresents the cost but creates an artificially high ceiling 
that is easy for private contractors to come in under.
<P>
	Contracting out is a scam designed for patronage. A 
government serious about saving money should cut back on 
contracting out. It should not cut back on employees who will do 
the job for a lot less than what the private sector now charges the 
government, thanks to the government's own misleading way of 
calculating the cost of doing it in house.

We need to ensure that our post-secondary institutions are

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
last election campaign, a few days before the vote, the Prime 
Minister made a formal commitment not to increase taxes. He 
reiterated this same commitment in this House on September 20, 
when he said: ``We do not plan to have any tax increases''.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister reconcile his election 
commitment not to increase taxes with the statements made 
yesterday by his Minister of Finance, who said: ``We made no 
promise with regard to taxes''?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not plan any tax increases. The Minister of Finance 
will table a budget and we think that there will be cuts. However, 
if people do not want us to make cuts, the alternative is to raise 
taxes.
<P>
	We do not know exactly how much the economy will grow. We 
hope that it will give us the revenue we need, and I am pleased to 
report to the House that the Conference Board said today that 
confidence in Canada last month was the highest since 1979.

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> As a historical aside, I was 
Minister of Finance at that time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
can the Prime Minister tell us that he is counting on economic 
growth to make up the deficit, when his Minister of Finance said 
exactly the opposite yesterday, and I quote him from memory: 
``We can no longer count on economic growth alone to make up 
the deficit. Other measures will have to be taken''? How does he 
reconcile these two statements?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is quite obvious that the hon. member has a memory 
problem. We cut government spending in the last budget; it will 
be necessary to make further cuts in the next budget. That is 
what we are saying.
<P>
	The Reform Party tells us that we are not cutting enough. 
Yesterday, you criticized us for not cutting enough, so we will 
perhaps listen to the opposition and make more cuts. Then they 
will stop complaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, you 
will agree that the majority of Canadians find it rather 
distressing for the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance to 
merrily contradict each other on such an important issue.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister is serious in the answer he just gave, 
could he, despite what his Minister of Finance said yesterday, 
make a formal commitment not to increase taxes for Canada's 
middle class?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are consulting the Canadian public at this time. 
Everybody knows that when we became the government we had 
$500 billion of debt that we have to carry. We have prepared a 
very serious plan. We said that we will reduce the deficit every 
year by so much and will be at $25 billion at the end of the third 
year of our mandate.
<P>
	We said very clearly that we will achieve our goal and we will 
do it. This year growth is at 4 per cent which is helping a lot. We 
will probably have to make cuts too. Probably we will have to 
plug some holes that exist in the tax system. We always have 
some problems like that which can bring in more revenue to the 
government.
<P>
	I have absolute confidence we can reach our goal. There is 
always abuse of the tax system. I have been around long enough 
to know that. It is the job of a good minister to plug these holes 
and I have complete confidence in my good Minister of Finance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. Instead of 
getting spending under control, the Minister of Finance has 
clearly announced that he is not giving up the idea of raising 
taxes. His document proposes a review of tax expenditures that 
affect mainly middle-income people, such as education tax 
credits, RRSPs, credits for charitable donations, credits for 
seniors, credits for married people, compensation for work 
accident victims-it is all fair game.
<P>
	After hitting the unemployed and the very poor hard, how can 
the Minister of Finance now consider taxing the middle class 
more when he makes no reference in his paper to the scandal of 
family trusts and of tax shelters which benefit rich Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, all the hon. 
member just did, really, as I did yesterday, was to read the public 
accounts. Now we know that he can read. We now ask him to 
take a closer look, to make choices and to tell us what he thinks 
should be done. We also asked the member many times to give 
us his suggestions about family trusts. We asked him to 
participate fully in the debate, but all we hear are political 
speeches, not constructive suggestions!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday we made some very specific suggestions to 
the Minister of Finance. And I even challenged him to apply 
them and to attack the problems that are out there: operating 
expenses and tax breaks for wealthy Canadians. That is where he 
must cut.
<P>
	Under these circumstances, how can the Minister of Finance 
consider going after RRSPs when he refuses to touch family 
trusts and tax shelters? That is the question and it is outrageous 
that he is not doing it!
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the last budget, 
we closed the $100,000 capital gains loophole. That was the 
biggest tax break. We closed a great many corporate tax 
loopholes. We will certainly follow through in the next budget. 
Until then, the hon. member and his colleagues can make 
suggestions. Instead of making partisan speeches and praying to 
heaven, why do they not act as responsible members of 
Parliament and join the committee to really improve the lot of 
Canadians?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the finance minister admitted that the 
spending cuts contained in his last budget were not sufficient to 
even meet his own modest deficit cutting target. He admitted 
that unless another $3 billion to $5 billion in savings is achieved 
in 1995-96 and another $6 billion to $9 billion in 1996-97 he 
will not meet his target.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6900"> 6900 </A></B>
<P>
	My question is simple and direct and I hope to receive a 
simple and direct answer. Where does the minister expect to 
get that order of savings?
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development- Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I set out 
yesterday, among the various scenarios, was a scenario based on 
a prudent assessment of what interest rates are going to be and of 
the necessity to arrive at savings of $9 billion cumulatively over 
a two-year period.
<P>
	As to where that is going to come from, I set out very clearly a 
list of all government expenditures, a list of all spending and tax 
expenditures. We have set in place a process of consultation 
which is unique in Canadian economic history. It is very 
important that the process work.
<P>
	I ask the leader of the Reform Party and his colleagues who sit 
on that committee to give us their suggestions, to join in drawing 
Canadians out as we have to, to make the trade-offs.
<P>
	It is crucial, in the period into which we are going and the 
budget into which we are going, that we build bridges to 
Canadians so there is a national consensus of the need to face up 
to the problems at which we are looking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister was told in the budget debate six months 
ago that his spending cuts were inadequate. He insisted that they 
were good enough. When interest rates went up, the minister 
was told by analysts, by officials in his department, by the 
money markets, that his deficit cutting was off track. He insisted 
he was on track.
<P>
	The minister has repeatedly been advised over the last six 
months that his deficit control program is off track and how to 
fix it, but he has ignored that advice.
<P>
	Why should Canadians believe that their advice would be 
listened to now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the leader of the Reform Party is 
engaging in a certain amount of revisionist history.
<P>
	What took place in the House was members of the Reform 
Party consistently crying wolf and saying, within about two 
weeks after the budget, that we were going to miss our targets 
this year, that we should have a mini-budget in March, that we 
should have a mini-budget in April, May, June, July.
<P>
	I do not know if they have ever run anything, but that is not the 
way a big institution works, certainly not the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	As we indicated yesterday, we are going to hit our deficit 
target this year for the first time in Canadian history.
<P>
	If someone would like to talk about the last budget and how I 
feel, I am a little upset that the Prime Minister announced that 
business confidence was up. I was going to announce that. I am 
even more upset that the Prime Minister said that business 
confidence was higher when he was the finance minister than 
now-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Same level.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> On the same level. I would 
like to tell the Prime Minister that not only is business 
confidence up but that real exports are up to record levels, 17.7 
per cent higher than at this time last year.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Keep laughing while you go further in debt. Enjoy 
yourself now.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I love these Wednesdays.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the truth is that the Liberal cabinet has not the foggiest 
notion of how to balance budgets and Canadians are paying the 
price for it.
<P>
	Reformers in the House know that the Minister of Health 
cannot read a financial statement, that the Prime Minister does 
not know that jobs are created by deficit cutting and not public 
spending, and that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has never balanced a budget in his entire political 
life.
<P>
	How much more are Canadian taxpayers going to have to pay 
while high spending Liberals learn the elementary lessons of 
fiscal responsibility?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, just a slight correction. I believe 
the Minister of Health is an accountant. I have never said very 
much about accountants, but I think they can read balance 
sheets. In fact she is a very good accountant.
<P>
	We have offered members of the Reform Party the 
opportunity time and time again to set out before us what they 
would do. We gave it to them in the prebudget debate and they 
did not take advantage of it. We gave it to them this summer and

unique opportunity to lay in front of us what the Reform Party 
would do, and we are looking forward to the details. I was going

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. In his grey paper, the 
minister admits for the first time that he intends to make major 
additional cuts in the social program reform, on top of the $7.4 
billion cuts announced in last spring's budget and which have 
largely been approved already.
<P>
	Now that the Minister of Finance has confirmed that he will 
cut billions more at the expense of the poor and the middle class, 
the question is: How many billions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we made it very 
clear in the budget that, in 1996-97, transfers to provinces 
would be frozen to the 1993-94 level. This was also confirmed 
by the Minister of Human Resources Development in his 
document.
<P>
	We said that a review of the UI program was in order and that 
it would be the second stage of the reforms undertaken. Again, 
this was confirmed by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. Make no mistake about it: We will definitely have 
to cut in all government spending.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development is holding 
consultations right across the country and the finance committee 
will conduct the same exercise. I do hope that members opposite 
will make suggestions. Indeed, instead of just yelling they 
should make useful suggestions.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
can the minister announce additional cuts of billions of dollars 
in social programs without being more specific, when the 
consultation process on the social policy reform is barely 
getting underway?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I suggested that 
the hon. member read not only the grey paper, but also the first 
document, which is mauve as you can see. She will see that the 
policy statement is very clear: we have to improve government 
finances in order to protect our social programs.
<P>
	Obviously, we cannot let international markets tell us how to 
build our country. Again, it is to protect our social programs that 
we are undertaking a true structural reform and I hope that the 
hon. member will come before the committee to make 
suggestions. I will welcome them.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
February 23 of this year I asked the Minister of Finance to admit 
that if he provided realistic economic projections in his budget, 
as a result of that budget the deficit would not go below $30 
billion in the third year and would remain close to 4 per cent of 
GDP. The minister replied: ``The answer is quite the opposite. 
Absolutely we will attain the 3 per cent of GDP''.
<P>
	Yesterday the minister admitted that my original assumption 
was correct. Will he tell the House why he did not know what he 
was talking about when he presented his budget projections in 
February?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there obviously is 
a little confusion here. The member says that I did not know 
what I was talking about in the House yesterday. I was not in the 
House yesterday.
<P>
	Perhaps these might help. The fact is-
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. We would prefer that there not be any 
props.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> I wish they were props, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	The fact is that we have been unequivocal. The Prime 
Minister has stated it unequivocally. All the members of cabinet 
and all the members on this side and on that side of the House 
have stated it unequivocally. We are going to hit our target. If 
there should have been any doubt about it, there could not have 
been any doubt after yesterday with what this country is going 
through.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps the minister missed the English translation. What I said 
was that the minister made precisely that statement about his 
February budget and he was wrong just as every finance minister 
with weak intermediate targets-Marc Lalonde, Michael 
Wilson, Don Mazankowski-have been wrong in the last 10 
years on this very subject.
<P>
	When will the Minister of Finance admit that a two stage 
approach to this problem will not work? Will he admit that it is 
not possible to jump over a wide chasm in two short leaps?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I obviously do not 
have the same familiarity with the Mazankowski and Wilson 
budgets that the member does because I did not work for them as 
he did.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	He acknowledged yesterday in the House that he has no idea 
whether or not the Hibernia megaproject will be profitable one 
day. He said, and I quote: ``We must complete this project 
because[. . .] we will be able to recover if not all at least a large 
part of the money invested so far''. The Prime Minister does not 
even dare talk about profits.
<P>
	Considering that this statement is in direct conflict with the 
smug optimism of the Minister of Natural Resources, how can 
the Prime Minister say that he is managing public money 
soundly, when he is not even sure that we will be able to recoup 
the billions of dollars we are sinking into that project?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Let me assure the hon. member that this government believes 
that the Hibernia project is viable and that we anticipate a 
reasonable and fair rate of return on our investment as do all 
consortium members.
<P>
	Let me suggest that the hon. member should appreciate that 
we in the Government of Canada define value in a number of 
different ways, only one of which is rate of return. I should 
remind the hon. member that many jobs have been created and 
many contracts have been let, many of those in the province of 
Quebec. Over half a billion dollars worth of benefits have gone 
to the province of Quebec.
<P>
	We are building infrastructure. We are building a new source 
of energy security in this country. Therefore, I suggest that 
Hibernia on all counts is a valuable project for the long term 
prosperity of this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister must be one of the very few who imagine 
we can make money on a barrel of oil. We are going to see the 
end of the oil before we see any profit. If you want to talk about 
Quebec, Madam Minister, let us talk about it!
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I remind the hon. member that he should 
address his comments to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> If the Minister wishes to talk about Quebec, 
maybe she could explain to us why a shipyard was built from 
scratch in Newfoundland, where there was no expertise-as we 
can see today with the transfer of work to New 
Brunswick-while the shipyard in  Lévis-Lauzon could have 
done the work instead of being threatened with closure.
<P>
	The minister is telling us that she is having her arm twisted. 
As we know, the government withdrew from two other 
megaprojects, one in Regina and one in Lloydminster, in 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Why continue to sink billions of dollars in Hibernia, when she 
actually acknowledges that it will never be profitable?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me try and answer at least some of the 
hon. member's allegations.
<P>
	There are many indicators at this point that we will receive a 
reasonable rate of return on our investment. I suggest the 
member look at a recent Wood Gundy report which indicates 
that we will enjoy a reasonable rate of return on our investment 
as will all consortium members.
<P>
	Let me suggest to the hon. member that when he talks about 
shipyards that he is referring to a recent contractual issue 
involving Vinland shipyards and Saint John shipyards.
<P>
	I think many in this country, including my colleagues from 
New Brunswick, would be somewhat surprised to hear that the 
hon. member does not believe that the Saint John shipyard, one 
of the finest shipyards in the world in terms of instrumentation 
and electrical abilities, is qualified to participate in this 
contract.
<P>

all of us.

have borrowed over $4.7 billion in this $6 billion boondoggle 
and have created only 7,000 long term jobs.
<P>
	Given the statement of the finance minister yesterday about

<P>

that are going on in his riding which he did not object to.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6903"> 6903 </A></B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, this program is creating not 7,000 but some 
100,000 jobs. That is only the beginning because it is attracting 
additional private sector investment into many communities 
and that will create at least twice as many jobs at the end of 
the day.
<P>
	The money that is used for the federal portion as has been said 
time and time again because it is in the red book-have a look, it 
is on reallocation-is a matter of setting priorities and spending 
smarter. That is what we doing with the money we are putting 
into it.

short and the answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the

that I opposed the projects in my riding.
<P>
	We hear about the red ink book, the lilac book and the green 
book. The only thing in common is that they are comic books.
<P>
	The infrastucture program is up for review at the end of its 
second year. Given that the finance minister has admitted that 
the deficit kills jobs, will he kill the infrastructure program and 
create jobs?

	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

some of the projects in his own riding that are putting people to 
work. He has never told me that. He certainly never told my

	This program is implementing what this government said it 
was going to do in providing a program that brings three orders 
of government together to get the economy moving. Provinces 
of all political stripes and municipalities of all political stripes 
applaud this program and are in fact joining together in a 
partnership that is helping to get Canadians back to work.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Prime Minister. Clearly, without the 
participation of the provinces, the National Forum on Health 
will be just a lot of useless talk about health issues, and the 
Prime Minister admitted as much when he said, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The forum is not a decision-making body. Its purpose is to look at the issue 
and make recommendations. This exercise is not binding on the federal 
government nor on the provinces. . . I invited these people to discuss the issue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	Since the fact that the provinces will not attend makes the 
National Forum on Health an exercise in futility, will the Prime 
Minister cancel the forum and save $12 million in taxpayers' 
money, to show he is really serious about dealing with waste in 
government spending?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all participants, who represent the health care 
community in Canada, including all national associations, have 
applauded the government's initiative. The time has come to 
review a system that has served Canadians well so far. We must 
realize, however, that the system costs the Canadian economy 
more than 9 per cent of our gross domestic income. This is better 
than the United States, but not as efficient as systems in other 
countries.
<P>
	We must find ways to work as cheaply and efficiently as we 
can to serve all Canadians, and we must have a dialogue with 
experts from all regions of the country. I think it will be a very 
useful exercise that will help us ensure that we can maintain 
adequate levels of health care for all Canadians across Canada, 
because health is everybody's business.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
can the Prime Minister refer, as he did yesterday, to establishing 
national standards, when health care is the exclusive purview of 
the provinces and at a time when his government, the federal 
government, is contributing less and less to health care 
financing?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I was an ordinary member of Parliament and we 
adopted medicare for all Canadians, the federal government's 
contribution in the health sector was practically nil at the time. 
We set up a national system of which Canadians can be proud. If 
the federal government at the time had not taken this initiative, 
we would not have a national health care plan that applies to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	That is why we have a Canadian Parliament that sets standards 
for the benefit of all Canadians. Our system is the envy of other 
countries, because we treat our citizens well, whether we are 
talking about health care or other areas.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on October 7, I sent to the Minister of Transport my 
solution for the Pearson airport contract problem. He has now 
had almost two weeks to consider the merits of my proposal.
<P>
	Will the minister agree that the Pearson problem will not go 
away and that the proposal I sent him is the only fair and logical 
way to bring the matter to a just conclusion?
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you will understand my concern when you hear from 
whom the proposal came. The hon. member who asked the 
question has been quoted as saying that as far as he is concerned 
there is nothing wrong with the Pearson deal. Therefore 
anything he has to say about it certainly will be suspect in my 
mind.
<P>
	What is very interesting with respect to the position of the 
Reform Party on this matter is that when we talk about the court 
system, I hear its members every day questioning the judicial 
system of the country. Yet when they want to protect their 
friends with a deal at Pearson they want us to go to court. Make 
up your mind.

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, N.D.P.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. Yesterday, before the 
finance committee, he indicated that in his first round of 
prebudget consultations Canadians ``told us they wanted clear 
targets to which they could hold the government accountable 
and we provided those targets. We provided those milestones.'' I 
applaud him for his leadership.
<P>
	However, we have heard an awful lot about the target of 
deficits. Why did the minister not also include targets for 
employment? He is concerned about employment. We have been 
hearing only targets for deficit reduction. Why not targets for 
employment as well?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me say first of 
all that I welcome the question from the hon. member. It is really 
unfortunate that it only appears to be from this side of the House 
that one ever hears the voice of compassion or understanding 
and I am delighted to hear it coming from that side of the House 
and from that member.
<P>
	The member is quite right to point out the great distinction 
between yesterday's document and the document that we issued 
on Monday: the one that dealt with creating an economic 
framework, the one that dealt with jobs, the one that dealt with 
giving Canadians skills, that said basically that the best social 
policy is a good job, the one that dealt with building this country.
<P>
	The member is very wise to point out that we embarked on a 
two track project in the red book and in the election campaign. 
We were going to build this country and we were going to clean 
up the nation's finances. We remain faithful to both tracks.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in only a few short 
days we will celebrate the first anniversary of the Liberal 
government.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	Over the course of that year the red book has become a 
guiding light of government policy. Today I am proud to 
announce that once again we are delivering on another red book 
promise.
<P>
	I am proud to announce that we are going to follow up on the 
recommendations of the Standing Committee on the 
Environment and Sustainable Development. We are following 
up on our promise not only to appoint an environmental auditor 
general, but to go even further.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today, our government has decided to make profound changes 
in the way we operate in order to ensure that Canada's 
environmental agenda is integrated with Canada's economic 
agenda.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have heard the members on the opposite side of the House 
say spend money. What the members of the third party do not 
understand is that a government that incorporates the principles 
of sustainable development into all of its actions will be a 
government that will save taxpayers money.
<P>
	We promised in the red book that we would appoint an 
environmental auditor general. Many people thought the 
government would never follow through on that promise 
because it opens the government up to the potential for 
criticism. It could subject us to the same kind of hard nosed 
analysis and criticism that we are currently open to as a result of 
the Auditor General's current level of activity on our financial 
behaviour.
<P>
	I wish to tell members of Parliament that not only are we 
fulfilling our red book promise today, we want to go further. We 
think it makes good environmental sense and it delivers better 
government. We are serious about promoting sustainable 
development and we are delivering today. We are serious about 
the greening of government.
<P>
	This place alone saved over $750,000 when the former 
Speaker decided to make the practices of the House of Commons 
sustainable. It does not cost more money because we are 
spending money smarter. We are serious about getting the 
federal government's act together on environmental issues and 
we are serious about being held accountable for our 
environmental actions and our environmental planning.
<P>
	The cabinet has reviewed the extremely thoughtful work of 
the parliamentary committee chaired by the hon. member for 
Davenport.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The committee felt that while it is vitally important to audit 
past actions of the government, it is even more important to 
ensure that environmental considerations be a fundamental 
component of planning in all government departments.
<P>
	We have decided upon a package of initiatives which meet all 
the objectives of the committee's report and does so in a manner 
consistent with the fiscal framework of the government. 
Members of Parliament from all parties and a wide range of 
individual witnesses indicated the importantce of moving from 
the concept of sustainable development to the practice of 
sustainable development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to repeat that in English because I think it is an 
important underlying principle. We have to stop talking about 
sustainable development and start delivering. We have to move 
from the theory to the practice, and that starts right here in this 
place with the actions of the single biggest employer in the land, 
the Government of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Committee called for enhanced environmental auditing 
of the government's policies, programs and laws.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The committee believed that individual government 
departments must improve their practices to achieve 
consistency with sustainable development and the greening of 
government. The committee called for the review of existing 
policies and independent and internal evaluation of all new 
policies and laws.
<P>
	The committee also felt that the government must be held 
accountable to Parliament and to the public for demonstrating 
real progress in meeting these objectives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The committee advocated that the government go beyond the 
idea of just an Environmental Auditor and, instead, establish a 
Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable 
Development.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	The government will amend the Auditor General Act to 
establish a Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable 
Development.
<P>
	To guarantee the absolute impartiality of this person, she or he 
will be appointed by the Auditor General of Canada and report 
through the Auditor General to Parliament. The government will 
include a definition of sustainable development in the Auditor 
General Act and ensure that environmental considerations are 
taken into account in all Auditor General reports to the House of 
Commons.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6908"> 6908 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All cabinet ministers will be required to table sustainable 
development strategies in Parliament. The act will make the 
commissioner responsible for monitoring and reporting, not to 
cabinet, not behind closed doors, but to Parliament to monitor 
and report on the performance of government departments in 
meeting our sustainable development goals and objectives.
<P>
	The Auditor General Act will also be amended to allow the 
commissioner to receive from the public and to forward to 
appropriate ministers petitions on environmental concerns. The 
commissioner will have the authority to monitor and report on 
government responses to petitions from the public.
<P>
	I want to be crystal clear. The commissioner, through the 
Auditor General, will issue a separate report annually to 
Parliament on the extent to which departments are or are not 
meeting the goals and objectives of their stated sustainable 
development strategies.
<P>
	In addition to this separate report, the Auditor General's 
report will include considerations of economy, efficiency, 
effectiveness and environment.
<P>
	These changes go well beyond the red book commitment and 
we intend to do even more. The parliamentary committee 
indicated the importance of an open, inclusive process to really 
get people involved.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
We must get people involved in the greening and sustainable 
development process.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Government departments will be required to prepare their 
sustainable development strategies in an open and transparent 
manner which includes review by public stakeholders in 
receiving the advice of independent, objective experts, 
including the National Round Table on the Environment and the 
Economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We want to guarantee that members of Parliament have a key 
stake in ensuring that we meet our objectives. All ministers, 
therefore, will be required to report on their progress toward 
sustainable development in preparing and presenting their 
annual estimates for consideration by Parliament.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The environment is not just a job for the Minister of the 
Environment. The environment is a job for every minister, every 
member and every department of government. The government, 
through the red book, devoted a chapter to the importance of 
sustainable development in building a strong economy by 
linking a healthy economy and a healthy environment. We are 
committed to this integrated approach.
<P>
	Economic, social and environmental policy must go hand in 
hand. We are committed to ensuring the promotion of thinking 
green and delivering on our  actions. It must be a central 
component of decision making, not just from the Ministry of the 
Environment but in the decision making of all departments of 
government and at all levels of society. That is the role Harlem 
Brundtland was talking about when she said that you think 
globally and you act locally. What you flush down your toilet is 
part of what affects the environment. What we flush down the 
sewers, sometimes unaccounted for, affects the drinking water 
and the ecosystems and the gifts that we can give to our children.
<P>
	In the Government of Canada, decisions of government 
departments must reflect a sustainable approach to building on 
our economic strength by recognizing that the world is going 
green.
<P>
	We have announced already our intention to proclaim and 
strengthen the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. I was 
pleased that we received the support of the opposition in this 
particular initiative.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	We have already announced a comprehensive proposal for the 
management of toxins which put the onus not on people to prove 
that chemicals kill, but on companies to prove that they are safe. 
Reverse onus is a very important principle.
<P>
	We have followed up on our promise to establish an 
environmental industry strategy at a time when everyone knows 
that government dollars are tight. We are spending new dollars 
from a reoriented budget to ensure that we have our fair share of 
an emerging world market that has the potential to create 
thousands of Canadian jobs over the next decade.
<P>
	In less than one year we have also delivered on our promise to 
put in place an independent task force. The Minister of Finance 
and I spent a number of months working on the membership of 
that task force. That task force is going to report in one month on 
where the government is developing tax policies that help the 
environment and where perhaps some of our policies might be 
disincentives to sound environmental practices. The 
information from that report will help the Minister of Finance as 
he has to make the tough decisions that come up in the next 
budget. That work will also lay the groundwork for a 
comprehensive review of federal policies and programs again as 
promised in the red book.
<P>
	We are determined to see the greening of the federal 
government. Looking around, this is a green chamber, but we 
want to make sure it is more than in name only. We are prepared 
to put our government on the line, to hold ourselves accountable 
for meeting our objectives and obligations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6909"> 6909 </A></B>
<P>
	Today's announcement means the beginning, just the 
beginning, but it is the beginning of a fundamental change in 
the operation and practices of government. Environmental and 
economic thinking must converge. They are not disparate; they 
are not fighting against each other. They are coming together 
because environmental health is essential for long term 
economic and human health.
<P>
	Who would have thought 10 years ago that a whole industry 
would be wiped out because we did not develop sustainable 
practices? Just look at the fisheries, the cod stocks in Atlantic 
Canada to see a living example of the lack of a sustainable 
development policy.
<P>
	Today's initiatives will be funded within existing resources. I 
believe in the long run today's announcement will pay off major 
dividends, environmental and economic, to the taxpayers of 
Canada, because thinking green does not cost money, it saves.
<P>
	The government is getting its act together on sustainable 
development. We are beginning to make the links between the 
environment and the economy. We are turning the sentiments of 
Canadians into concrete action. We are delivering on the spirit 
of the red book. We are taking measures to seek out independent 
advice because we are not afraid to have our mettle tested. We 
are not afraid to put our feet in the fire and say we will be 
accountable not only to cabinet, not only to the government but 
to the people of Canada through the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	That is what is happening with the creation of the 
commissioner who reports to Parliament. The government 
wants to hold Parliament accountable and the people want to 
hold the government accountable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With this announcement, the government is fulfilling, in less 
than a year, yet another primary election commitment of the 
Prime Minister. One chapter was devoted to sustainable 
development in the red book. This is much more than words. It is 
a set of specific initiatives to ensure all government departments 
develop, announce and publicize our sustainable development 
programs.
<P>
	I want to thank, first of all, the members of the standing 
committee and the witnesses who appeared before the 
committee for their invaluable advice and insight. Today's 
initiatives are much stronger because all members of the 
committee undertook their responsibilities with the utmost 
seriousness and dedication.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to acknowledge the work of all the committee 
members, some of whom actually along with the chair are 
currently on the road on another task of reviewing the five year 
plan of CEPA. One former member is in the House today. I know 
he and his colleagues contributed very constructively to the 
outcome of today's announcement. As I said, it is only the 
beginning. We want to look to him and his party and to all 
parliamentarians for that kind of constructive co-operation in 
the future.
<P>
	I can say from a personal point of view that I have spent a lot 
of time in opposition and not much time in government. 
Sometimes it is hard for governments to open themselves up to 
public scrutiny. It was not easy to move this through all the 
levels behind closed doors. However I can say that the 
commitment of the cabinet to open this to transparency and in 
particular the commitment of the Prime Minister to live up to the 
promise of the red book is what has made today's announcement 
a reality.
<P>
	We came into government and some of the people in the 
bureaucracy said that the red book was politics. Now it is 
government and now they are starting to understand that the 
politics and the policies of the election form the basis of what it 
is we want to achieve.
<P>
	We were successful in actually moving forward on the 
creation of a commissioner for sustainable development who 
will report directly to Parliament through an agency outside of 
cabinet and outside of government departments. I had the full 
support of all my colleagues because they understand that to 
really make government work we have to incorporate the 
principles of sustainable development not only in the Ministry 
of the Environment, not only in the agencies involved in 
environmental protection, but most particularly in how we do 
business in the future.
<P>
	May I conclude by saying that I believe today's 
announcement is the beginning of a future when the 
commissioner for sustainable development will provide the kind 
of ammunition opposition parties need to get up and hold the 
government to account.
<P>
	I am confident the mandate we have accorded to the new 
commissioner for sustainable development with the political 
teeth of the Office of the Auditor General and with the personal 
commitment of the current Auditor General will make this 
process work. Just as today when the Auditor General comes 
down on government departments, we may not always like it but 
we change, we move and we respond to the analyses of the 
Auditor General. In the same way future Parliaments will be 
waving around reports of the commissioner for sustainable 
development to make government accountable, to work for the 
people, of the people and in particular to be accountable to the 
Parliament of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6910"> 6910 </A></B>
<P>
	I am thrilled. This is a small step in the right direction, but 
it is a step that could yield fantastic dividends for the greening 
of Canada in the next decade.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today I have been given the great honour of hearing the Minister 
of the Environment respond to the report of the Standing 
Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development 
about the position of environmental commissioner.
<P>
	Throughout last winter, the members of this committee heard 
many witnesses who, one after the other, told us how they felt 
about the idea of creating such a position in order to assess 
federal programs, activities and legislation, thereby translating 
sustainable development into something concrete, measurable 
and quantifiable.
<P>
	The work done by all committee members was 
unquestionably very serious and constructive, while the 
discussions held during our meetings were always frank and 
honest.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	I must pay tribute to all members of the Committee on the 
Environment and Sustainable Development, and particularly to 
its chairman, the hon. member for Davenport, who always 
showed throughout our discussions a respect-I would go so far 
as to say an innate respect-for the environment and sustainable 
development.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois members on the committee, that is, my 
friend and colleague, the hon. member for Terrebonne, and 
myself, expressed a dissident opinion on the main directions set 
by the majority. We did so with the necessary rigour, without 
partisanship and in the hope of optimizing the resources and 
expertise already available in the Canadian Parliament.
<P>
	So I take a certain pride in the fact that the minister accepted 
the alternative proposal we submitted to her at that time. The 
minister and the Cabinet agreed to amend the Auditor General 
Act to outline a function to be assigned to the commissioner. The 
government decided to make departments more accountable for 
sustainable development, so that efforts made in this area can be 
assessed.
<P>
	Making departments accountable for the environment is the 
way of the future for sustainable development. The Auditor 
General, need I remind you, has learned a great deal about 
environmental assessments. He has developed an expertise in 
this area over the years and he now performs several 
environmental assessment functions. The Auditor General has a 
thorough knowledge of where environmental jurisdiction is 
shared and where the provinces have exclusive authority.
<P>
	In a word, the Auditor General has the necessary integrity to 
carry out these tasks, to give the person appointed all the 
requisite technical support to meet the objectives and fulfil the 
ensuing action plans, in order to make sustainable development 
a reality. Of course, to do this, he will need the financial 
resources required to implement these objectives, which the 
minister has surely provided for and will assuredly inform us of 
in the near future.
<P>
	We members of the Bloc Quebecois thought it was most 
important to amend the Auditor General Act to allow the 
Auditor General to present more than one report a year to 
Parliament and the people.
<P>
	A few moments ago, the Minister of the Environment, in full 
oratorical flight, said that the auditor or the commissioner might 
tell the government things it did not want to hear. Of course, it 
hurts to hear that one has done something badly, but to be told it 
only once a year by someone who has a four-year contract with 
the Canadian people is not so bad. We suggested that the 
Minister of the Environment allow the commissioner to make 
two reports a year, or better yet, to present them as required in 
case of disaster and not to wait 18 months to bring this disaster 
to the public's attention. But no, they are still sticking with an 
annual report.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	We members of the Bloc Quebecois thought that it was very 
important to amend the Auditor General Act so that the Auditor 
General can report to Parliament as required. If there is an 
emergency, another report will be presented; if there is another 
emergency, one or two more reports could be presented.
<P>
	It seems that the minister did not want to amend the law that 
way. If our understanding of this is correct, two separate annual 
reports will be published, dealing with two different aspects of 
sustainable development: one for the departments and the other 
for current activities affecting the environment.
<P>
	Hopefully, the bill to establish a commissioner responsible 
for the environment will be more specific and will provide a 
clear idea of what is involved.
<P>
	The environment minister acknowledged the contribution and 
concerns of Bloc members regarding the position of 
commissioner. We will continue our critical but constructive 
work in committee during the review of this legislation.
<P>
	Sustainable development and the environment must become 
priorities for the federal government, the provinces, the 
territories and the municipalities.
<P>
	Our concern for the environment is real and permanent. 
Recent measures taken by the minister, including the 
proclamation of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 
and the proposal regarding an integrated management policy on 
toxic substances, seemed to be motivated by a stand-offish 
attitude. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6911"> 6911 </A></B>
<P>
However, establishing a dialogue and  harmonizing policies 
with the provinces are essential to promote sustainable 
development.
<P>
	Our environment is too important and too fragile to start 
arguing over issues of jurisdiction. True sustainable 
development can only occur by co-operating with the provinces, 
not by antagonizing them or acting alone.
<P>
	We feel the minister is making a mistake and will not help the 
environment at all if she does not enlist the participation of the 
provinces in various federal initiatives. The minister must make 
sure that the efforts to provide a healthy environment for future 
generations are not wasted.
<P>
	I am sure the minister will agree that our environment is too 
important to avoid a dialogue with her provincial counterparts.
<P>
	In conclusion, I once again say to the Minister of the 
Environment that she can count on the support of the Bloc 
Quebecois regarding any policy, provided that she respects 
provincial jurisdiction and that she avoids overlapping.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Her colleague, the Minister of Finance, used a very vivid 
metaphor, when he said that jumping over a bar three feet high 
does not look like much, but if you happen to be standing six feet 
down in the hole, it is quite a challenge. It means you actually 
have to jump nine feet!
<P>
	Well, the minister can always count on our support, but 
Madam Minister, you will have to recognize provincial 
jurisdictions, and especially Quebec's, and you will have to 
avoid overlap, something Bloc Quebecois members on the 
Environment Committee have said repeatedly. Of course we did 
not always get our way on the Environment Committee, but 
considering the announcement made by the Minister of the 
Environment today, we were probably the only two 
members-after three or four months of debate, who were right, 
because from the very beginning our position was that the 
environment commissioner should work with the Auditor 
General.
<P>
	Perhaps the Minister of the Environment will appreciate the 
following story. When I was a little boy, in a certain country they 
had a red book that was read by everyone. Children grew up 
reciting passages from the red book. Of course, Mr. Speaker, 
they later went to the other extreme-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Like a catechism.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac, B.Q.):</B> Yes, like a catechism. They 
collected all the red books to make huge bonfires. The hon. 
member for Shefford mentioned this awhile ago, and I suddenly 
remembered. So the red book became toxic waste, as it were, 
and they tried to erase its harmful effects from the minds of the 
people, and they will succeed. Mr. Speaker, you have probably 
guessed the name of the country and the author.
<P>
	Speaking of red books, I had one during the election campaign 
almost a year ago, and then my organizers made the mistake of 
throwing it out when they were housecleaning. I asked some 
Liberal colleagues for one, and of course they were quite willing 
to give me photocopies of part of the red book but never the real 
red book. Madam Minister, could I make a formal and official 
request for a red book?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Please drop by my office.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac, B.Q.):</B> I will be there in less than 
an hour. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to acknowledge at the commencement of my remarks that 
when I first started into this process I rose in the House and I 
said: ``If the minister is serious and if we have the opportunity to 
go through the whole process, I am looking forward to her and 
her department coming forward and saying yes, this is the 
collective wisdom of the committee and we are prepared to act 
on it''. I said that if she did that I would congratulate her, so 
today I congratulate her.
<P>
	I realize as a Reformer that I have to be careful, but I would 
like to make special note of the chair of the committee, the hon. 
member for Davenport. I believe he and I share a mutual respect 
for each other, for the fact that we have hard opinions, strong 
opinions and different opinions. In spite of that he did a 
masterful job of bringing together all of the opinions that were 
available through this arduous process. He is absolutely to be 
commended for his work.
<P>
	In addition, taking some of the responsibility for this, the 
member for Comox-Alberni and myself absolutely held out, 
dug in our heels and would not be moved. I am now very pleased 
to see that the minister has announced that we will fund these 
initiatives within existing resources. I take some small amount 
of credit for that on behalf of the Reform Party. There were 
people on the committee who had a differing point of view to 
that.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	I would like to read from the minister's prepared comments: 
``The government will include a definition of sustainable 
development in the Auditor General Act and ensure that 
environmental considerations are taken into account in all 
Auditor General reports to Parliament''. She will know that 
extreme environmentalists would see the term sustainable 
development as being an oxymoron, in other words the two 
things do not necessarily fit together. The responsible 
industrialist, the entrepreneur, does not see it that way. I must 
tell this House that neither does the Reform Party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6912"> 6912 </A></B>
<P>
	The Reform Party sees sustainable development as being an 
absolutely achievable goal. However, one of the difficulties is 
what does sustainable development mean. That is a very 
difficult question. I have some small bit of concern because the 
minister in her comments today in the unprepared part of her 
speech said that there will be an onus on the companies to prove 
their process is safe.
<P>
	One of the concerns that I have is that I do not know what that 
means either. In other words, are we going to kill the goose that 
lays the golden egg by becoming so wrapped up in saying we 
cannot do anything that we will not be able to have any 
responsible development of the resources that we have in 
Canada? It is a concern.
<P>
	I would like to read into my speech from the Reform Party 
blue sheet. We have gone from mauve to purple to red to green to 
grey. The Reform Party has always stayed with blue.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Reform Party supports ensuring that all Canadians and their descendants 
dwell in a clean and healthy environment. The party supports sustainable 
development because-</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is the most important part.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-without economic development and the income generated therefrom, the 
environment will not be protected or enjoyed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is where the hon. member for Davenport and myself 
differ. From his perspective I believe I would be fair in 
characterising his point of view to say that we must protect the 
environment before we get into economic development. I 
suggest if we take a look at what is happening in the third world 
where the countries do not have proper economic activity, where 
they do not have the resources to protect the environment, we 
end up with absolutely atrocious situations in the third world in 
terms of pollution. They do not have the resources to protect the 
environment.
<P>
	I say again that the Reform Party states that without economic 
development and the income generated therefrom, the 
environment will not be protected or enjoyed.
<P>
	This has been a consistent position of the Reform Party 
contrary to what has been said. I am sure that the minister would 
never have said anything disparaging about the Reform Party, 
but maybe there are some people in the Liberal Party who have 
said some things that perhaps have not been totally accurate in 
characterising where the Reform Party is coming from. I would 
like to read in exactly where we are coming from on the issue of 
sustainable development. This by the way has been in our blue 
book since 1991.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Reform Party supports the view that environmental considerations must 
carry equal weight with economic, social and technical considerations in the 
development of a project.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Reform Party supports the integration of environmental and economic 
objectives in management philosophy, structure, procedures, planning and all 
decision-making matters involving economic and environmental issues in which 
the federal government has constitutional jurisdiction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Reform Party supports the initiation of a public education program of 
environmentally conscious purchasing. The federal government and private 
sector should cause their purchasing departments to be environmentally 
conscious in all their purchasing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Reform Party supports the federal government in taking leadership in 
developing a new discipline integrating economics and the environment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This has been the position of the Reform Party. I cannot 
possibly imagine that the responsible members of the Reform 
Party would ever move from those very sustainable and 
responsible positions.
<P>
	However, there is a battle for the hearts and minds of people 
over the issue of responsible resource management and 
development and probably no place more strongly than in the 
province of British Columbia.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	This battle for the hearts and minds of citizens is waged by 
people who seem to get on to the extreme. We have to realize 
that, just as in society, people, human beings, have a finite life. 
For example, in British Columbia the flashpoint is trees. Trees 
have a finite life.
<P>
	What has to be decided is what we are going to do with the 
fibre. Are we going to let it fall to the ground in decay? Are we 
going to harvest it? Are we going to be handling it responsibly? 
There is this battle for the hearts and minds of people.
<P>
	I will tell a quick story. I was at a meeting attended by people 
from all over Canada in my constituency a few weeks ago. A 
prairie farmer came up to me. He was very proud of the fact that 
he was going out of his way to save all the forests in British 
Columbia. He was one of the largest contributors to one of the 
more extreme environmental groups that have single-handedly 
shut down logging operations, put loggers out of work, and 
created all sorts of havoc in situations where the companies 
within the last five years have turned around and managed their 
affairs and the affairs of the forests very responsibly. I suggested 
to him that maybe I should start to contribute to a fund that 
would advocate returning all the prairies to grasslands. How 
would he feel about that? Of course he became very incensed 
about it.
<P>
	One issue in the entire area of the environment is to get good, 
quality information out. I congratulate the minister and the 
committee chairman for their effort to this point. I look forward 
to the Reform Party supporting the initiative.

hospitals to disclose to emergency response employees, who 
provide emergency medical or rescue services to a patient, the

patient might have transmitted to them.

reactor projects except those for making isotopes for medical 
use, acknowledging that there is an appropriate use in terms of a

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFAGRICULTUREACT">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (on behalf of the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food)</B> moved that Bill C-49, an act to 
amend the Department of Agriculture Act and to amend or 
repeal certain other acts, be read the third time.
<P>
	He said: I am glad to address the House as Secretary of State 
for Agriculture and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans and to 
move the third reading of Bill C-49 entitled: An Act to amend 
the Department of Agriculture Act and to amend or repeal 
certain other Acts.
<P>
	Three weeks ago, at the start of this debate, the minister was 
telling the House that this bill was a reflection of the kinds of 
changes the Canadian agriculture and agri-food industry has 
undergone in recent years and can anticipate in future years. The 
proposed changes are not spectacular, but they are important for 
the two following reasons. First, they take into account the fact 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6915"> 6915 </A></B>
<P>
that agriculture as a commercial  activity is evolving and is now 
much more that mere growing of plants. Second they represent 
sound public management.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The agri-food element now added to the mandate of the 
department is important, because it reflects the interactions we 
must have with all our clients, from producing farmers to urban 
consumers. To prosper, the processing sector must rely on 
flourishing farms and, conversely, farmers need a healthy 
processing sector for their goods. We are mutually dependent 
for our daily bread.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Allow me to illustrate with a few examples. In 1993, $10.5 
billion worth of farm inputs such as seeds, machinery and 
fertilizers were transformed into farm production valued at 
$21.5 billion. In turn that farm production was further 
transformed into processed foods and beverage products worth 
$46 billion.
<P>
	In 1993 Canada exported $13.3 billion in agri-food products. 
That contributed to a surplus of some $3 billion to Canada's 
balance of trade.
<P>
	The recognition of these connections will be important as we 
plan for the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These amendments will contribute to better public 
management for the following reasons. The bill defines more 
clearly the department's responsibilities in research. The 
present legislation indirectly refers to research by mentioning 
experimental farm stations. The bill broadens this definition to 
include research in agriculture and its products specifically with 
respect to experimental farm stations. This is a wise 
clarification at a time when Canadian industry must compete on 
international markets dealing with food and non-food products, 
that is to say products resulting from research.
<P>
	More amendments. The Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food will have the authority to designate inspectors for 
the purpose of the Food and Drugs Act, a responsibility which is 
presently his under several other acts. Contrary to what the 
opposition has been implying, this amendment does not add to 
the inspection functions of the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food. Rather, it is an amendment necessary to allow the 
minister to carry out responsibilities under the Food and Drugs 
Act he inherited from the former Department of Consumer and 
Corporate Affairs.
<P>
	These amendments represent a sound management practice 
since they repeal three pieces of legislation which had become 
useless.
<P>
	Finally, under this new bill, the department will publish only 
one yearly summary of its expenses and programs in a single 
document, namely Part III of the Main Estimates, instead of 
doing it in several annual reports. This will save a lot of time and 
money.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With the world trading environment opening up with new 
ways of doing business emerging, it is an opportune time to 
review the mandate of one of the country's oldest departments.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Over the next few months the minister will be working with 
producers and industry to hammer out a shared, comprehensive 
vision about where we want agriculture and agri-food to be in 
the year 2000, 2005 and 2010 and how we plan to get there.
<P>
	The government is preparing to make some fundamental 
decisions about many longstanding and difficult issues in 
agriculture and agri-food. These decisions for the future will be 
part of a comprehensive plan for a modern, progressive industry.
<P>
	The minister has spent a good deal of his time during the past 
month or so talking about the need for a long term vision. The 
minister's view is clear. Industry should be growing. Industry 
should be competitive. Industry should be market oriented and, 
of course, it should be profitable.
<P>
	It should respond to the changing food and non-food needs of 
domestic and international customers. It should be less 
dependent on government support. It should contribute to the 
well-being of all Canadians and it should contribute to the 
quality of life in rural communities. Overall it should achieve 
farm financial security, environmental sustainability and a safe, 
high quality food supply.
<P>
	As a New Brunswicker I am of course very interested in the 
vibrant farming community and agri-food industry. My 
province may be small, but it has developed a very competitive 
food sector. McCain Foods Ltd., Cavendish Farms, Ganong, 
Moosehead, Baxter Foods and Dairytown Products are all New 
Brunswick firms that have found success beyond provincial 
borders. In my own riding of Beauséjour, although concentrated 
in the fishery, food processing is a major activity and farming is 
as well.
<P>
	I see in agriculture an agri-food industry that is leading the 
way in achieving growth, jobs and security, the three overriding 
themes of this government in the Atlantic region and across 
Canada. To achieve this, it is vitally important that everyone 
involved in this industry, from suppliers to producers to 
handlers and processors to consumers and governments, 
recognize that most of our issues cannot be dealt with in 
isolation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This bill, which groups agriculture and agri-food together 
under one roof, highlights how important it is nowadays for 
sectors, provinces and even continents to consult one another.
<P>
	We are all interconnected and interdependent. We must be 
aware of the possible impact of our aspirations and actions on 
the other links in the complex chain of stakeholders in the 
agricultural and agri-food sector. We need one another and we 
must adopt a concrete and firm team-work approach to solve our 
internal problems and compete against the rest of the world.
<P>
	The GATT and NAFTA agreements have resulted in freer 
trade and easier access to world markets. Every government on 
the planet is helping its exporters to make inroads abroad. We 
too must follow suit. During our first year in power, we have 
taken steps towards this end.
<P>
	Soon we will create a Canadian agri-food products marketing 
board which will be made up of people from the industry 
representing every sector of the agri-food business. This board 
will act as a forum to improve co-operation among industry 
players and to help them to be more competitive.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, in 
co-operation with the departments of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade, will create an international agri-food 
marketing branch. Through this single window, the industry will 
have access to federal foreign market development programs. 
We have already put in place a network of agri-food trade 
specialists in key locations like Seoul, Singapore, T'aipei, 
Mexico and Dusseldorf, and this network is growing.
<P>
	We are getting ready to take advantage of increasingly 
sophisticated national and international information highways. 
Our offices world-wide will be linked to the Info-Agro-Export 
network. This is an interactive, automated system providing 
personalized information on world markets. Canadian food 
industries invest a relatively small percentage of their sales in 
research and development, as compared to their US 
counterparts. They could do better in this area.
<P>
	A few months ago, the research branch undertook a 
pilot-project called Agri-Food Research and Development 
Cofinancing Project. In this project, the department and the 
industry will work together to carry out research and 
development, each contributing half the funds. Since the 
industry will be setting its own priorities, the relevancy of the 
research and development activities will be guaranteed. In 
addition, technology transfer will be facilitated because, with 
the industry sharing in the financing of the research activities, 
its support will be guaranteed in advance. We hope that this 
project, to which a budget of $2 million was allocated this year, 
will be a first step towards a substantial increase in agri-food 
research in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is only the beginning. The challenges we face are 
formidable. As I said earlier, in 1993 Canadian agri-food 
exports of $13.3 billion contributed a surplus of almost $3 
billion to Canada's balance of trade, almost a full one-third of 
Canada's total merchandise trade balance.
<P>
	However, it is worth noting that while there is a positive 
balance for primary products, there is a negative balance for 
processed products.
<P>
	Strong export growth has been registered in early 1994 with 
projections for the year moving beyond the $14 billion mark. 
Canada's overall share of the world agri-food market has 
declined since the early sixties. Our growth in agri-food exports 
is lagging behind the rest of the world. It will be a major push to 
meet the $20 billion export target by the year 2000 set last year 
by federal and provincial agriculture ministers.
<P>
	We are on track toward that target in 1994 with exports 
projected to reach $14 billion. What can we do in co-operation 
with industry to keep on track?
<P>
	These are some of the issues we need to address: From 1992 to 
1993 our agri-food export surplus declined. In fact, countries 
which used to buy Canadian commodities and products are now 
net exporters. We have higher processing costs and less private 
sector research than some of our competitors. Government 
income support payments exceed net farm income and are much 
higher than our investments in marketing or market 
development.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	There is little growth in our exports of these higher value 
products to countries other than the U.S, in particular, to Asian 
markets where demand is growing rapidly. We must therefore 
continue to address international access issues without 
forgetting there are unnecessary trade barriers here at home.
<P>
	Of course food safety has been and must continue to be a 
priority in and for Canada. Our reputation for safety and quality 
is vital to our domestic consumers and it is a critical advantage 
in the international marketplace. At the same time we need to 
ensure that it is an efficient system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The minister fully intends to continue playing an active role 
in promoting Canadian agri-food products abroad. Next month, 
the Prime Minister will head a trade mission to Asia, a region 
that the Governor General and the minister visited last spring. 
Next week, he will go to the international food fair in Paris, 
where he will participate in the presentation of international 
prizes to five Canadian companies that showed excellence in 
creating or marketing innovative food products. The Paris fair is 
the largest trade fair for food products in the world.

	The Canadian agri-food sector already enjoys some 
significant advantages such as internationally famous product 
competitiveness, high health and safety standards, and 
environmentally friendly agricultural practices.
<P>
	If we focus our activities on the markets, if we use our limited 
financial resources wisely, and if we keep in mind that the 
various elements of the agricultural and agri-food sector are 
interrelated, we will be able to preserve and even increase the 
level of success enjoyed by the whole sector.
<P>
	By proposing these amendments today, we recognize that, 
even in a changing world, the Canadian agricultural and 
agri-food sector can continue to play an important role at the 
international level.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-49 which we are debating on third reading this afternoon 
would amend the Department of Agriculture Act.
<P>
	Mainly, this bill adds the term ``agri-food'' to the 
department's name. Like the minister, his secretary of state said 
in his speech on second reading of this bill that it is important to 
change the title of the act.
<P>
	This emphasizes that Agriculture Canada's field of activity is 
not limited to helping farmers. Indeed, their economic future is 
closely tied to processing, distribution, marketing and of course 
research and development at all levels of these various products. 
It is essential to deal with the whole cycle of farm products.
<P>
	As agriculture critic for the Official Opposition, I can tell you 
that we in the Bloc Quebecois will not oppose this bill.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, as my colleague from Jonquière said on second 
reading of this bill, changing the department's name will in no 
way solve other thorny problems, including overlap with the 
provinces. What farmers, like pork producers in Quebec, want is 
not a change in the name of the Department of Agriculture. They 
do not want a change of deputy minister. What our pork 
producers in Quebec want is a government that works for them.
<P>
	For example, regarding pork exports in particular, what has 
the minister done to clear up the mystery surrounding the 
reproductive and respiratory syndrome in pigs? Nothing. What 
did the federal agriculture minister do to reassure the nine 
countries importing pork, namely Russia, Argentina, Venezuela, 
Australia, Uruguay, Panama, Korea, Denmark and South 
Africa? Nothing. What did he do to reassure Quebec's maple 
syrup producers? Nothing.
<P>
	Quebec's maple syrup producers do not care whether the 
department is called the Department of Agriculture or the 
Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food. What they want is 
that department to help them sell their product at a fair, 
reasonable and, above all, stable price. Last Sunday, I met a 
producer who told me that he had sold maple syrup, in bulk, for 
$1.62 a pound. Some people and friends told him that this price 
was too low and that he should wait until the end of the fall to 
sell the syrup produced in the spring.
<P>
	So, that person waited until last month and instead of getting 
$1.62 he only got $1.47, which is 15 cents less. That price does 
not even cover production costs. These costs keep increasing 
year after year, while the selling price of maple syrup is almost 
constantly getting lower. In fact, one can now buy maple syrup 
for much less than in 1980. This gives you an idea why Quebec 
producers do not care about the name of the agriculture 
department. What they want is results.
<P>
	What did the federal Department of Agriculture do to 
stabilize prices? Nothing. What budget did it allocate for 
research and development in the maple syrup industry? None. 
The result is accumulated surpluses in Quebec, where 90 per 
cent of all the maple syrup in the world is produced. I come from 
the region of Plessisville, the national capital of maple syrup; I 
know what I am talking about and I can tell you that we produce 
the best maple syrup in the world.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	We have surpluses and if the government would only take the 
trouble to release funds for research, we could surely find some 
new attractive outlets. Just the other day, the former Liberal 
Minister of Agriculture, Eugene Whelan-I can give you his 
name since he is not here-said: ``In the agriculture industry, $1 
invested in research later yields $7.'' I told Mr. Whelan: ``I am 
no businessman but I can count. If you can guarantee me a 
seven-fold return over seven, eight or ten years, I am willing to 
sell everything I own and to invest the money in your research 
and development company. I am ready to do it if I am to get a 
seven-fold return.''
<P>
	What has the Canadian Department of Agriculture done to 
ensure income security for Quebec farmers in supply-driven 
sectors such as milk, eggs and chicken? Not much. What has this 
famous department done to find more new outlets for dairy 
products, eggs and chicken? Not much. Surely, changing the 
name of the department will not make it any more efficient. We 
need to change our ways. We have to be willing to change our 
ways. The department is not doing anything. And the Bloc 
Quebecois will keep nagging at it until it decides to act, because 
the farming community is fed up with this stagnation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6918"> 6918 </A></B>
<P>
	What has Agriculture Canada done or what will it do in the 
short or medium term to support young farmers, to ease the 
transfer of family farms from one generation to the next? 
Nothing.
<P>
	My neighbour bought a hog farm not far from us. He went to 
the Farm Credit Corporation, the federal agency, to negotiate his 
loan the day after New Year's Day and was able to sign the 
contract the day after Canada Day. It took exactly six months for 
him to get the necessary financing. I should tell you that he 
nearly lost the opportunity to buy this farm. And, in buying it, he 
created a job for himself, for his brother and for another person.
<P>
	For Quebec's farmers, the Department of Agriculture seems 
rather sluggish and unwilling to help. So much so that last week, 
during our recess, whether my government colleagues like it or 
not, I toured my riding where nearly 20 per cent of my 
constituents depend directly or indirectly on agriculture for 
their livelihood and I submitted them to a test. I just love tests. I 
asked them: ``Do you know who Quebec's new Minister of 
Agriculture is?'' Eight out of ten said that it was Marcel Landry, 
a member from the Gaspé Peninsula, and some of them were 
even able to name his riding, Bonaventure. Then I asked them: 
``Could you tell me who the Minister of Agriculture in Ottawa 
is?'' I could not find anyone, Mr. Speaker, who was able to tell 
me the name of the Minister of Agriculture sitting right in front 
of me. Nobody could. Perhaps it is because he went too often to 
Quebec or spoke to Quebec producers in their own language, 
listened to their concerns, their needs, the solutions they had to 
propose, I do not know, but the fact is that they do not even know 
his name. Let us hope that he is better known in his own riding 
than he is in Quebec within the farming community of my 
riding.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	What did the government do to promote gobal marketplace 
access for ours producers? I listened carefully a few moments 
ago to the Secretary of State who said he was going to favour 
this, to develop that, to open our borders. Our farmers are fed up 
with talk. They want action.
<P>
	This afternoon, someone pointed out that next week would 
mark the first anniversary of the Liberals' coming to office, on 
October 25. Let me tell you that the Liberals are slapping 
themselves on the back for winning such a clear majority, 98 
seats out of 99 in Ontario, almost a perfect record. One hundred 
per cent in the Maritimes. There is one lady there who was 
elected-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Fifty per cent of the Tory caucus!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac, B.Q.):</B> Indeed, 50 per cent of the 
Tory caucus. But even there, one out of approximately twenty, 
and 98 out of 99 in Ontario. Fine. But in Quebec, the results were 
not so fantastic. Except for the English-speaking ridings and the 
Outaouais, they were elected in two predominantly 
French-speaking ridings, apart from the riding of 
Saint-Maurice which  elected the Prime Minister, have elected 
Liberals. Of course, no expense was spared in Saint-Maurice. 
And let us not forget that in 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, they won by a very 
narrow margin. These things must be pointed out.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I would like to put another question to the 
Liberal government: What has the Department of Agriculture 
done to reduce acid rain? As you know, acid rain affects the soil. 
Year after year, we check the pH balance and we find that the 
acidity level is too high. When flowers and strawberries grow in 
crop fields, that is bad news. Children like that, they can pick 
them. But farmers know very well it means that the pH level is 
too high and must be lowered, and that costs a lot of money. 
Lime is getting more and more expensive. The riding of 
Frontenac is getting acid rain and as we know, this riding and the 
Eastern Townships are where acid rain conditions are the worst 
in eastern Canada. This is not because there are industries in 
Frontenac because we have almost none, except for asbestos 
mines and a few small and medium-sized firms. The acid rain is 
not caused by industries in Montreal. A good part of it comes 
from Ontario but for the most part it comes from the American 
Midwest.
<P>
	What have my Liberal friends done to compensate farmers 
and help them eliminate the acid rain that seeps through the soil? 
Every year farmers must buy lime to lower the pH level in order 
to have decent crops. Year after year, farmers see their 
production costs rise and their gross income decrease.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	What has the Minister of Agriculture done and what does he 
intend to do for farmers with respect to the global warming 
problems? It is all very well to say that, over the last 50 years, 
the temperature has risen by 3.2 degrees centigrade. Some 
people are smiling at the thought of lower heating costs. But the 
problem is not so simple. Far from it.
<P>
	The Department of the Environment is not alone in having a 
role to play. The Department of Agriculture is also in for 
trouble. What has it done? Nothing. What has the Minister of 
Agriculture done to reach a reasonable and acceptable 
agreement between his department and the Department of the 
Environment? Nothing.
<P>
	To illustrate, one of my constituents called me last week. He 
was desperate. Let be tell you briefly what happened to him. 
Three or four years ago, a fire destroyed his farm, leaving only 
the foundations. People in my region are very supportive, you 
know, so we pulled together, we all contributed money 
according to our means and we organized a bee, as we often do in 
the Beauce area, and we rebuilt the barn following all the 
standards set by the Department of the Environment. We had 
obtained permits to build on the same spot.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6919"> 6919 </A></B>
<P>
	A river runs very close to the barn, perhaps 700 or 800 meters 
away, 1,000 meters at the most. In May, the farmer applied for 
a permit to the Department of the Environment to build a liquid 
manure tank. Believe it or not, last week, he was still waiting 
for his permit to dig a manure pit. Why? ``You are too close 
to the river''. After being granted a permit to build a $450,000 
barn four years ago, why is he being told today that a permit 
cannot be delivered because he is too close to the river and why 
do they make him wait for a permit to dig a manure pit?
<P>
	You see, too often, it seems as though, in some departments, 
the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. Merely 
changing a name will not help to improve foolish situations like 
this one.
<P>
	What has the Department of Agriculture done to improve 
rural services? I was about to say: ``Nothing.'' But another 
department has chosen to close down some post offices, arguing: 
``They are not profitable''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Not any more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac, B.Q.):</B> Not any more, you say? But 
they did. Stop kidding me, they did. They closed down some 
post offices.
<P>
	How about the road conditions. You could tell me: ``The 
province of Quebec has jurisdiction over this issue''. It is true, 
but what did you do four years ago? You cut transfers to the 
provinces. What did Mr. Ryan, the Minister of Municipal 
Affairs, do? He transferred $500 million of expenses to the 
municipalities. Municipal governments do not have the money, 
the technology nor the know-how to maintain the smaller 
municipal roads.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Can you imagine the 1,500 municipalities of Quebec each 
buying a grader, a salt-spreader, a small bulldozer and a 
backhoe. It does not make any sense!
<P>
	I know where the Minister of Finance is heading! Of course, it 
is not the Minister of Agriculture, but his good old buddy. The 
Minister of Finance will cut transfer payments to the provinces. 
He is paving the way for this announcement. He has promised 
not to increase taxes, but last night, on the news, he did say that 
they never promised such a thing. In the red book, there was a 
promise-but now they have discovered a gaping hole. They 
will not be able to fulfil their commitments; they will need more 
time.
<P>
	I can see where he is heading! He is going to transfer part of 
the federal deficit to provincial and municipal governments, 
again at the expense of rural Canada.
<P>
	I visited a small town whose 500 residents are concerned with 
gas supply. Standards for gas tanks are very strict and since it is 
too expensive and not cost-efficient to dig out old tanks and 
replace them by new ones, gas is not sold there any more. These 
people must drive 15 kilometres to buy gas. That is what it 
means to live in rural communities.
<P>
	As for government services, since regional offices are not 
cost-efficient, they are closed down. People will just have to go 
to the city. As it happens, MAPAQ services were closed in 
Disraeli. Granted, Ottawa had nothing to do with this but these 
services were closed and people must now go to Thetford. If you 
need to have an autopsy carried out on a dead animal, you can no 
longer go to Sherbrooke. You have to go instead to 
Saint-Georges de Beauce.
<P>
	These are small irritants people have to live with in rural 
areas. People are telling us it is not fun any more to live in the 
country, and that they want to move to the city to earn a living. 
Young farmers are fewer and fewer.
<P>
	What has the Liberal government done this past year? After 
all, it will be a year next week since it took power. What has it 
done to help young farmers? Nothing.
<P>
	One thing we must recognize is that this bill to change the 
name of the department includes amendments to update the real 
mission of Agriculture Canada. Therefore, this measure is part 
of a vast process of reorientation and redefinition which the 
government is going through with respect to this department's 
future.
<P>
	It is in that context that during the next year, the Committee 
on Agriculture and Agri-Food will try to redefine the future of 
agriculture in Canada. Let me tell you that this is a big challenge 
because considering the current economic and political 
conditions, one thing is sure, and that is that it is absolutely 
necessary to find a direction for the future of agriculture.
<P>
	I submit that our discussions on Canadian agriculture must be 
based on the following three factors: First, the willingness to 
respect the provinces' priorities. I tell you, Mr. secretary of 
state, that if the priorities of the provinces are not respected, you 
are sure to fail. Second, the recent trade deals signed by Canada, 
in particular GATT and NAFTA. And third, the ability to balance 
the interests of the various regions fairly. It is not without reason 
that Quebec's farmers have great difficulty naming the federal 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. There are hidden 
reasons and I know them.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	There is nothing wrong with amending the act governing the 
Department of Agriculture with a view to planning the direction 
that Canadian agriculture will take in the future. However, 
before redefining anything, it is important to ensure that the 
provinces' work plans are fully respected.
<P>
	In Quebec, this consultation and orientation process 
concerning the future of agriculture has already begun. 
Following Quebec's development model, the various players in 
the agricultural community have undertaken an extensive 
reflection effort. Let us just mention the <I>États généraux du 
monde rural</I> and the Trois-Rivières Summit which resulted in a 
series of real commitments. Quebec took the lead in laying down 
the principles on which that province's agricultural future will 
be built. It would be inconceivable that the federal government, 
the  Liberal government, would establish national standards that 
are inconsistent with its own priorities and development goals. 
There-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6920"> 6920 </A></B>
<P>
fore, it is essential that any initiatives undertaken reflect the 
priorities set by the provinces.
<P>
	Another problem that should be examined is the provisions in 
the free trade agreements affecting Canada. With market 
globalization, we recognize that all trade areas will have de 
redefine their orientations. The main goal is to allow farmers 
from Canada and Quebec to be able to compete internationally. 
Agriculture is an important and well established industry in 
Quebec as well as in Canada. It is essential that it remain so and 
that we take greater advantage of its export potential.
<P>
	It is all very nice to export, but it is even better to export 
processed products, commonly referred to as value-added 
products. We have just been told that value-added exports are 
stagnating whereas we are exporting wheat that we import later 
under a processed form, for instance as flour. Japan is doing that 
to us. The Japanese buy our wheat, refine it and then re-export it 
as flour. If Japanese are bright enough to mill our wheat and 
resell it to other countries as flour, I wonder why we could not do 
the same here at home. This would provide jobs to our people, 
and in so doing we would be promoting job creation and 
economic recovery. We need more than mere words, we need 
action. We have to get going.
<P>
	GATT and NAFTA herald deep changes in the workings of 
international trade. That is why Quebec and Canada must have a 
clear and specific agenda.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	It is important at this point to mention negotiations on durum 
wheat. My colleagues in the Reform Party dealt extensively with 
that in the agriculture and agri-food committee. Those 
negotiations should teach us a lesson. If our arguments are 
flawed, and if our action plan is defective and outdated, we will 
knuckle under to major league players like the United States.
<P>
	The government and the agriculture department had an ideal 
case with durum wheat. They had all they needed to play a good 
hand of poker, but they ended up sharing the pot. This does not 
bode well for the future. It is therefore becoming urgent that we 
plan our strategies and solve the difficult problem of Canadian 
trade deals. I ask the Minister of Agriculture: Which comes 
first, GATT or NAFTA? Let me say this once more. Which takes 
precedence?
<P>
	I do not want to hear anything like sometimes it is the GATT 
and sometimes it is the NAFTA and in some cases neither one 
because they are equal. Which one takes precedence? As long as 
this question remains unanswered, any assumptions on the 
markets for agricultural products will only be a smoke screen.
<P>
	When we talk about negotiations, the issue of regional 
disparities always comes up. Agriculture is one of the best 
examples of this dead end debate. The heart of the problem is 
that in a negotiation process, you must compromise in order to 
make gains you consider crucial. You cannot win it all, but you 
cannot lose it all either. How can we speak for the key sectors of 
all provinces with one single voice?
<P>
	Canada is a vast country and, as my colleague the hon. 
member for Richelieu said so very well, it is quite a job to 
govern a country. How could we speak for the key sectors of ten 
provinces and two territories with one single voice? The GATT 
negotiations are a striking example of the fact that one voice 
cannot speak for all regions of Canada. In Western Canada, the 
priority is grain exports; in the East, it is quota controlled 
productions.
<P>
	There is no denying that Canada's failure with regard to 
Article XI.2(c) of GATT is a good example of these opposite 
interests. In December, a few months after being elected 
member of the federal riding of Frontenac, I went incognito to a 
meeting organized by UPA in Saint-Georges-de-Beauce-I 
remind you that I am also a farmer. At that time, the GATT 
negotiations were going full steam. I wanted to find out the 
farmers' opinion on the matter. I walked in and, although I was 
recognized by a few people, I could sit in a corner with a few 
friends and listen to the chief economist of UPA. This man is a 
professor at Laval University and also the owner of a dairy farm 
in the Drummondville area. He explained very simply what the 
negotiations involved.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	I must say that the 500 producers present at the meeting were 
very concerned. The older farmers especially were worrying 
about their retirement, because their milk quotas represented 
their retirement savings. Clearly they worried about their future: 
``I invested in milk quotas. I was counting on the sale of this 
quota to retire''. They were unable to give him a satisfactory 
answer.
<P>
	Most farmers do have RRSPs. Today, during question period, 
the finance minister was asked once again if, in the next budget, 
he was going to tax RRSPs. His answer was neither yes nor no.
<P>
	If the Liberal government decides to tax RRSPs, I hope that 
the agriculture minister, totally unknown by Quebec farmers, 
will stand up and speak with one voice for all the farmers in 
Quebec and Canada. This is their pension fund. The government 
changes the rules at the very last minute. This is totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	In Quebec, we believe that the future of agriculture lies in 
shifting power to the regional decision-making units which are 
more sensitive to local realities. Unfortunately, shared 
jurisdiction in agriculture and the very diverse interests of the 
main agricultural areas in Canada leave very little room for 
initiative on the part of Quebec farmers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6921"> 6921 </A></B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes that sovereignty is the 
indispensable tool which will allow Quebec agriculture to fare 
better. I want to stress that bills like the one before us this 
afternoon are surely very important, but we should keep in mind 
that there are other urgent issues to deal with.
<P>
	Bill C-49 reflects the government's desire to make changes 
within the Department of Agriculture. I sincerely hope that it 
will meet the provinces' concerns and that the government will 
not take advantage of this to confuse further the issue of 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	To conclude, Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food and his secretary of state that it is 
not by changing a name that they will solve the agricultural 
problems in Quebec. It will take the will to change, and things 
have to change.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, it is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Mississauga West-Pearson International Airport; 
the hon. member for Calgary West-The Constitution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must admit when I first laid eyes on Bill C-49 I had no 
idea it would be so convoluted and complicated. Today we have 
heard two speeches that went into great detail and involvement 
in the department of agriculture. Certainly I had no reason to 
expect what we saw yesterday with the amendments in Bill 
C-49. There were voice votes and all matters of things I had not 
anticipated we would see in a bill that I originally thought was a 
very lackluster one containing absolutely nothing.
<P>
	The federal department of agriculture certainly needs more 
than just a name change. As laudable as Bill C-49 is, to reflect 
the reorganization of the department made in June 1993 we need 
to do much more to restore hope for the future in the agriculture 
industry. Today I would like to place before this House a 
proposal for reforming the entire jurisdictional areas of the 
agriculture industry.
<P>
	My proposal builds on statements and ideas put forward in 
this House by my colleagues on this side beginning last May. It 
also reflects the ideas that are being generated and talked about 
by many farmers, academics, and farm leaders right across this 
country. There is a real momentum building to radically alter 
and redesign how governments and industry function together in 
agriculture, in other natural resource sectors and the other many 
sectors of our society.
<P>
	This is an issue where people are way ahead of governments in 
their thinking, their ideas, and their proposals. It is time to lay 
those ideas and those proposals out on the table to look at them 
honestly and openly, to have the debate and discussion needed to 
move forward. I am not suggesting in any way that what I will 
share today will be the final word in the way things should 
ultimately be but, it is a starting point for discussion and 
dialogue.
<P>
	Our proposal builds on Reform's vision for reconfederating 
agriculture on the basis of a clearer division of responsibilities 
for both levels of government and for the industry. It also lays 
the foundation for a new visionary, comprehensive and cohesive 
Canadian agri-food policy.
<P>
	The new governance system proposed here calls for decisions 
to be made at the lowest most local level at which decisions can 
reasonably be made. The task of the larger unit is to assist or 
support the individual industry or more local government bodies 
in carrying out these tasks. This new governance entails a 
devolution of senior government responsibilities to the 
provincial and local levels and to the industry and the citizens 
themselves.
<P>
	Consequently we should have a leaner and more strategic 
senior level of government to deal with norms, standards, 
general directions and values over and beyond the managerial 
tasks that can be handled effectively at that level. The system 
would be more community owned with the federal government 
in a more catalytic role. It would call for local and provincial 
governments to minister to the public and to deliver the service 
best adapted to the diverse needs of different communities.
<P>
	Such devolution might entail a Canadian governance system 
of the year 2020 in which a small percentage of the agri-food 
civil service will be federal. It would be organized into small 
units concerned with longer term national policy in the areas of 
trade arrangements, financial support, and safety and health 
standards. Again, although there is an attempt in this proposal to 
more clearly delineate jurisdictional responsibilities in the 
agri-food sector, this does not mean an absolutely watertight 
allocation of tasks among players.
<P>
	This new system of governance tries to reconcile 
contradictory tendencies, for example the need to be global in 
outlook but local in application, to be small and big, to be 
centralized and decentralized, to be capable of generating both 
freedom and justice for all the players. This therefore must and 
will be an ongoing process of learning.
<P>

<B><A NAME="6922"> 6922 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	This proposal complements the current study being 
undertaken by the Liberal government in its effort to downsize 
government programs and departments. The Liberal study is 
based on six questions that each department asks itself.
<P>
	The questions are: Does the program or activity continue to 
serve the public interest? Is there a legitimate and necessary role 
for government in this program or activity? Is the current role of 
the federal government appropriate, or is the program a 
candidate for realignment with the provinces? What activities or 
programs could or should be transferred in whole or in part to 
the private or volunteer sector? If the program or activity 
continues, how can its efficiency be improved? Lastly, is the 
result and package of programs and activities affordable within 
the fiscal constraint and if not, what programs or activities 
would be abandoned?
<P>
	By thinking hard about these matters now we can help lead the 
way to a sound future for the agri-food industry. This proposal 
forms a theoretical basis for examining how agri-food programs 
currently in existence at both levels of government and in the 
industry could be reformed, removed or reassigned. As such, it 
is a prerequisite step for proposals we would make about federal 
budget cuts, savings and expenditures.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am afraid I will not be able to continue my 
speech as I cannot get a word out of my voice. I would just like to 
ask the Chair if I can take my leave right now.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Certainly. Would somebody wish to 
carry on and give the speech for the hon. member?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, if it is all right, I would just defer 
at this point in time.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does that mean nobody wishes to 
speak on behalf of the Reform Party at this point in the debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, maybe we could move on to the 
next speaker and that will be fine.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy to participate in the debate on third reading of Bill C-49, 
an act to establish the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food.
<P>
	Our farm community has many concerns today. I used to farm. 
I was not a full time farmer. I was a part time farmer but I 
certainly realized very shortly that farming is a lot of hard work 
and not a lot of money.
<P>
	I would like to deal with two concerns that our farm 
community has today and possibly address how our government 
is dealing with them. They deal with general financing and also 
with intergenerational transfers and farm properties.
<P>
	In my riding agriculture is a very significant enterprise where 
gross agricultural production is second only to General Motors. 
From Bowmanville to Orono to Port Perry and Uxbridge 
farming is a major way of life. It is a  community that has 
developed over 100 years of agricultural background. One thing 
I have noticed is that our farm community is aging. The average 
age of the Canadian farmer is about 54 years.
<P>
	I have spoken in this House and in committees about the need 
for small business to seek access to new forms of capital. 
Indeed, the industry committee which I sat on has just put out a 
report on access for growing small business. All too often we 
forget that farms are small businesses as well and they have 
significant problems in dealing with their banks. When I was 
farming every spare dollar I had went back into the farm, into 
equipment and new buildings. As a consequence, farmers have 
very little cash flow.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Over this last break I had the opportunity to talk with some of 
the local bank managers. Many of my constituents who are 
farmers have expressed the major concern that they are having a 
hard time dealing with their banking enterprises. These are not 
people who started farming overnight; they have had long term 
credit ratings with their banks, possibly 15 or 20 years. I talked 
to some of the managers. One of them commented that the banks 
no longer want to make evergreen loans. I had never heard that 
expression before so I asked him to explain. He told me that an 
evergreen loan is one the banks consider never gets repaid. I 
suppose the analogy is that evergreen trees never shed their 
needles; similarly the banks do not want to make loans they 
think will not be repaid.
<P>
	Quite frankly, I thought that to be rather preposterous. I can 
remember not too many years ago that the last thing a bank 
wanted to do was have its loans repaid, because obviously once 
forming a good credit relationship with a farming enterprise it 
went on for decades and decades. A relationship was formed 
with these people.
<P>
	Farmers need to finance numerous things on the farm. The 
two basic ones however are the financing of livestock inventory 
and the financing of next year's crops. Like any other small and 
medium sized business, as it grows it continually needs that 
degree of financing. By definition, it is not money that is paid 
off every year. In fact in a sense it becomes a fixed asset or 
liability of the farm. It becomes what we used to call a hard core 
loan, something that is there all the time; the farmer pays his 
interest on it and the banks make their profits on it and 
everybody is happy.
<P>
	We have discovered that the banks have changed their attitude 
to all kinds of sectors of small and medium sized businesses. 
Farmers are feeling this very hard pinch as well. The banks are 
saying they want their loans paid off. They have also become a 
little different; they are now brokers of money as opposed to 
bankers. That means every time someone wants to borrow 
money the banks will charge a fee. They charge all kinds of setup 
fees.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6923"> 6923 </A></B>
<P>
	Worse than that, I have clients in the farming business who 
have been with a bank for 15 or 20 years and they are now being 
asked to do all kinds of financial reporting. These are things 
the banks used to do internally and now they are telling the 
farmers to hire professionals to get all this work done. Of 
course the farmer is in a very precarious situation. He owes the 
bank $100,000. He may have a half million dollars worth of 
assets but he cannot pay the $100,000 back tomorrow without 
selling his cattle or getting rid of all his crops, or not planting 
next year's crops. In a sense the farmer is in a bad position so 
he has to comply.
<P>
	I am a chartered accountant and my own profession would 
love to deal with the extra business from that source. But the 
reality is and the question is, is it necessary? Is this a necessary 
expense to farmers? I suggest that along with some of the studies 
that have been done in the industry committee that we also focus 
on small business loans to farmers.
<P>
	I look at the banks and their pampered position in this country. 
There are special tax laws for banks. There are even laws that 
allow them to create money. What better operation can you have 
than that, when you can lend money that you do not even have? 
These are the rights of the banking sector. We have to look at 
those rights and privileges and reflect on what they are doing to 
our farm community.
<P>
	One of the recommendations made by the industry committee 
was the possibility of regional banking. People can think back to 
the early 1900s when there were such things as farmers banks. 
The local people could form their own banking enterprises so 
that the smart alec MBAs from Bay Street are not telling them 
whether or not they can buy that new combine or manure 
spreader, even though they may have more of an affinity for the 
latter than the former. These are some of the aspects of 
capitalizing small business. I think our government is very 
interested and very concerned about moving in the area of 
improving access to capital for farmers.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	I would like to deal with the aspect of retiring farmers. As I 
mentioned in my opening remarks the average Canadian farmer 
is 54 years old. One of the exemptions that they have under the 
Income Tax Act today is a $500,000 lifetime exemption for 
capital gains. I would like to discuss capital gains in relation to 
farming.
<P>
	The reality is that the capital gains tax, in spite of what the 
people in finance might tell us from time to time, generally 
speaking does not exist on the farm. In fact what it represents is 
inflation. In other words, what was the value of the farm in the 
1950s and what is the value of the farm today. If we go back and 
extrapolate the real value of money we discover the farmer in 
fact has not gained anything.
<P>
	He has however taken every spare cent he has and buried it in 
that farm property. That is his retirement income. He does not 
have a retirement savings plan.  Maybe some do, but very few 
just by the nature of the business itself.
<P>
	Finance from time to time talks about $2.2 million lost 
revenue from this deduction for farmers. The reality is that it is 
not lost money at all. It is money that does not exist. It is a tax on 
inflation.
<P>
	I draw that to the attention of the House. Presumably the 
finance minister will also feel similarly impressed that this is 
something we have to maintain in order to assist our farmers to 
make orderly transfers of their farm property to another 
generation or even to retire completely from farming.
<P>
	My second point is where Agriculture Canada and more 
specifically the Farm Credit Corporation have been active in 
assisting our farm community. Only recently Farm Credit 
Corporation introduced a new mortgage plan for farmers. Some 
of that will relate to farmers who are retiring and turning it over 
to their sons or daughters and some of it will involve farmers 
who are retiring from farming completely. Generally speaking 
this program will assist retiring farmers to transfer their 
properties to another generation.
<P>
	All too often farmers stay with the farm away beyond the time 
they should turn it over to another generation. Usually the 
problems are financial. Farming is hard physical work. 
Obviously at 54 we should have thought about retiring or 
becoming a manager long before this.
<P>
	Farm Credit Corporation has devised a mortgage instrument. 
It is a little complex but I will explain it briefly. If the farmer 
wants to sell his farm for say $100,000, his son will have to 
come up with 10 per cent of the proceeds, $10,000. Farm Credit 
Corporation will then advance $40,000, up to 40 per cent of the 
sale price to the retiring farmer. He will have $50,000 or half of 
the proceeds of the sale on the day of sale. The balance of the 
money is paid to the retiring farmer over a maximum five year 
period. It could be a shorter period than that.
<P>
	The other side of that is the retiring farmer only receives the 
interest on the $40,000. The new farmer, his son or daughter, 
will pay full mortgage payments. More and more money is being 
applied against the principal and only a small portion is paid 
toward the interest on the $40,000.
<P>
	This is another good idea that Farm Credit Corporation has 
which is going to assist the new farmer to build up equity in the 
farm and assists the retiring farmer to get his money out of the 
farm.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	What is the catch? Generally speaking the retiring farmer is 
not going to receive interest on as much as $50,000 over that 
short period of fiscal time. However, most farmers I know 
realize and in fact I have heard it mentioned many, many times 
in the farm community that if we charge over 10 per cent interest 
we are going to get the farm back.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6924"> 6924 </A></B>
<P>
	Most farmers are knowledgeable about the concept. They 
would be happy to reduce the amount of their real interest with 
the concept that they are going to get their cash flow out of the 
farm.
<P>
	This is one area where the Government of Canada through 
Agriculture Canada and the Farm Credit Corporation has added 
a very specific and useful instrument to assist the farm 
community to make intergenerational transfers.
<P>
	I conclude with the remark that these are some of the things 
we will have to take into account when dealing with our 
agricultural sectors, the problems they have with their banks, 
the fact that they must retain their $500,000 lifetime exemption. 
The Government of Canada has heard their concerns about 
intergenerational transfers and it is trying to do something very 
positive in assisting them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to what the hon. member for Durham 
had to say when he talked about financing for intergenerational 
transfers. I will comment very briefly and would appreciate the 
hon. member's comments as well.
<P>
	I know quite a few farmers who need a very substantial line of 
credit. The problem is, however, that the bank or credit union 
charges very high interest rates on this line of credit, because it 
does not pay for the farmer to mortgage his farm, his house or 
part of his property to get the loan.
<P>
	I am reminded of one of my friends who bought a quota in the 
spring, a very substantial quota worth $35 per kilo of butter fat, 
not produced, and then ran into some bad luck. He had to 
replace, and he had not budgeted for this, his baler, 
bale-catapult and four-wheel drive which all broke down at 
some point, and at the end of the haying season, he had to replace 
his mower-conditioner as well.
<P>
	This was money he had to spend right away. He could not 
afford to waste three weeks looking around for financing. He 
needed the money yesterday. He could not afford to wait, 
because every minute counts when the haying season is under 
way. So he increased his line of credit and had to pay much 
higher interest.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member for Durham could suggest that his 
government set up some form of assistance, so that farmers 
could have a line of credit based on their income as reported on 
the previous year's tax return. The interest would be paid largely 
by the Farm Credit Corporation or else the FCC, which he 
mentioned earlier, could provide financing in a few cases when 
farmers are hard pressed. As I said before, a farmer cannot 
afford to wait six months. The money would have to be available 
within a week.
<P>
	I would appreciate the comments of the hon. member for the 
Liberal Party.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	First, the Farm Credit Corporation does have a program of 
what is called variable rate mortgages. The reality is that Farm 
Credit usually takes its credit by way of a mortgage on fixed 
property so it is usually the mortgage on the farm.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	I think what the hon. member is really addressing is more of a 
demand for what we would call working capital. The reality is 
that there is a great void between our banking sector and how it 
operates and how farms operate. As the hon. member has 
mentioned, it is because there is always a degree of uncertainty 
on the farm. There is always the possibility that hailstones will 
wipe out your crop. There are countless problems.
<P>
	In my brief encounter with farming it seemed that the 
equipment would always break down on a Sunday when nothing 
was open. It goes on and on and on. These are the problems of 
farming.
<P>
	To address the specific intent of the question, I think it goes 
back to some of the things that I was saying. Our financial sector 
genuinely is not set up to really deal with farmers. The banking 
sector, which has always been a short term lender, is becoming 
more and more of a short term lender and wants its money back 
every year. It wants to be able to be flexible. It wants to be fluid. 
Farms are just the reverse of that. Farms are long term 
commitments to capital. In other words, there is a breakdown in 
the financial structure of that system.
<P>
	We have realized through the Industrial Development Bank 
that in the business sector there is this problem of obtaining long 
term capital. I think it is an apropos question to ask how we can 
reform the credit lending system for agriculture. Maybe this 
goes back to my first comment. Maybe we should think about 
things like schedule 3 banks, regional banks, a farm bank where 
farmers will understand as creditors of that bank and as lenders 
and depositors the problems of banking. I think that is possibly 
one way we could address that issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the member about the Farm Credit Corporation. 
The member referred to a particular program that the Farm 
Credit Corporation offers.
<P>
	I would like to ask whether the Farm Credit Corporation is 
needed any more. I have heard from managers, directors and 
members of the credit unions that they would like to fill the 
lending gap or would like to be lending the money that Farm 
Credit is lending now. They are asking if there really is a need 
for the Farm Credit Corporation and that is the first question I 
am asking you.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6925"> 6925 </A></B>
<P>
	The second question is along the same line. There is 
considerable money which should be available to farmers in any 
farming community. This money comes from retired farmers 
and in particular from within that community. Unfortunately 
what is happening now is retired farmers are concerned enough 
about the economy and the future of agriculture that they are 
investing the money mostly outside of the country now. This 
is as a direct result of the lack of resolve on the part of finance 
ministers for the past 10 to 20 years to eliminate the deficit and 
reinstate in Canada an air of confidence in the economy.
<P>
	My question to you is do you believe it might be a wiser move 
to get rid of Farm Credit and use that as part of the budget 
balancing funds and indeed make that money available through 
private investors by creating this more positive atmosphere?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I take it the member for Vegreville 
wants the Chair to answer the question. I am making the point. 
Please, members, when they say you please refer to the Chair 
and the third person as an hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Thank you very much for the question. I think 
the thrust of that question is whether there is still a need for a 
Farm Credit Corporation in this country. I am going to say yes, 
very much, in the affirmative. On some of the things that you are 
talking about concerning confidence in our economy, we are 
doing those things in a positive way as well.
<P>
	The problem with financing in agriculture is the thing that I 
talked about which is the necessity for long term capital. 
Generally speaking, our capital markets have not addressed that, 
even in the residential mortgage business today. I can remember 
when everybody had a five year mortgage. Today it is down to 
two years or three years and people are playing around with that. 
That is another problem with residential mortgages.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	The United States has 30-year mortgages. Canada cannot 
come up with anything better than a five-year mortgage. It 
seems to be a dilemma of our capital markets. They are not large 
enough and strong enough to be able to address that concern.
<P>
	We have a parallel situation in industry with the industrial 
development bank. In spite of what we might say-they have 
had a lot of management as all other banks have had-generally 
speaking the industrial development bank has been successful at 
addressing the issue of the need for long term capital. If private 
industry would come along and take that over we would all be 
very happy about it. The reality is that they are not prepared to 
take the risk.
<P>
	In answer to the member's specific question, we still need 
something like the Farm Credit Corporation. Perhaps we should 
open up its doors. The hon. member talked about farmers who 
are investing overseas. In my area we would not have such a 
luxury. Perhaps too many subsidies are being directed to the 
member's area so these people have that kind of luxury.
<P>
	They might invest in something like a farm credit 
corporation. That is a possibility. Perhaps we can cross the line 
and partially privatize it. Everybody wants to address the 
concerns of farmers for long term capital.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
speech will deal with Bill C-49, an Act to amend the Department 
of Agriculture Act.
<P>
	The Department of Agriculture being renamed the 
Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food is something that we 
can understand. It goes without saying that the economic future 
of the agricultural sector depends not only on government 
assistance but also on the development of processing, marketing 
and distribution. I have questions on the last point, distribution, 
and on overlap. Agri-food processors often talk about the 
difficulties they encounter in distributing their products.
<P>
	How can we develop the agri-food sector successfully 
without tackling the deficiencies of the distribution sector?
<P>
	Let us take the example of fine cheeses, which are difficult to 
distribute. This small market could be profitable but 
transportation and market placement costs are exorbitant. 
Intercompany consultation could be a solution. The current 
distribution monopoly hurts processors. We could look at the 
example of the Quebec consultation forum on exportation, 
where businesses worked together to transport food products to 
new markets. The government has a responsibility to provide 
more information on these markets. There is room for 
improvement on its part in this area.
<P>
	Such co-operation must be encouraged among wholesalers, 
who have a hard time competing with their American 
counterparts enjoying special access through U.S. subsidiaries 
established in some Canadian markets. These subsidiaries 
already have their own suppliers of cheaper U.S. products. That 
is why it is important for our wholesalers to work together to 
fight these American companies with a significant advantage.
<P>
	Producers do not enjoy a power relationship with the 
distribution sector so they must co-operate on transportation to 
become more competitive. Joint price setting by producers, 
processors and, of course, the government must not be done at 
the expense of producers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6926"> 6926 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to overlap, we see, once again, that the 
government did not take it into account in drafting a bill. The 
minister of agriculture did not say clearly that his bill would 
save Quebecers from paying twice for the same services. This 
happens all too often, unfortunately.
<P>
	As I already pointed out in a previous debate on agriculture in 
this House, industry and government in Quebec have worked 
together for a very long time to implement market-winning 
strategies. Meanwhile, the federal government sets up programs 
that conflict or overlap with provincial programs, thus wasting 
public funds.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	This also increases the debt, which surely displeases the 
Minister of Finance. When the government imposes its policies, 
does it realize that these do not always, and I would even say not 
often, fit in with the priorities and development approaches of 
those who work in the sector concerned?
<P>
	Let me remind you of some of the objectives which came out 
of the summit conference on rural Quebec in 1991: respect and 
promotion of regional and local values; co-operation among 
regional and local partners; diversification of the regional 
economic base; protection and regeneration of resources; a 
top-down shift of political power. From this conference arose 
the co-operative councils, which have proven their 
effectiveness. The federal government does not take these 
objectives into account at all in developing its programs.
<P>
	The government should stop trying to direct farming, but 
should consider farmers as business people when it supports 
regional entrepreneurship. It must distinguish agricultural 
development policies from regional development policies and 
encourage farmers themselves to realize the importance of 
environmental issues as a way to promote agriculture. Those are 
provisions we could have found in this bill.
<P>
	It is all very well to agree with the spirit of this bill, but 
nothing prevents us from seeing that there is still a big potential 
for overlap. Some activities that overlap? Here are some: The 
Canadian and Quebec governments both support farmers. They 
both promote the development of markets, research initiatives, 
as well as inspections of agricultural products.
<P>
	The fact that the Department of Agriculture will become the 
Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food confirms the greater 
responsibility of that department. It will no longer simply help 
producers, because the future of the agricultural sector is 
dependent on the processing, marketing and distribution of 
products. The minister made it clear in this House last month. 
Needless to say that the new department will have to help our 
producers become more competitive and self-sufficient in 
relation to foreign producers, and will also have to ensure the 
future of our agricultural sector.
<P>
	The bill provides that the minister will assume his 
responsibility in the field of research, which is essential. Indeed, 
with the opening of world markets, the department should play 
an active role in that regard.
<P>
	I will conclude by asking the minister to look at the issue of 
overlapping as well as the distribution problems experienced by 
processors, which I referred to earlier. Then, the new name of 
his department could be a meaningful change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a number of farmers in my 
riding, and as you know, farming is a major industry in Eastern 
Quebec, in the province as a whole and, of course in Canada.
<P>
	I was again very interested to hear the hon. member's 
comments, but I was surprised at this tendency to ignore what 
the Government of Canada does for a sector that is so important 
to Quebecers and especially to the people in the Gaspé.
<P>
	I had the privilege of working with the Union des producteurs 
agricoles du Québec in my riding, where we handed over a 
cheque of $84,000 to develop a small-fruit industry, as part of a 
program to provide new incentives for local farmers to grow 
new products for local, provincial and even international 
markets.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that the same people have 
already contacted me, and I am referring to representatives of 
the UPA and farm producers, especially in the dairy sector, to set 
up a program for regional processing of milk and cheese.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	These people came to see the Government of Canada. They 
came to see their federal member. However, they have yet to 
receive an answer, and people may have the impression that 
their member is the Minister responsible for Agriculture in the 
riding of Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine and has not 
bothered to respond.
<P>
	I took this project very seriously. I transmitted it to the 
Federal Office of Regional Development, because we want to 
show local people that the federal government is prepared to 
work with them, in partnership with farmers, the Government of 
Quebec and all the agencies concerned.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Lib.):</B> 
So I am very surprised, and I realize we are on questions and 
comments, but just the same, if we are talking about agriculture 
and research, including research on cattle, I repeat, the federal 
government has made a commitment to develop new 
technologies, but unfortunately, once again we hear the Bloc 
Quebecois setting themselves up as the defenders of the public 
service. I do not claim to defend the public service. I defend and 
promote the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6927"> 6927 </A></B>
<P>
interests of farmers in the Gaspé. And when I hear the  
opposition defending the public service, I have my doubts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry: </B>Mr. Speaker, it is a real pleasure to respond to 
my colleague opposite. There is one thing that I would like to 
tell him about. Let us look, if you will, at maple syrup, where we 
have an over-production. Look at what is going on. I will go 
further than that by telling exactly to the government what 
happened in Quebec and the rest of Canada. Let us talk about 
potatoes. In New Brunswick, farmers produce potatoes; they are 
also produced in Quebec, and the federal government was 
subsidizing the New Brunswick potato growers so that they 
could go on the Quebec market.
<P>
	Quebecers never got 5 cents to leave their area and go on the 
market, within their own province. So, I justify myself today; 
that is exactly what the federal government did, or give me some 
evidence to the contrary. The evidence that I have is that it has 
never been fair. I could also talk about many other issues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a well known fact, although 
the opposition seems to ignore it, that 48 per cent or the 
Canadian milk production comes from Quebec, and this is 
because of the quotas that were instituted by the federal 
government. It is thanks to the federal government which 
protected the Canadian market that Quebec could control 48 per 
cent of our milk production.
<P>
	Potato farmers were mentioned once again. Let us talk about 
potato farmers, let us talk about maple syrup. I know what I am 
talking about, I used to work for a company abroad which tried 
to open up this market for Quebec producers. It is totally false to 
say that the federal government did nothing. In my riding, UPA 
received $84,000, and you refuse to acknowledge that we paid 
more money to people who work in the field in order to diversify 
local production.
<P>
	I am disappointed by the denials of the opposition. Once 
again, we only hear the separatist rhetoric, that real Quebecers 
do not want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Mr. Speaker, in Quebec 24 per cent of the 
population works in the agricultural industry, but only 10 per 
cent of the agriculture budget goes to Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac, B.Q.):</B> Only 10 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Only 10 per cent. I want equity. Once my 
colleague opposite gives us equal treatment, we will talk.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that much 
remains to be done in agriculture. The hon. member must bear in 
mind however, that the federal government and several 
departments are working on finding ways to make programs 
more accessible to the Quebec producers. At any rate, I would 
like to point out to the hon. member that, as it happens, we are 
managing and considering programs in which producers are 
invited to get involved in biotechnology.
<P>
	As it happens, there is program in my riding to encourage 
farm producers, these men and women who work the land, to try 
and find ways to perhaps introduce such products making use of 
new technologies, for the betterment of Canadians health and 
well-being.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	Of course, the opposition is none too pleased to hear such 
things, but as far as the entrepreneurs are concerned, when we 
talk about bank loans, about the implications for example of the 
involvement of the Federal Office of Regional Development, of 
the Federal Business Development Bank, it is all a matter of 
balance. What matters for Quebec producers, in terms of 
balance, is to make sure that there is a Canadian market in the 
first place.
<P>
	I think that Quebec producers agree almost unanimously on 
the importance of the Canadian market and the need to maintain 
this market to compete with the United States.
<P>
	Funds were made available to farmers, scientists, research 
workers, unions, labour organizations. The federal government 
has a role to play. Let us not forget it and let me tell you that it is 
often welcome, contrary to what the hon. member opposite 
claims.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Mr. Speaker, we were talking about fairness. 
That is a point I wish to raise. I would like to debate the issue of 
fairness.
<P>
	In my riding in Quebec and elsewhere, we see young people 
who, after completing agricultural studies, want to start working 
on farms, or to buy family farms. There are many restrictions 
and requirements at the FCC. Young agricultural school 
graduates are not allowed to work in their field of study.
<P>
	We in Quebec know what we need. I have nothing against 
them defending the federal government but I want fairness. As I 
said earlier using the figures I quoted, we have 24 per cent of the 
population but only 10 per cent of the budget. I am not asking the 
impossible; we should simply get our fair share per capita, that 
is, 24 per cent.
<P>
	With respect to agriculture in Quebec, there is overlap and 
duplication. The party opposite has asked us to offer solutions. 
We do more than just criticize. The Official Opposition is not 
only to criticize but to propose solutions, as we saw this 
afternoon when we talked about tax shelters and family trusts. 
We indicated where cuts must be made and what is needed. We 
do more than just criticize. I am willing to criticize but also to 
offer solutions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to address this bill as a politician 
and also as a farmer. I appreciated the comments of the last two 
hon. members because as a farmer I am a little hard of hearing. 
Finally I could understand the debate and it made my day a little  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6928"> 6928 </A></B>
<P>
happier. I do not want to comment on the remarks. I do not know 
how valuable they were but I could understand them.
<P>
	When the bill was first proposed to the House we were briefed 
on it. I found it almost unbelievable that a new government 
would pick up on a suggestion that more or less was put to us by 
the previous government under Prime Minister Kim Campbell 
to reorganize this department. I felt that the bill would have at 
least contained some improvements to make the department 
more efficient or in some way give the Department of 
Agriculture a stronger voice in the House. I do not see anything 
of that. That is the point I would like to raise at this time.
<P>
	If I as a farmer had not reorganized every year before I put the 
crop in, if I had not updated my machinery or improved my seed 
varieties, I do not think I could have survived. If I had gone out 
and purchased a different machine in a different colour and it 
had no more performance and did not do the job any better, 
although I had just spent a bunch of money, my neighbours 
would have thought me a little queer and I am sure I would not 
have survived very long.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	The government reminds me a little of the first self-propelled 
combine I owned. It had all the parts. It looked like a beautiful 
machine. I was so proud of that machine I was just dreaming of 
the day I could take it into the fields. By coincidence that 
machine was a faded red colour.
<P>
	When I started up that machine there was noise. Boy, it really 
performed out in the yard. I said: ``If this machine works like 
this in the fields I will get my crops off in half the time''. 
However that is about where my joy ended.
<P>
	When I put the combine in the field and pulled into the swath 
there were noises; loose chains, loose bearings, walkers 
banging. The worst part was that the cylinder was out of balance.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It sounds like a Liberal combine.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Let me get to it. I am trying to get there. This 
was a tremendous experience. My hair stood on end. I was 
furious that I had been really duped into buying this machine. 
When that cylinder got some straw in it, it bounced around and 
almost left the ground. What were the results of this? I got very 
little work done all day.
<P>
	It reminds me of this Liberal government. I have heard noises. 
I have heard: ``Boy, we are going to do something for 
agriculture''. Boy, we have accomplished very little. That 
cylinder I see in front, which I call the cabinet for comparison, I 
hear one member say ``cut'', the other one says ``spend'' and the 
agriculture minister says: ``Hold it members. Let us not do too 
much. We could be accused of doing something''.
<P>
	I was a little enthused the other night when all of a sudden I 
saw one of the standing committee members on that side making 
amendments that would make this bill of some value. He tried to 
balance that cylinder so it would run a little smoother. What did 
the majority of the members do? They shot him down, 90 per 
cent. The Bloc agreed and the Reform agreed. Finally we had an 
amendment that would have made this bill of some value.
<P>
	What was the result of this? It was the same as with my 
combine. I got very little done. We have been two days on this 
bill and we still have not passed it.
<P>
	It amazes me that people do not realize that when you put in a 
long day and only get little done the fuel tank still gets emptied. 
That is all we have received out of this debate so far. We have an 
empty fuel tank and when that happens we are going to be in big 
trouble.
<P>
	Grain that should be in the bin is not in the bin. Grain that 
should be in the tank is mostly chaff and straw. It has no 
substance. Why do we pass bills like this when we should be 
talking about problems like provincial trade barriers and value 
added? Instead we are talking about building swimming pools 
and maybe adding a sports arena somewhere. We are forgetting 
that we may be hungry some day. Why are we even going 
through the motions here?
<P>
	I would like to compare the tremendous amount of effort we 
have put into this bill to my tremendously efficient combine that 
went so slow that when I turned the corner I was usually lost in 
the dust and I could not find the next swath. People around me 
wondered if there was a driver in the machine. I get the same 
impression from this Liberal government. When we as a 
standing committee make suggestions to the government they 
just get shot down or forgotten. Ask me why.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	When we told the agriculture minister to stop the 
back-tracking and change the car allocation system, what did 
the government do? This was recommended by every member 
on that standing committee. The government did nothing. Is the 
Liberal government running this by remote control? Are the 
railways, or the grain companies or the unions running the 
government? Who is running it? Sometimes I wonder.
<P>
	This bill reminds me of a lot of other bills. When we should 
have been addressing problems what did we do? We did the same 
thing as that old, faded out red combine did for me. It put the 
grain over the walkers back on to the ground and we are going to 
see it sprout and be ruined.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6929"> 6929 </A></B>
<P>
	That is what Parliament has done as far as agriculture is 
concerned. It makes me wonder when I see a bill which contains 
a clause like clause 6 which says that the agriculture minister 
can appoint any person to inspect any product, to control any 
act that he has anything to do with.
<P>
	I will tell members why that bothers me. The government 
previous to this government and the agriculture minister tied the 
hands of the customs and revenue people and allowed 
unlicensed grain into the country. He set at risk the quality of our 
wheat. He set at risk the reputation that farmers had built up of 
growing a superior quality of grain. Not that he listened to 
farmers, he listened to a few individuals or self-interest groups.
<P>
	This agriculture minister is going after illegal exports of 
grain, for which I must commend him, but why does he not 
prosecute those farmers under the wheat board act? Why does he 
have to enlist customs and revenue when they have nothing to do 
with it? Customs and revenue are there to prevent imports, not 
exports.
<P>
	This is the type of bill I will not support. That is why I think 
clause 6 should not be in the bill.
<P>
	I see I have taken my 10 minutes or so. I always like to end on 
a positive note. There is hope. One of these days we will have a 
green machine on that side. Then as farmers we will say when 
we see a green machine on the fields, it runs like a deer and we 
will see a government that runs slick, smooth and swift and we 
will get things done.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I say to the member for Lisgar-Marquette that I 
thought the story of the combine was absolutely fantastic. 
However he missed the essential point. He should have told us 
why the operator, to wit himself, was punishing through with 
that kind of machinery. Why would he not do what we are doing 
with this bill? The time comes to refurbish, to trade your 
equipment in or at least refurbish it instead of trying to punish it 
out in the field with very low production. That is what this bill is 
all about.
<P>
	The member for Lisgar-Marquette said something else and I 
wrote it down. I will probably get it framed. I want the House to 
realize, all my friends to realize-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Friends, which friends?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> I'm his friend.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Are they ready for this now? Even the member 
for York South-Weston will appreciate this one, I am sure. The 
gentleman from Lisgar-Marquette said something just now 
that has to be absolutely historical. He sits with the group that 
said: ``We are not politicians. We are going down there to get 
them politicians''. He started his speech today beautifully. I 
commend him as a politician and as a farmer. Welcome to the 
real world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> An honest politician.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Now the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster wants to qualify it. There is only one 
kind of politician. Either he is a politician or not a politician. He 
should stop apologizing for it.
<P>
	If we had the time-we certainly have the audience; there is 
no question about that-I would tell the House about agriculture 
in Newfoundland. There the combines do not break down. They 
are all green. Roadrunners, almost.
<P>
	You will be interested to know, Mr. Speaker, in the very short 
time I have at my disposal that in my riding alone we have quite 
a diversity of farm activity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Better green than 
red.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Only yesterday I was musing with my friend 
here about how times have changed. This crowd came to Ottawa 
not to heckle. They were going to be pipsqueak quiet all the 
time. It is beautiful; I am feeling more at home with this crowd. I 
might join this crowd.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> I say to my friend from Winnipeg South that 
the idea of being the first Reform cabinet minister of 
Newfoundland and having my own clothing allowance had its 
appeal, but I said no. I said it was a good opener but it was not 
enough. I asked what else they had. It is a question of time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> At least we do not put our helmet on backwards, 
Roger.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> At least we wear one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> That is his sin. That is the Prime Minister's 
sin, I say to the gentleman from Crowfoot. Is that a terrible sin? 
Is that a terrible gaff? Imagine, the member for Crowfoot has 
gone right to the nub of the issue. Some people, no matter how 
many helmets they put on or which way, would not protect 
anything important.
<P>
	We can change the name of the department and the sooner we 
do it the better.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question is the following one. Mr. 
Robichaud for Mr. Goodale, seconded by Mr. Chan, moved that 
Bill C-49, an act to establish the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In the din I 
did not hear the speaker ask for the next presenter this evening 
and I was prepared to give a presentation on Bill C-49.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6930"> 6930 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There was a mistake in the form and I 
read the wrong bill. I asked if the House was ready for the 
question and I do not think I heard anybody say no.
<P>
	Is the member indicating, and we always take a member's 
word on these matters, that he could not hear and generally 
wished to say that the House was not ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Yes, that is right, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair will always take a member's 
word on that. The hon. member for Vegreville.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that very much.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It seems to me the member has already 
spoken in this debate. Am I not correct?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
believe you had already called the question and that you had 
moved on to begin reading the question. In fact there was 
substantial agreement among the three major parties in the 
House that we would allow the debate to collapse at this point 
and have a vote on division on this question.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member who just rose might want to consult 
with his whip before he insists on making a speech at this 
particular time. The fact is that the question has been called and 
we should then go on with the vote.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does any other colleague wish to speak 
on this point of order, mostly including the whip or the acting 
whip of the Reform Party?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, Reform had agreed that if the 
debate did collapse on the bill we would have the vote on 
division. However I was informed that the member for 
Vegreville intended to speak and had prepared a speech.
<P>
	However in the din and the excitement between the speech of 
the hon. member for Lisgar-Marquette and the response of the 
member for Burin-St. George's I think he did not hear you, Mr. 
Speaker. Therefore, if the House would be agreeable, we would 
appreciate it if you would give him an opportunity to speak to 
Bill C-49.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, I made some preliminary 
comments during my speech. I had intended to make a speech on 
the issue but I was informed there was an undertaking among the 
parties that there had been enough debate on the issue and that it 
was the general wish of the House to conclude the debate. I 
co-operated by sitting down and yielding 15 minutes of my time 
to allow the vote to go forward.
<P>
	I think a deal is a deal. I appreciate the member for Vegreville 
would have liked to make some remarks on the matter. He 
should have told his whip or his House leader in due time so that 
could have been communicated as part of the deal. We had an 
arrangement here. We have observed the arrangement and in so 
doing I have forfeited my speaking time. I am sure there will be 
other opportunities for the member to participate in debate.
<P>
	I would suggest that technically the Speaker has already put 
the question anyway. I believe the Speaker has effectively called 
for the question and I think we should get on with it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> The agreement was whether or not we 
would call a recorded division.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> I submit that the question has been put. I also 
submit that we had an arrangement and we should in honour stay 
with that particular arrangement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, not with the intention of leading the 
Chair but rather making a suggestion to the Chair, it has been 
precedence in the past that in some cases where this has arisen 
the Speaker recognized the request by the hon. member who may 
not have had the opportunity to rise in his place at the moment 
that was important. What that led to was a request for unanimous 
consent of the House to proceed with the member's request to 
make the speech. Maybe that could be the compromise the Chair 
might want to reach on this particular occasion.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, for our part, we would be ready to 
vote. However, if I understand correctly, I believe that the 
government is adamant on having a vote today.
<P>
	On the other hand, the Reform Party wants one of its members 
to be allowed to speak. I think that we are running out of time. If 
we could have unanimous consent to prolong the debate in order 
to allow the Reform member to speak before proceeding with 
the vote, it would be satisfactory to all of us here. We all know 
that the vote will be taken on division. I believe that if there were 
unanimous consent to do so, everybody would be satisfied and 
this would put an end to these incessant points of order, clearing 
the way for a real debate on important matters.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> On the same point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If the member would take her seat for a 
moment, the time has expired for the debate unless there is 
unanimous consent from all the members not to see the clock for 
a few moments.
<P>
	It was the Chair's understanding that there was an agreement 
by all parties to end the debate a moment before 6.12 p.m. and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6931"> 6931 </A></B>
<P>
then the vote would be taken on division. On that understanding 
the Chair was not  listening for anybody saying that he or she 
was not prepared to go ahead.
<P>
	We are now in a very difficult position. I wonder if the deputy 
whip of the government party has something to propose.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am certainly prepared to accede 
to unanimous consent, provided the member for Vegreville 
displays the same courtesy to our agreement that the member for 
Burin-St. George's did and keeps his remarks equally brief. 
Otherwise we would have the position where one member was 
denied his speaking time. I hope he will respect that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> Is there unanimous consent to give 
the floor to the member for Végréville for a few minutes and 
then proceed with the vote?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
apologize to the House for causing all the problem this evening. 
It was lack of experience on my part. Indeed I will keep my 
comments very brief. I will just hit on the points I was going to 
elaborate on in some detail.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to amend the Department of 
Agriculture Act to give effect to the government reorganization 
initiated by the previous government. For the most part it is an 
administrative bill. Its basic intention is to streamline and 
clarify the mandate of the department. Streamlining is 
consistent with Reform thinking but when streamlining is done 
there has to be a positive outcome, or at least Reformers demand 
a positive outcome.
<P>
	In the case of the streamlining proposed in the bill there is 
only a very small efficiency added to the way the department 
operates. There is no indication at all of any cost saving, which 
is the other requirement of any streamlining. The bill falls far 
short of what any reorganizing bill should. It will not improve 
the efficiency of the department substantially and it will not cut 
the cost of operating the department.
<P>
	The specific clause of the bill I would like to address again 
briefly is clause 7 that deals with reporting to Parliament. The 
bill recommends and, if it passes, will cause the reporting to 
Parliament to be removed. These annual reports have been 
around for some time.
<P>
	Part III of the main estimates give more detail than the reports 
do in terms of how spending occurs within the department. The 
problem is that part III of the estimates do not give enough 
information to make the finances and spending of the 
department clear. I would propose this accounting to Parliament 
and this report to Parliament should remain in the bill so that 
there is proper accountability.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	This is exactly what the hon. member for Malpeque was 
suggesting in his amendment which was shot down by his 
colleagues.
<P>
	I am only asking for what the hon. member for Malpeque was 
suggesting in his amendment and nothing more. The 
parliamentary secretary to the minister when addressing this 
issue said: ``Why keep the annual reports because they were 
always late anyway and they had very little in them?''
<P>
	That does not sound like the way to handle a situation like 
this. If the annual reports were of very little value then the 
annual reports should be presented in a more timely fashion and 
with enough information to make them worth while.
<P>
	There are two different views on how to handle a situation like 
this. I believe that by making these annual reports timely and 
meaningful that together with the main estimates this House and 
the people of Canada, to whom we are responsible, would be 
able to understand whether the spending within the department 
is done in an efficient and acceptable way or not.
<P>
	The only other comment that I will make now in the extended 
time I was given is that the main estimates do not give enough 
information to make the spending by this department or any 
other department easy to understand. As evidence of this I would 
challenge any member opposite to a duel at high noon tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Lib.):</B> 
I will take you on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> I will ask questions about the department. I will 
ask questions and using part III of the estimates, the hon. 
member will answer the questions. I hope there will be a taker 
for this challenge, certainly the parliamentary secretary or the 
minister. I will be absolutely delighted if this challenge is 
accepted.
<P>
	I will end my remarks saying that we will not oppose this bill 
although there is very little in it for us to support.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-226, an act to amend the Criminal Code, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity this 
evening to speak to Bill C-226, which I initially introduced in 
the last Parliament and reintroduced in this Parliament on March 
17, 1994.
<P>
	I would like to thank the chairman of the subcommittee on 
Private Members' Business, the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River, and other members of the 
committee for selecting this bill as a votable item. As you know 
Mr. Speaker, it means this bill at some point will be put to a vote 
in this House, a free vote. Every member will be called upon to 
exercise his or her discretion in saying either yes or no to 
repealing section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I am convinced, given the discussions I have had with a great 
number of my colleagues, that this bill will in fact become law in 
the not too distant future. I am convinced as well because of the 
overwhelming public support for the removal of this section 
from the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Section 745 of the Criminal Code was introduced in 1976 
when Parliament was debating the abolition of capital 
punishment. At that time there were a series of compromises and 
deals struck, presumably in the backrooms of the precincts of 
Parliament, in order for capital punishment to be abolished.
<P>
	One of those deals or compromises was that in return for 
abolishing capital punishment there would be a law that said if 
you are convicted of first degree murder you have to serve a 
minimum of 25 years in prison before you become eligible for 
parole. That is not where our predecessors let it stand. A group 
of others decided that was cruel and unusual punishment. Before 
giving their support for abolishing capital punishment they 
argued that what became known as section 745, because they 
thought 25 years was too long, would give inmates faint hope 
that they could in effect apply for a reduction in the parole 
ineligibility period. They argued that it would be used very 
rarely, only in exceptional cases.
<P>
	Most Canadians are not aware that section 745 is in the 
Criminal Code of Canada. It says very simply if you commit 
first degree murder, it is the worst possible crime in the Criminal 
Code. This is cold blooded, calculated, premeditated murder. 
These are the people who plan a murder. They buy a gun or a 
knife. These are not pleasant crimes, not your run-of-the-mill 
armed robberies. These are vicious and cruel crimes that result 
in the victims being mutilated and raped before or after they are 
murdered. We are talking about the worst crime under the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Section 745 says if you are convicted of murdering somebody 
in those circumstances, if you kill one, two, three or more 
people-Clifford Olson raped and murdered 11 young children 
and he will be eligible under section 745-regardless of the 
number of people you murder or how you committed those 
murders, you can apply to have your parole ineligibility period 
reduced to 15 years.
<P>
	Most Canadians believe that the penalty for murder is life in 
prison. We all know that is bogus. Nobody serves life for 
murder, or at least not that I am aware of. Most Canadians think 
it is 25 years, but that is not the case. Right now the going rate 
which I refer to as the Walmart discount in the Criminal Code is 
you can get 40 per cent off that 25 years by applying under 
section 745. These applications just started a few years ago 
because of the time lag from 1976 and 15 years hence. As of May 
1994 there were 60 applications from convicted killers. 
Forty-three of those 60, or 72 per cent, were successful.
<P>
	That tells you very simply that the penalty for first degree 
murder in Canada is fast becoming 15 years. Is that what 
Canadians want? Is that a fair penalty? I suggest not. In my view 
it demeans the value of life. It is one of the reasons why 
Canadians have so little respect for our criminal justice system. 
It is an example of how the criminal justice system in this 
country is totally imbalanced. The rights of convicts, the rights 
of criminals are considered to be first and foremost. The rights 
of victims and their families are shunted aside.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	This Parliament now has an opportunity to create a more 
equitable balance in our criminal justice system. Section 745 
must be removed from the Criminal Code in order for Canadians 
to at least have some belief in the criminal justice system that it 
is serving the public and not serving convicted killers.
<P>
	I spoke of Clifford Olson who becomes eligible for parole on 
August 12, 1996. It was not that long ago. Most members in this 
House recall the hideous nature of Mr. Olson's crimes. I have 
here some comments from Mrs. Sharon Rosenfeldt, the mother 
of one of the Olson victims, Daryn Rosenfeldt, who was 
abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered by Clifford Olson. 
She says and I quote: ``I am so repulsed that our justice system 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6933"> 6933 </A></B>
<P>
can circumvent a court of law decision. A court of law sentenced 
the killer of my child to life in prison with no  eligibility for 25 
years. Who then is lying to me, my family and the public?''
<P>
	That is the mother of just one of the victims. I can say that in 
the next 12 to 15 years 600 of these applications will come 
forward. I have here the list of those who have committed first 
degree murder or those who have committed second degree 
murder and have been sentenced to a period of incarceration of 
more than 15 years. A good number of them have already been 
successful. Some of my colleagues might recognize some of 
these names.
<P>
	In Ontario for example, the province I am from, there is 
Gerald Chase, Darryl Dollan, William Frederick, Frederick 
Sweet, Norman Clairmont, Rolf Droste, Allan Kinsella whose 
case is coming up, and Federick Radike. These cases have all 
been successful. There are a good number of other cases across 
the country that have been successful.
<P>
	It would appear that a good number of these applications, 
unless Parliament acts decisively to repeal section 745, will be 
made by Olson. Do not let anyone kid you that it is impossible 
for Clifford Olson, the Canadian version of Charles Manson, to 
be released. All you have to look to is the Karla Homolka case 
here in Ontario. A woman who was privy and party to the murder 
of two innocent young women was sentenced to 12 years in 
prison. We are not even talking about first degree murder. She 
becomes eligible for full parole after serving only four years. 
She becomes eligible for day parole after serving only two 
years. Something is drastically wrong with our criminal justice 
system in this country.
<P>
	There is the case of a family of another victim, in this case a 
police officer in Saskatchewan. In 1978 a 39-year old RCMP 
officer by the name of Constable Thomas Brian King had 
completed his shift on duty and was returning home to his wife 
and three small children. There were two men who decided that 
they were going to bag and murder a cop. What they did was 
remove the licence plates from their vehicle. They were stopped 
by two police officers. They wanted to get stopped. The two 
police officers searched the car and levied a fine I suppose. 
Because there were two officers and only two of them they 
decided not to do anything to those two officers.
<P>
	They again removed the plates from their car. This time they 
were stopped by Constable King. They overcame Constable 
King, handcuffed him with his own handcuffs and then went 
around to boast about how they had bagged a cop. Because they 
could not find some of the friends they wanted to boast to, they 
took Constable King out and fired two shots into his skull. As he 
was dying, and I am reading from a synopsis of what occurred, 
according to the evidence in court, ``as the steaming warm blood 
was gushing on to the two soon to be convicted killers they 
delivered a few more final blows to the head of their victim and 
began dragging his body  off to the river to discard it''. That was 
in 1978, not a long time ago.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Mrs. King, her three young children and all the other relatives 
thought that these two individuals would serve a minimum of 25 
years in prison. Much to their horror, last year it was revealed to 
them that one of the killers was applying under section 745 to be 
released from prison or to have the parole ineligibility period 
reduced.
<P>
	The wife of Constable King writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This suddenly opened a terrible new chapter in the life of the King family for 
which we were not prepared. If a book were to be written, it would show enough 
pain in this one chapter to nauseate or embarrass them into reconsidering the way 
in which section 745 functions and how it is so counterproductive to the very lives 
of those whose Canada's judicial and correctional system is intended to serve.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I relate these two cases to you, Mr. Speaker. Here is another. 
Let me make it three, the Kaplinski family. In January 1978 a 
young night desk clerk at an inn in Barrie was robbed by two 
men. Mr. Kaplinski was the father of a very young child. He was 
a law-abiding citizen, working to support himself and his young 
family. The inn was robbed and several months later his 
decomposed body was found in a snowbank north of Barrie.
<P>
	They came in to rob the guy. They took the money and then 
drove him up north where they pumped a number of bullets into 
Mr. Kaplinski's skull and left him in a snowbank. This is what 
the sister, Joanne Kaplinski has to say about how section 745 has 
impacted on her family:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We the Kaplinski family received our own life sentence by being forced to 
look into the abyss of human cruelty and selfishness. However, last December 
1993, we were once again forced to revisit that abyss by the application of one 
of the murderers, Allan Kinsella, for early release under section 745. We 
thought that after the original trial the men responsible for taking Ken's life in 
such a cruel and brutal fashion were being made to pay for their actions by 
forfeiting at least 25 years of their lives under the conditions of incarceration. 
We simply could not believe that release after only serving 15 years was an 
option.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fifteen years is not adequate retribution or denunciation for the wanton 
destruction of human life and we fail to comprehend why the current legislation 
fails to include protection of the public as relevant criteria being only reflective 
of the rehabilitation principle of sentencing and ignoring-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She goes on about how this section is a miscarriage of justice.
<P>
	Those are just three cases. Six hundred others are coming up. 
Families that were victimized 15 or more years go will be 
revictimized as a result of this provision in the Criminal Code of 
Canada.
<P>
	It is an injustice. Section 745 ought to be repealed. I regret to 
say that it is not the official position of the Government of 
Canada today that it ought to be repealed. However I am pleased 
with the government's commitment to Private Members' Busi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6934"> 6934 </A></B>
<P>
ness and I am  pleased that this bill will have a free vote in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	As I said earlier, I am convinced that it will pass. Not only 
does section 745 demean the value of life and create a terrible 
imbalance in our criminal justice system, but it is costing 
Canadian taxpayers millions upon millions of dollars for these 
applications to come forward, an estimated $4 million a year 
over the next 15 years. I believe that is a low estimate, given the 
fact that those who will be applying will be using legal aid 
lawyers.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	This bill is supported by CAVEAT, the Victims of Violence, 
the Canadian Police Association and, I would submit, the 
overwhelming majority of Canadians. I cannot accept the views 
of the bleeding hearts. I suppose we will hear from some 
bleeding hearts here in the House who say that 25 years is cruel 
and unusual punishment.
<P>
	Those who argue that 15 years is a sufficient period of time for 
first degree murder, I suggest that they are sadly mistaken or 
misguided. There are those who will argue as well that those 
convicted of first degree murder will not reoffend.
<P>
	I present this statistic for consideration. Between 1975 and 
1986, there were 130 murders committed by people who were 
released on parole. Ninety of those were murder and 40 were 
manslaughter. Anyone who suggests that people who are 
released on parole are unlikely to reoffend and commit murder 
refer to these statistics which were put out by the Ministry of the 
Solicitor General.
<P>
	In closing, I urge my colleagues on all sides of the House to 
support the bill at second reading. In so doing, it will be referred 
to the justice committee which will then provide an opportunity 
for all Canadians, various interest groups and others to come 
forward and present their views.
<P>
	When the bill comes back to the House I hope and I expect it 
will be passed, resulting in a major correction of a flaw in the 
criminal justice system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
1976, the federal government amended the Criminal Code to 
make it consistent with its parole legislation and policy. It 
replaced the death sentence, which had just been abolished, by 
life sentence for murder.
<P>
	The Liberal philosophy, to which the hon. member for York 
South-Weston would never have subscribed, was inspired at 
the time by the general principles of humanism. In 1976, the 
criminal was looked upon first and foremost as a victim of 
society in general, of his social group in particular and even of 
himself. His crime was above all a social act. Irrespective of the 
harm done, criminals were treated like the casualties of the 
system, individuals who had to be saved even at the expense of 
common sense.
<P>
	We must now recognize that such noble principles overlooked 
certain realities. The system had come to consider all criminals, 
that it to say individuals convicted by a court for an offence 
against a criminal law, as the first victims of their actions. Our 
parole legislation is a product of this thinking.
<P>
	Once the judicial drama is over, you deal with the real stuff. 
As soon as the court has passed sentence, the correctional 
system takes charge of the individual behind closed doors, 
whether in an institution or in an in camera sitting of the parole 
board. Regardless of the work of the court, the correctional 
administration undertakes to assess the criminal and to establish 
how much of the sentence he or she will actually serve. And all 
of this under the cover of a big word: rehabilitation.
<P>
	The entire system is predicated on this concept that the public 
does not look upon favourably, an argument put forward by 
criminologists, these crime philosophers. In a word, the concept 
of rehabilitation is defined as an act of pity on the part of society 
towards criminals perceived no longer as individuals 
responsible for their faults but rather as victims of an 
ill-accepted social environment.
<P>
	Therefore, crime no longer being a real crime, the criminal is 
no longer a real criminal, and a quiet reintegration into society is 
supposed to serve the public interest.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	Even if the court feels that an individual is beyond 
redemption, Parole Board and correctional system officials will, 
in their ivory tower, decide to set that person free when he 
should have been kept in jail.
<P>
	Even if they admit that an individual is the sole responsible 
for his crime, these so-called rehabilitation experts firmly 
believe that criminals can be rehabilitated. It is time we set the 
record straight.
<P>
	Our criminal law is based on the responsibility of the 
individual. I realize that many hold less pragmatic views on the 
Canadian criminal law, but let me say to these philosophers that, 
in our judicial system, positive law still takes precedence over 
moods, which is certainly a good thing. Consequently, an 
individual who has committed a murder will be handed down the 
mandatory sentence provided by the law and by the law only. 
That is the reality.
<P>
	The general public thinks that murderers are jailed for at least 
25 years. This is what the law provides. However, along with our 
common law system, a new law full of subtleties, nuances and 
surprises has developed. The public does not know about it, 
because this new law is, more often than not, applied in an 
absolutely discretionary manner by crown agencies. There is 
now such a thing as correctional law.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6935"> 6935 </A></B>
<P>
	If I were cynical, I would define correctional law as the set 
of written or implicit rules which allow criminals to serve the 
shortest possible sentence in the best conditions. Behind its 
functional aspects, correctional law refers to the allocation, by 
public authorities, of maximum resources to reduce the 
sentences handed down by the courts.
<P>
	Our so-called correctional law is based on a set of laws and 
regulations more elaborate than our criminal law. We have 
developed a very sophisticated administrative legal system for 
the benefit of criminals.
<P>
	Criminals who go to jail enjoy the protection of a true charter 
of rights and freedoms for convicted offenders. In fact, the 
correctional system abides by the following principle: the 
sentence is now calculated based upon the duration of the total 
reduction. The prisoner knows about this.
<P>
	All the efforts made by the prisoner, often with the help of 
correctional officers, aim at changing the length of his sentence. 
It is a well-known fact that prisons are full of converted and 
born-again Christians just waiting for parole.
<P>
	A life sentence should mean imprisonment until the death of 
the inmate, but the average citizen has come to understand that, 
by some work of fiction, it now means a minimum of 25 years 
before parole. But this is where he is wrong. In fact, a life 
sentence can mean 25, 15 or 10 years depending upon the 
inmate's eligibility for parole. And this is when the average 
citizen lets you know that he has had enough.
<P>
	So, I understand how frustrated the hon. member for 
York-South-Weston feels, but I do not think that the minor 
amendment he is proposing will change anything in the system. I 
even think that striking down section 745 of the Criminal Code 
would do more harm than keeping it.
<P>
	What we find appalling in the parole system is the philosophy 
behind it, the costs and the aberrations, but mostly the discretion 
given to the sentencing courts, despite all the information it has 
about the crime and the criminal.
<P>
	Actually, the sentencing court is in the best position to 
evaluate the individual and the crimes he has been found guilty 
of. The sentence is contemporaneous with the offense.
<P>
	Do you really believe that, 15 years after the sentencing, a 
civil servant would be in a better position that the court to 
determine if the decision was justified? Or that because of 
changes in his personal outlook, the criminal no longer deserves 
the punishment imposed for acts for which he remains 
responsible, despite the passage of time? Tell that to the 
relatives of murder victims.
<P>
	In these circumstances, whether a sentence is exemplary is 
very much a matter of opinion. In the end, the principle of 
immutability and the usefulness of sentences as a deterrent 
should prevail over all the nebulous theories of liberal 
criminology.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Under its existing provisions, the Criminal Code provides for 
a judicial review mechanism, which seems appropriate.
<P>
	In every case where the inmate has served 15 years of his 
sentence after being found guilty of murder, he will have to 
convince a jury that he should be released before his ineligibility 
period expires. If he is not successful, he will have to serve his 
full sentence.
<P>
	Personally, I am more inclined to trust the judgment of six or a 
dozen ordinary citizens than that of a commissioner of the 
National Parole Board, whose qualifications are strictly based 
on his political past.
<P>
	The statistics I obtained from the Department of Justice tend 
to confirm my opinion and put into context the relatively small 
number of individuals concerned by section 745.
<P>
	Since the 1976 amendments and up to March 31, 1994, only 
128 inmates across Canada were able to apply for a judicial 
review under section 745. Only 71 actually applied, and 43 
requests were heard.
<P>
	Before looking at the conclusions, we should remember we 
are discussing the cases of about fifty people. We are looking at 
legislation that is aimed at a very small group. I want to make it 
very clear that I do not understand the relevance of the bill 
standing in the name of the hon. member for York 
South-Weston.
<P>
	As for the outcome of these hearings, I think we can conclude 
that the system works quite well. As a matter of fact, of the 43 
applications heard to date, and again I repeat that this number 
covers the 28 years since the introduction of section 745, 11 
were turned down, 13 have led to a partial reduction of the 
number of years of imprisonment without eligibility for parole 
and 19 have been successful.
<P>
	Thus it seems to me that the system is working relatively well. 
This is why I think we should end the discussion immediately 
since we are discussing situations so rare that I feel I am wasting 
my time.
<P>
	Must we remind the House that in case of murder the rule is 
still life imprisonment?
<P>
	Finally, section 745 allows any inmate guilty of a murder of 
either category, first or second degree murder, to apply for a 
reduction in the number of years of imprisonment without 
eligibility for parole. The bill proposes to abolish this section.
<P>
	In other words, imprisonment without any possibility of 
parole.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6936"> 6936 </A></B>
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that by abolishing section 745 we 
would be replacing a necessary evil by a mandatory evil. I 
nevertheless congratulate the hon. member for his initiative but 
I must tell him and the House that I will not support the bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the hon. member for York South-Weston for this bill. I 
stand in support of it.
<P>
	Today there is a cry across the land for the return to capital 
punishment. Why is this? It is clear this cry for the return of the 
death penalty is a recognition of the complete and utter failure of 
the bleeding heart approach to criminal justice. The philosophy 
underlying our present criminal law is not protecting members 
of society. Our sons and daughters are being assaulted and 
murdered without end.
<P>
	The most horrific sign of failure of this underlying mentality 
of our criminal law is the murderer who kills again after being 
paroled. I thank my hon. colleague from York South-Weston 
who told us today that 130 innocent people have been murdered 
by people who have been released on parole.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	These politicians who have set the agenda for the 
administration of Canada's justice system for the past 20 years 
are responsible for paroling into society criminals who have 
raped, assaulted and killed again. The custodians of our justice 
system, these very same people, want to continue to release 
these people into society. Section 745 of the Criminal Code is 
the most pathetic example of this bleeding heart mentality.
<P>
	In 1976 the death penalty for murderers was abolished. At that 
time the politicians assured us that society would be protected 
because murderers would be sentenced to life imprisonment and 
would have to serve a minimum of 25 years before release. 
However, the people of Canada were betrayed by these 
politicians.
<P>
	Bill C-84 which eliminated capital punishment contained a 
little known clause which allowed for the creation of section 745 
of the Criminal Code. Section 745 nullifies the term life 
imprisonment and grants murderers the right to apply for parole 
eligibility after serving only 15 years of their so-called life 
sentence.
<P>
	The bleeding hearts assured us that in exchange for the 
abolition of the death penalty, society would be protected by a 
25-year minimum sentence. Then they deliberately betrayed us. 
They provided the murderers with the right based in law to be 
released back into society after serving only 15 years.
<P>
	I ask these people who support section 745 and the early 
release of killers into society: What is a human life worth to 
them? I ask these politicians: What penalty should Larry 
Sheldon pay for having raped and murdered a little, innocent 
9-year old girl? What penalty should Norman Clairmont serve 
for brutally and savagely  murdering the 19-year old Potts girl? 
What penalty would the bleeding hearts have Charles Simard 
pay for murdering two innocent teenagers in the province of 
Quebec? I ask again: What is the value of an innocent life to 
these politicians?
<P>
	On April 28, 1994 Judge Demetrick of the Alberta provincial 
court declared that portions of the definition of firearm 
contained in the Criminal Code of Canada were so convoluted as 
to be legal fiction and twice removed from reality. It seems 
incredible that the Government of Canada is producing 
legislation that is being declared by our courts to be fictitious 
and twice removed from reality.
<P>
	The only explanation for this type of legislation is that the 
political thinking and reasoning that is producing this type of 
legislation is fictitious itself and is itself twice removed from 
reality. Can the families of victims murdered by criminals who 
have been released on parole come to any other conclusion than 
the politicians responsible for this are twice removed from 
reality and do not know what they are doing?
<P>
	When we look at our national debt, our Young Offenders Act, 
the horrendous mess our immigration policy is in and the 
betrayal of section 745 of the Criminal Code, is it any wonder 
that our courts are pointing out that some of this stuff is twice 
removed from reality. And by so doing are they not clearly 
implying that our politicians do not know what they are doing?
<P>
	The hon. member for York South-Weston has my support for 
this bill. I believe he has the support of the entire Reform caucus 
and I believe he also has the support of millions of Canadians 
who back in 1976 were conned into believing that the abolition 
of the death penalty was to be substituted for a term of life 
imprisonment with a minimum of 25 years.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I take offence 
to the term that Canadians were conned by a piece of legislation.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That is not a point of order as I suspect 
the member fully knows. The hon. member for Crowfoot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe as well the hon. member 
for York South-Weston may even have the support of many of 
his own colleagues in the Liberal caucus if they are allowed a 
true free vote on this private member's bill. I shall wait and see. 
I am sure millions of Canadians who are demanding the return of 
the death penalty are also waiting to see how many in this House 
consider the taking of the life of an innocent human being to be 
worth less than 25 years imprisonment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6937"> 6937 </A></B>
<P>
	We will see if the twice removed from reality mentality still 
controls the agenda in the Liberal caucus. If it does, then the 
only real hope for the people of Canada who want change to 
legislation like section 745 of the Criminal Code is to wait until 
the next federal election. They can then remove the Liberals 
from power as decisively as they removed the Tories from 
office in the election one year ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I owe it 
to my constituents and the Canadian Police Association, the 
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, CAVEAT, the 
families and friends of victims of violent crimes and tens of 
thousands of Canadians who signed petitions, to rise in the 
House today to speak to Bill C-226, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	During the last Parliament and through two years of work my 
own private member's Bill C-330 attempted to introduce 
similar changes to the Criminal Code that among other things 
would eliminate section 745. Consequently I applaud and 
second the member for York South-Weston's bill to 
reintroduce this initiative to the House of Commons for 
consideration. I thank him for that honour.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> The Reform Party should wait to hear my whole 
story before applauding.
<P>
	In our society first degree murder has always been considered 
to be one of the most heinous crimes punishable by law. Despite 
our unswerving disgust with the premeditated destruction of 
another life, our approach to punishing first degree murderers 
has changed somewhat over the years.
<P>
	With regard to convicted first degree murderers, the most 
significant change to take place in our criminal justice system 
occurred in 1976 when the members of this House passed Bill 
C-84. In addition to creating two new categories of murder, first 
and second degree, this bill also brought about two significant 
changes to our criminal justice system. It abolished the death 
penalty for Criminal Code offences such as first degree murder. 
It went even further by creating a legal loophole, section 745, 
that allows convicted first degree murderers to apply for early 
parole consideration after serving only 15 years of a so-called 
life sentence without parole for 25 years.
<P>
	The actions taken in this House by my predecessors 18 years 
ago constitute what I call a double compromise. This double 
compromise is unwarranted and unjust. It serves only to 
confuse, frustrate and even traumatise the many families and 
friends of murder victims throughout this country.
<P>
	When the death penalty was abolished 18 years ago, it was 
done in recognition of several key factors: one, the fact that 
capital punishment was not and is not an effective deterrent for 
heinous crimes such as first degree murder; two, the death/ 
penalty obviously eliminates the entire notion of rehabilitation 
of the convicted criminal; three, at the time this legislation was 
introduced,  Canada's social conscience was more conducive to 
sentencing a convicted first degree murderer to life 
imprisonment rather than authorizing state sanctioned murder; 
and four, the legal and administrative costs associated with 
successfully carrying out a death sentence are often, I say to the 
Reform Party, far greater than the costs of incarceration.
<P>
	Clearly the abolition of capital punishment represented the 
first compromise between two extremes. Those at one extreme 
were like our friends in the Reform Party who believe that all 
first degree murderers should be lined up and shot immediately. 
Those at the other extreme believed that we should simply 
rehabilitate first degree murderers for a few years instead of 
subjecting them to the harshness of long term imprisonment.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	As though that compromise were not enough, section 745 of 
the Criminal Code allowed for what I call a double compromise. 
Not only would first degree convicted murderers escape the 
death penalty, they would also have a chance to escape their 
so-called life sentence by applying for early parole 
consideration after serving only 15 years of a minimum 25-year 
sentence.
<P>
	I personally do not agree with the death penalty but let us be 
reasonable here. By compromising ourselves twice in this area 
we went too far. Whose interest does this second compromise 
really serve anyway? Does section 745 serve the interests of the 
victims who were brutally murdered in cold blood? Of course 
not. Does section 745 serve the interests of a society that is led to 
believe that it will be safe from first degree murderers for at 
least 25 years without parole? Of course not. Does section 745 
serve the interests of a criminal justice system that aspires to be 
balanced, fair and effective when dealing with first degree 
murderers? Certainly not.
<P>
	People across the country are asking us to say what we mean 
and mean what we say when a person is convicted of first degree 
murder. If an individual is convicted of first degree murder and 
sentenced to life in prison without parole for 25 years then that is 
what should happen. If people think that life in prison without 
parole for 25 years is inappropriate for the same reason then we 
should debate what the actual sentence should be, reach an 
agreement and codify it in our laws. We should stick to it until 
we have reason to change those laws.
<P>
	Under the current provisions of section 745, the sentence of 
life imprisonment is nothing but legal doubletalk. According to 
the statistics of the National Parole Board there are over 2,000 
offenders serving life sentences in the Canadian correctional 
system. Furthermore over the next 15 years-and this is for the 
Bloc's edification-655 inmates in federal prisons will be 
eligible for this judicial review courtesy of section 745.
<P>

<P>
	As of May this year there have been 60 judicial review 
applications made under section 745. A staggering 42 of them 
have been successful. That means 72 per cent of the convicted 
first degree murderers, first degree premeditated murderers 
who applied for early parole consideration, were successful 
under the current provisions of section 745 of the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	To anyone who is thinking that I am just a vindictive 
individual, I ask them to consider this: crown attorneys, our 
public defenders, tell me they are not prepared to handle the 
sheer volume of judicial review cases that are about to come 
crashing down upon them. Most crown attorneys have little or 
no experience with this type of judicial review, which makes me 
a little concerned with the proper administration of justice in the 
country.
<P>
	Canadians are fed up. They feel their rights are being 
superseded by the rights of the criminal. They feel that the 
scales of justice are no longer balanced but tipped in favour of 
the criminal and that there is not enough justice for the victim in 
society in general. For the benefit of those who may have 
forgotten why we need to seriously punish for heinous crimes, 
allow me to awaken their collective consciousness.
<P>
	Daniel Gingras was convicted of murder in 1978. Nine years 
later he was released from a maximum security prison on a day 
pass for his birthday. He escaped his police escort and later 
celebrated his birthday by brutally killing two women.
<P>
	Clifford Olson was convicted of murder in 1981. He still 
managed to murder 11 children while out on parole, one of 
whom was a young boy who was repeatedly raped for several 
hours before he was killed. He has the right under section 745 of 
the Criminal Code to be eligible for parole in less than a year.
<P>
	Joseph Fredericks was convicted of raping and sodomizing a 
little boy in 1984. While on parole this man raped and murdered 
an 11-year old boy.
<P>
	Patrick Mailloux was convicted of a long list of violent 
crimes. While on parole he walked into a corner store, pulled out 
a gun and murdered a 17-year old girl in cold blood.
<P>
	Charles Simard killed two teenagers in Quebec. He had his 
parole eligibility period reduced by a judicial review from 20 to 
15 years. Also there were Gilles Lavigne, Larry Sheldon and 
Serge Roberge.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps the most stirring case is that of Saul Betesh, Josef 
Woods and Ronald Kribs. In 1977 those three men lured a 
12-year old boy into their apartment and raped him for 12 hours 
before strangling the little boy to death. Betesh and Kribs were 
convicted of first degree murder and Woods was sentenced to 18 
years without parole, which means that he may be released as 
early as next year. All three prisoners are expected to seek 
judicial review courtesy of section 745.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, think about what that 12-hour torture was like 
for that little boy. Now think about what it would be like if he 
were your child.
<P>
	In my own riding of Hamilton West there was the case of John 
Rallo who brutally ended the lives of his wife, his five-year old 
daughter and his six-year old son, whose body has yet to be 
found. Indeed the list goes on and on.
<P>
	What exactly are the people of Canada saying to us about this 
issue? I have received a great deal of feedback from my 
constituents over the years that illustrates the public sentiment 
out there. I will give one before I conclude: ``Only a politician 
and/or a lawyer could come up with a penalty which turns out to 
be not life imprisonment for 25 years but 15 years, and our 
politicians wonder why people do not trust their words''.
<P>
	How much longer must Canadians live with the double 
compromise presented by section 745 of the Criminal Code? Let 
us say what we mean: truth in sentencing. Life without parole 
for 25 years should mean exactly that and section 745 of the 
Criminal Code must be eliminated.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-226 could have been called ``sink the 
shipwrecked'' or ``shoot the ambulance''. In actual fact, it 
comes to the same thing. In the society we live in, the light at the 
end of the tunnel is part of daily life, irrespective of the 
environment we are in.
<P>
	For example, we are currently going through an intense 
recession. The Minister of Finance knows it, he does not see the 
light at the end of the tunnel either. We have difficulties 
imagining that one day this country will come out of it, 
financially. Yet, we do not shoot the Minister of Finance. The 
system is not perfect, only human, and no human is perfect.
<P>
	To understand the consequences of Bill C-226, we have to put 
it back in its context. In 1961, murders fell into two categories: 
capital and non-capital. Before that, death was the only 
sentence available for convicted murderers, even though the 
governor could grant a stay of execution and intervene in favour 
of the sentenced.
<P>
	Those convicted of non-capital murder were sentenced to life 
in prison, but were eligible for parole after seven years. We are 
talking about 1961.
<P>
	After 1967, people sentenced to life in prison needed 
permission of the governor in council to be released. They had to 
serve at least ten years before becoming eligible for parole.
<P>
	In 1974, changes to the Criminal Code allowed judges to raise 
to 20 years maximum the period during which no parole could be 
granted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6939"> 6939 </A></B>
<P>
	As we can see, sentences are becoming more and more 
severe. In 1961, we were talking about seven years; in 1967, 
ten years; and in 1974, we could go to twenty years.
<P>
	On February 24, 1976, the Solicitor General introduced Bill 
C-84 which abolished the death penalty altogether. At the time 
that was a hot topic. We were wondering whether the death 
penalty should be kept on the books or abolished.
<P>
	It is still a very contentious issue today, so imagine what it 
was back in 1976.
<P>
	Bill C-84 offered a new variation, namely different categories 
of murders: first degree murder and second degree murder. 
People convicted of first degree murder had to serve 25 years 
before being eligible for parole, whereas people convicted of 
second degree murder had to serve between 10 and 20 years, 
depending on the sentencing judge's decision, before being 
eligible for parole.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, in 1961, seven years, in 1977, ten years, in 1974, 
maybe 20 years, and in 1976, maybe 25 years. Bill C-226 is 
aimed at removing any hope of parole for convicts serving a life 
sentence. Everybody agrees that society must be protected, but 
to what extent? As parliamentarians, do we have the right to pass 
laws regarding the probable behaviour of individuals 15 years 
from now?
<P>
	As it now stands, the law gives individuals the opportunity to 
be tried and sentenced to penalties proportionate to the 
seriousness of the crime which brought them to court. Bill 
C-226 claims that none of us believes that individuals who are 
sentenced today will be rehabilitated 15 years from now. It 
closes the door to hope. It shoots down rehabilitation. Do we 
have the right to do that?
<P>
	As parliamentarians, we have rights, but we also have the 
fundamental duty to do our best so that, when we leave, society 
is a bit better off than when we arrived. It is to meet this humble 
objective that we must strive. Statistics show that only 6 per cent 
of inmates on parole re-offend within six months of their 
release. That is to say that the present judicial process and parole 
system are not working too badly.
<P>
	The controversy surrounding the review process is fuelled by 
two often contradictory objectives. On one hand, there is the 
way we feel about crime and, on the other, the desire to 
rehabilitate offenders, which are often mutually exclusive. The 
initial reasons for a judicial review are always the same. At the 
time, in the years 1961, 1967, 1974, and 1976, reactionary views 
were predominant. There were debates on the death penalty and 
life imprisonment. Those were the buzz words, back then.
<P>
	The right wing is back, and we hear the same debate all over, 
especially with the emergence of victims' rights groups, the 
word victim being used in its widest sense. The emphasis is now 
placed on the problems those victims experience. We should 
realize that arguments for repealing section 745 of the Criminal 
Code are based on retaliation.
<P>
	Retaliation does not justify shattering one of the few hopes 
lifers have left. When you are in prison, the light at the end of the 
tunnel is essential. I do not mean to put up an all out defence for 
prisoners, but we must recognize that those people are not 
animals. They are human beings, and we have no moral right to 
utterly deprive them of hope.
<P>
	Let us not forget that judicial review after 15 years does not 
mean lifers will automatically be released from prison. It is just 
another step a prisoner has to take before parole is granted. 
People who sit on parole boards are there to determine whether 
individuals can be safely released in our society. If not, parole 
boards have every right to keep them behind bars till the end of 
their sentence.
<P>
	I am puzzled by Bill C-226. First of all because I honestly do 
not think victims will be better protected. Nor do I believe that 
sentencing will be improved by this bill. Moreover, we have to 
wonder if Bill C-226 really serves any purpose since there are 
already, within the parole system, people whose job it is to be 
sure that the individuals they choose to release will make a 
positive contribution to society. Obviously, it is important to 
protect society, but as members of this society we have a role to 
play. When we see an ambulance going down the street, we do 
not fire at it. We give it the right of way without even asking who 
is inside.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	For a person who has received a life sentence, the parole 
system is the light at the end of the tunnel. I do not think that the 
victims' relatives will suffer after 20 years. They certainly have 
suffered and everybody deplores that fact. However, we do not 
have to always give in to the people who shout the loudest.
<P>
	A politician must be able to stand up and defend his views. My 
view is that Bill C-226 serves no useful purpose.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy that the debate on these 
bills under review this evening gives me the opportunity to 
dispel certain myths concerning the Criminal Code provision 
which Bill C-226 would repeal and that is the section providing 
for a judicial review of the parole ineligibility period.
<P>
	This provision was adopted in 1976. The legislation adopted 
at that time stated that people convicted of first degree murder 
or high treason were to wait for at least 25 years before being 
allowed to apply for parole and for those convicted of second 
degree murder, the jury would set a 10- to 25-year parole 
ineligibility period.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6940"> 6940 </A></B>
<P>
	But Parliament was wise enough to determine that in both 
cases, once the convict had served 15 years of his sentence, a 
jury could be formed and the parole ineligibility period could 
be reviewed and revised if appropriate.
<P>
	This provision was based on the principles of justice and 
rehabilitation, two principles which are still very sound today. 
Parliament added that section to the legislation because it 
believed individuals could improve.
<P>
	They considered then, and the argument is still valid today, 
that the possibility for the parole ineligibility period to be 
reviewed could be an incentive for the convicts to make special 
rehabilitation efforts.
<P>
	I should remind you that this provision was linked to the 
abolition of capital punishment which occurred in several 
countries where authorities instituted life imprisonment without 
any eligibility for parole as a compromise to please both those in 
favour and those against the death sentence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	No doubt the creation of section 745 was unique in the 
criminal law of the country. However the section was included 
in the first reading of the original bill in 1976. It was fully 
reviewed and discussed by the justice and legal affairs 
committee at that time before it was finally debated and passed 
by the members of Parliament.
<P>
	In fact, rather than the original proposal to have three judges 
to hear a case, Parliament amended the bill so that a jury would 
decide the case instead. This was done specifically to increase 
public participation in the process.
<P>
	Clearly there was debate and communication in the public 
arena. Efforts were made to make the resulting judicial review 
hearings as public as possible.
<P>
	Let me review briefly how the provision works. I think the 
Reform Party-

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PEARSONINTERNATIONALAIRPORT">PEARSON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Pearson International Airport is a vital asset to the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
<B>(1920 ) </B>
<P>
	I recently chaired a Toronto Liberal caucus task force 
investigating the immediate needs for runway construction at 
Pearson. The task force reviewed the available documents and 
held two public meetings. There were several issues considered: 
the immediate completion of a second north-south runway; the 
construction of two additional east-west runways and the 
impact these runways would have on the travelling public, the 
economy and the surrounding communities.
<P>
	Currently air traffic at Pearson is handled primarily on two 
east-west runways. Five per cent of the time, about 70 times per 
year, severe cross winds force planes to change to the one 
available north-south runway for periods of up to five hours, a 
total of 350 hours per year. Capacity is cut in half, disrupting 
airline schedules, forcing delays and re-routing, allowing 
potentially dangerous landings to occur on the east-west 
runways at higher cross wind limits than are allowed at U.S. 
airports.
<P>
	Does Pearson need a second north-south runway at this time? 
The Minister of Transport recently announced a second 
north-south runway will be tendered for completion. This 
construction will not increase the overall capacity at Pearson, 
only the efficiency and the safety.
<P>
	An environmental assessment report completed in 1992 
recognized that a second north-south runway was needed to 
eliminate the current imbalance of two east-west with only one 
north-south. They wanted a safety and operational feasibility of 
a shorter 4,500 north-south runway investigated. This short 
runway would have had less noise impact on the local residents.
<P>
	Two studies were undertaken by Transport Canada and the 
Canadian Airline Pilots Association in 1992 and 1993. They 
found that 85 per cent of the aircraft that use Pearson could not 
land on a 4,500 foot runway. Arriving aircraft would have to be 
kept at high altitudes of 10,000 feet to facilitate sorting and 
sequencing. These restrictions would increase the probability of 
mid-air collision. The operational separations imposed for 
safety reasons might even result in less capacity than exists now.
<P>
	Both reports concluded that safety concerns would have to be 
given priority over all other considerations. They recommended 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6941"> 6941 </A></B>
<P>
against the short runway. The caucus committee concurred that a 
full length north-south runway is needed at this time. It further 
recommended  the new north-south runway should be used for 
landings only during severe cross wind conditions only.
<P>
	Does Pearson need two more east-west runways at this time? 
The Air Transport Association of Canada has provided figures 
which indicate aircraft movements are down 12 per cent from 
their pre-recession high. Currently Pearson processes 20.5 
million passengers per year, a volume easily handled by the two 
existing east-west runways.
<P>
	Travel replacing technology such as faxes and tele and video 
conferencing are being increasingly utilized with fewer people 
travelling for business purposes.
<P>
	Our committee concluded that any additional runways should 
not be contemplated until the threshold of passengers exceeds 
30 million per year. This will not take place before the proposed 
Canadian airport authority takes over the management of 
Pearson.
<P>
	I endorse the minister's decision to complete the second 
north-south runway for economic and safety reasons. I applaud 
the innovative plan to turn the operation of airports over to local 
airport authorities so they can be financed and improved in a 
self-sufficient, cost-effective, businesslike manner.
<P>
	I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport 
to expand on the concept of the Canadian airport authority for 
the residents of Mississauga. What assurance do we have that 
this will be the most efficient and economical solution to 
Pearson's current problems?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of 
Transport I would like to respond to the question from my hon. 
colleague, the member for Mississauga West.
<P>
	Let me first assure my colleague that she can reassure the 
residents of Mississauga that when the new north-south runway 
is completed at Pearson it will be used primarily for landings. In 
recognition of the concerns of the residents living near the 
airport about noise I want to reiterate that the new runway will 
only be used 5 per cent of the time when severe cross winds 
make landings on the two east-west runways unsafe.
<P>
	The only time the new north-south runway would be used for 
take-offs would be on those extremely rare occasions when, 
combined with adverse weather conditions, the existing 
north-south runway is unavailable due to emergency or repairs. 
On these occasions only take-offs toward the north following 
the established departure path of the existing north-south 
runway would be permitted.
<P>
	The minister wants to assure the member and her constituents 
that absolutely no decision will be taken on the matter of 
additional east-west runways until the Canadian airport 
authority is in place and functioning at Pearson International 
Airport. In any event it is anticipated that the additional 
east-west runways would  not be constructed until traffic 
warrants it. This is not expected to happen until the turn of the 
century.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	One of our colleagues from the Reform Party has said that we 
do not intend to move on the new Canadian airport authorities 
for Pearson until 1998. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<P>
	As the minister has made very clear we will be moving to 
establish CAAs at many airports as soon as the communities 
involved identify their representatives and pass the necessary 
local resolutions which is indeed the case for Pearson. There is 
no question about waiting until 1998.
<P>
	The fact is that the local municipalities have named their 
representatives and the minister has indicated that we will 
proceed with all that needs to be done at Pearson. The only 
logical option though is to work with these representatives in an 
advisory capacity for the time being.
<P>
	We will move to activate a Canadian airport authority which 
we believe is in the best interests of the Canadian public as soon 
as the Senate puts the interest of the taxpayer ahead of its 
rhetoric.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THECONSTITUTION">THE CONSTITUTION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Monday, October 17 I put two sets of questions to the Minister 
for Intergovernmental Affairs. The minister effectively declined 
to answer those questions at the time saying they were 
hypothetical. However, the exchange after question period 
between the leader of the Reform Party and the Speaker would 
indicate the questions as put were of course not hypothetical and 
were in order. The questions were in order because they dealt not 
with the government's political plans but with its competence, 
jurisdiction, and role in the matters of constitutional law and the 
possible separation of Quebec.
<P>
	The first question was formed from a quotation from the 
Prime Minister of Canada. He said a Prime Minister of Canada 
has a constitution he must respect and there is no mechanism in 
the Constitution permitting the separation of any part of 
Canadian territory.
<P>
	While that is very narrowly true in fact the Constitution does 
have provisions relating to amendment of various things that 
would be required in the event of the separation of a province. 
These are things as elementary as the transfer of the legitimate 
powers of the federal government to a province which would 
generally speaking require the consent of two-thirds of the 
provinces representing 50 per cent of the population. In other 
cases where it actually involves institutional change it would 
require unanimous consent. These clauses are laid out in part 5, 
sections 38 through 49 of the Constitution Act, 1982.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6942"> 6942 </A></B>
<P>
	My question to the government was merely that it affirm that 
it is the position of the Government of Canada that the 
constitutional status of a province could only be changed 
legally and would be done through this amending formula. This 
would of course not apply simply with a separation scenario 
but to any constitutional change. I would maintain that it is the 
duty of the federal government which purports that national 
unity is its highest priority to recognize that it does have an 
obligation to uphold the Constitution.
<P>
	I would also note that politically there would be considerable 
advantage for it to make clear to the people of Quebec that when 
they are being told that separation can be achieved unilaterally 
that this is legally untrue. In fact, it would also be political 
untrue, politically unfeasible to pursue in that manner.
<P>
	We would also of course be interested to know what the 
position would be of the leader of the official opposition on such 
an illegal position as unilateral separation. However I do not 
expect the parliamentary secretary to comment on that 
particular question.
<P>
	My second question concerned an article recently written in 
<I>Canadian Parliamentary Review</I>, Autumn 1994, by the hon. 
member for Vancouver Quadra. He held that today the federal 
government retains full constitutional options to allow or not to 
allow a referendum vote, to control the content and wording of 
any referendum question, to control the actual timing of any 
vote, and to launch its own pre-emptive nationwide referendum 
legally superseding any Quebec vote.
<P>
	As you well know, the opinions of the member for Vancouver 
Quadra are of some interest not simply because he wrote the 
article but because he is a noted constitutional expert and also a 
member of the governing caucus. While I do not subscribe 
necessarily to all his constitutional views I would certainly 
think that the government would take note of them and would be 
prepared to comment on whether it believes these are in fact the 
constitutional powers of the federal government.
<P>
	I would note that the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
himself has previously commented that the federal government 
should consider the option of a national referendum. I believe 
this is an option our own party would suggest should be 
considered, not necessarily acted upon but certainly considered 
given that ultimately the unity of the country and its future 
constitutional status is the business of all Canadians.
<P>
	I put that question and hope to receive more enlightenment 
than I did on Monday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank the hon. member for his question. It is quite an extended 
question and is obviously a subject of considerable debate.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs for whom I am 
answering believes that the Constitution Acts do not provide any 
rules or procedures for secession of one of the provinces.
<P>
	The argument which has been presented by the hon. member 
for Calgary West that the amending formula can be stretched to 
include the secession of a province is a point of view. However 
as the hon. member suggests there are many points of view on 
constitutional questions. Colleagues of mine have expressed 
constitutional views. Members of the opposition have as well.
<P>
	It is very clear that when the time comes there is international 
precedent and their is domestic precedent in this regard. 
However, what I think the record shows internationally is that in 
cases of secession what is likely to occur is so much confusion 
and trouble that it would be impossible to proceed in an orderly 
and fashionable manner and indicate what goes before.
<P>
	It seems to us that the premise of the member's question is 
that we should say: You cannot leave unless we let you go. That 
does not seem to be a very helpful approach at this time. Our 
approach is to argue to Quebecers that the case for secession 
cannot be sustained. It involves costs and risks that are 
unnecessary and that this country is too precious to be 
destroyed.
<P>
	We want the question to be put fairly and quickly. We agree 
with the leader of the Reform Party who has expressed that point 
of view. I do not intend to talk on behalf of the Leader of the 
Opposition, but I believe he said this morning in Toronto that he 
is a democrat and we are all democrats. Certainly we in this 
Chamber are all democrats and a democratic decision is 
appropriate and will occur we hope promptly and with a clear 
question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5), a 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until
