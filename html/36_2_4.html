<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 14 consideration of the motion 
for an address to Her Excellency the Governor General in reply to 
her speech at the opening of the session and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, continuing 
the debate today I would like to talk about health.  Our health 
depends on safe and healthy food and I would like to remind the 
House that the agricultural industry in my riding is one of the 
largest in southeastern Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Essex and the surrounding area has an ideal 
growing climate.  It is situated on a flat peninsula, jutting 
into the United States farther south than northern California. 
The growing season is the longest in Canada, averaging 212 days, 
with 350,000 acres of rich fertile and relatively flat farmland. 
There are 3,000 farms and over 400 acres of greenhouse 
production, producing everything from apples and tomatoes to 
flowers and cacti. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers provide an annual yield of fruits and vegetables, 
legumes and grains totalling over $200 million annually.  Today 
more than 50 food and beverage processing plants account for over 
$1 billion in shipments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our farmers take pride in nurturing the soil and producing the 
freshest and healthiest produce possible.  To assist the farmers 
in my riding of Essex and elsewhere we will use the upcoming 
World Trade Organization negotiations, including those on 
agriculture, to help build a more transparent rules based global 
trading system, one that ensures a level playing field, provides 
better access to world markets for Canadian companies in all 
sectors and respects the needs of Canadians, our culture and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House that agricultural production 
and its future is the very soul of this nation.  The Liberal 
government has been and will continue to be a very strong 
supporter of agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the throne speech stated, Canada's ability to adopt 
innovative environmental practices and technologies will 
increasingly be a part of Canada's strength in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just yesterday Canada's leading automakers announced a new fuel 
endorsement program designed to encourage gasoline retailers to 
sell fuels that meet strict specifications, including lower 
sulphur, positive combustion chamber deposit controls, no heavy 
metal additives and enhanced driveability characteristics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those retailers who meet these specifications will be able to 
obtain a licence to use the automakers' choice logo and 
designation.  To quote General Motor's president Maureen Kempston 
Darkes:  “If all vehicles on the road in Canada today could 
access automakers' choice gasoline, it would be the equivalent of 
eliminating the smog-causing emissions from almost two million 
cars and light trucks”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will positively affect all Canadians and my constituents by 
reducing the already unacceptable levels of air pollution in 
Windsor and Essex county. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will go further.  By improving our physical infrastructure 
for the 21st century we will not only aid trade and economic 
growth, we will ensure that we have clean air and water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will work with other levels of government and the 
private sector to reach by the end of the year 2000 an agreement 
on a five year plan for improving physical infrastructure in 
urban and rural regions across the country.  This agreement will 
set out shared principles, objectives and fiscal parameters for 
all partners to increase their resources directed toward 
infrastructure.  It will focus on areas such as transport, 
tourism, telecommunications, culture, health and safety, and the 
environment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is a multibillion dollar industry in Windsor and Essex 
which attracts day-trippers and vacationers by bridge or tunnel 
to an uncrowded, relaxed and safe destination.  Tourism accounts 
for our fourth largest industry, with 12% of the workforce or 
16,300 people employed in accommodations, food service, amusement 
and recreation.  The Ambassador Bridge is North America's number 
one international border crossing, with over 10 million vehicles 
per year travelling between our two great nations. 
Municipalities in my riding and individual companies have 
communicated to me the importance of creating a better highway 
system to ensure the safety of our citizens, the efficient 
movement of our trades and goods, and to increase the movement of 
people to our tourist attractions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the millennium approaching, Canada is preparing for the 
arrival of the 21st century and its immediate future.  We cannot 
speak of the future without looking to our children.  This 
government recognizes that the viability and economic strength of 
this nation depend on the opportunities we give our children 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada is going to be the place to be in the knowledge based 
economy of the 21st century, young Canadians, our leaders and 
innovators of tomorrow, must be equipped with state of the art 
high tech skills.  As well, they must have access to the tools 
and educational opportunities which will help them apply their 
creative talents and hone their skills.  Our goal is to give 
today's young generation of Canadians, no matter where they live, 
a shot at personal success in the knowledge economy, at a job 
with a future that pays well, and at becoming our best and 
brightest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SchoolNet has connected every public school and library in 
Canada to the Internet.  Canada is the first nation in the world 
to accomplish this.  The community access program has ensured 
that we will have public Internet sites connected in 10,000 rural 
and urban areas by the year 2000 and Computers for Schools, whose 
goal of providing 250,000 computers for Canadian schools, is 60% 
complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech reaffirms that we will build on this strong 
foundation and use the world leading high tech infrastructure we 
are putting in place, not only to enhance the skills and 
opportunities of young Canadians, but also to broaden their 
understanding of their fellow Canadians and the Canadian 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is on the right track.  The nation's finances have been 
restored and we are enjoying the longest economic expansion since 
the 1960s with the creation of 1.7 million jobs since we took 
office.  As the nation's finances have improved, the government 
has begun to deliver broad based tax relief totalling $16.5 
billion over three years.  As the nation's finances continue to 
improve, the government will further reduce taxes to increase the 
disposable income of Canadians, enhance innovation and risk 
taking, and create a more robust economy.  In its next budget the 
government will set out a multi-year plan for further tax 
reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had my opportunity to comment on the throne speech and 
the vision the government has unveiled to bring our strong nation 
into the next millennium.  I hope that my constituents will take 
the opportunity to give me their views at the prebudget 
consultation I will hold at the Essex Civic and Education Centre 
on November 9, 1999 at 7.00 p.m.  Together we can build a 
stronger Canada for the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to take a look at some things that have happened since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the agricultural industry in my riding and in other parts of 
western Canada farmers are piling grain on the ground.  Their 
bins are full.  They have no place to put it.  They cannot move 
it.  About 40% of farmers are considering bankruptcy at this very 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning there are about 166,000 out of every million 
children who are going to school hungry.  They are living in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to 
the hon. member, which is hard for me to find right now, the 
government has already invested an additional $1.7 billion toward 
low income families and children.  The member who just spoke 
voted against that.  He now has the nerve to stand in the House 
and talk about poverty and children when he voted against money 
going to low income families and to children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has led the government and the country to the 
lowest unemployment rate in years.  Canadians are back to work. 
We have new programs in our schools.  We are connected to the 
Internet with leading edge technology.  We are investing in 
research.  We are attracting the best and brightest to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the hon. member should come to the industry committee once 
in a while and hear what researchers in Canada have to say about 
the opportunities that exist in Canada and what attracts them. 
The bottom line is not the dollars.  It is where they can go and 
what they can do.  If members on that side would show up at 
committee they would obviously know that.  Since they are never 
there they cannot say anything about it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, obviously we have again heard non-answers from a 
government member to some very direct questions from my colleague 
from Wild Rose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about being on track.  Someone needs to wake 
her up because there has been a derailment.  The government is 
very off track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned broad based tax relief as though the 
government had actually delivered it.  She talked about $16.5 
billion of tax relief but, surprise, neglected to mention that 
the government at the same time has wrung $18 billion out of the 
Canadian people in tax increases.  We talk about the $16 billion 
of tax relief but we do not mention that we have raised and wrung 
$18 billion more out of Canadians at the very same time.  That is 
a net loss and the member has the gall to stand in her place and 
defend her government by saying that it has provided broad based 
tax relief.  How can she do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously the math on the 
other side is a little distorted as usual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go from double digit unemployment to single digit 
unemployment we obviously will have more Canadians working.  More 
Canadians working means more tax dollars.  That is why we have 
been able to provide $16.5 billion in tax relief and why we made 
a very clear announcement in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case they did not hear me the first time, we very clearly 
state in the throne speech that the government will set out a 
multi-year plan for further tax reductions.  Canadians know that 
we have a balanced approach.  Canadians supported us in the 1997 
election on a balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it bothers some members on the opposite side to think 
that Canadians want social programs at the same time as they want 
balance, with debt reduction and tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just the other day I had a dinner meeting and by chance two 
people there, one from the health care sector and one who makes 
substantial amounts of money from a different type of profession, 
were at odds on what should happen, but both of them agreed that 
we have to support the social programs as much as we have to 
provide tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I very clearly answered the question when I stated that we have 
gone from double digit to single digit unemployment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am glad to be part of the debate this morning.  l enjoyed the 
throne speech, but the main event for me and I think for many in 
the media and others was really the Leader of the Opposition's 
reply to the throne speech.  I always look forward to his 
comments.  What a great job he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reflecting on the throne speech, some Liberals seem to believe 
that spending money on government programs aimed at children will 
help with the challenges that Canadian families face. 
Unfortunately, investing in more new federal programs, the latest 
code word being investing, is really just more spending and 
spending financed by whom?  It is financed by parents.  It 
completely misses the importance of families in their struggles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues and pressures facing Canadian families are bigger 
than a few new spending programs.  Everything from fiscal and 
economic policy to justice and community safety issues all affect 
family units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High taxes mean fewer family outings and more financial stress. 
High CPP premiums translate into a tax on jobs.  There is also 
bracket creep.  Tax inequalities and inequities mean that 
families have to consider what effect employment decisions will 
have on their tax bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A massive underground economy means that families are the 
victims of an especially unbalanced tax burden.  A confused 
health care system means stress and uncertainty about the care of 
loved ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A low dollar, almost two-thirds of the American dollar, and once 
higher than the American dollar, means that families face a 
grocery bill and costs for fruits and vegetables higher than ever 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lower productivity means a less vibrant economy, higher long 
term and youth unemployment.  Youth unemployment is almost twice 
the rate of overall unemployment.  Many of the jobs young people 
get are across the border.  The brain drain is a real thing and 
it is breaking up families.  Oppressive regulations and bloated 
bureaucracies stifle the entrepreneurial spirit that is birthed 
within the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lax attitude toward crime and criminals and using our 
communities as test laboratories for rehabilitating early 
parolees makes danger on our streets and violence in the 
playground sometimes a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably a most significant concern to many in the House is the 
political interference and anti-democratic patronage which 
weakens the faith of our young people in the system.  Special 
interest group funding, political slush fund contributions and 
other frivolous attitudes toward spending tax dollars encourages 
a sort of family tax rage.  Children and families are all 
affected by these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the government talk about its concern for children 
but I and other members of the House have repeatedly heard it 
refuse to deliver even when it had the opportunity to do so. This 
is a government that says it is against child pornography, it is 
for greater protection from child sex offenders and it is against 
family tax discrimination.  Let us look at its actions because 
that is really the most telling sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen, in the country, the courts strike down laws that 
make child pornography illegal.  We saw 79 Liberal MPs and 
senators write a letter to the Prime Minister urging him not to 
wait for the appeal of the B.C. decision to be heard but to 
immediately act in defence of Canada's children.  These Liberal 
members recommended that strong new child pornography legislation 
be introduced as soon as the House returns.  That sounds good.  I 
and I am sure all the members of my party would have signed that 
letter.  In fact, they even went on in the letter to encourage 
the Prime Minister to consider the use of the notwithstanding 
clause to send a clear message that Canada's charter of rights 
and freedoms would never again be used to defend sexual abuse of 
Canadian children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tragically, we have the telling sign.  These same Liberals voted 
against a motion in the House to do just exactly what their 
letter asked for.  In February of this year every Liberal MP who 
signed this letter, except the four who are now in the frozen 
back land of the Liberal Party over there, the Siberia of the 
Liberal caucus, voted for the motion.  All the others who signed 
the letter voted against it calling for the motion for child 
pornography laws to be upheld by parliament, not struck down, the 
laws shaped by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about another situation.  The Liberals had an 
opportunity to protect children from convicted sex offenders but 
failed.  We all know the Liberals waited to prorogue the House 
this summer until they could get through Bill C-78.  Bill C-78 
allowed the government to get its hands on the pension surplus of 
public employees but they failed to pass another bill, a 
Reform-driven bill, Bill C-69 which protected children from 
convicted sex offenders.  Bill C-69 was in the Senate before the 
pension bill but they overlooked that and went for the money. 
They pushed through the pension bill to grab the money and left 
our children less protected.  If that is not a telling sign of 
priorities, I do not know what is.  Actions speak louder than 
words to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at another one.  The Liberals have refused and 
failed to end the tax discrimination faced by single income 
families with children.  We know that in the last federal budget 
a typical single earner family with two children, a family of 
four with a $45,000 income, pays about $4,900 in personal tax. 
The same single income family is paying 136% more than a dual 
earner family.  That is right out of the budget.  However, the 
Liberals voted against the motion in the House that addresses tax 
discrimination.  They said no.  The vote was 123 in favour, most 
united on this side, and 145 against on that side.  This affirms 
again that the true vision of the Liberals is a continuation of 
their legacy of high taxes and less choice for families.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal MPs say that they are concerned about pornography 
and child pornography.  What are they doing about it? Nothing. 
We hear that they are concerned about protecting our kids, but 
when they had a chance to do something about it they did nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals talk about caring for and wanting to address tax 
discrimination in the country.  They had the opportunity but did 
not move on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is all this talk about a legacy?  We hear them talking 
about a legacy.  The Prime Minister wants a legacy.  The Liberal 
member from St. Paul's was quoted in the Hamilton spectator as 
saying:  “We want something that is a legacy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member for Don Valley West was quoted as saying: 
“When they look back at us 50 years from now what will be the 
great thing that we did?  Will anyone remember if we gave them 
tax cuts?  If we are going to be remembered we must do some great 
thing, some great national project. What more appropriate thing 
for the millennium for our legacy”—he is concerned about his 
legacy—“than to do something for our kids”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This begs the question of what is more important to them, their 
legacy or our children.  Parents look after the needs of kids 
best but it looks like they might also be asked to finance the 
Liberals' legacy building project.  What a question to ask: 
“Will anyone remember if we gave them tax cuts?” Where is the 
credibility in all of this when we hear all this talk about a 
children's agenda?  To me it sounds more like an agenda for 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member for Sarnia—Lambton was quoted recently.  I 
have to agree with the member, although I think his career path 
in the Liberal Party is going to be severely stilted and 
derailed.  He fears that the national children's agenda is a code 
word for big spending, social engineering and government 
meddling.  He said:  “To me it's all a lot of nonsense.  It is 
as if having children is unnatural and the state is going to tell 
you how to rear your children”. This was said by a Liberal 
member and I can agree with him.  He is right on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to inform the government that it actually already has a 
legacy.  The Liberal legacy is one of high tax, of high national 
debt, of increasing taxes and of a huge national debt borne by 
our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families in Canada are actually aware of the Liberal 
government's agenda.  They are quite confident that they have the 
ability to look after the children.  Statistics Canada noted in a 
recent study that by far the majority of children living in 
Canada are in excellent and very good health according to their 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think parents want interference by the Liberal 
government.  They want to be left to raise their families as they 
see fit.  They want a government that will give them less taxes 
and less government.  They want a government that respects the 
natural authority of parents and the choices they are best suited 
to make on behalf of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot more to say but I will leave it for another time. 
My number one concern is that families in the country be given 
the respect and the freedom to raise their children as they see 
fit. I would like to move an amendment.

the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the last 
speaker mentioned that parents look after their children best. 
Over all I would agree with him except that there are situations 
where parents do not always look after the needs of their 
children best.  It is not because they do not want to but in some 
circumstances they cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member think that every parent should be the 
teacher of their child or the doctor of their child?  As 
citizens, as a group, can we not help each other look after our 
children?  Everything a government does is not necessarily some 
sort of nefarious interference with those of us who are raising 
our children.  In fact we can help each other build a stronger 
society by helping relieve the stress of a single person or a 
single couple looking after their children exclusively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think that is a very 
reasonable question.  I want to be clear on this particular 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in no way advocating that as a community and as a nation of 
caring people we do not support one another or that we do not 
encourage one another in the rearing of our children.  What I am 
focusing on is the natural authority of parents in their families 
to make their decisions.  When they want to seek help and when 
they want to get advice from their neighbours, their community or 
even from their government, that should be a decision left solely 
in the hands of the parents to decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not talking about situations of neglect or abuse where 
perhaps there is a legitimate requirement for a government to 
have some intervention.  We are primarily concerned that public 
policy and government policy respect the role of parents to make 
the decisions in the best interest of their children.  They 
should be able to make those choices in a fair way where tax 
policies do not discriminate against one choice over another. 
There should be a fair and equal playing field for parents to 
make the decisions because they are the ones who can best make 
the needs assessments of their children.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The transport committee of the House of Commons is an all-party 
parliamentary committee.  Members of all parties of the House sit

afternoon we are meeting with an agenda.  From all indications 
from my colleagues on the committee, as well as the critic for 
the member's party, the airline issue is probably the issue the 
committee will be seized with immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be input from the Standing Committee on Transport in 
the form of a report.  We all hope that it will be a unanimous 
report back to the House of Commons as soon as possible but 
within the limitations given us to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member indicates that he is looking to the government to 
provide vision.  There are members on this side of the House who 
are concerned.  They are bringing their concerns to the attention 
of our internal economic development committee chaired by the 
member for Stoney Creek, and that will move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member aware of all these different things that are 
going on, including the Competition Bureau which will make 
representation to the minister by the end of the month in the 
form of a report?  The Minister of Transport is being seized with 
this issue and is getting all this input.  I wonder if the member 
can acknowledge that all this work is being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, I am aware of that 
work being done.  I am also aware there was no mention of the 
airline industry in the Speech from the Throne.  I am also aware 
that this issue was not led by any plan of the Liberal 
government.  It was led by the industry itself.  It had to take 
action because there was no vision from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying it should intrude in that situation, but at the 
same time I am saying there is a vacuum over there.  There is no 
plan.  It is trying to cope with the realities of the marketplace 
and struggling with how to do it.  I am aware of what the hon. 
member is pointing out, but we are not seeing any clear direction 
from the government at all.  It is trying to cope with the 
situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to enter into the debate on the Speech from the 
Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite evident from what was not in the Speech from the 
Throne that the government is clearly failing in a number of 
areas.  At a time when the throne speech is to lay out the 
government's priorities in the areas that it needs to pay 
attention to, it neglected four of the major issues that are huge 
in the country right now.  Many people are talking about those 
issues and many people are looking to the government for answers. 
There was a failure of the Liberal government to acknowledge 
those issues or spell them out in any remote detail or even in 
any generality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major four areas is the fishing crisis happening on 
our east coast.  The government did not talk about that or 
mention it in the throne speech.  The government did not address 
agriculture in that throne speech.  That is a major issue for 
many hard working Canadians in the agricultural field and it 
affects all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has neglected to talk about the airline industry, as was just 
pointed out by my colleague for Calgary Centre.  It has failed to 
talk about immigration and the crisis happening in the broken 
system that became so clearly evident this past summer off the 
west coast of Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus most of my attention in my speech this morning on 
the broken immigration system and the failure of the government 
to address the crying need for change in that area.  It is woeful 
that the government has not taken action.  The incidents that 
happened this past summer of which all Canadians across the 
country are aware have in essence highlighted and shone a beacon 
of light on the government's failure in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The immigration system has been broken for a very long time. 
Members of the opposition have been talking with the government, 
pleading with it for a number of years to change the system.  My 
colleagues that were here years before I came here made a lot of 
proactive positive suggestions to the ministers of immigration, 
to the government, to the Prime Minister, and they have not acted 
on them.  They rebut any idea of change out of hand because it 
comes from opposition members or from anybody else.  They believe 
they have the answers and will do what they want.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that kind of attitude and that kind of approach to 
governing the Liberal government gets itself into the position of 
crisis after crisis after crisis because of its inability to be 
proactive and its inability to look at positive solutions 
suggested by others, even by people in its own caucus.  They are 
rejected out of hand.  As a result of that attitude, that 
underlying philosophical approach to governing, the government 
neglects its responsibility.  That is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the opposition will continue to urge that the 
government take action.  Failing that, we will work in whatever 
way possible to become the government so that we can put in place 
proactive positive approaches that solve glaring problems across 
the country which the government is not willing to even go near. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move into a little more detail about some of points made 
about our immigration system.  I will quote a piece of 
information that came from a report commissioned by the minister 
of immigration entitled “Not Just Numbers:  A Canadian Framework 
for Future Immigration”.  This study was put together by some 
independent individuals who did a broad based consultation 
process, in the government's own words, to find out what needs to 
be done.  Here is something that was included in the report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years in Canada, over half of all the asylum-seeking 
arrivals at ports of entry had destroyed all identification 
documents before being seen by officials— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent arrivals have mainly come from countries which are stable 
enough to provide identification documents.  Generally, these 
individuals are uncooperative and refuse to provide their names, 
their countries of origin, or anything else that might assist the 
expeditious processing of their claim.  The idea that all such 
persons are reluctant to give such details because of 
refugee-based fears, or that the persons helping them enter 
Canada are latter-day Raoul Wallenbergs, is naive.  The 
people-smuggling business is now as lucrative as the 
international drug trade. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was in a report submitted to the government, commissioned 
by the government and in fact has been lost on the government. It 
is another report that has simply been shelved or put away to 
gather dust for another day.  We can say this because the 
government has rejected that notion out of hand as well as many 
other proposals which have been put forward.  It is a shame that 
is its approach to governing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigration department officials in response to the people 
smuggling that occurred on the west coast this past summer have 
said the following.  An Immigration Canada spokesperson named Jim 
Redmond has said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a humanitarian movement; this is almost a slavery 
movement.  It's hard on the people who are smuggled.  It's 
organized crime at its worst. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a good chance we could have more arrivals this year.  It 
would be naive to say it's all over. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What appears to be happening is that the Liberal government is 
hoping the issue will just fade away.  If it does nothing long 
enough other issues will pop up which will take the attention 
away from this glaring failure within its mandate so that it does 
not have to act on it.  The underlying approach of the government 
is if it does not do anything long enough maybe people will 
forget about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are not forgetting about it.  They are realizing that the 
government is failing in the area of addressing the immigration 
system.  I have sat with my colleagues for two years on the 
immigration committee.  We have had many good debates.  We have 
tried to work together.  We have had many very heated debates at 
times too about the issue because it is a very important one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been able to work co-operatively at times to look at 
ideas and solutions.  What tends to happen is they get rejected 
because they are not approved by the minister, by the prime 
minister or by the cabinet.  That is a shame too because there 
are many things we would like to see happen that are not 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party offers a proactive positive approach rather 
than this force of negativity of doing nothing offered by the 
Liberal government.  We have ideas, suggestions and solutions 
which have been put forward time and time again.  I will mention 
a few of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to move away from the voluntary compliance system within 
the immigration system when individuals claim the protection of 
Canada.  They can come, claim refugees status and then be told to 
appear tomorrow or next week at a hearing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are not true refugees will abuse that and often do. 
They disappear and do not go to their hearings.  That is a 
problem.  We need a system that addresses that, a system that has 
individuals maintained in an area until it is determined whether 
they are really refugees or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That process needs to be expedited.  It cannot go on for years 
and years and years as it currently does.  Members know that 
refugee cases go on for years.  People's lives are in limbo. It 
is not fair to them and it is not fair to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That process needs to be determined quickly, in a matter of days 
and weeks, not months and years.  It needs to be done quickly, 
and once a decision is made, then it should be acted upon. If the 
person is determined not to be a refugee, then they should be 
removed from our country post-haste.  If a person is determined to 
be a refugee, then they should be integrated into our communities 
as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's approach is to leave people's lives in 
limbo, to allow people who are not refugees to be here and then 
to go after people who are true refugees and deport them.  The 
system is broken at both ends and this Liberal government is 
failing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are in.  The perception across our country is that 
this government does not think it is a problem.  The Prime 
Minister himself said there is nothing wrong with our immigration 
laws and there is nothing wrong with our refugee process.  He 
said that this summer.  In light of what is happening on the west 
coast, it is unbelievable.  It is absolutely shocking that this 
government, in the light of information, details and facts from 
its own people, fails to act.  It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my colleagues on the government side to apply pressure to 
change the system.  Failing that, the members of the opposition 
will work day after day in this place, in committee and on the 
streets of our nation to be proactive and positive. We will make 
a commitment here and now that we will change the system not only 
within immigration, but within all the other areas outlined in 
the Leader of the Opposition's speech for a positive vision for 
the future of this country, because it is clear that today in 
this land the Liberal government has failed and is visionless. 
We will carry the day.  We will put in place the positive 
solutions that will reshape our country and take our country 
ahead for the next generation.

would like the hon. member to comment on something I find very 
interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has not been one question or comment on his presentation 
from the members opposite. We see members from Vancouver, members 
from Toronto, members whose constituents are upset that the 
government has taken no action on the issue.  Obviously 
government members must have been told to keep quiet on this very 
serious issue.  The Liberals are afraid to tackle difficult 
issues and this is a difficult issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment on the government's handling 
of this issue, in particular that none of the government members 
are willing to ask a question or make a comment on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can only say in 
response to that very good comment from my colleague that it is 
clear that the government has no answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Vancouver—Kingsway across the way is a member of 
the immigration committee.  She is simply not offering any 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the government, ministers of the crown have said very 
interesting things.  The Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific said 
it is sad that Canada's screening process is being abused, and he 
is angry because the generosity, the goodwill Canadians have 
toward genuine refugees has been abused.  That is what he has 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Wait until winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  That is right.  The minister said wait 
until the weather gets bad so the ships stop coming. What kind of 
approach is that?  That is the government's solution to a very 
important issue.  It is a do nothing approach, just wait and hope 
that people do not notice.  Well, people have noticed. If the 
Liberals will not change the system, we will work day after day 
to sit on that side in order to put in place our proactive 
solutions.

Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker let me say to 
the deputy citizenship critic for the Reform Party that as usual 
he has it wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at Canada and the success that we have had.  As a matter of 
fact Canada has been named the best country in the world for the 
last six years and it is because of the people we have in this 
country.  The people in this country were immigrants or refugees 
at one point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member says he wants to make a determination on refugee 
cases in a matter of days or weeks, he is wrong.  We cannot have 
a judicial system or any system that has any kind of justice that 
can make a determination on somebody's life in a day or a week. 
This is the problem the Reform Party brings to this House.  The 
Reform Party has simplistic solutions that are not viable.  I do 
not want a commandant deciding in a day if somebody gets due 
process.  It takes some time. Our government is acting 
responsibly to combat international smuggling of human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition parties, particularly the Reform Party on this 
issue, are like ambulance chasers.  They run around looking for a 
problem and they point fingers.  We are working.  It is 
succeeding.  Members opposite can blow and shout but the reality 
is we have a system which we are continuously working on to 
improve.  It is a very good and a very fair system, one which 
will be even better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a broken system. 
The member is in la-la land.  The member sits on the immigration 
committee and he talks about simplistic answers. The Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration said wait until winter so the boats 
do not come anymore.  What about that for a simplistic answer. 
That is the suggestion offered by the minister and her mouthpiece 
the member for Kitchener—Waterloo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the member's community. Talking about immigrant 
communities, I talked to some of his constituents who said they 
gave the member a petition and he lost it.  That is the kind of 
approach the member takes to constituent work.  Now he has no 
answers.  His government has no answers to this crisis.  It is 
clear.  The facts are in. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to tell my colleague that our government not only 
cares but it also takes action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month the Chinese government invited a small delegation of 
three Liberal MPs to go there.  We had a very long and detailed 
discussion to establish co-operation between China and Canada to 
tackle the problem of human smuggling.  It is the beginning of 
our work on immigration. There are many things we can tell the 
House.  We not only take on our concerns but members' concerns 
are also in our hands.  We are trying to solve the problems. We 
do not just sit in this House and talk.  Talk is too easy. The 
government takes action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to simply say something 
and say it is true is an interesting concept.  Actions speak 
louder than words.  The member's solution to the immigration 
crisis is to make an educational video and send that across the 
waters to folks so that they know to please not come because we 
are not sure what to do with them when they get here.  That is 
the member's approach to this crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than work for legislative change with some teeth in it 
that will make a change and send a message internationally that 
Canada is not an easy mark for those who would abuse our 
immigration system, the member and her colleagues sit idly by and 
offer solutions such as waiting for winter so the boats stop 
coming, or putting together an educational video so that people 
stop coming. 
Those are their suggestions, rather than using the legislative 
powers we have in the House to take action and make a change.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A member has shouted out a comment that I am not going to repeat 
because it is in contempt.  He said it the other day in question 
period under his breath.  He does not have the intestinal 
fortitude to stand in his place and make that accusation because 
he knows he would be thrown directly out of this place.  He does 
not have the guts to stand and deliver; rather he holds his hand 
in front of his face and utters scurrilous remarks toward 
opposition members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the approach of the government, to run scared, to do 
nothing and utter attacks against those who offer positive 
proactive solutions for change.  Shame on the member and shame on 
every one of the Liberal members for standing idly by and doing 
nothing once again.  That is the Liberal government's approach to 
governing. Shame on the Liberal members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day will come soon when we will be in the Liberal 
government's place making positive proactive solutions to address 
the concerns of this nation because the Liberal government simply 
refuses to do so.

society of our older citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Older persons across the country and around the world are an 
active and important part of society.  As fellow members of 
society, it is our duty to ensure these older persons receive the 
health care and special services they need and deserve.  The 
federal government recognizes these needs and is committed to 
working with Canadians to continually improve our health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must accommodate the changing demands of our aging and 
increasing population.  The International Day of Older Persons 
gave us the opportunity to really look at this important sector 
of our population.  Older persons have special health care needs 
and services which must be made readily available to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to applaud the Canadian Medical Association's 
efforts during this international day.  I urge Canadians to work 
together with each other and with the government to ensure our 
older persons are well taken care of.

rise to speak on behalf of many Canadians in my riding of 
Nanaimo—Cowichan and across the country who are concerned about 
the introduction of genetically engineered foods to the 
marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While everyone is interested in ensuring that the world's food 
supply grows and that the hunger pangs of children and indeed all 
people disappear, there are many who share concern about the 
safety of genetically engineered foods.  There are too many 
outstanding issues and too many questions of what if. These 
questions require full answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safety of our food supply cannot and must not fall into 
question.  We must learn from past failures, such as the testing 
of our blood supply, and ensure the public that the same mistakes 
will not be made again. We must take time now to ensure that the 
safety of these foods is without question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have currently submitted a private member's bill to be drafted 
that calls for further investigation into the regulations 
concerning genetically engineered foods and their mandatory 
labelling.  Until this process is complete, I believe that the 
questions will remain unanswered.  In the near future I will be 
asking for support of this bill by the members of the House.

was a huge jump in the price of gas in Ontario this summer.  In 
addition, the major oil companies continue to jerk around gas 
prices and Canadians to maximize their profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the price of crude oil has gone up, but that in no way 
explains current high gas prices.  Some say that more than seven 
cents of the new price is excess profits for the corporations.  I 
urge the government to initiate another inquiry into the lack of 
competition in gas pricing in Ontario.  I believe the virtual 
elimination of small retailers has produced a monopoly in the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also urge the government to persuade the Government of Ontario 
to use the threat of gas price regulation, which is clearly in 
the jurisdiction of Queen's Park, to pressure the oil companies 
to change their ways.

met last month in Charlottetown they agreed to establish a

integrated donation and transplantation strategy across the

November.

demonstrate their concern by contributing a food donation to 
their local food bank.

It is an international NGO, formed originally in France, which is

the globe, often at great risk to themselves and in places such 
as Kosovo, East Timor and remote corners of Asia and Africa.

Canadians see the world.

these problems.  The present minister sends out meaningless form 
letters to the concerned Canadians who are contacting her on this

because the government has failed to act we are forced to use the

will have a race based fishery in the future.  Most Canadians 
want equality of all citizens and groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While both groups of fishermen have rights, both native and 
non-native fishermen, by not petitioning the court, by not asking 
for clarification, it is ensuring that one group of fishermen has 
superior rights over another.  That is not right.

that the Marshall decision gives them the right to harvest timber 
without a licence.  Others claim that they now have mineral 
rights.  If the minister does not think that is true, he just has 
to look at what has been going on in British Columbia all summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expect the minister may wish that this problem would go away. 
He only has two days left.  I would urge him to petition the 
court.  Why will not the government ask the supreme court to stay

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the minister of agriculture. 
Yesterday the minister told his counterparts in Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan that they had to put up some money for the farm 
crisis themselves.  That is like asking the farmers to pay for 
their own crisis as R.B. Bennett did in the 1930s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knows that in Saskatchewan there is a joint 
position of all parties in the farm groups asking for an 
additional $1 billion in emergency farm aid now, on top of what 
they already have from last year under AIDA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister be forthcoming with that money since he took 
money out of the programs by eliminating the Crow a few years 
ago?  How much money will come back to the farmers on the 
prairies? 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

discussion with the ministers from Saskatchewan and Manitoba 
yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As they already know agriculture is a shared jurisdiction.  The 
safety net support to agriculture for the last numbers of years 
has been shared 60:40.  Provinces can contribute in that way. 
They can also contribute in other ways as was demonstrated 
yesterday by the province of Alberta. 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr.

letter from a 14 year old girl in Carragana, Saskatchewan.  She 
is saying that nobody in parliament is listening to her on the 
farm crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the minister could answer my question directly as to 
whether or not there will be an extra $1 billion going to hard 
pressed farmers on the prairies.  This is the worse farm crisis 
we have had since the 1930s.  Could the minister answer that 
question directly?  Would he screw up his courage and come out to 
the prairies to see for himself the severity of the crisis?

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion for an address to 
Her Excellency the Governor General in reply to her speech at the 
opening of the session, of the amendment and of the amendment to 
the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Rural 
Development)(Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern 
Ontario), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this 
opportunity to respond to the vision set out by the government in 
its Speech from the Throne.  I particularly want to expand on 
what that vision means for rural and remote Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very exciting time in the history of our country.  The 
Speech from the Throne is the last for this millennium and lays 
out the government's vision as we move into an exciting era of 
the 21st century.  By investing our resources in focused ways, we 
intend to make sure that we have an infrastructure in place that 
will further the well-being of all Canadians.  This includes not 
only the physical infrastructure so crucial to the renewal and 
development of rural communities, but also investments in 
children and youth, in innovation, in further tax relief and debt 
reduction, in health and in the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our agenda will create opportunity and prosperity for Canadians 
no matter where they live.  One of every three Canadians lives 
outside a major centre, whether it is a small community near an 
urban centre or a more remote community, be it a farming town, a 
forestry or mining community, or one based on tourism or 
manufacturing.  The government recognizes the special 
circumstances of rural Canadians and it specifically addressed 
rural Canada in its Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that rural Canadians have faced numerous challenges. 
Like all Canadians they have faced those challenges with 
ingenuity and an inspiring commitment to their families and their 
communities.  Hailing as I do from a rural area of central and 
northern Ontario, I have seen firsthand the dynamism of our rural 
areas, our towns, our villages and the entrepreneurialism and 
energy of those who live there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne has clearly laid out the direction in 
which the government intends to go in the coming months.  This 
direction applies very much to rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to believe that vibrant communities and 
a sustainable resource base are the foundations for a strong 
rural Canada.  It is a rural Canada where residents have access 
to the tools, information and skills they need to make informed 
decisions and to take full advantage of opportunities for 
personal and community development.  It is a rural Canada where 
citizens have access to science and technology, infrastructure 
and services to be full partners in Canada's knowledge based 
economy and society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the throne speech said, we know that technology can open new 
doors to all Canadians, tearing down the old barriers of distance 
or access and allowing rural as well as urban communities to 
compete globally.  We have made a commitment to encourage the 
development and adaptation of new technologies, recognizing that 
they hold the promise of greater economic stability for rural 
communities traditionally dominated by single industries like 
mining, fishing, forestry, or agriculture.  In other words, 
investments in new technologies are a critical tool in the bid to 
strengthen rural communities and enable them to break out of the 
cyclical economies.  We will make those investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also committed to work with its partners in 
other levels of government, in the private sector, in the 
voluntary sector and with citizens in general to build a better 
quality of life for Canadians everywhere.  As the Speech from the 
Throne indicated, this includes rural Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that my appointment as Secretary of 
State for Rural Development is in itself a strong signal of the 
importance the government attaches to rural Canada.  The purpose 
of creating a separate additional Secretary of State for Rural 
Development is to bolster and reinforce the government's focus on 
rural Canada.  I am deeply honoured to serve in that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my new role I plan to lead the government's efforts in 
improving the quality of life for Canadians who live in rural and 
remote Canada.  I intend to work with my colleagues on both sides 
of the House.  Most important, I intend to work with individual 
Canadians to ensure that we take a co-ordinated approach to rural 
Canada and that we work together for common priorities which have 
been identified by rural Canadians themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the months ahead I will be concentrating on three particular 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First is the rural lens.  This is essentially a way of making 
sure the potential impact on rural Canada is taken into 
consideration before federal policy decisions are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is to help Canadians who live outside our cities have 
better access to all the resources that are available to them. 
That means making sure they know what programs and services are 
out there, as well as making sure they are able to use them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third area I will be focusing on is the task of turning our 
strong commitments into specific tangible actions that truly help 
rural citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, rural Canadians face many challenges, a number 
of them quite similar from community to community, for example, 
the challenges presented by distance from markets, low population 
density and the cyclical nature of resource based industries. 
Depending on where one lives in rural Canada, whether it is a 
remote Newfoundland outport, a small rural municipality in 
Saskatchewan, or a community in the far north, circumstances and 
cultures can also be quite different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to reflecting those 
differences and those realities in our policy decisions.  In 
adopting the principle of the rural lens, cabinet has made a 
commitment to ensure that the challenges and priorities of rural 
Canadians are understood and taken into account, both in current 
initiatives and in long term planning. As Secretary of State for 
Rural Development, I look forward to the opportunity to work with 
my cabinet colleagues in applying the rural lens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me back to my second priority which is to improve 
the communications and information flow between the government 
and rural citizens.  As well as sharpening our focus on rural 
concerns within the government, it is also critically important 
that we do more to let rural Canadians know what assistance or 
programming is already available.  We have made a good start. 
This year for example, our departments and agencies worked 
together to provide information on programs and services for 
rural Canadians in a booklet that went out to two and a half 
million households in rural and remote Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to inform rural Canadians about the progress being 
made toward meeting their priorities.  One key way of doing this 
is by producing an annual report which measures our achievements 
in dealing with rural issues and challenges. Not only is the 
government committed to helping rural Canadians, it also expects 
to be held accountable for doing so.  Early next year I will 
table this report in parliament, thereby providing an opportunity 
both for my colleagues in the House of Commons and for all 
Canadians to engage in a public discussion on how we chart the 
future of rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Developing rural Canada and assisting rural Canadians will be a 
transparent process, one that is bottom up and not top down 
driven.  That is why at the end of April I will host a national 
rural conference inviting individual rural Canadians from across 
Canada to come to Magog in the province of Quebec. The conference 
will promote and showcase rural Canada.  More than that it will 
be an opportunity to discuss our successes, our challenges, our 
vision, and most important the specific actions we need to take 
to ensure the future of rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third area I want to talk about and the most important part 
of what I am charged to do relates to specific actions to be 
taken to bring about tangible developments and improvements for 
rural Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The direction set out in the Speech from the Throne will guide 
us as we work to deliver the results in rural Canada.  Rural 
communities will be involved in drafting a five year plan for 
improving physical infrastructure.  They will also be key 
partners in our efforts to make Canada a nation that is highly 
connected through the information highway so that rural citizens 
have ready access to the education, technology, skills and other 
tools that will allow them to share in the country's wealth and 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our focus must now shift from process to results to take the 
steps necessary to develop action items into specific 
deliverables in rural Canada and make concrete progress on the 
priorities of rural Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases this may simply mean bringing together different 
departments that do similar programs to focus resources in one 
area.  In other cases we may need something new in addition to 
what is already being undertaken.  For example, Health Canada 
through the office of rural health is taking the lead on the 
development of a rural health strategy to ensure that Canadians 
in rural and remote areas have access to quality health care.  In 
another initiative a number of service Canada projects are being 
tried out in rural areas as a possible way to improve access to 
government programs and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before closing I would like to mention that I wear another hat, 
that of Secretary of State for Federal Economic Development 
Initiative in Northern Ontario, more commonly known as the FedNor 
program. That brings with it a responsibility for community 
futures which plays a role in providing access to capital and 
facilitating business development for rural Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community futures development corporations are administered 
by four different entities within the federal government:  three 
regional development agencies, plus Industry Canada.  The program 
works very well. It is an excellent example of one community 
level program which works across several different agencies, yet 
is very rurally focused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next few weeks I will be discussing with my ministerial 
colleagues other co-operative initiatives that involve their 
departments or agencies.  Those initiatives will be directly 
targeted at the priorities set forward in the Speech from the 
Throne, and the federal framework for action in rural Canada 
which rural Canadians themselves helped to write and helped to 
develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne lays out a vision and opportunity for 
prosperity for Canadians.  It is my personal commitment to ensure 
that rural Canadians are equal partners in that vision, that they 
have the technologies, the tools and the infrastructure to build 
a better quality of life for their chosen communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural Canada is the foundation on which a large part of our 
economic wealth is built.  It is a place of great energy and 
great ingenuity.  It is our past, it is our present and it is our 
future.  It is a way of life, a way of unique traditions and a 
specific social structure. Most important, rural Canada is home. 
It is home to my family and other members' families.  It is home 
to our friends, it is home to my constituents and it is home to 
nine million Canadians.  It is a place with a great future.  This 
government is working to make sure that that future for rural 
Canadians is as bright as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, my 
question for the minister is a very simple one.  He speaks of the 
nine million Canadians who live in rural Canada.  I think he has 
tried very gallantly to revise the biggest single omission in the 
throne speech and that is the fact that there was no mention of 
agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent the riding of Kings—Hants which has 50% of the 
agriculture output for the province of Nova Scotia.  The fact is 
that many of the farm aid programs currently do not meet the 
needs of farmers either in my riding or in western Canada.  The 
AIDA and NISA programs simply do not meet their needs.  Some of 
those programs are based on 70% of the last three years' 
earnings. In my riding the last three years have been disastrous 
due to the drought.  Of course, 70% of nothing is nothing. For 
farmers who are facing this crisis and bankruptcy there was 
absolutely nothing in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister speaks about rural issues. One of the most pivotal 
and important issues for rural Canadians is agriculture and food 
output.  The throne speech did not address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister did not speak of the seasonal workers in Atlantic 
Canada and my riding.  Seasonal workers have been devastated by 
the EI reforms and the cuts by the Liberal government. Many 
seasonal workers who did work periodically and who did contribute 
and participate in the economy are now forced on provincial 
social assistance.  They have gone from working seasonally to not 
working at all.  That is a significant concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister did not speak of the concentration in the food 
distribution business which increasingly is forcing producers to 
effectively deal with one or two major purchasers. It is denying 
the producers any ability to control price or have any control 
over their own business affairs.  The minister does not address 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister spoke at length about e-commerce, the growth in the 
high tech sector and the importance of connectedness in terms of 
technology in rural communities.  I share with him in his 
optimism that in the long term these may play a role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, does he really believe that the government's focus on 
e-commerce and on Internet connectedness for rural communities is 
going to help?  Does he really believe in the short term that a 
50 year old farmer who is facing bankruptcy is going to be turned 
into a computer programmer or a high tech worker and suddenly 
will be transported back from the edge of the abyss of poverty, 
despair and into some new e-world of prosperity and future 
potential?

Ontario and in the east. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Madam Speaker, part of what we see 
here, from the comments made by the hon. member who represents 
the Tory Party, is a good example of how its inability to deal 
with two separate issues at the same time led to an 
administration in the country from 1984 to 1993 that resulted in 
record deficits, increased unemployment and lower economic 
growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that we are dealing with all the issues that the 
hon. member mentioned.  He talked about nothing being done in 
terms of the farm income prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it very clear for the hon. member, who seems to have 
missed it, and for other hon. members in the House and obviously 
for Canadians, that there was $900 million, when combined with 
provincial contributions of another $600 million, meant there was 
a $1.5 billion package to assist Canadian farmers through an 
income crisis they are experiencing right now.  That work is 
ongoing and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has 
indicated his willingness to continue to work with his provincial 
counterparts, with the industry and with others to do the things 
that are necessary to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond just simply helping in the income crisis, as important as 
that is, we must also ensure the long term viability of rural 
Canada.  That is what the hon. member and his party have missed. 
We cannot just simply deal with the issues of the day, although 
we must and it is important.  We must also ensure the long term 
viability of rural Canada and rural Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make sure that there is a future for rural Canadians. We 
must make sure there is a future for our children so that they 
can choose to live in rural Canada.  It means more than simply 
identifying or dealing with one specific industry.  It means more 
than just simply identifying with any one specific problem.  It 
means dealing with the broad issues that face rural Canadians. It 
means understanding that rural Canada has separate challenges and 
separate needs and to respond to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the government committed to do in the throne 
speech.  As the minister responsible, I will attempt to ensure 
that those commitments come to reality and fruition. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have listened carefully to the speech by 
the new Secretary of State for Rural Development, and I wish him 
good luck, despite my belief that the federal government has no 
business whatsoever interfering in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would invite him to speak to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. With his responsibility for rural areas he is 
surely aware that, since employment insurance reform, there has 
been a serious problem that has to do with the rule of 
intensity. 
Seasonal workers are penalized by the deduction of 1% of their 
benefits every time they have used 20 weeks of employment 
insurance, which means that after three years, instead of 
receiving 55% of potential benefits, they will receive 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the Minister of Human Resources Development gave an 
interview to a Moncton newspaper.  She thinks that the rule of 
intensity must not be done away with, nor the period of benefits 
extended, because that is no solution.  More employment must be 
created, and seasonal employment must be enabled to last longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the secretary of state and to the minister “Why not do 
both at the same time?” When they state that the industry's 
season must be lengthened, it is as if they were telling people 
“You are not working longer because you do not want to.” The 
Secretary of State for Rural Development must surely know, and I 
hope he agrees with that view, that there is no one in Canada 
who does not want to work. This is not a situation where, 
contrary to what the Prime Minister said in the past, the 
unemployed are beer drinkers. That has been demonstrated. There 
are no more cheaters among the unemployed than there are in 
multinationals or elsewhere. Generally speaking, people do want 
to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not by hitting them on the head or by imposing 
unacceptable rules regarding minimum income that things will 
change. 
In rural areas, when a person works 15 or 20 weeks, if that 
person does not collect enough benefits, even if he or she has a 
job, even if he or she is among those who worked during the 
year, that person will still get poor because we do not have a 
good employment insurance program.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, will the Secretary of State for Rural Development make 
representations to the Minister of Human Resources Development 
to have that situation changed, and is he not deeply upset that 
the throne speech says nothing on this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for the secretary of state to get the 
bureaucracy moving and force the government to stop viewing the 
employment insurance program strictly as a surplus generating 
scheme; this could have a positive impact in an area of federal 
jurisdiction. The EI system is also a tool for economic 
stabilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the secretary of state do that in the years to come? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Madam Speaker, I had the opportunity 
as the chair of the natural resources committee to author a 
report called  “Think Rural” which outlined many of the issues 
in rural Canada.  Even though the hon. member was not a member of 
that committee, he took the time, effort and energy to provide 
input into the development of that report.  He is committed to 
his rural area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the issues in HRDC, I know that he and the minister 
have had debates in the House and that they continue to have 
discussions.  The member forgets to talk about the other parts of 
the HRDC regime.  He forgets to talk about active measures and 
all the other labour market adjustment type of initiatives that 
are undertaken by HRDC and which certainly help rural areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity not too long ago to travel to his part of 
the country.  Their concern was not particularly over 
jurisdiction.  There was not a concern over nationalism in 
Quebec. There was a concern about improving the quality of life 
of rural Canadians no matter where they live. That is what I am 
trying to, that is what the government is trying to do and that 
is what we will accomplish.  We will improve the quality of life 
for all rural Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I, like some of my other colleagues, 
will begin by pointing out to Canadians and to the members of the 
House an issue that was not addressed in the Speech from the 
Throne:  the state of Canada's airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were all inundated over the summer months with positions both 
for and against changes in the airline industry but the 
government remains silent. There was absolutely no mention in the 
throne speech of the crisis in the airline industry. It is very 
clear that major changes will be coming.  These are the questions 
I have.  Where is the government's vision for the future of the 
Canadian airline industry?  Where does the government feel 
Canadians want to see the airline industry go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government's apparent lack of vision that causes 
concern.  The government seems to always be responding or 
reacting to situations rather than working out some of the 
problems or finding solutions in advance.  Unfortunately its 
history of popping up into the issues and trying to influence the 
private sector is usually done for the wrong reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the dust settles over the current airline industry 
situation, government and parliament must work together in a 
non-partisan fashion.  We must work together with the 
stakeholders to develop a clear blueprint for Canada's airline 
industry in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is a Canadian who has not heard of Onex, 
Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International.  Canadians accept 
the fact that Canadian Airlines International is in trouble. I 
think everyone is aware of the Onex offer to merge the two 
airlines to stabilize Canada's airline industry under one major 
airline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there are many Canadians, and I am one of them, 
who are aware of what Air Canada's counterproposal may be. 
However, I would suggest that one way or another it looks like we 
will only have one national airline in Canada.  More importantly, 
parliament must play a role and it must be done in a non-partisan 
fashion.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes that the role of government should be 
to facilitate a private enterprise solution to this problem. 
That means less government regulation not more.  It means that 
the government must establish the priority of protecting the 
interests of Canadian consumers at both the national and regional 
levels, the interests of the Canadian taxpayer, the interests of 
the airline employees and the interests of those who invest in 
Canada's airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe a starting point would be a comparison with the airline 
industry in Australia.  It is interesting that in Australia where 
the demographics and the geography is very similar to Canada and 
where it has similar concerns and issues that Australia can have 
two profitable national airlines.  Maybe there is something that 
we can learn from Australia's airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to look at what role this government and previous 
Liberal and Conservative governments played in bringing our 
airline industry to the point where it is today.  More 
importantly, the issue we have to address is how to fix the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move on from the airline industry because there are other 
transportation issues in the country that must be addressed. 
Canada is on the brink of entering a new century.  We can either 
enter the new century boldly or we can enter it timidly and in 
response to other situations around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brief mention of infrastructure programs in the throne 
speech leaves a lot of questions in the air.  It mentions that 
the federal government will work with the provinces and the 
private sector over the next year to develop a new five year plan 
for improving the infrastructure.  I think that is very short 
sighted of the government and of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to take a much larger and longer vision of where we want 
to go with our infrastructure and on how we are going to get 
there.  We would be remiss if we were not looking in ten 20-year 
cycles as opposed to only looking five years down the road. Not 
only is that true for our infrastructure program but it is also 
true for our national highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government has studied the problem of Canada's highway system 
for years.  It really is time to quit studying and to do 
something about it.  It is time for the government to implement a 
national highway strategy program.  It is also time for the 
government to invest more than the 10% it collects in gas taxes 
into our highway infrastructure.  It is time that the government 
started recognizing that highways and the ability to move people 
and goods is very important.  It is important for rural Canada, 
it is important for urban Canada and it is important for the well 
being of all Canadians that our transportation networks are 
sound, well planned and certainly in good condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues that is very dear to my heart is the issue of 
trade corridors.  A large part of the reason for Canada's 
economic improvement over the last years is due to the massive 
increase in trade, mainly with the Americans.  I do not know that 
Canadians understand or realize that over $1.5 billion worth of 
trade happens across the Canada-U.S. border every single day of 
the year.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really pleased to see that the Liberal government has 
decided that trade is good for Canada, but if this growth is to 
continue, if we are to continue to maximize the future of our 
trading partners on the North American continent, our 
infrastructure must grow to accommodate that trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just good enough to have trade agreements.  It is not 
just good enough to have agreements among countries and documents 
that are signed between the leaders.  We have to be able to move 
the goods that we have agreed to trade.  We have to make sure 
that the movement of those goods is done in an efficient and 
timely manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we can ignore rail transportation, particularly 
the movement of grain across our country.  That has been an issue 
for a number years and it remains an issue that has to be 
resolved.  Two reports have been produced for parliament to 
consider, the Estey and Kroeger reports.  I look forward to the 
coming years and seeing this happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also environmental concerns.  If the Minister of 
Environment is concerned about vehicle emissions then I would 
suggest that he go to any major commercial border crossing.  He 
could go down to the Ambassador Bridge between Windsor and 
Detroit and see 100 trucks on either side of the bridge, idling 
for hours waiting to fill out unnecessary paperwork at customs. 
He could watch the fumes from their diesel engines billow into 
the air and check why Canadian and American archaic cabotage 
rules are forcing many trucks to travel on the continent empty. 
It is time to address some of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, the government's plan of talking with the 
provinces about highways is not just good enough.  We need to 
develop a seamless transportation system involving our highways, 
our railways, our waterways and skies to move goods and people in 
the most efficient manner not on a national basis but on a 
continental-wide basis.  Only then can we ensure that we are 
looking after the health, safety and economic well-being of all 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to represent the people of 
Selkirk—Interlake and to speak to the throne speech today.  The 
government has been speaking about the good aspects of the speech 
so I do not have to go over those details again.  They are few 
and far between, but it highlighted the ones it thought were 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of issues that did not get fully addressed in 
the throne speech.  One of them was that Manitobans expected to 
see more in the area of health care.  There was nothing in the 
speech but a reiteration of the fact that the government was 
putting $11.5 billion into health care over the next several 
years.  That is totally insufficient.  They would like to have 
seen something in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the government seems to have recognized that it has been 
fumbling the first nations accountability issue.  The throne 
speech mentioned that the government wanted to foster 
accountability on the part of elected officials on our first 
nations.  The Indian affairs minister has said in speeches 
privately in Saskatchewan that was one of the government's 
objectives.  It is certainly worth recognizing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Physical infrastructure work was mentioned with regard to what I 
assume will be roads.  This may have a benefit for farmers if the 
physical infrastructure it is talking about enables roads to be 
built sufficient to carry the large trucks which are now 
necessary to carry grain from the farmers field to the inland 
terminals and out to port by rail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are all the items I saw in the throne speech which were 
directly pertinent to farmers.  Certainly we needed much more. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1250

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of points in the throne speech were scary for farmers. 
Certainly we are concerned about the government's intentions with 
regard to its Kyoto commitment and how they will impact upon the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that is bothersome is the Endangered Species Act. 
It will be implemented and passed in such a way that it will not 
have the negative impacts on agriculture that we found in the 
United States with its legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An immense concern to my riding, to all of Manitoba and really 
to all Canadians which was not mentioned in the throne speech, 
involves an issue in the riding of Provencher in Manitoba.  I am 
referring to the closure of the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited 
nuclear research station.  The government is in the process of 
closing that research station.  In fact it has virtually closed 
it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it is leaving behind can only be described as waste and 
byproducts.  The nuclear contamination from that site is still 
there.  That is a natural issue which happens.  However it is the 
government's responsibility to show some vision and direction 
with regard to atomic energy uses in Canada and to clean up that 
site.  Manitobans want to use that site for private industrial 
development, but it is impossible to do so because the government 
is standing in the way of cleaning up the site and arranging for 
it to be used for industrial purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mayor of Pinawa, the town in which it is located, and the 
Hon. Darren Praznik, MLA for that area, have clearly brought to 
my attention that they need assistance to bring to the attention 
of the government in Ottawa that this nuclear contamination and 
the clean up of the Whiteshell site are of utmost importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only tell the resource minister that I will be raising 
this matter in the House over upcoming months.  It should have 
been in the throne speech.  We will make sure that it is raised 
and something is done about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out one last thing about it.  When hot cells, 
nuclear contaminated cells, in Tunney's Pasture in Ottawa were 
decommissioned a couple of years ago, they were completely 
demolished and the site was returned to a green field state.  Why 
should Manitobans and the people of Selkirk—Interlake and 
Provencher expect anything less than what was done in Ontario? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the chief agriculture critic I will devote the rest of my 
speech to agriculture issues.  Our leader has spoken quite 
eloquently with regard to the lack of emphasis on agriculture in 
the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last two years farmers across Canada have faced 
destructive drops in farm income.  Realized net income in Canada 
fell by 21% in 1998 and is predicted to fall by another 15% in 
1999.  That brings the figure down for Saskatchewan in terms of 
realized net income to a negative $48 million for 1999.  Farmers 
will be losing massive amounts of money in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan farmers are so desperate that they are actually 
involved right now in a tax revolt involving the education taxes 
on their properties.  We are finding that these farmers are being 
pushed into doing anything they can do to reduce the cost of 
government in particular and other costs that are helping to 
drive them out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use the gross figures for Manitoba. 
We talk about a realized net farm income drop in Manitoba to $64 
million according to Statistics Canada figures.  These figures 
are not something I made up myself.  They are right from 
Statistics Canada.  That drop to $64 million is $100 million 
below the $164 million earned by Manitoba farmers in 1998 and 
well below the five year average of $231 million.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program the government brought forward to address the income 
crisis was AIDA, the agricultural income disaster assistance 
program.  The government had the understanding or 
misunderstanding, really, that the situation with regard to farm 
incomes was simply a one year drop in income in 1998 but that the 
drastic drop may happen in 1999 also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government took the program that came to it from the safety 
net advisory committee, which involves a lot of farmers' groups, 
et cetera.  The government changed that recommendation around to 
make the program fit the budget the minister thought he could get 
for it, instead of making the program fit the crisis and address 
the problem.  That is exactly why AIDA has not worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will just give a couple of examples of farmers who were 
applying for AIDA and receiving nothing.  One story is that in 
May of this year two brothers who are farmers in Manitoba 
applied.  Their application is still sitting in the review area 
of AIDA.  The way the farm is set up, they expect to get 
approximately $70,000 back from AIDA.  They have received nothing 
and they are on the verge of going bankrupt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over past months, certainly since last fall in particular and in 
fact right from 1993, the Reform Party has made many suggestions 
to the government on how it can increase the income of farmers. 
That is the subject of a minority report of the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture.  It involved matters such as reducing 
the cost of government, reducing user fees and making the 
Canadian Wheat Board a voluntary board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, I would only suggest that the government review all 
the material we in the Reform have produced, take those 
suggestions and implement them immediately to help solve the 
crisis in western Canada and across the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I happen 
to represent a riding that has a lot of farmers in it, although 
admittedly the farmers in my area are more mixed farmers than 
grain farmers.  We certainly are aware of the crisis that is 
taking place on the prairies with farmers.  I would like to ask 
my hon. colleague to comment on a couple of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we lost the benefit of the Crow rate under the Liberal 
government.  I am rather surprised at that because these days we 
are talking about the fishing rights of the natives, apparently 
based on an agreement which was some 200 years old.  It is said 
to last in perpetuity and cannot be changed. It seems to me the 
Crow rate agreement was also an agreement in perpetuity, but the 
government just said with impunity that it would wipe it out and 
give them a bit of a cash payment which hopefully would cover it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member comment on to what degree the cash payment came 
even close to covering the long term costs of farmers 
transporting their grain to the ports? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question is with regard to transportation problems. 
When I was a youngster my dad used to ask “How come when I buy a 
combine or a tractor that is manufactured in Ontario I have to 
pay the freight to get it from Ontario to Saskatchewan, but when 
I sell them my wheat I have to pay the freight to send their 
wheat back to Ontario?”  I would like the member to comment on 
those two points.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, in perpetuity are two 
words that have devastated western farmers and made them so mad. 
They are madder than a boiled owl when they hear the words 
spoken, so I hesitate to even use them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Liberal promise along with the promise of the Conservatives 
over the years assured western Canadian farmers that the Crow 
rate, which was a subsidy for exporting grain, would be kept in 
perpetuity.  Western Canadian farmers certainly knew better than 
the Liberal and Conservative governments.  They realized that the 
Crow rate was not allowing western farmers to diversify their 
incomes.  As a result when the Crow rate went it was beneficial 
in that farmers diversified and have certainly improved the 
western farm economy in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real devastation regarding the income problem and the cash 
taken out of farmers' pockets when the subsidy was not received 
anymore was that starting in 1993 with the trade agreement and in 
1995 with the federal budget, domestic support for agriculture 
was drastically reduced by the government in an attempt to 
balance its deficit.  In doing so it brought in user fees and all 
kinds of charges, increased taxes and all of the things that have 
taken away the meagre incomes farmers were getting from exporting 
their grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is domestic support that is lacking from the government.  We 
heard it today in question period.  Farmers are asking for that 
support to be reinstated at least to the level where they can 
remain viable and on the farm, to provide Canadians a secure 
domestic food supply.  It is in our national interest that that 
be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we see?  Nothing is happening by way of money for the 
majority of farmers in western Canada in particular, and in 
Ontario, to keep them on the farm and keep the farms going.  What 
will happen?  It will end up that this country's farmland will be 
owned by absentee landlords.

of very wet years that have caused farmers to have a low three 
year margin net income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government put together an AIDA program that said it would 
base payments on a three year margin net income. Guess what?  It 
was so low that farmers do not have the income to get a payout.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are entering the century of the Pacific.  It is very fitting, 
as the Prime Minister has noted, that a Canadian who came to the 
country as a young refugee from China should be the new Governor 
General. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That an individual who arrived in Canada as a refugee can attain 
the position of Governor General, a post deeply rooted in our 
tradition, is a symbol to the world.  It is a very special 
appointment and symbol that Canada affords to all citizens the 
opportunity to participate fully in our society. 
It is a symbol that all citizens, whether born on Canadian soil 
or having arrived as migrants from other nations, can and do make 
meaningful contributions.  It is a symbol that Canada is a nation 
that recognizes talent and diversity.  Indeed over the last 
century our society has blossomed with migrants from the four 
corners of the globe arriving and contributing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appointment of the Governor General is a true reflection and 
celebration of cultural diversity in Canada today.  I would like 
to congratulate the Prime Minister on this important appointment. 
That such an appointment has been made under this government 
demonstrates its recognition and appreciation of the rich and 
beautiful cultural fibre that our nation has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That so many aspects of this country are flourishing is a credit 
to our Liberal government, but we must continue to build on our 
strengths.  We must strive to increase the quality of life of all 
Canadians.  This government has proven it has the courage and the 
vision to do so.  Concrete plans have been formed to help 
Canadians face the challenges of the new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are at the forefront of our investment in the future. 
This government is committed to ensuring that children receive 
the support and attention they need.  Many studies demonstrate 
that the early years of a child's life are very important. Loving 
and involved parents are the cornerstone of the well-being, 
happiness and success of every child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is to be commended on its solid commitment to 
extend employment insurance maternity benefits and parental 
leave. Maternal leave time will be extended from a current 
maximum to a full year, a year that will provide invaluable time 
for all our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has shown its insight in providing new benefits 
to accommodate the diverse needs of Canadian families. Those 
benefits will be more flexible, more adaptable to the wide range 
of realities that face Canadian families.  This government wants 
to ensure that children are equipped with all the capacities they 
need to be ready to learn when they begin school and to grow into 
healthy productive adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government, as responsible citizens, we have no higher 
priority than our children.  As our children grow they must be 
well educated in good schools and institutions that will provide 
them with skills that will prepare them for work and future 
challenges, that will prepare them to be successful in a global 
economy.  That is why the investment this government has 
announced for our post-secondary institutions is so crucial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Prime Minister's address, he endorsed a plan to create 
1,200 new chairs for research excellence in universities across 
Canada and more important, a plan for the financial support 
needed to make them internationally competitive.  That was not an 
empty commitment: $60 million in the first year of the plan; $122 
million in the second year; $180 million in the third year; and 
following that, a further $120 million will fund 800 additional 
chairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs those university chair endowments to compete for, 
to attract and to retain researchers of international calibre. 
Furthermore, those researchers will train our students to become 
the best and the brightest in the world.  Such investment in 
post-secondary institutions ensures Canadians will have the 
resources and expertise to be successful in a highly competitive 
world.  Those endowments will ensure Canada is at the forefront 
of the knowledge based economy.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Foundation for Innovation has already been created. 
That $1 billion endowment is helping to build a leading edge 
national system of innovation.  Knowledge and technological 
innovation are the cornerstones of a higher standard of living 
and a better quality of life. The investment of the government 
will ensure Canadian institutions have the resources, the 
laboratories and the university infrastructure to carry out their 
creative work, but this is not all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January the Canadian millennium scholarship fund will begin 
to generate over 10,000 scholarships.  The government's SchoolNet 
project has connected every public school and library in Canada. 
The community access program will have public Internet sites in 
10,000 rural and urban communities before the end of this year. 
The government has and will continue to increase support for 
lifelong learning to ensure Canada has the most highly skilled 
and knowledgeable workforce in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous commitments of the government and those outlined in 
the Speech from the Throne indicate the level of commitment this 
government has to ensure Canadians will embrace the challenges of 
the 21st century.  This investment in education and research will 
fuel the Canadian economy of the next century.  Our economy will 
continue to strive and to grow.  Canadian families will benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continued tax reduction will foster an even more dynamic 
economy.  Canadian families have already seen the benefits of tax 
cuts totalling $16.5 billion in the last two budgets alone. That 
trend will continue.  The next budget will lay out a multi-year 
plan for further tax reduction. I am a member of the finance 
committee and we will be conducting prebudget public hearings to 
listen to Canadians for their ideas and suggestions for our next 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are one of the leading industrialized nations in the world. 
The future will see great advances in business, government and 
society.  The way to the 21st century is to invest in the 
cornerstones of our society.  We will invest in our children, in 
our families, in our researchers and in our educational system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  What this government will not do is sacrifice 
our financial health.  Canadians from British Columbia and indeed 
from coast to coast to coast recognize this is the direction for 
Canada in the next century.  The government is doing what 
Canadians want.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said that the 21st century would belong to the Pacific 
region. Will the hon. member be able to influence her government 
colleagues, so that they take a stand regarding the labeling of 
genetically modified products? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Minister of Agriculture took a stand when he 
said that such labeling was optional. However, the Asian market 
requires that genetically modified products be labeled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May be the hon. member can influence her colleagues. I would 
like to hear her comments on this issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung:</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for her very thoughtful question.  It would be very 
interesting for our government to consider and I think a lot of 
study will follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, very strict regulations will be set up.  I 
thank her for calling this matter to our attention. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's speech with great 
interest.  I noted that she said repeatedly throughout her speech 
“We will invest.  We will invest.  We will invest”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem I have with that is that what she and her colleagues 
in the Liberal Party do not seem to understand is that when they 
talk about investing they talk about spending taxpayers' money. 
Typically the Liberal answer is to set up more programs.  She 
outlined a whole raft of them in her speech for which they are 
going to need taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She also talked about providing a higher standard of living. She 
said “We must strive to improve the quality of life for 
Canadians”.  Certainly, something like that we can all agree 
with.  However, I wonder when she and her Liberal colleagues will 
get it through their heads that the easiest way to improve the 
quality of life for Canadians is to lift the oppressive tax 
burden which they face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to hear the hon. member insult Canadians' 
intelligence by talking about $16.5 billion in tax cuts. 
Canadians know quite well that is more than offset by the $18 
billion in tax increases over the past couple of years that the 
government has foisted on them.  Really, they are worse off. 
That is very clear when they look at their take home pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the hon. member to answer very honestly and 
truthfully—and do not insult the intelligence of the Canadians 
voters who are watching this debate today—when her government is 
going to deliver real tax relief, not this bogus $16.5 billion 
they always talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to remind 
my colleague that we very successfully eliminated the $42 billion 
deficit.  Last year we not only reduced taxes, we also eliminated 
the 3% surtax.  We all know that.  It is on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are entering an era where we will have a balanced 
approach.  There will be tax cuts, but at the same time we will 
not overlook the most important things, such as health care, 
social programs and the children's agenda.  We are now spending 
under a very cautious, socially balanced program. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member speaks again of investment, which is really spending, 
but the fact is that many Canadians are finding it difficult to 
invest themselves.  While the government is currently in the 
black, at an unprecedented rate Canadians are in the red.  We 
have the highest level of personal debt in the history of our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1990s Canadians have seen an 8% drop in their personal 
disposable income because of the tax burden imposed by this 
government.  During the same period Americans have enjoyed a 10% 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be better if Canadians were able to invest for 
their own futures as opposed to the government taking more money 
from Canadians and then trying to invest where it feels the 
priorities are? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung:</B>  Madam Speaker, we do not just take from 
Canadians.  We are also trying to create more opportunities for 
trade and we are trying to help medium and small business people 
gain more business so they will have more cash in their pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing both.  We are meeting the social needs of Canadians 
and, at the same time, we are trying to help business and other 
sectors.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise today to reply to the Speech from the 
Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building a higher quality of life for all Canadians is an ideal 
theme, as we are about to celebrate the new millennium. It is 
the greatest legacy that we can leave to Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about vision.  It is about what kind of country we want to 
live in.  It demonstrates a real understanding of the broadest 
determinants of quality of life.  It recognizes that although we 
have been designated the best country in the world in which to 
live we cannot rest on our laurels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vision is statesman-like foresight, sagacity in planning.  It 
means using our experience and our knowledge together with the 
power to apply them critically and practically.  More than that, 
it is incorporating the core values of Canadians.  Vision and 
values are the key ingredients to making a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne was an extraordinary example of the 
positive role the government can play in people's lives.  The tug 
of war is over.  No longer is it possible for Canadians to think 
that good social policy is bad economic policy.  We are now 
embarking on a new age where with good social science research we 
can demonstrate that good social policy is excellent economic 
policy and those who think that tax cuts alone will cure all are 
horribly misguided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax cuts in Ontario resulted in the doubling of child 
poverty.  We are embarrassed internationally because of this. 
The cuts to social services in Ontario have not saved money. 
Gina Browne, the fabulous researcher at McMaster and author of 
<I>When the Bough Breaks</I>, has now demonstrated that 
conclusively, with the help of Health Canada.  The Ministry of 
Health of Ontario has turned down the study twice and now seems 
to be hiding from its results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to outline some of the highlights of the study to 
show that the failure to provide appropriate social programs does 
not save a cent because the people go elsewhere, generally to the 
medical system, and cost at least as much money there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gina took over 700 single moms.  Some were left to self-direct 
their support generally by using walk-in clinics, emergency 
departments and GPs' offices.  Some were directed to a variety of 
support:  recreation, day care, social services and employment 
advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of two years the control group had 10% less on 
welfare generally because the Harris program had cut them off. 
The group that had only received a recreation program for their 
kids over six, which included transportation, running shoes and 
snacks, had twice as many moms off welfare and huge savings to 
the system in parole, children's aid and the use of food banks. 
The kids now had friends from other neighbourhoods and were well 
on their way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the group that received all the support, over 25% had exited 
the welfare system and demonstrated huge savings in their use of 
the medical system.  The interventions helped to identify the 
mothers with depression and got them appropriate and effective 
help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Gina has said to rotary club after rotary club, the 
Government of Ontario is kidding itself if it thinks it is saving 
money by its cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is exciting now is that we can fund research to show what 
instinctively we have known, that good social policy is good 
economic policy.  With the social union framework we have an 
exciting tool with which we as a country can begin to share best 
practices and demonstrate that accountability and transparency 
are what Canadians need in order to feel that their taxes are 
well spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commitment in the social union for all levels of government 
to report publicly on the effectiveness of their social programs 
in effect will continue to demonstrate this reality of good 
social programs being good economic policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne articulated the commitment of the 
Government of Canada to work toward removing all barriers for the 
mobility of Canadians with respect to their qualifications, 
student loans and essential services for persons with 
disabilities.  It is clear that achieving full citizenship for 
all Canadians is good social policy as well as good economic 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of St. Paul's are big picture people.  They 
understand the need for balance and accountability.  They 
understand that we need evidence based practice.  They understand 
that strict ideology is usually bad public policy because of the 
need for practical solutions based on proper evaluation and 
changing conditions.  The pure tax cutting rhetoric is just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the Speech from the Throne has touched the core values 
of Canadians.  As my constituent Fiona Nelson pointed out, the 
big cold countries at the top of the globe decided a long time 
ago that we would have to look after one another. 
The countries in the middle with the warm climate, fishing and 
coconuts falling out of the trees have not had to be quite so 
progressive.  Canadians decided a long time ago that they do not 
want people to have to mortgage their homes, and maybe even lose 
them, for their cobalt treatment for cancer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final report of the National Forum on Health eloquently 
articulated that the core Canadian values will remain even when 
opinions can waver or be seduced by the rhetoric of more money in 
people's pockets solving everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want fairness.  They want the tax system to be made 
fairer.  They know that increasing disposable income for the 
lower and middle classes is a good thing.  They understand that 
the child tax benefit has been an extremely important measure for 
the working poor, and that extending it to the middle class will 
be extremely important to their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year at the prebudget consultations in St. Paul's some of 
the business people expressed their concern about the use of the 
word “investment” as the new code for government spending. 
Whether we call it smart spending, results based management or 
investment, it is becoming clearer and clearer that we can spend 
a little now or a lot more later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Labour, who is responsible for homelessness, has 
declared many times that investing in kids now will help us to 
close prisons later and that this is now becoming better 
understood.  There are certain expenditures that, with a proper 
long range view, we cannot afford not to do.  Governments can no 
longer present a little checklist of things that can be 
accomplished within their mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look to the millennium it is imperative that we look 
forward to our future.  It is our kids.  It is our planet.  We 
need to do the right thing now.  It will be our legacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If 25% of absenteeism in children is because of a tragic 
increase in asthma, we must do something about air quality now. 
We must help the world deal with all aspects of the 
sustainability of our planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vision articulated in the Speech from the Throne was a broad 
vision for Canada.  Its focus on children as we move to a 
knowledge based economy is one of the best things we can be 
doing.  Dr. Fraser Mustard said that there is substantial 
evidence that the quality of early childhood experience has long 
term effects on an individual's performance in the education 
system, their behaviour in adult life and their risk for chronic 
disease in adult life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that this need is universal and that in many 
neighbourhoods the wealthy children are not doing any better 
because love is not the same thing as knowing how to parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of practising next to the fabulous 
Children's Storefront in Toronto where I watched parents, nannies 
and new immigrants come.  With the advice of the early childhood 
educators they learned about conflict resolution, positive 
reinforcement, attitudes toward learning, cuddling and reading. 
I know that it works.  I know that those children are better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we embark on the exciting new research chairs and the 
Canadian institutes of health research we have an opportunity to 
gain better evidence as we do research in evaluating the policies 
and programs to find the optimal solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the commitment to aboriginal health alone, we know 
that we have to do something about the doubled rate of low birth 
rate babies, five times the suicide rate and six times the death 
rate from injuries, violence and poisoning.  We need to look at 
the root causes of homelessness, the role of 
de-institutionalization, child abuse, substance abuse, learning 
disabilities and FAE/FAS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extraordinary time for Canada.  The prospect of a 
surplus will ensure our ability to be able to deliver a truly 
balanced approach.  This is a truly Canadian thing to do.  As to 
the promises we made to Canadians who elected us—tax relief, 
debt retirement and prudent investments—we can all be proud that 
the vision and values articulated in the Speech from the Throne 
will indeed build a higher quality of life for all Canadians. 
Good social policy is good economic policy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to build a stronger Canada and provide a better quality 
of life to our children and grandchildren. This is the best 
legacy that we can leave to them.

<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to direct two questions to the hon. member.  The 
previous speaker talked a great deal about the importance of 
education, with which I agree.  Being well educated people, our 
young people look forward to a good future in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am acquainted with many highly educated people from this land. 
In fact, one of them is my son, who went into a certain field, 
searched around and is now working in Georgia along with 
thousands of other Canadians who have left this country.  Doing 
the same job down there, as compared to here, he puts $500 to 
$600 each month more into his pocket, savings because of taxes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is on a very good health program.  He has benefits that 
exceed any that we provide to many of our employees in this land. 
Yet his heart is in Canada.  He wants to be here, as do many of 
them, but because of economics and of high taxes they cannot 
afford not to take jobs south of the border with greater 
benefits, greater wages and lower taxes.  When will the 
government recognize that quality of life does not exist here? It 
is fading away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On quality of life the solicitor general, the justice minister 
and many of the people in the justice area have indicated that we 
need to empty our prisons, that we have too many people in jail. 
This month a multiple killer, a cop killer, walked away from a 
minimum security prison.  There has been a 100% increase in 
people walking away from prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the placement of a person who has been convicted of taking a 
life, a police killer, into a minimum security institution from 
which they are walking away the right method?  Is that a method 
of emptying our jails?  It all adds up to the total incompetence 
of a justice system which would allow this kind of person to walk 
away from a penitentiary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not ensuring quality of life.  That is endangering lives 
in our land.  The government's policies are allowing it. It is 
worse today than it ever was.  Could the hon. member address 
these two issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Madam Speaker, I remind the hon. 
member that most of the people moving to the United States are 
moving because of opportunities.  In terms of salaries that are 
offered there, for example, there is the fabulous Howard Hughes 
grant of $1 million a year to a researcher.  We have trouble 
competing with that.  There is no good evidence that these people 
are moving purely because of taxes.  It is opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my patients moved to New York and had to spend $10,000 a 
year on their health insurance they understood what comes with 
the taxes in our country and a reliance on a public health care 
system, a fabulous public education system and a huge reduction 
in crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People do not want to live in armed communities.  The kind of 
approach demonstrated in the Speech from the Throne will actually 
prevent the cop killers the hon. member talks about.  We will 
actually be able to demonstrate that we have much smaller numbers 
of people who require being in prison 20 years from now if we do 
the right thing now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that we want more cops and more prisons.  That is not 
an approach to crime.  We have to deal with people who were 
abused as children, who have fetal alcohol effects, who have 
learning disabilities that were not recognized and then ran into 
trouble in the school system, dropped out, got into trouble with 
drugs and then later into trouble with the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a prevention problem.  This has nothing to do with what 
the hon. member suggests is crime and punishment.  It just does 
not work.  We know it does not work.  We have to prevent 
psychopaths before they are formed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, let me say 
from the outset that the reason I want to take part in this 
debate about the throne speech is to stress how this government— 
which has major surpluses after cuts in transfers to the 
provinces, with the result that ordinary people in particular 
have felt the impact of these significant cuts in health, 
education and social assistance—is using these surpluses in an 
arrogant way, without any concern for the very real problems 
experienced by individuals, problems for which the provinces now 
appear to be responsible.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, why did the government postpone the beginning of the 
session by three weeks? Did the throne speech really justify 
that three week delay? During those three weeks, Quebecers and 
Canadians could not get answers from federal ministers, nor 
could these ministers be pressured into finding solutions to 
issues such as the major problem in the airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Montreal, between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs could be lost, yet no 
one was there to explain why the government was letting things 
develop in such fashion or, if there is an east-west problem in 
Canada, to let us at least talk openly about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was the speech postponed?  Citizens were deprived of an 
opportunity to react in a timely manner to the supreme court 
decision.  The government saw the Marshall decision coming; it 
should have been ready. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who paid the price?  I would like to point out that Acadians and 
natives were on good terms.  Many times, Acadians would say, in 
French, that they were sad because the reason many people were 
still around was because the Indians had protected them after 
the 1755 deportation.  The government's negligence has torn this 
community apart.  It will take time for things to return to 
normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why a three week delay?  Here is what I think.  First, the 
government wanted to install, with great pomp, a new couple to 
represent the Queen of England, the Queen of Canada.  The 
government claims it wants to help Canada enter the 21st century 
as a leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, what are the Australians doing?  They are 
getting ready for a referendum on whether or not to become a 
republic.  That is a debate that might perhaps lead to the 21st 
century.  The decisive day is November 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government delay the Speech from the Throne?  So as 
not to muddy the waters for the International Forum on 
Federalism, which was supposed to show how wonderful Canadian 
federalism was.  How wrong it was, because that was not what 
came out of the forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I would like my constituents in Mercier to know that 
I was there and glad that I was.  What we saw were federations 
that said they were having problems and were trying to resolve 
them.  That is not what we see in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Canadians tell the forum that they were having problems, 
that they had imposed the Constitution on Quebec in 1982, and 
that it could no longer be changed, when change was what was 
needed?  No, we did not hear that. 
Canada appeared as the model of a federation, but nobody was 
fooled, because Lucien Bouchard and Joseph Facal set out the 
problems.  They said what we are saying in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conference revealed more than just the problems that Canada 
did not want to reveal.  It also established that the issue of 
identity was important one.  The speaker everyone there 
acknowledged as the best spoke of the importance of identity. 
Other federations said that they were trying to satisfy the 
needs of groups, specifically, the federations based on two or 
three nations trying to accommodate them so that together they 
may improve the quality of life of their citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not ignore the fact either that the first person to 
point out that Canadian federalism had huge problems, was 
Ghislain Picard, who noted just how often native peoples had 
promises made to them put off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we have the throne speech.  I can't say right off that 
it was not worth forgoing the three weeks of session.  For 
Quebec, this is a throne speech of a unitarian country 
recognizing increasingly less its mere existence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word is mentioned once to say that the government will be 
concerned with the issue of clarity, as if 94% of Quebecers who 
voted the last time did not know that their question was clear. 
Even Jean Chrétien realized it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Yes.  I think the hon. 
member realized that we do not name members in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, I apologize; I meant to 
say the Prime Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Speech from the Throne.  The mentality in it is the 
same as at the international conference on federalism.  Canada 
is denying the problems. 
The Government of Canada is skirting the problems it itself 
created with the dramatic cuts to transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking of Quebec, and I may perhaps speak as well of the 
other provinces, which are dealing with problems in health care 
and education.  There are problems in postgraduate education, in 
helping the most disadvantaged. The government arrives and talks 
to us about the 21st century, applauded by the Liberal crowd. 
And what does it announce? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it announce help for the provinces in resolving their 
problems?  No.  It introduces new programs.  Will it help the 
unemployed live during the time it takes them to find a new job? 
No, the government introduces new programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terrible thing in this is that many people need money. 
These people find themselves in a situation created to a large 
extent by the federal cuts. They do not necessarily understand 
exactly how they ended up in that situation, because those who 
made the cuts and reduced services are those who manage the 
programs, that is the provincial governments. Nonetheless, the 
federal government will introduce new benefits for children, for 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If children are poor, it is because their families are poor. We 
saw the situation of the families deteriorate, and that is the 
most serious problem at the moment. Middle income earners, the 
middle class, are those who paid most, and there is absolutely 
no chance they will ever get enough for their money back, since 
there will be no new investments in health or education nor any 
money to help the neediest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that 1,200 new chairs were announced. I can talk about 
that because I was member of the industry committee. The main 
problem in postsecondary education comes from the context in 
which universities must operate. The creation of new chairs will 
not solve the problem. Of course, universities will gladly 
accept the money, but they are in dire need, like the hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government had had a real vision—and everybody will 
reach the new millennium at the same time, like Christmas and 
New Year Day—it would have started by working on the problems 
it created itself, to avoid becoming an outdated government, one 
that is out of touch, in spite of its desire to appear to be the 
best wired government in the world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, ten minutes is a short time for a lot of people in this 
parliament, but especially for the member for Mercier who, 
obviously, had a lot more to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She opened a door at the very end of her speech. She had only 
one minute left when she raised the problem of funding for 
universities, a problem which was created in part by the federal 
government. Members will recall the drastic cuts in research and 
development, which had a particular impact on universities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like her to comment on the following: this morning, 
in a newspaper, there was an article about maternity leave. I 
was struck by the title of this article written by Jean-Jacques 
Samson, from Quebec City, with whom I do not always agree, but 
who really did put his finger on the problem. He pointed out 
that the federal government wants to show some generosity by 
extending maternity leave without changing UI eligibility rules 
but, at the same time, that we must not forget that it no longer 
contributes to the UI fund. Only employers and employees 
contribute to the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the federal government not doing the same thing it did to the 
provinces, namely cutting transfer payments and using all kinds 
of schemes to look generous, trying to impress Canadians with 
other people's money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
first like to thank my colleague for the extra time granted to 
me. Ten minutes go by real fast. This reaction from a well-known 
Quebec journalist is sound and I was recently getting to the 
same conclusion although in a different way. Let us take for 
example the issue of maternity leave. I can tell you that most 
of those who phoned my constituency office had the simple 
reaction to say that the unemployment benefits are so low that 
instead of having a full year off, they would much rather have a 
shorter leave and get real benefits that would equal to much 
more than 55% of their salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that working women often do not earn much more than 
minimum wage. They also often do not work many hours, which 
means that they earn very little money. 
Consequently, even if we allow those low-income women to take a 
whole year off, if they do not have a spouse with a good salary, 
they will not be able to take advantage of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very simple way of answering to the government, by 
looking at ordinary people's reaction. If the government was 
really taking their problems into account instead of only 
reacting to the plans that the government of Quebec advanced and 
that it has a hard time to implement because of the lack of 
co-operation from the federal government, the government would 
grant real maternity leave. Real maternity leave is not one 
that only a few women can take advantage of. It certainly does not 
generate enough income, even if it is extended. 
There is a lot more to say about this Speech from the 
throne and the generous gifts that it contains, without taking 
into account the real situations and the problems that the 
government itself is responsible for. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate on 
the throne speech because three weeks ago the members of the 
Bloc who are in charge of social issues have stated that social 
equity should be the motto of this throne speech. When I 
consider this speech, I have to wonder if the government has 
really tried to uphold the principle of social equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It certainly has not found the right means to do it. We should 
not hide from the fact that the role of the federal government 
is to redistribute wealth, and it can do it through transfer 
payments, for example. It should also use the EI plan to make 
sure workers get a decent income when they are out of work. 
But its responsibility is not to create first line services. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not its turf. It has never succeeded in doing it 
efficiently and concretely, and it is not its constitutional 
responsibility to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first mistake of the federal government is that it did not 
limit its role. In Quebec and in Canada, nobody expected figures 
on tax reduction, but we were counting on clear indications that 
the federal government would significantly reduce the tax 
burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to do it, the federal government does not need to cut 
transfer payments or any other program. 
It can do so by simply stopping interfering in areas outside its 
jurisdiction and limiting its spending power to those areas 
under its responsibility, such as national defence and 
international affairs. If the federal government had restricted 
its involvement to these areas and had decided, for the two 
years left in its mandate, to deal only with its constitutional 
responsibilities, it could have freed up large sums of money 
that could have gone into the pockets of the middle class and 
the poor, on whose backs the battle against the deficit was won, 
and left some room for those actually in charge of important 
areas as health and education to levy taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, the federal government decided, for the sake of 
visibility, to forgo its responsibilities and revert to the old 
habits of the Liberal governments we knew in the 1960s and the 
1970s. We will have to keep a very close watch because we could 
very well face the same situation as before, with a federal 
government competing with the provinces, interfering in areas 
under their jurisdiction, buying off the provinces with millions 
of dollars, and trying to buy the silence of community groups, 
for instance. What we are seeing, such as wanting to provide 
services in the home, is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second point is this: if the government was really 
interested in social fairness, it would have significantly 
increased transfer payments. These days the economy is booming 
and production is on the rise. 
Our problem is the distribution of wealth, and this federal 
government has decided not to meet that challenge.  It was not 
flashy enough for it, not significant enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development, who is responsible 
for the department with most responsibility for the impact on 
the provinces, and for transfers, seems not to have been heeded 
by this government.  The measures she proposed probably did not 
give the federal government the visibility it wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By putting visibility before efficiency, however, the federal 
government is not fulfilling its role, and this impacts on 
direct services to the population provided by the provinces. 
The federal government is hiding behind the fact that it is not 
in the front line in providing services to the population, and 
it is washing its hands of the outcome. 
Then it comes along, a bit like a white knight, to provide home 
services over the heads of the provinces, who were not able to 
provide them because the federal government did not give them 
the necessary funding.  When it comes down to it, this attitude 
is close to being Machiavellian and it is something that, in my 
opinion, the population of Quebec and of Canada does not accept. 
They cannot see themselves in the throne speech that has just 
been delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third aspect that is close to my heart is the entire 
question of employment insurance.  With a tour and subsequently 
with the Employment Insurance Act, it has been demonstrated 
since 1994, with well-documented files and briefs, that 
implementation of this act had created a great many inequities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it possible that this speech contains nothing that will 
do away with the rule of intensity, which penalizes the seasonal 
workers?  How can the Liberals across the way accept the fact 
that their government, at a time when it has $6 billion in 
surplus employment insurance funds yearly, is incapable of 
putting an end to the injustice this rule of intensity 
represents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are some honourable members who do not know that this 
rule of intensity is, I will explain it to them.  Each time one 
of their constituents uses up 20 weeks of emploment insurance, 
his or her benefits are cut by 1%.  This means that, for a 
seasonal worker who works about twenty weeks each year, after 
three years, he or she will receive 50% of his average earnings, 
rather than 55%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people earn $9, $10 or $11 an hour, the difference between 
the two often represents the money necessary to make ends meet. 
If we were going through a terrible austerity period like the 
one in the early nineties, the government might be justified in 
saying “Everyone should do his or her share”. The government did 
not ask everyone to do his or her share, but it continues to 
make that request to people who have already done their share. 
People who have jobs in rural areas are not deemed to be 
unemployed but, in the end, they still do not have enough money 
to support their families. This is unacceptable. 
The government does not get a passing grade as regards this 
issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does social equity mean for the government? Is it that it 
did not use employment insurance to help seasonal workers and 
young people? Only 25% of all young workers qualify for 
employment insurance. They all contribute to the program now. 
They all have payroll deductions, but only 25% can get benefits. 
This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the throne speech talk about fairness and about 
providing funds for young people and children when the 
government is not giving anything more to the parents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most children in Canada live with their parents. It is the 
parents who support the family. If the government gives money 
only to children, it does not necessarily mean that these 
children will try harder to succeed in life, but it could result 
in the parents having an inadequate income. Children become more 
dependent on the state, whereas if parents receive an employment 
insurance cheque, it is because that money comes from an 
insurance program. They worked to earn that money and they made 
contributions to the program. The government did not at all 
achieve its objectives in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, I heard the Secretary of State for Rural 
Development tell us how dedicated he was to taking his 
responsibilities seriously.  If he wants results, he should 
speak to the Minister of Human Resources Development and the 
Minister of Finance and get this scrapped.  It is unacceptable. 
It is practically immoral that people should still be living 
like this in Canada, which calls itself a developed and well-off 
society.  This is something that has to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another example.  There is the wonderful announcement 
about parental leave.  The number of weeks of benefits will be 
increased to 52 from 26.  Bravo for women with children, or 
couples where the man decides to stay at home.  This gives them 
more weeks.  Great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what we were not told was whether, in order to qualify for 
this leave, 700 hours would still be required when, before the 
EI reform, 300 hours entitled one to maternity leave?  In 
Quebec, one woman out of five or six would qualify with the 
figure set at 700.  That is 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Try though they might to come up with the best scheme in the 
world, if no one qualifies, is that what we want?  All that is 
achieved is visibility, but it is temporary, not long term, 
because people are smart.  They are perfectly capable of seeing 
where this will lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, we saw this already in yesterday's news on 
television. 
Women who have, or want to have, a child, couples where the 
father wants to stay at home, are wondering “Am I going to be 
entitled to this?  Could it be more flexible?  Could I have the 
opportunity to benefit from it?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore important to settle this matter, and to have 
adequate parental leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by addressing what was not in this speech.  It 
is most astonishing, and if I were a private citizen and not in 
politics, I would say “What is going on there in the House of 
Commons?  They have a Speech from the Throne that announces 
policies for two years, but they do not mention anything about 
airlines”.  It is as if they had never heard of Air Canada and 
Canadian International Airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no mention of aboriginal rights and yet the media are 
full of stories about native fishers.  We see them daily on our 
TV.  There is scarcely any reference to organized crime, yet 
there are major problems with it too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can they prepare a speech that is supposed to give a vision 
of the country for the next two years but sending the following 
message to people “We are talking about things that have nothing 
at all to do with reality.  Don't bother listening.  It isn't 
worth the trouble”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why this approach that is divorced from reality?  Because this 
government is run by a federal bureaucracy that thinks for us, 
and decides what is right for us.  It puts visibility before 
efficiency.   That is where Canadian federalism is taking us. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the hon. member for raising an issue that we have 
not heard enough about in the debate.  We certainly did not hear 
any reference to it during the throne speech and we did not hear 
much reference to it in the subsequent follow up debate.  The 
issue I am talking about is the national scandal that exists in 
our EI system.  The hon. member pointed out some of its many, 
many flaws.  I would like to comment on this briefly and then ask 
him how he feels about a recommendation I would like to make. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1400"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Winnipeg Centre I have problems similar to what 
the hon. member pointed out.  The changes to the EI system have 
taken $20 million a year out of my riding alone, out of one inner 
city riding in Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we imagine the impact when $20 million a year that used to 
be transferred from the federal government to my riding is no 
longer there?  Let us look at the other side of the coin.  Can we 
imagine trying to get a new business to come to a riding with a 
$20 million payroll?  We would have to pave the streets with gold 
to try to get the business to come to our riding.  The inverse is 
also true.  We should be very alarmed when we lose a $20 million 
payroll just from changes to the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member pointed out the surplus that exists in the fund. 
There is a $600 million a month surplus.  We are paying in $600 
million a month more than we are getting out in benefits.  This 
is a national scandal.  I do not know why working people are not 
taking to the streets.  They should be furious about the issue. 
They certainly are where I come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne talked about finally dealing with 
labour market training in terms of national sectoral initiatives. 
That is something we have been advocating for decades within the 
building trades and the labour movement.  Finally we are getting 
reference to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Quebec has a very good system for labour market 
training through a 1% training levy.  In my industry that money 
is then managed through the CCQ, the Commission de la 
construction du Québec.  It manages that money and the training 
in that sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question and recommendation would be:  Can we not use some of 
the enormous surplus in the EI fund for these sectoral councils 
and make the correct model the national model for the whole 
country in terms of labour market training? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I like the example the member 
gave of his riding of Winnipeg Centre being out $20 million in 
EI.  Where I come from, in the Lower St. Lawrence region, the 
amount is $83 million in a given year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, in Moncton, in response to a question, the Minister 
of Human Resources Development said that she did not think that 
restoring benefits would change matters, or extend the seasonal 
industry.  This is tantamount to telling seasonal workers that 
they do not work longer because they do not want to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are both not possible?  Why could the seasonal industry's 
period of activities not be extended?  Why could we not take an 
original approach to this and develop our economy and, at the 
same time, make sure people have an adequate income?  Right now, 
they are being treated like economic guinea pigs.  The door is 
going to be shut; the requirements are going to be made so 
stringent that they will be driven back to work. But this is not 
what will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Montreal, a few weeks ago, there was a job fair.  I think 
10,000 people turned up in search of jobs.  People want jobs. 
What EI has done is to remove the stabilizing effect of the 
economy.  Today, in a period of economic growth, the federal 
government does is not playing its role of sharing out the 
wealth responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the member's question about the 1% rule.  In fact, 
this allows the focus to be put on training.  This is one way of 
preparing ourselves to compete with the rest of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was another example of that recently.  The Quebec minister 
responsible for economic development, Bernard Landry, offered to 
help subcontractors obtain contracts with General Motors, to 
provide them with the conditions that would enable them to 
develop things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry reacted by saying “No, no, we must not 
intervene like that.  We have to let the General Motors plant in 
Quebec close”.  However, they will make sure the one in Ontario 
stays open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no future over there.  We need a government that is 
responsible in both social and economic terms.  Quebecers 
realize, in addition, that they have one government too many in 
Canada. It leads to decisions that are unacceptable and 
inappropriate for the future of Quebecers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Toronto Centre—Rosedale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The residents of Waterloo—Wellington have gratefully received 
the throne speech and what it entails.  That bodes well for us as 
a government and certainly as Canadians.  That is important to 
note.  I also thank my colleague, the hon. member for 
Windsor—St. Clair, for moving the Address in Reply to the Speech 
from the Throne and the hon. member for Laval West for seconding 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I extend my congratulations to Her Excellency the Governor 
General for being installed in that prestigious position.  It is 
one which the residents of Waterloo—Wellington think is a great 
position for her.  We are grateful for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to look at some of the health care provisions provided in 
the throne speech.  The government continues to be deeply 
committed to a universal and publicly administered health care 
system that delivers the highest quality health care to all 
Canadians, no matter where they live in this great country of 
ours.  As reiterated in the Speech from Throne on October 12, 
good health and quality care are essential to the well-being of 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures announced in the 1999 federal budget will improve 
access to quality care and help restore the confidence of 
Canadians in the future of medicare, but a high quality health 
care system depends on more than money.  It requires adjustments 
in the way health care is organized and delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At their meeting in September 1999 in Charlottetown, health 
ministers from all Canadian provinces and territories underlined 
access to quality care and its link to an appropriate supply, 
deployment and distribution of highly qualified health 
professionals.  Those ministers agreed to continue to work 
collaboratively on health resources and the human resources 
necessary in planning, having noted concrete progress in this 
area.  That is also important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech puts further emphasis on the government's 
connectedness agenda to ensure that Canada is economically 
competitive in a global marketplace and to improve the quality of 
life of Canadians.  Investments in the health infrastructure have 
an important role to play in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have noted, a modern health information system will give 
health professionals and individual citizens improved access to 
up to date information about health issues and treatment options. 
The government will ensure that citizens in every region of this 
great country have access to such information so that they too 
can make better informed decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the government's plan to improve Canada's information 
infrastructure, the government will reintroduce legislation to 
protect personal and business information in the digital world. 
The reintroduction of the bill, formerly Bill C-54, will have 
some impact on the development of the health infrastructure. 
Examples will include that Canada's privacy concerns are 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's intention to build on the personal gateway 
project to the government information and community content, 
www.access.ca, could tie into the health infrastructure 
initiatives such as a Canadian Health Network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the government's five year plan for improving 
physical infrastructure includes telecommunication in health. The 
government will also take steps to modernize overall health 
protection for a changing world.  Investments in the health 
protection branch national health surveillance infrastructure 
will be part of this modernization process.  That too is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will also continue to address the serious health 
problems in aboriginal communities, for example, supporting their 
efforts to promote wellness and to strengthen the delivery of 
health services for them.  The first nations health information 
system can help achieve this objective in a very meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government announced in last February's budget that it was 
providing $328 million over three years to start building a truly 
national network of information about health and health services 
to strengthen the health care system and make it more accountable 
to Canadians.  All these measures are important to Canadians as 
core values for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn my attention to the Canadian Institutes of Health 
Research which are important vehicles.  It will fund health 
research that will improve the quality of life and health of 
Canadians and lead to more effective health products and services 
and will result in the strengthening of the Canadian health care 
system. 
It will offer unique opportunities for economic development in 
the knowledge based economy.  This initiative came from the 
research community which has been working closely with health 
officials to develop the design and structure of the CIHR.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIHR will integrate the wide range of approaches to health 
research under a single umbrella organization, providing 
co-ordination and support for these efforts based on a shared 
health research agenda.  Biomedical scientists will work 
collaboratively with clinic researchers; researchers specializing 
in health services and systems; and researchers working on the 
health of populations, societal and cultural dimensions of health 
and environmental influences on health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIHR will be a truly national institution, breaking down 
traditional barriers between disparate research sectors and 
different research agencies.  It will establish strong, 
co-operative partnerships among researchers, research funders in 
federal, provincial and territorial governments, voluntary health 
organizations in the private sector and users of health research 
in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtual health research institutes will link researchers working 
on a common theme.  These institutes will be guided by a strong 
ethical framework and will adopt integrated multidisciplinary 
approaches to health research as a whole.  The CIHR will provide 
opportunities and support for Canadian scientists to participate 
in international collaborations for the benefit of all Canadians, 
no matter where they live and within the wider global community 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget last February the government gave $50 million a 
year for three years to the granting councils to work toward the 
objectives of the CIHR.  The impact of this new funding has 
already been felt in the research community.  I look forward to 
the CIHR bill being introduced this fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now turn briefly to a discussion of the Canada health and 
social transfer, the CHST.  In the budget of 1999 the Government 
of Canada announced an investment of $11.5 billion over five 
years in health care.  This was the single largest new investment 
the government ever made.  The increase in the CHST cash from the 
previous 1999 budget level of $12.5 billion to $15 billion by 
2001-02 takes what is regarded as the health component of the 
CHST to as high a level as it was before the period of 
expenditure restraint in the mid-1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget of 1999 also dealt with the issue of equitable 
distribution of the CHST to provinces and territories.  By 
2001-02, CHST entitlements will be distributed on an equal per 
capita basis.  As a result provinces and territories will receive 
$985 per capita in CHST entitlements by the year 2003-04.  This 
increase clearly demonstrates the government's determination to 
work with all our partners to provide the absolutely best health 
care possible to all our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne reaffirmed the government's 
commitment to move forward with our partners in the health care 
community on a common priority and common front.  They include 
supporting the testing of innovations in integrated service areas 
such as home care and pharmacare, ensuring that citizens in every 
region of the country have improved access to up to date 
information about health issues and treatment options through the 
modern health information system so that they can make good 
choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this underscores what we are up to as a government in terms 
of the throne speech and the vision that will take us into the 
21st century.  It is important to note that as we march 
confidently into the 21st century we do so by linking arms with 
all Canadians and not, as some would have us do, by leaving some 
Canadians behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us as a government on behalf of all Canadians keep our focus 
on the opportunities of the future in the 21st century and not on 
the grievances of the past.  In the spirit of co-operation, 
fairness and equity that is precisely what we as a government are 
doing.  We are doing it with vision, foresight and compassion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have a quick question for the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Emphasis on health and the importance of health is always right 
up front in the minds of many Canadians.  This government has 
been in power since 1993.  The report has just come out that one 
in six children across the country are going to school hungry. It 
is three times worse now than it was in 1993.  Homelessness is 
double what it was in 1993.  Poverty is up 100% from what it was 
in 1993.  There is squalor and third world conditions on many 
reserves. It is far worse than it was in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member please give me the government's excuses for 
allowing this to happen in the last six years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do know there are 
ongoing problems that we as Canadians face and that certainly we 
as a government face.  It requires a concerted effort on the part 
of all parliamentarians and all Canadians to address those 
problems.  We need to attack those areas that need attention.  I 
think the member heard that in the throne speech, if he was 
paying attention and I hope he was. We are on the cusp of doing 
great things with respect to our children's agenda for example, 
and issues related to the homeless and poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will as a government do the kinds of things that are 
necessary to put in place initiatives to ensure that those 
problems are eradicated.  Canadians expect no less of us and that 
is what we as a government will be doing.  We will be doing it 
with vision and foresight, unlike the party opposite which 
instead of uniting Canadians in a common cause to eradicate 
problems seems determined always to take extremist views that 
pull people apart, that pit region against region, people against 
people and group against group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on the government side will have no part of that agenda. 
Mercifully and thank God that we do not.  We know what we have to 
do.  We will do the right thing in terms of all the issues noted. 
We will do it with vigour and with the compassion that Canadians 
know only we can provide. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member talks about doing the right thing. I want to 
ask him about a very big crisis facing our country, namely the 
farming crisis on the prairies, the drop in farm income.  Farm 
income is going down to negative levels.  It is the biggest 
crisis since the 1930s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have in Saskatchewan and Manitoba a joint alliance 
between all the political parties.  For example, in my province 
of Saskatchewan all three political parties and the farm groups 
have gotten together and are requesting of the federal government 
an additional $1 billion in terms of emergency farm aid for our 
province.  I am not talking about the AIDA program that is there 
now.  I am talking about an additional $1 billion minimum of farm 
aid and farm assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the largest farm crisis since the 1930s.  People are going 
bankrupt.  People are under stress.  We have many letters here 
from children who have written about the stress in their families 
and the financial pain they are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has united all three political parties.  It has united the 
farm groups and the chamber of commerce.  It is a crisis like I 
have never seen because unlike the member, I was not here in the 
1930s.  It is a long time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member whether he is open to helping us put 
pressure on the Minister of Finance and the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food to use some of the several billions of 
dollars of surplus that are now accumulating to help farmers stay 
on the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind him that every time a farmer is better off in this 
country, we are all better off.  When the farmer is better off, 
there are more jobs in the towns, cities and villages across the 
country.  When the people have more jobs and the economy is 
stronger, there is more money for health care, there is more 
money for tax cuts and there is more money for education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the member will help us in that lobby is my question.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I really do not need to be 
lectured by the member opposite about the importance of farmers. 
I still live on the family farm and we settled in 1827.  I know 
the importance of what the family farm means.  I am still on it. 
I still live it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was part of the tour that went to Saskatchewan and Manitoba 
this summer. I know firsthand the kinds of heartache those 
farmers are facing.  It is very real and it is very disturbing. 
We as a government, as the minister of agriculture mentioned 
today, along with our provincial partners have committed the 
kinds of resources that are necessary to do the right thing in 
that very important area. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise on debate in response to the Speech 
from the Throne.  I would like to echo the words of the member 
for Vancouver Kingsway and the member for Waterloo—Wellington 
who congratulated the Governor General on her appointment and on 
the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Governor General's words were particularly welcome to those 
of us in Toronto Centre—Rosedale because the Governor General 
and her husband John Ralston Saul live in Toronto 
Centre—Rosedale.  We are all very proud to see her installed as 
our new Governor General.  We are proud of what she represents to 
this country, looking forward into the future of the 21st 
century, representing what is the best of Canadians and Canadian 
developments in the 20th century. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also represent Toronto's bicultural dimension and its 
bilingualism, anglophones who speak French and who have 
incorporated our country's French element into their culture and 
into Toronto's multiculturalism. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Toronto Centre—Rosedale is an extremely diverse riding in the 
middle of downtown Toronto.  St. James town has 20,000 people 
living in it.  Fifty-seven different languages are spoken there. 
Those languages are spoken by people who live and work here in 
Canada together because we have established a country which has 
as its base a certain notion of tolerance and a willingness to 
work together.  We have certain Canadian values that make that 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What about the value of equality for all 
the people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham:</B>  That is why those people are there. They 
have a sense of the value of equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding also happens to have the largest gay and lesbian 
community in Canada, which the hon. member opposite knows 
something about because his party is already trying to make sure 
they are not treated as equals. As members will recall this House 
adopted measures in the last parliament to ensure that that 
community will be properly treated. We now wait for legislation 
which will bring into effect those values of equality.  We will 
see how the opposition party treats those matters when they come 
before the House when we talk about equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at the businessmen in our ridings.  We are aware of 
the economic requirements of a modern economy, or the cultural 
dimension of my riding in Cabbagetown, or the universities and 
community colleges.  We are proud to have in our riding the 
University of Toronto, Ryerson university, George Brown community 
college and Collège des Grands Lacs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proud to have mixed communities like that of St. Lawrence 
where an enormous number of co-ops are contributing to the way in 
which we manage our relations in a complex urban environment 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne responds to the needs of this 
community as it responds to the needs generally of Canadians.  It 
addresses the needs of children.  It addresses the need for 
investment in science and technology so that our universities and 
researchers can grow and make this a stronger country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech addresses the issues of the environment, 
health and agriculture in spite of some of the comments that were 
made in the House today.  The north is very important for this 
country and is seldom mentioned.  It was important for us to see 
mention of the north and our arctic in the Speech from the 
Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also addresses the needs of the business community to see tax 
reductions. We heard today in question period of $16.5 billion 
projected for the future with possibilities of greater reductions 
to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a balanced approach, exactly what I would have expected of 
the government.  It focuses on the needs of Canadians generally 
to ensure that those in society have a good government that 
furnishes them with the services they need and at the same time 
ensures that we have a healthy and vibrant economy that is able 
to deliver those services.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne had another very important dimension 
to it, which I think members of the House would be equally 
interested in, and that is the international dimension. The 
Speech from the Throne spoke of the role of Canada and Canadians 
in a world that is evolving.  It recognized that we cannot be 
prosperous or healthy in a world that is not prosperous and 
healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government understands that Canadians live in an integrated 
world and that activities outside our borders affect us on a 
daily basis.  We are adapting ourselves to world conditions in a 
responsible way and in a way to ensure that Canadian values and 
interests are protected in that world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the area of trade and economics, we see that the 
policies that are being adopted by the government, both in the 
WTO and the FTAA, are responsive to Canadians' concerns.  When 
the foreign affairs committee travelled across the country there 
was an intense interest from Canadians on this subject.  They 
were determined to have human rights, labour standards and the 
environment put at the forefront of our concerns at the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are also concerned that globalization is forcing 
changes on us which we do not wish to accept.  Our determination 
therefore is to ensure that the institutions in which Canada is 
represented abroad will both protect and advance our values and 
interests.  As the member for Peace River reminds me, that 
includes the interests of agriculture which will certainly be at 
the forefront of the discussions in Seattle as he well knows, and 
which our government will make sure is made a priority point for 
the government in those negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also recognizes that state sovereignty is changing in the 
world today.  The people's needs have to be put ahead of those of 
states.  That is why we have our peacekeepers in places like 
Bosnia, Haiti and East Timor where the safety of women and 
children has become a preoccupation of governments and where the 
international control of drugs and crime is a focal point of what 
our government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, it is what our foreign affairs minister calls the 
human security agenda.  It is the agenda of ensuring that 
individuals are more important than states as we go into the 21st 
century in a world in which borders and state sovereignty is 
being eroded in favour of individual protection and the need to 
ensure that everybody is guaranteed a better standard of living 
throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are a generous people.  We recognize that in helping 
our neighbours we help ourselves.  In that respect, the member 
would be happy to recognize that the Speech from the Throne spoke 
of an increased need for Canadian aid to underdeveloped 
countries.  We will rebuild our need for aid to underdeveloped 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We rejoice in today's announcement that Médecins Sans Frontières 
has been named for a Nobel prize this year.  As members know, 
there is a Médecins Sans Frontières in Canada.  We have young 
doctors from Canada and non-doctors who work with that 
organization outside our borders.  They all contribute to the 
well-being of the world in exactly the same way as our modern 
NGOs do in providing a different type of world, a different type 
of international arrangement within which we all participate. The 
Speech from the Throne spoke directly to that and it is an 
inspiration for us all to enable us to be more effective with our 
global responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the perspective of the people in my riding, and I believe 
from the perspective of all Canadians, the Speech from the Throne 
demonstrated a balance between what we need in terms of providing 
services for Canadians and a sense of what our society needs, 
both in the present and in the future.  This was evidenced by our 
increased funding for universities and our increased funding for 
health care, which are concerns for Canadians.  It focused on the 
needs of today's Canadians and on the needs of Canadians in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be accomplished in the broader context of a world in 
which Canadians will play a role.  As we go into the 21st century 
we will make sure that our interests and values are secure here 
at home and secure in the world.  The Speech from the Throne 
demonstrates the ability of the government to achieve that.
