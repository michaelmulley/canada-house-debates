	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
recently the Hamilton-Niagara region hosted a meeting of the 
environment ministers from the G-7 countries. My work on the 
House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs has 
reinforced for me the necessity of acting on a global level. As 
nations, our economies and environments are intrinsically 
linked and must be addressed globally. The G-7 visit gave the 
Hamilton-Niagara region an opportunity to demonstrate its 
commitment to environmental sustainability.
<P>
	As a well respected member of the international community, 
Canada has every reason to be proud of its environmental 
accomplishments in local communities like Hamilton-Niagara 
and on a national level. Later this year we will host the G-7 
summit in Halifax. This will give us an additional opportunity to 
show the world Canada's achievements.

anyone who has watched the activities of Opération Dignité in 
eastern Quebec knows that it is fully committed to keeping

living in rural Quebec to live with dignity. Unfortunately, his 
relentless work negatively affected his health, which had been 
deteriorating for many years.
<P>
	Jean-Marc, you gave your life so that others could take charge

	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this week has been declared both national forestry 
week and national mining week. Last year these two industries 
jointly provided 421,000 direct Canadian jobs. For 1993, 
forestry and mining together accounted for $10 billion more to 
Canada's balance of trade, meaning exports minus imports, than 
the combined production of energy, automotive vehicles and 
parts, agriculture and fishing.
<P>
	Last week I had the pleasure of attending the AGM of the B.C. 
Interior Lumber Manufacturers Association. Far from being a 
sunset industry, these people represent world leading 
companies, which are constantly inventing better ways to use 
our natural resources with improved environmental safeguards 
and full cooperation with all who depend on our beautiful but 
limited land base.
<P>
	On behalf of all Canadians, I want to thank the forest and 
mining industries for their continued contribution to making 
Canada one of the most prosperous nations on earth.

Mr. Speaker, this is national forestry week in Canada and I want

tremendous job to make this special week a successful one

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRANSFERPAYMENTS">TRANSFER PAYMENTS</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday in his budget speech, the Quebec 
Minister of Finance brought home the negative impact of the 
massive cuts to the federal transfer payments used to fund social 
programs, which were announced in February's budget. While 
hastening its financial withdrawal, Ottawa intends to maintain 
its national standards, indeed impose new ones.
<P>
	The Quebec Minister of Finance said yesterday, and I quote: 
``By the end of the decade, the federal government will no 
longer be making any transfer payments to Quebec for social 
programs. In fact, Quebec will be making payments to the 
federal government''.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Would the 
minister confirm the conclusion reached by his Quebec 
counterpart to the effect that the massive cuts made in his most 
recent budget to transfer payments to the provinces to fund 
social programs will mean a shortfall of $650 million next year 
for Quebec and of $1.9 billion in 1997-98, if the federal 
government continues its practice of allocation on a per capita 
basis, as he himself has said?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we have discussed 
this repeatedly. The shortfall next year will be $350 million. As 
regards the following year, we will have discussions and 
negotiations to decide how we will allocate federal transfers to 
the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am not surprised by the deficits we are running 
up, because the Minister of Finance seems unable to count. He 
continues to deny figures that are perfectly clear, figures arrived 
at through his own budget calculations.
<P>
	Would the minister acknowledge that, as of 1999, in four 
years' time, Quebec will no longer receive any transfer 
payments for social programs, but will in fact have to send a 
cheque to Ottawa for the Canada social transfer paid to other 
provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, ages ago, 
discussions were held between the provinces and the federal 
government, and tax points were transferred to the provinces as 
the result of these discussions. Quebec in fact received more tax 
points than other provinces.
<P>
	However, the Minister of Human Resources Development, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and I have clearly 
indicated our intention to begin negotiations with the provinces 
to enable both the federal  government and the provinces to 
straighten out and stabilize public finances.
<P>
	Now, as to the first point, where the Leader of the Opposition 
was finding fault with my figures, I would suggest that, if he 
does not agree with equalization payments, he should say so. 
However, if he agrees that Quebec benefits enormously from 
equalization payments, he will acknowledge that my figures are 
valid.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if I were the minister, I would feel somewhat 
embarrassed about alluding to equalization payments, given that 
his first act in January 1994 was to cap equalization payments 
thereby depriving the provinces of $1.5 billion over the next five 
years.
<P>
	The minister acknowledges that the federal government is 
hastening its withdrawal from transfer payments for social 
programs. Under these conditions, how can he talk seriously of a 
cost effective and flexible federal system, when he will be 
depriving Quebec of $2.5 billion over the next two years and 
when Ottawa will no longer pay a cent to fund social programs 
by 1999, all the while maintaining its tax base and claiming to 
set national standards in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I do not know 
where the Leader of the Opposition keeps getting these 
misleading figures, which have no basis in reality. Perhaps they 
help his argument. Some of his figures are global, but, as we 
have already said, we are going to have to negotiate with the 
provinces individually.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	As for equalization payments, we have signed the agreement 
with the provinces. In other words, we have succeeded in 
reaching an agreement, something the previous government, of 
which the Leader of the Opposition was a member, had refused 
to do during its term of office.

obligation to consult in a prescribed manner with the James Bay 
Cree and the native bands of Yukon.
<P>
	Section 24.4.26 of the James Bay and Northern Quebec 
Agreement states that all regulations relating to the hunting,

	Yesterday it became quite clear that the Minister of Justice 
failed to consult the James Bay Cree or the aboriginal people in 
Yukon on his proposed gun control bill in the prescribed manner. 
According to the Liberal chair of the justice committee this 
makes the entire legislative process unconstitutional.

gun control bill in the prescribed manner?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I record my 
astonishment that such a question would emerge from the party 
that to date has refused to meet with aboriginal people, 
describing them as a special interest group.
<P>

against every single piece of legislation introduced in the House 
to advance aboriginal rights and that less than a year ago voted 
against legislation giving rights of self-government to the 
Indians in Yukon to which the leader has referred.
<P>
	The record will show that I consulted throughout the country 
before preparing the proposals that are engendered in Bill C-68. 
In addition to the consultations carried out in advance of the 
legislation, we have already put in place an elaborate and

said, as he said again today, that it was the result of the most 
extensive consultative process known to man. He had consulted 
everyone from Elvis Presley to the ghost of Mackenzie King.
<P>
	The evidence is now mounting to suggest the minister's 
information tour was neither extensive nor substantive in many

Cree agreement and the provincial politicians in Alberta and 
Saskatchewan say the minister's consultations were a joke.
<P>
	Has the minister assessed the damage that can now be done to 
federal-provincial and aboriginal relations if the government 
rams through this defective bill in its present form?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for a period of almost 
one year I have met with individuals, groups, associations and 
representatives of governments at all levels in the country to 
discuss firearms' control. That consultation has been complete 
and entirely in accordance with our legal and constitutional 
responsibilities.
<P>
	To listen to the leader of the third party one would conclude 
that to him consultation means doing exactly what he would 
have us do. In fact, the consultations in which we have 
participated over this last year have resulted in a bill which is 
respectful of and responsive to the needs of aboriginal peoples, 
among others, in the country.
<P>
	We will proceed with the legislation which is very much in the 
public interest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr.

<P>
Attorney General of Saskatchewan and representatives of the

<P>
	What we have here with respect to gun control is yet another 
top down, made in Ottawa solution to a problem; the NEP, like 
the Charlottetown accord, like the TAGS program and a whole 
bunch of others. They start with an allegedly high level of 
consultation and high levels of support which then diminish as 
the provinces and the people get a look at the content and 
discover the flaws.
<P>
	Is the minister willing even at this late date to listen and 
respond by incorporating legitimate concerns of Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, the James Bay Cree, the Yukon First Nations into 
his gun control proposals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the contradictions in 
the hon. member's position are almost too numerous to identify 
in these brief moments.
<P>
	Let me begin by observing that he is hardly in a position to 
champion aboriginal rights in the House of Commons. Second, 
this is the party of law and order that in not supporting Bill 
C-68, stands against the chiefs of police and frontline police 
officers.
<P>
	This is the party that would have us listen to the people. The 
Attorney General of Alberta comes to this city and tells us he 
opposes gun control when his own public opinion poll shows 
that two out of every three people in his province are in favour of 
it.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the Quebec Minister of Finance announced 
yesterday that the Quebec government intended to implement a 
series of measures to give the province a real policy on 
manpower training, he requested that the unemployment 
insurance premiums levied in Quebec be reduced, and I quote: 
``These premiums are at any rate too high, given that the 
unemployment insurance fund is now in a surplus position and 
that the federal government is using some of the premiums to 
intervene in programs which are in fact our responsibility''.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance intend to follow up on his 
counterpart's urgent request to reduce the unemployment 
insurance contributions of Quebec businesses, which would 
prove that he is dedicated to job creation and that the federal 
government is moving towards withdrawing from the sector of 
manpower training?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, members of 
Quebec's business community clearly indicated at our meetings 
with them that they preferred to accumulate a surplus in their 
fund to ensure that there will be no need to increase premiums 
during the next economic downturn, like what happened during 
the last one. Such is our intention. We would certainly like to 
reduce them, but we would also like to keep them at that level 
once they are reduced.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, are we to understand by the Minister of Finance's 
evasive reply that he will continue to skim money from the 
unemployment insurance fund, to use the huge surpluses that he 
is generating by setting premiums too high to increasingly 
interfere in a sector where he has no business being and stifle 
Quebec's job creation efforts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if my answer 
seemed evasive, I will repeat it. It is the members of the business 
community in Canada, in Quebec, and in Montreal who asked us 
not to lower the premiums, but to create a surplus in the 
unemployment insurance fund, because they do not want to have 
to increase premiums during the next economic downturn, as 
such increases are a real hindrance to job creation.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Consultation was engaged continuously with officials in the offices of every

	The attorneys general of Saskatchewan, Alberta and Yukon 
have flatly denied there was any serious consultation, let alone 
continuous consultation.

	Will the justice minister explain the enormous contradiction 
between his statement to the House and the declarations of these 
attorneys general?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

made on December 7 was true then and it is true now.
<P>
	The officials in provincial governments were kept abreast 
throughout the process last year. They were told exactly the 
proposals that were under consideration. The paper of 
November 30 came as no surprise to any of them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12414"> 12414 </A></B>
<P>
	In so far as the province of Alberta is concerned, we already 
know from the attorney general's poll in that province that 
two-thirds of the people of Alberta support the proposals.
<P>
	As far as Saskatchewan is concerned, I suggest the hon. 
member wait until after the election in that province in June at 
which point this will become a lot less significant for that 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have a 
good idea of what happened in Manitoba where the Liberals lost 
50 per cent of their seats.
<P>
	Aboriginal representatives from Yukon as well as the James 
Bay Cree claim a constitutional right to be consulted in the 
prescribed manner before the enactment of Bill C-68. Both 
groups claim consultation in the prescribed manner never took 
place. The James Bay Cree indicate their letters to the justice 
minister regarding the matter were never even answered.
<P>
	How does the minister explain the violation of the 
constitutional rights of these aboriginal peoples?
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, neither the Department 
of Justice nor the government has any lessons to learn from the 
hon. member with respect to consulting aboriginal people.
<P>
	During the course of past months I have visited the Inuit in the 
Northwest Territories. I have travelled to Yukon. I have been to 
the northern parts of every province to speak with aboriginal 
communities to learn their concerns and their perspectives on 
the issue.
<P>
	I urge the hon. member to do exactly the same. Let him learn 
as I have the perspective of aboriginal communities. He will 
learn as I have the appalling fact that firearms are the leading 
cause of accidents and death in many of these communities.
<P>
	We are confident we have complied with every constitutional 
obligation for consultation. That consultation continues and it

the federal government is launching a series of pilot projects at 
Canada Employment Centres in Quebec. In Jonquière, for 
instance, we have one of the first single-wicket operations, 
where the federal government wants to control manpower 
training by bringing all agencies that provide manpower 
training under the aegis of the Canada Employment Centre.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. Does the minister realize that his government's pilot 
project directly contradicts a consensus in Quebec on the need 
for transferring  manpower training to Quebec, and that this is an 
instance of direct provocation aimed at the Quebec government?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to

Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	The hon. member should know that the federal government 
has co-operated a great deal with the provincial governments 
throughout Canada. As a matter of fact, there are proposals 
tabled with the provinces that speak to the clarification of the 
responsibilities of both the federal and provincial governments 
to arrive at the delivery of a more efficient system so that at the 
end of the day the people of Canada, whether they live in Quebec 
or outside Quebec, can have the best possible service.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs must know that the 
most important mechanism in this respect in Quebec is the 
Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre. 
Would the minister agree that setting up an entirely new federal 
manpower network is a clear indication that Ottawa has no 
intention of transferring manpower training to Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Resources Development Canada had approximately 50,000 
labour market contracts in Quebec; 9,600 contracts with 
non-profit organizations; 9,300 contracts with private sector 
firms; and 2,800 contracts with public sector organizations.
<P>
	The point I am making is that there is a need to deal with these 
individuals. At the end of the day Quebecers will realize that 
there is a role for the federal government to play in co-operation 
with the provinces and local organizations.

question is for the minister of Indian affairs.
<P>
	Since the minister was instrumental in establishing a modern 
agreement with the natives of Yukon, why has he not insisted on 
consultation with the justice department in the creation of Bill 
C-68?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last September I had 
the privilege of visiting the Yukon territory, meeting with 
representatives of the Council for Yukon Indians, discussing 
with them their perspective on firearms, reviewing the options, 
going to communities like Kwanlun Dun outside Whitehorse, 
meeting with  members of those communities, talking about the 
way 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12415"> 12415 </A></B>
<P>
firearms are used as tools, talking about community needs and 
becoming sensitive to perspectives of the aboriginal 
communities on the issues.
<P>
	That perspective is reflected in Bill C-68. I point out, as the 
hon. member will know as a member of the committee that is 
considering it, that section 110(t) of Bill C-68 provides 
expressly that provision can be made for the manner in which 
the bill is implemented in aboriginal communities, including 
those in Yukon.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	That is the kind of approach we think is right to achieve 
community safety while respecting the aboriginal perspective.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, he is 
talking about something once it becomes law. I guess the real 
problem is that big city lawyers do not understand the word 
consultation.
<P>
	According to the agreements consultation must take place 
when any legislation may have an impact on hunting and 
trapping activities. It seems strange to me that consultation 
takes place after the legislation has received second reading.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to listen to the recommendations of 
Yukon natives who say to stop the proceedings until the proper 
procedures are followed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, September of last year 
was some five months before the bill was tabled in the House. 
That was consultation before the tabling of legislation.

	As far as the point of view of the people of Yukon is 
concerned, the committee of which the hon. member is a part is 
now listening in detail to the evidence of witnesses. I have no 
doubt they will have proposals to make to improve the 
legislation, but in the final analysis the government remains

what is needed to enhance community safety throughout the

<P>
	However, previous solicitors general have publicly identified 
Warren Hart, Claude Morin and Marc Boivin as RCMP security

liberty to do so because these individuals had identified 
themselves as human sources. Luke Desilets also identified 
himself as a human source for CSIS.

the parliamentary secretary, continues to hide behind section 18 
of the CSIS Act. If he would read down to section 18, paragraph 
2, he would see that Parliament also gave him the authority to 
reveal the identity of a source just like his predecessors did.

On November 1, 1991, the Transport ministers of Canada, 
Quebec and Ontario announced they would share the cost of a $6 
million feasibility study on operating a high speed train similar 
to the TGV in the Quebec-Windsor corridor. This study was to 
be finished not later than November 1993, and the agreement 
between the three governments expired on March 31, 1994.
<P>

to this unacceptable situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr.

rather tricky situation. Since three governments are 
involved-the Government of Quebec, the Government of 
Ontario and the federal government-a consensus among all 
three governments is essential before the study is submitted to 
the responsible minister and published.
<P>
	Discussions are continuing to see if we can reach a consensus 
on the report. In fact, our deputy minister met his Quebec 
counterpart not long go, and the change of ministers in Ontario 
may have delayed things as well.

<P>
	Considering the studies he already has, including the joint

charged to ministerial budgets ``indications are that some

<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

it is rather ironic that the President of the Treasury Board said 
that.
<P>
	I want to quote again from this document we have. ``The cost 
sharing will in effect allow ministers to respend the amount thus 
saved. This will result in an increase to the costs of running 
ministers' offices''.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Since the 
Prime Minister's office provided concurrence on this financial

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Agriculture. Part III of the 
Estimates of the Department of Agriculture provides that, and I 
quote: ``Dairy policy is expected to be a focus of analysis in 
1995-96 and will cover the impact of the introduction of 
recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST) in Canada''.
<P>
	In view of the fact that available studies appear not to contain 
sufficient information to permit the marketing of the hormone 
and that the Department of Health has not announced any change 
in this regard, how does the minister explain the hormone's 
expected arrival on the scene this year?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. gentleman is 
perhaps misinterpreting that particular phrase used in part III of 
the estimates.
<P>
	Obviously the issue of RBST use in Canada is under 
investigation at the present time in two different forums. One is 
the established legal regulatory forum which is under the 
jurisdiction of my colleague, the Minister of Health. As I 
understand it the appropriate officials in the Department of 
Health have not yet arrived at any determination as to what some 
future decision may or may not be with respect to RBST use in 
Canada.
<P>
	Last year a second analysis was undertaken quite apart and 
independent from the regulatory jurisdiction of the Department 
of Health. That study was initiated by the agriculture committee 
of the House of Commons. It held public hearings and made a 
number of recommendations, including the proposal that 
whatever the regulatory decision of the Department of Health 
might turn out to be that at least for a one-year period the 
potential use of RBST in Canada ought to be delayed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> We negotiated that delay with the companies.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am in receipt of a letter sent to the minister of Indian 
affairs on March 21 by members of the Yellow Quill band in 
Saskatchewan. In it there are serious allegations regarding the 
misuse of band assets, capital project funding and housing 
moneys. As of February 14 the band was running a $2 million 
deficit. Band members have called upon the minister to uphold 
his fiduciary obligation and make their chief and council 
account for all spending.
<P>
	The minister has had this letter for a month and a half and his 
officials have known about this problem for much longer. What 
has the minister done about it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	As he will know, under Bill C-76 the Canada social transfer 
section clearly is a fundamental restructuring of Canada and of 
our national health care and social programs. A United Nations 
committee has expressed concern. I do not believe that 
anywhere in the very much mentioned Liberal red book was it 
suggested to the Canadian public that we would fundamentally 
adopt a Reform Party policy in transferring these programs to 
the provinces.
<P>
	Given the fundamental restructuring that this section on the 
Canadian social transfer represents, would he appoint an 
independent commission? We have done this in the past with the 
Hall commission and the Macdonald commission. It could study 
this particular section and come back truly with an independent 
view of what this means for the future of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as has already 
happened a couple of times today, the premise of the question is 
absolutely wrong.
<P>
	The fact is that the CHST enables the federal government 
along with the provincial governments to maintain in place a 
sustainable and highly progressive set of social programs.

be no residency requirement for welfare and its even greater 
covenant that the principles of the Canada Health Act will never 
be taken away from us.

	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. Throughout 
its history Canada has benefited from periodic infusions of 
capital investment from countries across the globe. In recent 
years however, foreign investors have viewed Canadian markets 
with some reluctance.
<P>
	Can the minister inform the House what is being done to 
improve the attractiveness of Canada to foreign investors?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the premise of the 
question is dead on.
<P>
	It is very important for Canada to maintain a good climate for 
investment. That means a sound balance sheet. That is why we 
are so pleased the budget of last February was so well received 
by the international markets and by Canadians.
<P>
	At the same time we have to recognize that as a low inflation 
country for which we paid a very dear penalty we must maintain 
the tremendous asset of low inflation and very high productivity 
of our workforce.
<P>
	We must congratulate the Minister of Human Resources 
Development for this transition from passive to active support. 
The new industrial policy is trade policy with the trade mission 
of the Prime Minister. I would congratulate my colleague the 
Minister for International for International Trade.

<P>
	This particular petition has been signed by a number of 
petitioners from the Lethbridge, Alberta area. The petitioners 
would like to draw to the attention of the House that managing 
the family home and caring for preschool children is an 
honourable profession which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society.

	They also state that the Income Tax Act discriminates against 
families that make the choice to provide care in the home to 
preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill and the 
aged.

<P>
	The petitioners state that Canadians are already overburdened 
with taxation due to high government spending. As the 
Saskatchewan government is on the verge of balancing its 
budget, allowing Saskatchewan taxpayers to see the light at the

government spending instead of increasing taxes.

Ontario and Saskatchewan, including my riding of 
Yorkton-Melville.
<P>
	All the people who signed these petitions are concerned about 
the public safety of all Canadians and feel that the existing 
controls on law-abiding, responsible firearms' owners are more 
than enough to ensure that safety.
<P>
	They therefore call on Parliament to support laws that will 
severely punish all violent criminals who use weapons in the 
commission of a crime, to support new Criminal Code firearms 
control provisions that recognize and protect the right of 
law-abiding citizens to own and use recreational firearms, and 
to support legislation that would repeal or modify existing gun 
control laws which have not improved public safety or have 
proven not to be cost effective or have proven to be overly

FBDB in each year since 1988?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12422"> 12422 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> There was 
no Federal Business Development Bank (FBDB) advertisement 
placed on pages 80 and 81 of the December 5, 1994 edition of 
Maclean's.
<P>
	FBDB placed an advertisement on page 49 of the November 
28 edition and on page 101 of the November  14 edition. Both 
were part of FBDB's national advertising campaign. The 
November 28 advertisement was free, <I>i.e.</I>, at not cost to the 
FBDB.
<P>
	The regular price for an advertisement like the one full page, 
four colour, that appeared in the November 14 edition of 
Maclean's is $27,480. The actual cost to FBDB for that ad was 
$23,076, representing 19 per cent off the regular price.
<P>
	It should be noted that FBDB advertising is entirely paid for 
by the bank, which operates on a full cost-recovery basis in its 
financial services.
<P>
	In its last examination report to the FBDB 1993, the office of 
the auditor general noted that the bank lacked comprehensive 
plans for marketing its services. To address this concern and 
achieve its objectives related to the complementary lender role 
of the bank, the bank seeks the expertise of external experts to 
develop, co-ordinate and implement national advertising 
campaigns, in order to maximize its impact with target 
audiences and minimize its costs.
<P>
	Therefore, the purpose of FBDB advertising is to accurately 
and timely inform as many small and medium sized businesses 
as possible and potential entrepreneurs of the availability and 
nature of the innovative financing and management products 
and services offered by FBDB.
<P>
	FBDB national advertising is limited to print, media, such as 
magazines and newspapers. FBDB does not advertise on a 
national basis on radio or television.
<P>
	A smaller annual budget is allocated to each of the bank's 78 
branches nation wide for the placement of local advertising in 
their community. Branch managers typically use the most 
effective local print media for reaching small and medium sized 
businesses and promoting local financing and management 
services programs offered by the bank. Exceptionally, a very 
small proportion of local radio advertising may be used. No 
television is used.
<P>
	As mentioned, there is no national advertising on radio and 
television and only print media are used. A specific breakdown, 
along the categories listed above, is not recorded. Total amounts 
spent during past fiscal years since 1988 are as follows:

	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, the government has been working 
assiduously on trying to get a response to the hon. member's 
question.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	In fairness to the government-and I acknowledge that the 
delay has been significant in this case-the hon. member must 
be aware that the question asks for information from every 
government department. There has been real difficulty trying to 
determine which grants made to persons are grants to 
businesses. In the sense of the hon. member's question, he asks 
for grants to businesses. It is often difficult for departments to 
tell if a grant to an individual was a grant to that person's 
business or to the individual.
<P>
	Given the complexity of the question and the numerous 
departments that have to be canvassed, the hon. member will 
have to exercise his usual patience and wait until the 
government gets the answer together.

ALLOWANCES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from May 9, 1995, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-85, an act to amend the Members of 
Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and to provide for the 
continuation of a certain provision, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee and on the motion that the question be 
now put.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I 
understand that probably the standing orders were not broken by 
the fact that we held a vote without a 30-minute bell. However, I 
am concerned that a precedent is being set that is not wise. There 
was not all party agreement that we suspend the normal 
30-minute bell. It does make it difficult to keep members here 
and to allow them to exercise their franchise in the proper 
manner.
<P>
	I urge that the House be a little more considerate about 
rushing the vote on some of these matters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure the hon. member, who is 
a very experienced member now, knows the rules of the House.
<P>
	The timing of the bells for any vote is governed by mutual 
agreement of the two whips who take the vote at the time, 
namely the chief government whip and the chief opposition 
whip. That is clearly in our standing orders. I am sure all hon. 
members, particularly someone who holds the position of House 
leader, know that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Points were made on both sides. All 
members know what the rules provide, as was indicated by the 
government whip. If we are to have an atmosphere of better 
cordiality in this Parliament than in the last Parliament, I would 
hope that in the future the whips of the government and the 
official opposition would indicate to the House leader of the 
Reform Party that there will not be a bell held after the vote. I 
would hope that all members would respect one another on that 
issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect, the courtesy call was 
extended to the members yesterday. What the Speaker has 
indicated as advice was followed, even though there was no 
requirement in the rules of the House. That courtesy was 
extended because we are a very courteous government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, there were some discussions 
yesterday. There was some indication that there may or may not 
be a 30-minute bell, a 15-minute bell, or an immediate 
walkdown. Some of us were left to believe that there might be a 
period of waiting, perhaps 15 minutes, before we would come in 
and vote. That was not clearly communicated to my caucus. That 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12425"> 12425 </A></B>
<P>
is why I am concerned about a precedent being set. It does not  
provide an atmosphere where we can work co-operatively 
together.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Wild Rose has 
two minutes left in his intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
spend the last two minutes repeating some of the things I said 
yesterday.
<P>
	The main reason I will be voting against this bill is because I 
want to represent the people in my riding. It is difficult for 
people across the way to understand that, but the people in my 
riding say there should be no more gold plated pensions. They 
would like to see a pension but they would like it to be the same 
as what they have to accept in the private sector. That is 
completely fair.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Although I cannot represent other people I have spoken in 
about 37 ridings, most of which are Liberal ridings. I would like 
to express on behalf of the people in those ridings that they too 
would like to see their members opt out of these types of pension 
plans. However they know that it will not happen. There happens 
to be a little problem. Possibly it is greed.
<P>
	I want to make sure the government will hear the people when 
they ask for a plan to be provided that is compatible with the 
private sector. The government should consider establishing a 
separate group, a third party of the citizenry. Let the employers 
decide what they should pay in the way of pensions, salaries, and 
a few other things.
<P>
	The Reform Party is prepared to do that. If Bloc members and 
the Liberals would like to come aboard, we could select people 
from the private sector and meet together to determine what we 
should receive in the way of pay, pensions and so on. We would 
certainly go along with the idea and I would accept whatever 
they decide.
<P>
	As a reminder to the Liberals, especially to my friend from 
Kingston who seems to have forgotten, he works for the people 
of Kingston. They do not work for him. Let them set the salary 
and the pension. That is the fair way of doing it.
<P>
	As leaders let us set the example. Everyone in the country is 
required to tighten their belts, to do more with less. For heaven's 
sake, the least we can do is set the example by refusing the 
pension. We could set examples in a lot of other ways as well. 
We could cut totally unnecessary trips to Asia, Africa, Europe 
and all over the world. It would result in a saving of $1.8 
million, which would help meet the needs of many people in the 
country who are suffering for one reason or another.
<P>
	There are many things to consider. Take a look at my frame. It 
crawls into an economy seat every time I get on a plane. If you 
think that is fun, trade sizes for a day and I will let you try it. It is 
a sacrifice to do it and I do not mind. I will continue to do it.
<P>
	All of us need to sit back and realize that we are asking 
Canadians to help us solve the problem created by the 
politicians of the past in terms of the country's debt and deficits. 
Let us get our act together, think of our future, think of the 
children we are raising and think of our grandchildren. Let us act 
like statesmen and forget the politics and the silliness.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased today to be able to speak to Bill C-85, an 
act to amend the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances 
Act and to provide for the continuation of a certain provision. 
Bill C-85, which will amend the Members of Parliament 
Retiring Allowances Act, has been touted by the Prime Minister 
as a great pension reform package that members of Parliament 
deserve because they are so underpaid.
<P>
	If anything raises the ire of Canadians, it is the scandalously 
generous pension provisions given to members of Parliament. 
Even more disturbing is the attempt to conceal from the public 
just how rich the pension plan remains even after the proposed 
changes.
<P>
	The government reports in the public accounts, part II, how 
much MPs spend on office expenditures, travel and their 
salaries. It is very interesting to note they refuse to tell the 
public how much the members of Parliament pension scheme 
costs.
<P>
	A former Liberal member introduced a private member's bill 
which would allow the auditor general to report more frequently 
so that waste and mistakes would be more readily exposed. This 
process would open the operations of government to closer 
scrutiny by Parliament on behalf of the people. What happened? 
The government said: ``No way. We do not want closer scrutiny. 
We do not want the public to know what is really happening with 
their money''. Then it gave the hon. member a pat on the back 
and sent him to the other place.
<P>
	Regrettably, the cost of the members of Parliament pension is 
not readily available to anyone.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	Even though this new law will reduce the accrual rate for 
benefits by 1 per cent, that is from 5 per cent to 4 per cent, it still 
remains double the rate found in registered plans in the private 
sector. There will be provisions for full inflation compensation 
whereas 78.3 per cent of private sector pensions have no 
automatic adjustment for inflation.
<P>
	Furthermore, the members of Parliament pension account 
earns a generous 10 per cent interest so the costs attributed to the 
plan are effectively lowered. Yet MPs who choose to accept the 
one-time offer to opt out of the plan will be paid only 4 per cent 
on their contributions.
<P>
	It is there but little is said about the higher rate of pensions for 
MPs leaving office with more than six years service. Even if this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12426"> 12426 </A></B>
<P>
group were to opt out of the plan, they will be paid their pension 
for the period prior to  October 1993 under the conditions of the 
old pension plan.
<P>
	Further bringing the new plan into question, MPs elected in 
the next Parliament will be required to participate in the pension 
plan. There will be no future open ended choice to say no to the 
gravy train. Why is the option to choose not to participate in the 
plan closed off at this time?
<P>
	Fifty-two Reform members of Parliament have forced this 
issue of pension reform, but the government's presented reforms 
are really an insult to Canadians. Until the government changes 
the retirement compensation account, the account the 
government and previous governments have used to pay benefits 
greater than those allowed under a registered pension plan 
provided for by the Income Tax Act, Reformers and some other 
principal members of Parliament refuse to be part of the charade 
and deception. We are not willing to ask Canadians to pay for 
this pension windfall.
<P>
	Right now, after only 10 years, members of Parliament can 
receive a pension worth half their salary. Anyone else would 
have to work and contribute to their pension plan for at least 25 
years to achieve this and for most, without inflation protection.
<P>
	Also under the new plan taxpayers still pay $3.60 for every $1 
the member of Parliament pays into his or her retirement 
pension. As a comparison, federal public servants are matched 
dollar for dollar, a ratio often seen in the private sector as well.
<P>
	The report by Sobeco, Ernst and Young suggested that pension 
benefits be limited to retirees who are at least 60 years of age, 
but the Prime Minister said members of Parliament have earned 
this pension even after only six years. Granted, for members 
who came into this House after October 1993, the new law 
would set eligibility at a minimum age of 55 for benefits accrued 
after this bill becomes law. Five more years to age 60 was too 
long to wait. The outside packaging looks okay, but if we open it 
up the box is empty.
<P>
	Reformers do not need to hire consultants to tell them that the 
members of Parliament pension should be reined in, just listen 
to the ordinary working people of all ages and income ranges. 
They have told government what they think, yet the government 
seems unwilling to listen to Canadian citizens. It studied the 
issue and studied the issue, all the while taunting us with a 
carrot, promising real change.
<P>
	We know the amendments are a done deal. The Liberals have 
the numbers in government to do what they want, but the one 
thing they can be sure of is that this issue will not go away. It will 
still be an election issue next time around so they will still have 
to answer to the voters.
<P>
	A number of hon. government members have pointed their 
fingers this way and made allegations that some Reform 
members are double dipping. We on this side of the House have 
made it clear that we object to double dipping. We recognize that 
Bill C-85 attempts to remove double dipping practices and we 
commend the government for its move in this aspect.
<P>
	Former members of Parliament who were given political 
appointments to work at another federal job should not draw pay 
for that job while continuing to draw their MP pensions. Private 
sector workers must earn their pensions by working 25 or more 
years before they are able to collect benefits. Again I point out 
some members of Parliament need only have served six years to 
collect these generous packages.
<P>
	Individuals in the private sector who have earned and are 
collecting pensions can and do take other employment while 
continuing to collect their pensions. After all, they have had to 
win the job they occupy; it is not given to them as a patronage 
payoff. In this aspect, I had to win this job by convincing the 
voters of my constituency that I was their best choice to 
represent them here in Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	Liberals are quick to point out that some Reform members, 
myself included, collect military pensions while at the same 
time earning salaries as members of Parliament. I collect an 
annuity for more than 36 years service in the Royal Canadian Air 
Force and the Canadian Armed Forces. I paid into that 
superannuation account with matching government 
contributions for 35 of those 36 years. Benefits accrued at 2 per 
cent per year, which is the normal rate for pension plans in the 
private sector.
<P>
	The annuity I draw comes from a superannuation fund paid 
into by former and present members of the RCAF and Canadian 
Armed Forces over many years. That fund currently stands at 
just under $30 billion so the notion that my annuity is a gift out 
of the taxpayer's pocket is simply untrue. My annuity has been 
fully paid for and hon. members should be aware of that. Some 
of my colleagues also earn pensions and for many years made 
contributions to their pension plans.
<P>
	What some government members are trying to do is compare 
apples and oranges. These pensions are a far cry from the 
generous pensions doled out to former members of Parliament 
who receive appointments to serve on various government 
boards or commissions.
<P>
	Canada is among the world's most generous countries when it 
comes to members of Parliament pensions. There is no other 
country in the world which pays parliamentarians a pension 
after serving only six years in office, with no minimum age to 
retire.
<P>
	In December 1993 the leader of the Reform Party wrote to the 
Prime Minister saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12427"> 12427 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Reform MPs sincerely believe that the credibility of Parliament in dealing with 
the financial crisis facing the federal government will be increased if every 
parliamentary caucus reviews the MPs' pension, pay and perks package and 
agrees to significant reductions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>By doing so, the 35th Parliament can increase its moral authority to appeal to 
other Canadians to make the sacrifices necessary to permit a balancing of the 
federal budget.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In Bill C-85 government has fallen sorely short of achieving 
appropriate and necessary member of Parliament pension 
reforms. Surely it should reconsider.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
remind Canadians watching the debate today that we are 
discussing the acceptability of the proposed pension for 
members of Parliament. As they are probably aware, the Liberal 
government introduced some changes to the former pension 
system. The changes have been set out in great detail in a 
number of speeches today and I am not proposing to repeat 
them.
<P>
	The issue is very simple. Is the proposed plan fair and 
reasonable? Is what is being proposed as a pension for members 
of Parliament fair and reasonable? The answer is very clear. No, 
it is not fair and reasonable. There are a number of reasons for 
this.
<P>
	My colleague from Saanich-Gulf Islands and a number of 
other colleagues have set out the reasons yet again. It is very 
clear that what is proposed is not fair and reasonable. There are 
three areas in which the plan is not fair and reasonable.
<P>
	It is incredibly rich. It allows a level of pension that is illegal 
for any other Canadian. If any other institution or organization 
proposed to give its employees this kind of a pension it would be 
prosecuted. It is flatly illegal. Somehow the richness for 
members of Parliament is okay. The lawmakers can have 
different rules. It simply flies in the face of what is right and 
what is just.
<P>
	It is an inequitable system. No other Canadians in the country 
could ever expect to have this kind of a pension plan, yet to a 
very large degree those self same Canadians will have to pay for 
the pension plan that is being proposed.
<P>
	A constituent phoned my office yesterday and said that he had 
worked for a major oil company for 30 years. He said his 
pension was not any better alongside an MP who has worked 
only six years. He wondered how that could be, and he had to pay 
for it.
<P>
	It is clearly inequitable for lawmakers to have a pension and 
benefits that are unavailable to any other Canadian. These 
benefits are fully indexed. There are virtually no other pension 
plans available anywhere in the country that are tied to the level 
of inflation. Yet lawmakers feel they are entitled to that. This is 
not a fair and reasonable plan.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	The sad thing about this is that the people who have to pay the 
shot for this plan have no say in how the plan is structured. In 
any other plan, most or at least half of the benefits are paid for by 
the person receiving them. In this particular plan the people 
receiving the benefits pay one-fifth or one-sixth of the benefits 
they will eventually receive. The people who have to pay the 
lion's share in this plan have no voice in the negotiations 
whatsoever, except what we might choose to give them.
<P>
	My friends in the Bloc would say it is very bad labour 
relations when one party simply sets down the benefits they 
expect to take and the other side has to pay them. That is clearly 
inequitable and unreasonable.
<P>
	In spite of the fact that this plan is not fair and reasonable, the 
Liberals go through a song and dance saying that yes it is. We 
should examine those arguments because as Canadians we need 
to judge whether or not this is a good and fair piece of 
legislation. Reformers are saying loudly that it is not. I have 
given some of the reasons and my colleagues have given more.
<P>
	Let us see what the Liberals are saying. The first thing they 
say is: ``At least we did something''. For those who might be 
watching these debates and who are students of political 
science, they might see this as a very interesting and excellent 
example of spin doctoring, of how a clearly untenable and 
indefensible proposal by a government is put forward as being 
equitable and defensible.
<P>
	First the Liberals say: ``At least we did something. We made 
some cutbacks. We made some changes. We brought in reform''. 
I might add this was thanks to Reform members who have kept 
raising this issue over and over in the House. I dare say the 
Liberals would have been quite happy to forget it if we had not 
pushed them to the mat and said: ``You must do something about 
this MP pension plan. Canadians simply will not stand for it to 
be left as it is''.
<P>
	The second thing they say is: ``We never promised to do 
anything more than this. We have done everything we said we 
would do''. I suggest the real issue is whether it was the right 
thing to do. Is that not what we are here for, to do the right thing? 
Or are we here to do the least thing possible so we can say we did 
something? I think Canadians should judge.
<P>
	Then there was a very interesting argument brought up by the 
President of the Treasury Board. He said that they were doing 
this because they care about their families and the people who 
are saying this is not a good plan should really think about 
whether they really care about their families. All Canadians care 
very much about their families, particularly the Canadians who 
are going to have to pay the shot for this pension plan that will 
benefit the families of a very few. It is the families of Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12428"> 12428 </A></B>
<P>
and Canadians themselves and fairness for all that we should 
thinking about, not just ourselves and our families.
<P>
	I find it rather remarkable that somehow a plan that is unfair, 
greedy and beyond what any other Canadian family could ever 
hope for is excused and justified on the basis that we care about 
our families. I do not think so.
<P>
	Then the argument is brought up that almost half of the MPs 
do not qualify for a pension anyway. So? We are talking about 
the people who do qualify for a pension. Is the pension for those 
who do qualify fair and reasonable? The answer is no.
<P>
	Then the President of the Treasury Board brought up studies 
that propose MPs should earn more. The President of the 
Treasury Board said that we do not dare do that; we do not dare 
follow the recommendations of those studies. What he actually 
said was interesting if one follows political speak.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	He said that it is not functionally possible at this time. Then he 
suggests it is okay to stay unreasonable on the pension side 
because we cannot do anything about the other 
recommendations. I do not think that two wrongs make a right in 
the minds of Canadians. Reform is against increasing either the 
salary or letting the pension stay unreasonable, particularly in 
light of the fact that the country is not living within its means.
<P>
	The next argument is interesting, which is the great sacrifice 
MPs make to serve the public good. Being an MP I can say there 
is some sacrifice involved, although I do not notice any shortage 
of people willing and able to make that sacrifice. There are 
literally millions of Canadians who make sacrifices to serve the 
public good.
<P>
	This week in the House we rose in a standing ovation to 
acknowledge and show appreciation for the Canadians who 
made the ultimate sacrifice. They went overseas and had the roar 
of guns in their ears. They suffered the separation from their 
loved ones, fear for their lives, danger and injury for an 
unlimited period of time. They made a sacrifice.
<P>
	What about the people in the private sector who go all over the 
world to pursue trade opportunities on behalf of their 
companies, suffering from jet lag and all of the deprivations of 
travel? What about the millions of Canadians who sacrifice in 
both their personal and professional lives to give care and 
guidance to their children?
<P>
	Sacrifice is a part of life. For MPs in the House to say we are 
making a sacrifice and therefore we should be given special 
consideration is ludicrous. It will not wash with Canadians.
<P>
	It might be interesting for members of the House to know 
about a survey I have been doing in my riding. I asked whether 
they supported MPs receiving the benefits outlined in the 
information I gave them. Eighty-seven per cent answered no. 
Question: Do you agree with your MP's decision to opt out of the 
MP pension plan and provide for her own retirement through a 
personal RRSP governed by the same guidelines as all other 
Canadians?  Answer yes: 88.7 per cent. Question: Do you think 
MP pension benefits should be reduced retroactively to reflect 
Canada's current fiscal situation? Answer yes: 87 per cent.
<P>
	It is very clear that Canadians are fed up with politicians who 
say one thing and do another, who decry any suggestion of a two 
tier health care system. They bleed from every pore at the mere 
suggestion, but a two tier pension system that benefits them is 
just fine.
<P>
	It is time we showed some leadership in the House and put our 
money where our mouth is. Reformers are prepared to do that. I 
challenge government members to show that we want to do what 
is right and fair for the country and we want to be on an equal 
playing field with the citizens of this country. We are prepared to 
do that in the matter of the pension plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my colleague who just spoke. That was 
well said. I hope hon. members on the other side were listening.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This 
is a serious matter. We do not have a quorum and that concerns 
me.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There does not appear to be a quorum. 
Call in the members.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is now a quorum. Resuming 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, when Europeans first came to 
Canada everyone had such a short life expectancy and society as 
a whole was so poor that people basically worked hard from 
childhood until they died. Some third world nations are still like 
that, but the industrialized world has made enough advances in 
public health and medicine that diseases which used to claim 
huge numbers of people have been either controlled or 
eliminated in developed countries.
<P>
	We generally expect to live long and healthy lives. For 
example, as of 1992 the Canadian life expectancy for women 
was 81.2 years while some say that we overworked men 
nevertheless manage to survive for an expected span of 74.9 
years.
<P>
	In addition to improved health, there are other major 
achievements of developed countries. We generate sufficient 
wealth so that both our children and our seniors no longer need 
to be involved in the direct production of wealth. We provide 
free public education for our young people at least to the age of 
16. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12429"> 12429 </A></B>
<P>
We pride ourselves on the fact that child labour is a thing of the 
past in our modern industrialized world.
<P>
	At the other end of life, industrialized nations also provide a 
special time when the wealth of society allows the elderly to be 
free from the need to produce more wealth. For Canadians age 
65 and older, advances in medicine and improved nutrition have 
also made it possible for them to enjoy improved health and 
independence.
<P>
	I had the opportunity last week to drop in at the beautiful 
lakeside community of Sorrento in my riding of 
Okanagan-Shuswap. The 220 members of their old age 
pensioners branch had raised enough money with no 
government grants of any kind to build a 30 by 60 foot addition 
to their original meeting place so that they could have room to 
enjoy such things as carpet bowling, snooker and darts. They 
also did the majority of the physical work themselves, erecting 
the walls and rafters.
<P>
	Some of these seniors I am speaking of are in their 80s. I was 
impressed not only with their energy but the enthusiasm they 
showed and the sincere concern they had for Canada. The 
seniors told me they are also concerned about whether Canada 
can continue to provide pensions on which they all depend 
because of excessive government spending, such as the gold 
plated MP pension plans.
<P>
	Of course some of these seniors have been thrifty and 
fortunate enough to own their own homes which keeps their 
monthly expenses down. Some seniors receive cheques from 
company pension plans or interest payments from their life 
savings, but many live on nationally funded pensions.
<P>
	Low income seniors, especially elderly widows, tell me they 
have great worries about adequate housing, health care, home 
care after hospitalization, and public transportation. 
Nevertheless overall this is a generation of people who lived 
through the great depression. They know how to make do as they 
say, meaning that they can get by on very little without 
complaining.
<P>
	For example, the monthly maximum payment this quarter for 
single seniors receiving old age security and the government's 
income supplement is $850 a month. For married seniors both of 
whom are over age 65, the monthly maximum payment this 
quarter from the federal pension and income supplement 
combined is $689 a month each. In other words, senior couples 
are living on less than $1,400 per month or $16,542 per year 
from which they must also pay taxes.
<P>
	Nationally, StatsCan set the low income cut off at a point 
where more than 54.7 per cent of income is required to pay for 
food, shelter and clothing. In rural areas, for 1993 the low 
income cut off for families of two was $14,238. For small towns, 
the level was $16,329. Therefore it is only in rural parts of 
Canada that seniors living on OAS and GIS escape poverty. The 
majority of Canadians live in cities. The low income cut off for a 
family of two shoots up to $20,603 in cities like Vancouver, 
Toronto and Montreal. Remember, married seniors get $4,000 
less than that.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to contrast the pensions of those average Canadian 
seniors with members of Parliament, who have been in the 
remarkable position of being able to pass the very law that 
determines how much pension they will receive. How would 
reasonable MPs decide on their pensions? Would they look at 
what is done in other countries? For example, in the United 
Kingdom parliamentarians contribute 6 per cent of their salaries 
and are eligible for pension after 55 when age plus years of 
service equal 80. The United States congressmen contribute 1.3 
per cent and can qualify at age 50 with 20 years service. 
Obviously Canadian MPs ignored those standards, both for the 
present pensions and their so-called reforms.
<P>
	Bill C-85 at long last proposes to reform MPs' pensions so 
that they cannot qualify until age 55. It also ends double 
dipping. For both these improvements I congratulate the 
government. However, these were merely two small baby steps 
toward badly needed major strides that should have been 
performed in reforming MPs' pensions in this country.
<P>
	Our goal should be nothing other than a pension plan similar 
to those allowed to everyday Canadian seniors. For them the 
Income Tax Act continues to set a 6 per cent limit on pension 
contributions. However, under Bill C-85 MPs' pension 
contributions will only drop from the present 11 per cent to 9 per 
cent. It is still 50 per cent higher than allowed for the private 
sector and it is still costing taxpayers millions of dollars.
<P>
	Another point I wish to raise concerns the opting out 
possibility. The entire pension plan should be significantly 
reformed so that no MP in good conscience would see any need 
to opt out. Without those complete down to earth reforms to the 
MPs' pension plan, every newly elected member of Parliament 
must have the option to turn down the pension plan, which 
through Bill C-85 has merely gone from being solid gold to 
being gold-plated. In my opinion, even after passage of Bill 
C-85 MPs' pensions will remain a national disgrace.
<P>
	When the Liberals were elected the Canadian people accepted 
them as they would at a wedding. They looked at them as either 
the bride or the groom. They gave them the ring to run this 
country. Unfortunately, since then, through acts such as this 
piddling around with the MPs' pension plan, I am afraid the 
Liberal government has given the Canadian public the finger.
<P>
	We do not have to delve too deeply to see what it is costing the 
Canadian public today to keep what these MPs seem to say is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12430"> 12430 </A></B>
<P>
their right. Does any member of Parliament think that the only 
reason he came to this place was in order to get a pension and his 
only way of being paid back is through that pension? I would 
like to know what their commitment to Canada is. I find it hard 
to accept that there is anyone in this House who would use that.
<P>
	I hear nothing from the other side with regard to this debate. I 
have yet to hear anyone on the other side stand up to address this. 
I find this strange. Are they afraid the Canadian public would 
not listen to what they say, or if it did listen it would want to turf 
them out? I think it is probably the latter. Hopefully I am wrong. 
I would sincerely like to see a member from the other side rise 
and speak to this issue. The Canadian public would also like to 
hear them speak to this issue. We have had only smoke and 
mirrors from the other side with respect to this. Perhaps it is 
time they clear the smoke away and tell us exactly what they 
have done to reform the MPs' pension plan and what the cost 
will now be to the Canadian taxpayers, who perceive the MPs as 
living off them like parasites.
<P>
	It is sad to say that in this country we have fallen that badly. 
The obligation should be for someone from the government side 
to stand up and support their own pension scheme. If they would 
go out and talk to seniors and see how much they have 
contributed to the country, with no guarantees, they would be 
really surprised. Maybe we should be a little ashamed of what 
we have allowed to happen in this country.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I take this opportunity to put some perspective on the 
controversy. I will end with a demand for greater openness in the 
process of setting the compensation for members of Parliament.
<P>
	In economics, one of the most difficult problems we have is to 
explain the relative wages of people in different occupations. 
Why does a dishwasher earn typically only the minimum wage? 
Why do miners earn considerably more than that? What should 
be the right pay for teachers, nurses, doctors, lawyers, and MPs? 
Who knows?
<P>
	In economics we have some answers. One side explains that 
generally compensation for workers is higher where greater 
skill and training are required. People who go to occupations 
that require only high school graduation will typically get a 
lower level of pay than those who had to graduate from 
university. Certainly those in graduate and medical school 
occupations make more than those with lower educations. I 
think this is a widely accepted principle. There is no problem 
with fairness. That is generally accepted in society.
<P>
	Also accepted in society, and the data show that this can be 
verified, is that the riskier a job, risks like illness and accident, 
the higher should be the pay. The greater the discomfort, if you 
have to work in the middle of the night or in a dirty environment, 
then pay tends to be higher than when it is in a pleasant 
environment.
<P>
	Generally these elements are verified by empirical studies. 
Yet even at a time when there was no government to appeal to 
there were differences in wages, which could not be explained 
by these factors alone. Economists know a structure of wages of 
different-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Point of order, the hon. member for Elk 
Island.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Capilano-Howe 
Sound has very important things to say and I think there should 
be more than two Liberals present to hear it. I call quorum.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will ask the clerk to count the 
members present.
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We have a quorum.
<P>
	The interval does not come off the member's time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was trying to put some 
perspective on the debate about pensions by suggesting that 
what has happened in Canada and many other democracies is we 
do not have a transparent system.
<P>
	In free markets, when there is no government to step in 
constantly and listen to people about their unhappiness about 
their wages, there is a very important equilibrium achieved in 
markets. Individuals under their own free will can walk up to 
someone and say they would like to work as a cook, as a miner, 
or whatever it is, and he or she gets employed. They are 
obviously better off than with anything else they would have 
done. They are happy. They have had a decision. They have 
maximized their welfare.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	One can imagine that in a world like that, without any 
government, we can develop a situation where there are just the 
number of cooks who want to work at the wage that is being 
offered them to be cooks. There are just the number of nurses. 
There will be neither people who are looking for jobs nor will 
there be shortages. The wages that come out of such a 
competitive system may be interpreted as being efficient and in 
some sense representing the best distribution of wages our 
society can arrive at.
<P>
	We all know that especially in the post-war years 
governments have taken it upon themselves to correct the 
outcome of the market. We have opened our ears as members of 
Parliament 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12431"> 12431 </A></B>
<P>
to people who do not like the structure that has come from a free 
market where people under complete freedom, talking to each 
other and making contracts without coercion, have produced 
this outcome.
<P>
	We hear stories that are so appealing they always bring tears 
to my eyes. I hear farmers telling me: ``My income was only so 
much. My wage was only so much. Do you know how important 
my job is? If it was not for us farmers there would not be any 
food and we would all die. Therefore, I think I should earn 
more''. I do not have to elaborate on what the nurses and doctors 
say and what the teachers say would happen to the next 
generation if they were not there.
<P>
	All of this sounds very good. The people who say this all the 
time have themselves completely convinced that the wages a 
free society and free exchange have produced are not right. They 
need more and more. This has created the kind of division in 
society we have today, inefficiencies and problems. The wages 
are set so high that there are long waiting lists of people who 
wish to join that occupation and others where the wages are too 
low and they cannot find workers for it. It is a sad thing. I believe 
that decentralized decision making was much better. However, 
we are now in an ideology that says the government has a right to 
step in.
<P>
	I want to now turn to a special problem that is associated with 
setting the wages of people like members of Parliament, where a 
government has to be involved. Here the problem is that until 
now there has never been a shortage of people who want to apply 
for the job. I do not know what the right wage is. I challenge 
anyone. The big problem is that the wage that is set will 
determine on average what quality of skills, intelligence, and 
energy you get of people who apply for the job and ultimately 
will end up in the Chamber.
<P>
	I think almost everybody would agree if today the wages for 
MPs were $20,000. What we would get on the one hand would be 
people who could not make more than $20,000 in the private 
market. On the other hand, we would get very rich people to 
whom this would be a hobby. It would be a totally undesirable 
mix of people here in Parliament. However, who is to say what is 
the right wage? We cannot ask members of Parliament any more 
than we can ask farmers, nurses, doctors or teachers. They will 
all say they have the most important job in society and it should 
be very, very high. Of course it cannot be done like that.
<P>
	What is the next best solution? Historically, we always have 
to come up with some wage. What is the right wage? The 
Government of Canada and all democratic governments have 
taken recourse to appointing commissions. The other day 
another commission report was released on that subject. I 
looked back. There must have been commissions in the history 
of the Parliament of Canada at least every four or five years 
since the founding of Parliament. They have all said that the 
wages should be higher than they are.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	To the best of my memory they said the wage should be set 
around $100,000 or $120,000 a year. I am not endorsing this. I 
do not know what the right answer is.
<P>
	One of the big problems comes once these wages are 
announced by these wise people. They are typically appointed 
with the consent of a broad spectrum of people. Canadians 
believe these wages are high relative to the norm.
<P>
	I have recently been having a lot of fun asking people I meet at 
dinner parties or at political conventions what the average 
income is of a Canadian working in manufacturing. Very few 
know it is $32,000. I ask what income does one have to earn to 
belong to the top 10 per cent of income earners in Canada. It is 
$52,000. The kind of people one meets when one is a member of 
Parliament typically say it is somewhere around $80,000 or 
$100,000. Some young students who come to lobby me tell me it 
is $1 million. It is $52,000 or $53,000.
<P>
	It is quite clear the kind of problem we are facing as a 
Parliament in our system. People who have the best in mind for 
Canada say that if we want quality people in Parliament, we 
should set a wage that right now would probably be putting them 
in the top 1 or 2 per cent of the income distribution. Yet the 
majority of Canadians have lower wages.
<P>
	It was not malice on the part of past Parliaments that took a 
way out of this which is now beginning to haunt us. They have 
set wages which are within the realm of acceptability in public 
opinion. Then they have begun to hide compensation in order to 
achieve a level of compensation that is consistent with what 
these wise people have said it should be. That is why my whip 
said the other day that if we look at the hidden compensation we 
would reach a level that is a little below what these commissions 
have recommended recently.
<P>
	As is typical with all these procedures without checks, once 
members of Parliament in recent years found out they could get 
away with hiding compensation, they went overboard. They 
went overboard in the form of pensions. It was clearly a mistake 
on their part to have gone as far as they have by overshooting the 
amount of compensation hidden in the pension.
<P>
	What I conclude from this analysis of our current problems is 
that the issue faced by Parliament today is not the narrow focus 
on the pension; it is what my colleague the whip has said. We 
need a more rational structure, a transparent structure of the 
compensation for members of Parliament.
<P>
	We should also be open with the people of Canada. In today's 
age of high levels of education, of communication, of 
understanding, I am personally convinced and have enough 
confidence in the democratic system that people would accept 
the judgment of those wise people and say: ``Yes, we want that 
quality of people to run for Parliament. We do not want it to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12432"> 12432 </A></B>
<P>
reserved for only the rich or people who don't have  anything 
else to do. We want to attract good people''. They would 
probably go for a compensation that is very close to what we 
have now, but a much lower pension. That would be consistent 
with what the last commission said.
<P>
	In my judgment we need a more transparent, open system that 
would put all of the cards on the table. We would end up with this 
being accepted by the people of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the pension plan was introduced in 1952 by an act 
called the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act. It 
was amended in 1992 to coincide with the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	During the course of this debate the conditions of the pension 
have been illustrated several times, so I do not wish to go into 
that, other than to look back to pre-election 1993 when there 
was considerable concern among Canadians as to how the 
pension plan had developed since 1952. There was enough 
concern, obviously, that in 1991 an amendment was passed to 
bring it in line with the Income Tax Act. Here we are in 1995 
again looking at a possible adjustment to the pension plan.
<P>
	Some of the things which were of great concern to the Reform 
Party prior to the election were members of Parliament having 
to serve only six years to be eligible to draw the pension, 
regardless of their age. Another condition which was of great 
concern to us was the indexing. I think at age 60 it was indexed 
according to the cost of living. A third concern was the fact that 
the pension was based on the best six years of salary. It did not 
say whether they were consecutive years to my knowledge.
<P>
	The people of Canada had concerns about the provisions in the 
plan. They were not happy with it because it did not coincide 
with the private sector. It tended to suggest very strongly that 
there was a two tier system for pensions in the country, one for 
MPs and one for everyone else.
<P>
	I assume some pressure was brought to bear through 1992 and 
some adjustments were made, such as passing the amendment 
which would put the plan in line with the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	Now we are considering Bill C-85. I actually do not 
understand what the bill will do to address the general concerns 
which were expressed about the pension plan prior to the 1993 
election.
<P>
	When I read through it I notice that the eligibility age has been 
increased to 55. That rules out the concern of getting a pension 
after six years of service. The person would still have to wait 
until they were 55 years old.
<P>
	The plan was brought in originally in 1952. In those years I 
can remember that my parents, for example, were looking 
toward their retirement. The eligibility age was 65. The trend at 
that time from a health and a technological point of view was 
that men, because they formed the major part of the workforce in 
those days, would retire at 65 and be dead of a heart attack or 
some such thing before they reached 65 and a half.
<P>
	I suggest strongly that over the years we have made advances 
in health, not only in the curing of various conditions but also in 
prevention. We lead a much more healthy lifestyle, so 55 is not 
really rational for 1993. If we were debating this in 1952 when 
the plan was originally implemented it might have some 
validity.
<P>
	That is one thing which Bill C-85 does in addressing the 
inequities of the existing plan. As far as I can see it really does 
not do much of anything else. It talks about opting out or opting 
in, however the phrase is worded. That is a one-shot deal. It 
applies to members of Parliament now. It includes those who 
have six years' service. Once that happens every MP who comes 
along after this will have to participate in the plan. The 
amendment does not really address much other than an increase 
on when one can draw the pension. To my mind that is not 
enough.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The whole pension issue and this bill, when one looks at it in 
its entirety, is an excellent illustration at how out of touch 
government politicians are with the Canadian public. There was 
a hue and cry about pensions prior to the election. The majority 
of Canadians realize that even with these changes in the pension 
plan, it will far exceed those available anywhere else in Canada.
<P>
	The other component in this plan that has to be looked at very 
seriously is the retirement compensation account and the 
mechanisms used in paying out the benefits.
<P>
	Regarding the opting out situation, there will be no choice. It 
is a one-shot deal. It is going to put a number of Reformers, who 
will come into this Parliament in the next election in great 
numbers, in the position of having to participate in the plan. It 
will be against their principles.
<P>
	One of the things that illustrates the point I am talking about 
now is an article that was in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> on February 9, 
1995 by Barbara Yaffe. That article was entitled ``Pension tiff is 
a measure of MP-voter rift''.
<P>
	In her article she pointed out that one of the problems with the 
pension issue is that MPs are the ones that determine the
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12433"> 12433 </A></B>
<P>
pensions. Many of my colleagues have made reference to the 
same point. One wonders how many other jobs there are where 
people can determine their own pension benefits.
<P>
	We have two options basically. We either have a pension plan 
or we do not. If we choose to have a pension plan, the Reform 
position is to bring it in line with that of the private sector, 
including such things as retirement age, indexing, et cetera. It 
should allow MPs the choice of whether or not to participate and 
seriously consider the benefits of allowing for some 
independent body of Canadian taxpayers to decide on the plan's 
perks, mechanisms, et cetera.
<P>
	The pension plan as it stands is not acceptable to the majority 
of Canadians. The changes proposed by Bill C-85 are tokenism 
or lip service. I am quite confident that the Canadian public will 
come to this conclusion as well.
<P>
	All of us must constantly keep in mind that the Canadian 
people are the ones who pay the bills. We work for them. It is 
probably why we are called public servants. That seems to be 
something that some of us tend to forget quite easily once we 
come to Ottawa.
<P>
	Once again I refer to the article by Barbara Yaffe. She writes 
that this unsavoury struggle over politician pensions has 
revealed one thing quite clearly. ``How utterly out of touch some 
MPs are with the real people in their ridings''.
<P>
	One must wonder why only Reformers seem to be speaking on 
this bill. Does this issue not concern the constituents of any 
other members of the government?
<P>
	The people of North Surrey have been very clear on this issue. 
I cannot accept this pension plan as it presently stands, nor can I 
accept the proposed changes in the bill. My constituents have 
also said to me very strongly that we must get these opinions out 
here on the floor of the House because the government is not 
listening to them.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	Therefore I want to tell all members of the House and my 
constituents in Surrey North that I will not be participating in 
the pension plan. I am joining my colleagues in opting out until 
something comes along that is much more equitable with the rest 
of the country and my fellow Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I seek 
unanimous consent to address the bill again. I have spoken to it 
once, but in light of the fact that I have sparked some interesting 
reaction I was wondering if members of the House would be 
willing to allow me to speak to the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for the 
member speak again?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in the debate on the issue 
of MPs pensions. It is certainly one issue that raises the blood 
pressure of the majority of Canadians and one time slot on the 
parliamentary channel that receives attention.
<P>
	I dare say there is not a single MP who has not been dogged by 
constituents on the issue. The obscenity of the bloated pension 
scheme for MPs raised the hackles of the majority of Canadians. 
If I were not to opt out of the plan my face would be as red as the 
Liberal red ink book. It is the ultimate in Liberal spin doctoring 
to call it pension reform. I do not know how MPs could face their 
constituents.
<P>
	I remember during the campaign being told by the incumbent 
when I complained about the MP pension scheme that once I got 
here I would certainly change my mind. I have not changed my 
mind.
<P>
	I challenge any government member to look in the face of a 
struggling overtaxed and overextended constituent and defend 
the ultra-luxurious pension plan. I further challenge 
government members to defend Bill C-85 and the so-called 
amendments contained in the legislation.
<P>
	The member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell can 
obfuscate, twist and distort the Reform position on MP 
remuneration. I challenge him to tell a dairy farmer in 
Cumberland why he deserves the gold plated pension. I bet he 
hopes no one is watching the theatre of the absurd practised by 
the member on the issue of pensions.
<P>
	We are witnessing a serious double standard characterized by 
greed and complete disrespect for the taxpayer's dollar. On the 
one hand the government preaches deficit reduction and debt 
control. On the other hand it introduces Bill C-85 under the 
guise of reforming the obscene pension plan. In other words, do 
what I say and not what I do. This is not the kind of leadership 
Canada needs at this time. It shows a lack of leadership.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports a pension plan that brings MPs 
pensions into line with private sector pensions. In my view if the 
Liberal government vacillates on the issue it will vacillate on 
every issue. There is a major principle involved and the 
government has fumbled the ball. Where is its conscience? What 
does Bill C-85 give us and the taxpayers?
<P>
	The bill lowers the rate at which benefits accrue. At 4 per cent 
they are still double the rate allowed for registered plans under 
the Income Tax Act. The so-called reforms include provisions 
for virtually full compensation for inflation which certainly 
does not parallel private sector pension plans. Over 78 per cent 
of private sector plans have no automatic adjustment for 
inflation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12434"> 12434 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill's minimum age provision of 55 does not go far 
enough. Under the Income Tax Act pension benefits must be 
reduced by at least 3 per cent per year if collected prior to 
attaining the age of 60 or alternately has 30 years of eligibility 
or attaining age and years of service totalling 80 years. This 
avoids that provision of the Income Tax Act.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	The legislation before us today will still use the special 
arrangement called an RCA account to pay members' benefits 
that are twice as generous as private sector norms. Until this is 
addressed, the whole bill is just window dressing. I want to see 
the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell sell this to a hard 
working farmer in his riding who has to save and administer a 
plan of his own. I have hard working loggers, miners, mill 
workers, fishermen and business people in my riding. I would 
not envy trying to sell it to them.
<P>
	We estimate that long run costs for the new pension plan will 
be close to 50 per cent of the payroll costs for currently sitting 
members. A plan the Reform Party could have supported would 
have had a maximum cost to taxpayers of 9 per cent of payroll.
<P>
	Again the government is bleeding the taxpayer dry and at the 
same time selling snake oil to cure the illness. It is deceitful and 
unfair, especially given that it will not allow opting out for 
members elected in the next election. The pension scheme will 
be an issue in three years. We guarantee it.
<P>
	Many Reform MPs ran their election campaigns promising to 
come to this <I>Alice in Wonderland</I> place and reform MPs' 
pensions. It was a solemn commitment to weary Canadians bled 
dry by greedy governments. The government's response has 
been to raise MPs' take home salary by reducing the MPs' 
contribution rate to the pension plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am sure 
what the hon. member has to say is extremely important, but I do 
not see a quorum in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member is quite correct. There is 
not a quorum. Call in the members.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We have a quorum. Debate shall 
continue with the hon. member for North Island-Powell River.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, this will serve to keep the ratio of 
government to member contribution very high.
<P>
	The member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell talked 
yesterday of openness, honesty and sincerity. There is not a 
scintilla of veracity in what the government is telling Canadians 
about the pension plan. When we add this insult to the $550 
billion debt, we are truly a country in trouble.
<P>
	The government is touting Bill C-85 as pension reform but it 
is not telling the complete story. Does the member for Hamilton 
East call a new pension of $2.7 million from the old $3.3 million 
windfall a reform? It is obscene and warrants the scrutiny of fair 
minded Canadians. It is truly unresponsive and says to every 
Canadian: ``You sacrifice, not me''.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I will be opting out and joining the majority of Canadians who 
are not taking advantage of the system and who are looking for 
leadership on issues like this one that we are not receiving from 
the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to the bill which is about 
more than the pensions that some members of Parliament will 
collect, much more. The bill reflects a difference in beliefs 
about the role of a parliamentarian and about the relationship 
between government and those who are governed.
<P>
	It might seem like a bit of an exaggeration to say that a bill 
dealing with pension reform reflects ideals about the very nature 
of governance in a democratic society. I do not think it is an 
exaggeration at all. Furthermore, with the benefit of time, the 
people of Canada will agree with me that the position taken by 
MPs on the bill reflects how they feel about their position in 
government. It tells a story about how they feel about their 
constituents. It even tells a story about how they feel about 
democracy.
<P>
	Let me explain. Canadians become a little sensitive when 
their politicians use U.S. examples. Nonetheless it is impossible 
to deny that U.S. experience provides us with an example of how 
representative democracy works: its problems and its benefits.
<P>
	In the greatest document ever written to defend American 
democracy, the federalist papers, the authors speak in paper No. 
35 of the qualifications of representatives in government. They 
write that representatives should be members of various classes 
of people from society and economy; that those people should be 
chosen by a majority of their constituents; that those people 
should be inspired by a desire to protect the interests of their 
class in the economy, to represent their communities; that those 
people should be elected for a very limited period of time, after 
which they should return to their former positions in the 
economy, back to their former places in life. People elected to 
government should be inspired and motivated to go into public 
life by a sincere commitment to their communities. They should 
expect nothing more than to represent their families, friends and 
neighbours.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12435"> 12435 </A></B>
<P>
	The model from the federalist papers does not speak of a 
class of professional politicians. No, the ideal politician is a 
real person from the real world who takes a short time out of 
his or her life to do his or her patriotic duty and represent his 
or her community with enough remuneration to survive but not 
enough to prosper. That would have to wait until his or her 
limited time in government was over and he or she returned to 
a former profession.
<P>
	That is one model or one vision of what the government and 
legislators should do. There is another, that of the professional 
legislative class, one where legislators are not so much chosen 
as they are born or made and where there are different incentives 
to get into politics. I am not referring to the incentives of 
patriotism or a willingness to sacrifice for one's community but 
an ambition to achieve power, to establish oneself in powerful 
circles and to make money. Representation of the people for this 
kind of politician is nothing more than saying the right things to 
avoid being voted out of office and thereby losing the security, 
power and prestige that public life offers.
<P>
	That is the sort of politician Canadians have learned to dislike 
so passionately. Canadians are more disillusioned than ever 
about their politicians. Politicians consistently rank at the 
bottom of public opinion poll surveys. People do not like us. 
When I ask my constituents what they do not like about 
politicians I consistently get the same answers: ``Politicians are 
only in it for themselves. They only want to make money and get 
power. They lie all the time just to stay in office''. That is quite a 
commentary.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Is it any wonder people are fed up with politicians? Members 
of the House have expanded their powers, expanded their 
salaries and expanded their pensions without ever consulting the 
people of Canada. Members have expanded their power and 
their purses. They have created what some of the founders of 
modern democracy hope to avoid: the creation of a professional 
class of politicians more concerned about their comfort than 
about the needs of the community and the country. In other 
words, the politicians have become Ottawa's messengers to the 
constituents.
<P>
	Here we are debating this pension reform bill. Some reform. 
This debate and the divergent attitudes and opinions of the two 
sides of the House-and I am not including the Bloc in my 
comments since it is absurd for the Bloc to even be participating 
in this debate-reflect more than just a different administrative 
view of how pensions should operate. They reflect a 
fundamentally different view of how Canadian democracy 
should operate.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes in the first model of 
representation: non-professional politicians who represent their 
communities out of a sense of duty and patriotism, politicians 
who expect nothing more than to return to their stations in life 
with a nod from their  communities and the occasional ``job well 
done''. We want nothing more than to be given enough 
remuneration to survive while we are here and then go home to 
our communities with respect.
<P>
	The Liberals on the other hand are concerned more about 
providing themselves with perks, power and pensions, pensions 
which have become the flashpoint of voter anger, and rightly so. 
Why should parliamentarians receive pensions which are richer 
than anything the private sector could even dream of? Why 
should citizens who are taxed to the max be forced to pay for this 
unbelievable scheme? The politicians in power across the way 
do not believe that politics should be about sacrifice for the 
country. They think the country should sacrifice for them. 
Liberal politicians do not ask what they can do for Canada, they 
ask what Canada can do for them. That bothers Canadians. That 
causes Canadians to lose faith in the political process.
<P>
	The Reform Party's philosophy on pension reform is simple: 
do not give us one. Leave us alone. Go ahead and take the cushy 
pensions. Go ahead and force the taxpayer to cough up $4 for 
every one. Clearly, that is what members across the way are 
saying, but leave us alone.
<P>
	If their vision of democracy and representation is one which 
includes establishing a permanent class of highly paid, highly 
pensioned, highly perked politicians, then so be it. Let us 
represent our constituents the way we want. Allow us to be 
servants of the people rather than demanding that the taxpayers 
serve us. Let our visions co-exist. Let them compete. Then let 
the voters decide come the next election. We are more than 
happy with that.
<P>
	This pension reform bill does not do that. It forces the next 
crop of Reform MPs to take this ultra rich pension package 
whether they want it or not. How absurd. How cynical.
<P>
	Canadians want responsible government. They want 
responsible governors, people they can trust, people who will 
serve willingly because they want to serve, not because they 
want to retire after a few years on tens of thousands of dollars 
indexed to inflation. Being a member of Parliament is an 
opportunity to leave an indelible mark on this great country. It is 
an opportunity to give something back to the communities 
which have given us all so much. It is a privilege.
<P>
	The current pension plan and the new pension package is a 
slap in the face. It is a slap in the face to all constituents and all 
communities. I urge my fellow members on both sides of the 
House to take a step toward restoring representation with 
integrity to Canada. Take a step in the direction of restoring 
trust. Vote no on the bill and vote yes to integrity and trust. I am 
going to opt out of the plan.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>

inadequacies of Bill C-85, I move:

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HATEPROPAGANDAVIAELECTRONICHIGHWAY">HATE PROPAGANDA VIA ELECTRONIC HIGHWAY</A></H3>
	The House resumed from March 31 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak today on the motion regarding hate 
speech on the Internet.
<P>
	I agree wholeheartedly that the government should move with 
speed to adopt legislative measures aimed at stopping the spread 
of hate propaganda through computer networks.
<P>
	The information highway is a wonderful resource, which 
provides education and information to people worldwide. The 
Internet is a powerful communication tool. It links people of 
various nations and backgrounds easily and rapidly, helping 
spread understanding and knowledge around the world.
<P>
	Like many tools or new technologies, the information 
highway can be used for harmful purposes as easily as for 
positive purposes. Unfortunately, the many benefits provided by 
the new technology are as attractive to hatemongers and racists 
as they are to scientists and students.
<P>
	As I am sure many members are aware, even a brief glance 
through various Internet discussion groups reveals material that 
is deeply offensive and contrary to Canadian values. The 
material ranges from recruiting messages from the Ku Klux 
Klan to pornography and Holocaust denial tracts.
<P>
	In January a university student was arrested in Michigan for 
issuing threats after he posted a computer message describing 
how he wanted to torture, rape, and murder a fellow student. In a 
recent case in Calgary, police arrested a man for possession of 
child pornography that he had acquired from a computer bulletin 
board linked to the Internet.
<P>
	It is true that in order to obtain much of the offensive material 
one has to go actively looking for the appropriate computer 
bulletin boards. However, some sources of pornography 
advertise their services in the computer discussion groups.
<P>
	Although some work is required to find offensive material, 
pornography and hate propaganda often end up in the hands of 
impressionable children. As I am sure many members are aware, 
children and young adults are often far more proficient with 
computers than their parents are. We should not underestimate 
the persistence of some children.
<P>
	We need to develop software that would allow parents to 
screen material that comes into their homes or schools, similar 
to what we can now do on TV. Children should not have access to 
pornography through computer bulletin boards, just as they are 
not able to purchase pornography from local stores. Parents 
must be able to control what their children view.
<P>
	There have been cases of white supremacists using computer 
bulletin boards to attempt to recruit new members, especially 
among students and other young adults. We do not tolerate white 
supremacists recruiting in person in our schools, so I see no 
reason to tolerate them sending their hate propaganda to school 
children through computers.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	Freedom of speech is one of our most important values. 
However, freedom of speech needs to be tempered by 
responsibility. It may be a cliché but it is nonetheless true that 
freedom of speech does not protect one's right to yell fire in a 
crowded theatre. In a similar fashion, freedom of speech does 
not protect hate speech. Canada already has laws dealing with 
the distribution of hate propaganda by conventional means such 
as books or on TV and radio broadcasts. However, our current 
laws are not having much impact on the electronic highway. So 
far there has not been a single case I am aware of brought against 
anyone spreading hate across computer networks.
<P>
	Some users of the Internet have argued that they can regulate 
themselves. Certainly there are some examples of Internet users 
challenging and discrediting hatemongers. However, there is 
much offensive material out there. In a perfect world 
self-regulation would work; but as we all know, this is not a 
perfect world.
<P>
	A combination of legislative action and self-regulation would 
perhaps be the best approach. We should encourage the 
development of a code of conduct among Internet users to 
discourage offensive E-mail and  discussion groups. Some have 
likened the Internet to a town square or a worldwide debating 
forum. Just as there are accepted norms of conduct for 
discussions in public places, there should be norms of 
acceptable behaviour on the electronic highway.
<P>
	Along with self-regulation, there should be some direction 
from Parliament. Canada's current laws are apparently having 
little effect on the electronic highway. The motion we are 
debating at the moment is needed to push for the expansion of 
current legislation to cover the Internet. This motion may not 
have any legislative authority, but it will demonstrate this 
House's desire and will to limit the spread of pornography and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12438"> 12438 </A></B>
<P>
hate propaganda. It will provide the courts with some guidance 
as to the option of the House of Commons regarding this issue.
<P>
	I compliment the Minister of Justice for his statement last 
week at an international conference on crime prevention in 
Cairo, where he said that the government is considering new 
laws to limit the harmful use of computer networks and other 
forms of communication.
<P>
	I believe this motion will encourage this government and 
others to continue their efforts to find a way to limit the spread 
of hate propaganda and pornography through the Internet. We 
need to encourage international cooperation to deal with the 
spread of hate propaganda.
<P>
	Given the worldwide nature of the Internet, regulation will 
require worldwide effort. It will be difficult to limit 
pornography and hate propaganda if what is banned in one 
country is easily available through a computer bulletin board in 
another country. Just as hate groups are cooperating in order to 
spread their hatred of others, all countries must unite to combat 
hate groups.
<P>
	I am well aware that it will not be easy to find ways to attack 
the spread of offensive items on the information highway. 
However, just because something is difficult it does not mean 
that we should not try. At the very least, by passing this motion 
we will send a message to the hatemongers and pornographers in 
the Internet that their messages are not welcome in Canada.
<P>
	I congratulate the member for Winnipeg North for having the 
foresight and initiative to bring forward this motion 
encouraging us to give serious thought to this matter. I hope all 
members of this House will support this motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on Motion No. 384 tabled by the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North requiring the government to move with speed to 
adopt legislative measures aimed at stopping the spread of hate 
propaganda via the electronic information highway while 
simultaneously preserving the legitimate use of the freedom of 
speech.
<P>
	I would like to express my support for this motion 
immediately and I congratulate my colleague for Winnipeg 
North on this excellent private member's initiative.
<P>
	As a member of a minority and a fighter for human rights 
since my youth, I am very much attuned to the fight against hate 
propaganda. I worked for many years with the union movement, 
which was behind the fight against racism and discrimination. I 
was also on the board of directors of the Quebec Civil Liberties 
Union. Many messages of hate and intolerance are directed at 
minorities, particularly visible minorities.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	We must fight hateful, racist and discriminatory remarks 
expressed in all sorts of ways, including those appearing on the 
Internet.
<P>
	Information technology is advancing by leaps and bounds. 
Thanks to the computer network, of which Internet is the latest 
and most impressive example, we can be in instant contact with 
people on other continents and in distant countries.
<P>
	Internet currently comprises over 30,000 networks, 2.5 
million computers and 35 million users in over 100 countries. 
These figures are rapidly increasing. A computer, a modem and 
a telephone are all it takes to access this information highway.
<P>
	The Internet network can transmit documents, images, voice, 
music, films and so on.
<P>
	Many Canadian firms are involved in setting up electronic 
highways, including Bell Canada, Northern Telecom, Unitel, 
Videotron, Rogers Communications, Stentor and the Sprint 
group.
<P>
	These new technologies, however, cause considerable 
concern in some sectors of society as the media point out 
increasingly. What we have here, in some respects, is a public 
debate on certain basic moral values of the highest importance. 
All democratic societies must combat racism, discrimination 
and hatred. On the other hand, they must also protect freedom of 
speech and expression, and every person's right to respect, 
dignity and equality.
<P>
	But, the state is not always well equipped to rise to the 
challenges brought on by the rapid and overwhelming 
development of new information technologies. I think that the 
motion introduced by the hon. member for Winnipeg North is of 
great merit, for it opens up discussion in this House on this very 
important issue.
<P>
	Under our justice system, it is section 163 of the Criminal 
Code which governs obscenity and section 319 which governs 
the distribution of hate propaganda. The first provision, more 
particularly subsection 163(1), states that ``Every one commits 
an offence who makes, prints, publishes, distributes, circulates, 
or has in his possession for the purpose of publication, 
distribution or circulation any obscene written matter, picture, 
model, phonograph record or other thing whatever''. This 
subsection deals with mechanical or electronic means.
<P>
	On the other hand, section 319 states that ``Every one who, by 
communicating statements in any public place, incites hatred 
against any identifiable group where such incitement is likely to 
lead to a breach of the peace is guilty-''. The provision 
describes two situations giving rise to a criminal offence: ``<I>(a)</I> 
inciting hatred by communicating, in any public place, 
statements that may lead to a breach of the peace'', and ``<I>(b)</I> 
promoting hatred against any identifiable group by 
communicating statements other than in private conversation''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12439"> 12439 </A></B>
<P>
	Are these provisions adequate to deal with the problems 
identified? For some people they are, but not for me. I should 
mention that our Criminal Code applies only in Canada, but the 
situation we are describing goes beyond our borders.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	The problem is an international one, and it is therefore 
necessary to promote international co-operation on this issue. 
Incidentally, Canada has signed international conventions that 
could apply to this area. The two most important ones are the 
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of 
Genocide, ratified in 1947, and the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, ratified in 1976.
<P>
	Hate messages may be sent from any country. It is therefore 
desirable to draft and adopt international guidelines for the use 
of the Information Highway.
<P>
	The matter should even be taken up at the UN. The U.S. 
Congress is now examining a bill that deals with the 
proliferation of this kind of information on the Internet. One of 
the provisions of this bill provides for fines of up to $100,000 if 
a person uses a computer to annoy, insult, threaten or harass. I 
think this is an interesting proposal, and I also think a certain 
amount of co-operation between Canada and the United States 
would be desirable in this respect.
<P>
	I support the suggestion made by the mover of this motion that 
we should adopt a code of conduct for suppliers of services on 
Internet and provide for a complaints mechanism.
<P>
	The authorities should also start a campaign to educate the 
public and Internet users and suppliers on the right way to use 
the Information Highway and their responsibilities in this 
respect.
<P>
	Users and service suppliers should also exercise a certain 
amount of self-discipline and restraint. So far, there have been 
no instances of legal action in Canada. The Minister of Justice 
and Attorney General of Canada must be vigilant when dealing 
with statements inciting hatred, violence and prejudice that are 
transmitted on the Internet. These hate messages constitute 
statements in the meaning of section 319 of the Criminal Code. 
The government should table legislation in Parliament to deal 
specifically with such cases.
<P>
	The government must act immediately. We must fight racism, 
discrimination and intolerance. We must fight  neo-Nazi 
groups, extreme rightist groups that promote white supremacy, 
anti-semitic groups, the Klu Klux Klan and all other groups that 
promote this kind of prejudice, and finally, all those who use the 
Information Highway to spread hate propaganda.
<P>
	I therefore support this motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to address the very timely topic of Motion 
No. 384 today, that the House move with speed to adopt 
legislative measures aimed at stopping the spread of hate 
propaganda via the electronic information highway while 
preserving the legitimate use of freedom of speech and 
expression. If legislation is passed on this issue the government 
will inherit a truly enormous task.
<P>
	I stand in support of this motion because we must always be 
fighting against wrong wherever we find it. Due to the 
increasing accessibility of illegal material directed especially at 
our young people we must struggle even harder to protect 
impressionable minds from feeding and growing on a diet of 
hatred, ignorance and fear.
<P>
	I have a person in my constituency who has received quite a 
bit of publicity lately. This man is a young, white supremacist 
connected with militant American groups and, as the media 
loves to do, he was featured on television a few weeks ago. He 
said that he hates the government with a perfect hatred.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	While I may have my own problems with the government, it 
certainly does not deserve hatred. The very fact that this fellow 
was allowed to say what he said on national television without 
being thrown in jail shows that he is obviously wrong in his 
beliefs.
<P>
	In a great many other countries he would be more justified in 
making such venomous diatribes. In Canada it is easy to grab the 
spotlight and heap abuse on our system even while standing 
within the shadow of a benevolent government. I would be 
interested to know if he not only derives his freedom, but also 
gets his living from the very government that he says he 
despises.
<P>
	I was reminded of this outrageous philosophy at our local V-E 
Day remembrance day services I attended last weekend. 
Together we remembered the millions of young soldiers who 
dashed all their hopes and dreams against Hitler's mightiest 
armies, the man who attempted to put the whole world under his 
jackboot.
<P>
	Hitler did not care about the Canadians, the Europeans, the 
Americans, the countless Asians who died. He did not even care 
about his own people. He cared about power. He used young, 
impressionable, dissatisfied men, like the man from my 
constituency, to get it for him. Many of them died along with 
their leader in the second world war.
<P>
	It is an incredible irony that the very system that tens of 
millions of people fought to the death to preserve is now being 
used to shelter someone like this, who promotes Hitler's 
philosophy. It stands as yet another proof of the incredible 
strength and essential goodness of our political system. While 
we must 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12440"> 12440 </A></B>
<P>
preserve this freedom, we must also preserve the stability of the 
system. Otherwise all those soldiers would have died in vain.
<P>
	As the human body tolerates all sorts of germs, it also 
struggles against infections. Our society is like an organism that 
plays host to all sorts of philosophies but it, too, has the right to 
guard against those which are most destructive.
<P>
	Hate literature and hate propaganda on the Internet are like 
pollution washing up on a seashore. Although we may never get 
rid of all the pollution, we must always keep cleaning the sand 
on our portion of the beach or else eventually we will be buried 
in the pollution. More and more hate literature is washing up on 
our personal shores, in our homes and businesses each and every 
day. We must actively battle it or risk having impressionable 
people won over by it.
<P>
	Those who would claim an untrammelled right of freedom to 
use the Internet for any purpose stand on shifting ground. They 
would never claim that right in other areas. For instance, no one 
acknowledges the right of bank robbers to use our system of 
roads with complete freedom. Every time bank robbers use our 
highways to get away, the police do their utmost to stop this 
abuse of freedom. It should be the same when one travels the 
information highway.
<P>
	To use another analogy, no one would claim that the 
government has no right to regulate the use of poisons in the 
marketplace, to pass laws to make sure that the poisons do not sit 
on a shelf alongside the food that we must purchase. Likewise, 
there are poisonous thoughts that should never sit on the shelf 
beside harmless chat groups and information libraries on the 
Internet.
<P>
	There is a difference between freedom and licence. Freedom 
is simply the right to do whatever is good but licence is the abuse 
of that right in order to harm others. In the case of the Internet, 
the definition of harm becomes all important.
<P>
	One of the hardest things is to define an intellectual crime 
where victims do not suffer physical or monetary loss. Should 
all white supremacist material be thought of at hate literature? Is 
pornography hate literature? Are religious messages that decry 
the actions of a person or a group based on a legitimate sense of 
moral offence hate literature? How can one determine the degree 
of hatred? Is just a little bit of hatred okay? It is very difficult to 
define a hate crime.
<P>
	The next problem we encounter is very nearly 
insurmountable. That is the matter of enforcement. The member 
for Winnipeg North is perhaps suggesting the  most difficult of 
all possible tasks, an act of global regulation.
<P>
	Internet messages are nearly anonymous. There are trillions 
of possible hiding places in the Internet. The sources of hate 
literature are limitless and the criminals can be located 
anywhere in the world. If one is found and prosecuted within 
Canadian borders, 1,000 can take his place from any other 
country.
<P>
	Obviously any regulation of the Internet would require 
international co-operation and it could only hope to drive the 
worst offenders underground. I note with satisfaction the 
Liberal House leader was reported on March 28 to have spoken 
favourably about an international agreement to stop the flow of 
this material into Canada. That would be necessary.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	We want to avoid a vast bureaucracy of Internet police hired 
to listen to private conversations. If a police force was able to 
listen to all private telephone conversations, we would think it 
was a terrible abuse of human rights. I would certainly think so 
as well. All kinds of offensive things are communicated every 
day in person or over the telephone lines. People have a right to 
their privacy even when they say bad or ridiculous things.
<P>
	However, the difference between personal communication 
and the Internet is that personal communications are 
inaccessible to all but the communicating parties. Through news 
groups the Internet makes essentially private conversations and 
communications available to anyone. That makes the Internet a 
thing of beauty and a beast at the same time.
<P>
	A partial answer is in international agreements but perhaps 
the most effective answer lies in the actions of the people of 
goodwill who might act as volunteer watchdogs on the Internet. 
Millions of people read each other's thoughts each day and 
comment on them. Thousands of users can get together and 
electronically sanction someone who abuses the information 
highway.
<P>
	This volunteer policing effort holds real promise for cleaning 
up the Internet, but once again that careful balance between free 
speech and responsible speech must be preserved, providing 
room for legitimate disagreements. That is why I think the most 
effective action the government could take is not legislative.
<P>
	Government could get the best bang for its buck by supporting 
the development of a set of Internet conventions or broadly 
based rules. Call them operating rules, call them a public code of 
conduct or electronic ethics. These guiding principles would 
suggest to users when they should report to police, when they 
should simply reproach the sender or when they should band 
together to sanction another user.
<P>
	Most Internet users around the world are responsible people, 
despite the horror stories we read in the newspapers. If there are 
vastly more responsible people than irresponsible ones, then it 
should be simple to  obtain their co-operation in stopping the 
spread of material that is illegal.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12441"> 12441 </A></B>
<P>
	The government could sponsor a small advisory group to take 
leadership in this area, to draft these voluntary Internet 
conventions using the legal assistance that government can 
provide and have the group go global on the Internet with its 
proposals, not working necessarily from government to 
government but from user to user. Let users decide among 
themselves what should be allowed and what should not.
<P>
	Winston Churchill said in a speech at Harvard University in 
1943 that the empires of the future are empires of the mind. This 
has never been more true than in the case of the Internet. At the 
moment it is purely an intellectual kingdom, but thoughts are 
powerful. Ideas in cyberspace translate into real world action 
and an Internet kingdom without laws will one day generate 
lawless deeds.
<P>
	If the government passes laws to prosecute the worst 
offenders and helps to develop conventions for voluntary action 
on the Internet, this intellectual kingdom will become one of 
peace and safety. We can hope for nothing better for us and for 
our children than to experience that peace.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research 
and Development), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
motion put forward by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North. I applaud his efforts on behalf of Canadians in 
bringing this to the attention of the House and moving to take an 
important step by recommending we take action and move 
forward in abolishing hate and hateful messages on the 
information highway.
<P>
	It is clearly not an easy aspect to consider as the Internet is 
travelled and is accessible from anywhere in the world. It is 
important subject matter and an important area for us to be 
concerned about as our children increasingly participate in and 
use the Internet and computers generally.
<P>
	We must think not only of Canadians. Our messages travel 
around the world. We must think about people in other countries 
as well. Canada is a society that has grown and developed a very 
important ethic of tolerance, an ethic in which we disagree with 
those who tend to promote hate. We would like this concept of 
tolerance that we have developed in Canada to be spread around 
the world through media like the Internet through approaches 
like the worldwide web.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Let us keep in mind at the moment that the problem is 
relatively small. At this point only a tiny proportion of the 5,000 
Usenet discussion groups have any problems that might come 
under this concept of hateful material.
<P>
	Nevertheless, it is important because of the rapidity with 
which the Internet is expanding, which it is estimated now 
reaches some 40 million people around  the world, that we start 
to move in this area. In doing so, I think it is important to first 
recognize that there are areas under the current 
telecommunications legislation and regulations where offensive 
and unsolicited content or messages can be dealt with.
<P>
	For example, under section 8.2 of Bell Canada's terms of 
service which sets out the basic rights and obligations of 
telephone companies and their subscribers, customers are 
prohibited from using the public telephone network in a way that 
is contrary to law for the purpose of making annoying or 
offensive calls. Originators of such calls, hate or racist 
messages on a telephone answering machine can be prosecuted. 
The public can file complaints with the telephone company or 
the CRTC who will pursue these investigations.
<P>
	Section 41 of the Telecommunications Act authorizes the 
CRTC to take regulatory steps to protect consumers against 
possible abuses from unsolicited telecommunications, 
computerized solicitations or junk faxes which may contain 
offensive content. Under this section, the commission 
introduced regulations restricting the use of automatic dialling 
and announcing devices for the purpose of broadcasting 
commercial messages, as well as various safeguards to protect 
consumers against unsolicited messages such as call blocking. 
While not intended specifically to control the dissemination of 
offensive content, these regulations can nonetheless be used to 
discourage abuses in this area.
<P>
	Section 36 of the Telecommunications Act gives the 
commission some latitude in allowing telecommunications 
carriers to take into account the content or the message it carries 
over its facilities.
<P>
	A case in point is the commission's approval of a number of 
safeguards to protect consumers, particularly children, against 
unwanted exposure over the 900 number telephone service 
which delivers audiotext services, including so-called adult 
entertainment.
<P>
	The commission granted the telephone companies some 
discretion to refuse to provide billing and collection service to 
certain 900 service operations which in the opinion of the 
telephone company offer a program or service which does not 
comply with the program content guidelines approved by the 
commission. This forces the service provider to use an 
alternative billing method such as credit card billing, 
prepayment or some other approach which provides greater 
control by consumers over the use of the service. The CRTC has 
also provided a number of other protection measures, including 
the provision of call blocking of 900 service upon request.
<P>
	Consequently, in situations where the material is not illegal 
under the Criminal Code there may still be levers to block, 
control or limit its dissemination.
<P>
	There is of course no reason to believe that the Criminal Code 
itself cannot be used on the information highway, although to 
date it has not been so applied, but it remains there. It is an area 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12442"> 12442 </A></B>
<P>
which as in other forms of  communication, print media, et 
cetera, can certainly potentially be used.
<P>
	Under the information highway advisory council there are 
some initiatives already under way. The advisory council, which 
we appointed last year, has been looking at this area along with a 
number of other areas in terms of how Canada should have solid 
initiatives and policies in the area of the information highway.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	At its most recent meeting on April 21 the council brought 
forward for third reading a four-pronged approach to the 
limitation or attack on any hate messages which might be found 
on the information highway. The four-pronged approach 
includes attention to law enforcement in this area, to the 
development of a code of ethics as it applies to the information 
highway, and also education and public awareness. This area is 
growing very rapidly in use. It is important for school children 
and people in communities and for all Canadians to develop an 
awareness of what the media is, how it works, and the 
limitations and advantages of it.
<P>
	Another approach is the technological approach. It is rather 
interesting that the technology to block, monitor or interfere 
with hate messages and hate propaganda is something which is 
coming. It may provide users of the information highway with 
approaches that will be very useful in the future.
<P>
	With regard to the already existing legislative measures, I 
would like to talk about four points briefly.
<P>
	Criminal Code sections 318 to 320 may apply. Also section 13 
of the human rights act can apply. One problem is that 
computers on the Internet do not recognize international 
boundaries. It would therefore be rather difficult unless there 
are common international standards, regulations or laws to 
control it when it originates from other countries. There may be 
potential for bilateral and multilateral arrangements. This is 
something that could and should be pursued.
<P>
	The second prong of the approach suggested by the 
Information Highway Advisory Council deals with development 
of a code of ethics. Other areas of communication, for example 
many of the established media industries such as broadcasting, 
cable television and sound recording have successfully adopted 
voluntary guidelines to deal with offensive content. We feel it is 
advisable to move in this area on the information highway.
<P>
	The third prong of the council's strategy deals with public 
awareness, an important initiative which we need to undertake. 
It also deals with technological approaches which can be used to 
block transmission to allow schools and parents to filter content 
coming into homes and schools. I think we will see these sorts of 
filters more widely used. These can be very helpful in allowing 
individual Canadians to control access and content coming to 
them.
<P>
	These sorts of initiatives are coming from the Information 
Highway Advisory Council. This is a grassroots move and is 
strongly supported by my hon. colleague for Winnipeg North. 
The motion is an important step forward. I support it and think 
we can move forward together and create an electronic world 
which is not only exciting, but is also one which is ethical.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of the 
motion by the hon. member for Winnipeg North.
<P>
	The information highway has the potential to become one of 
the most glorious tools ever imagined, providing links between 
people all over the globe. Its potential for positive interaction 
for the sharing of information and ideas and education is 
unlimited.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	How tragic to think of it instead as a tool for those who would 
use it to spread their own malicious, bigoted, racist ideas, 
particularly to our children. I have read some of the vile 
messages these people have posted. The thought that my 
children might also read them makes me sick at heart.
<P>
	Canada has long had a reputation as a tolerant and 
compassionate nation, accepting with open arms immigrants 
and refugees from all over the world. Many of these people have 
fled their homelands to escape persecution. Many were being 
persecuted on the basis of their race alone. They have come to 
this great country believing that at long last they will be free to 
live their lives in peace. I can only imagine their horror when 
they discover their young children innocently tapping into a 
cesspool of hate propaganda.
<P>
	What of our older citizens who have lived through the 
unspeakable horrors of the second world war, some as fighters in 
our armed forces, some as victims of the madness of the Nazis? 
This year and this week in particular we are remembering the 
end of the second world war in Europe 50 years ago. We are once 
again celebrating the victories of those men and women who 
fought so valiantly to make the world safe for democracy. We 
are remembering those who lost their lives so that we could live 
in freedom and dignity. Were these sacrifices for nothing? Do 
we not owe it to them to continue the fight?
<P>
	Our veterans came back to Canada from the war with an 
understanding of what happens when one group of people 
determines that another is inferior to themselves. They saw 
firsthand the inhumanity man can inflict on his brother in the 
name of nationalism and racial superiority. They taught their 
children and their children taught their children the importance 
of tolerance for the beliefs of others. How sad that their 
great-grandchildren are being targeted for this misinformation. 
How sad that the very first information they might receive about 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12443"> 12443 </A></B>
<P>
the Holocaust could be misinformation from a revisionist intent 
on reviling the Jewish people.
<P>
	People have fought and died to preserve the rights and 
freedoms we enjoy in this country, but they did not fight and die 
to preserve the right of one group of people to defame the 
reputation of another. They did not fight and die so a skinhead 
using equipment at a publicly funded university could call into 
question the rights of Asian and black people to live in freedom 
and bear children.
<P>
	Freedom of speech and expression is one of the most 
important and basic rights of all Canadians, but it is not a right 
without limitation. We have laws in this country prohibiting the 
public incitement of hatred. These people are breaking our laws.
<P>
	We have heard that the users of the Internet are a self-policing 
group and are flooding those who are spreading hatred with 
messages countering their arguments. I commend these people 
for caring enough to try to counteract the hate propaganda, but 
my concern is that these messages are still being received. Right 
now it seems impossible to stop the perpetrators of hate 
propaganda on the Internet. That is why it is so important to start 
looking for solutions immediately.
<P>
	The hon. member for Winnipeg North has suggested a number 
of areas in which the Canadian government can begin looking 
for solutions. I am in full agreement with all of these 
suggestions, particularly his suggestion that these measures 
must be taken immediately. Time is of the essence. We must stop 
this flow of hateful and hurtful information now. The 
information highway must be a conduit where all people feel 
welcome.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, certainly I am very delighted over the last two hours of 
debate on the motion to have observed a unanimity of hearts and 
minds on this very crucial issue. I feel a resolve on the part of 
Parliament not to allow hate in Canada. It is a commitment to a 
fundamental Canadian value.
<P>
	On that note, I would appreciate it if you would seek 
unanimous consent, Mr. Speaker, to adopt the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt 
the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 6.17 p.m, the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.17 p.m.)
