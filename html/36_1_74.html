motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to Motion No. 85 which calls 
on the government to enact legislation which would, among other 
things, mandate toy manufacturers to label toys containing a 
substance called phthalates in order to allow parents to make an 
informed decision when buying products for their children.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The really important word in all this is informed.  Informed 
means that when you arrive at a conclusion all the facts have 
been before you.  Based on those facts you decide what is in your 
best interests.  What this motion is suggesting is that we are 
going to short circuit that process and we, in this House, are 
going proceed to determine what is in the best interests by 
requiring that toys be labelled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the evidence before us.  The evidence is that a group 
called Greenpeace has said that phthalates in toys, when children 
chew or suck on them, somehow enter into their bodies and this is 
unsafe.  Greenpeace bases that on a couple of scientific studies, 
one of which came from a Dutch group and the other from a Danish 
group.  The problem is these studies are now being refuted.  The 
Danish environmental protection agency in April 1997 recommended 
that certain types of teething rings be withdrawn from the 
market.  In July 1997 the Dutch health ministry suggested to toy 
retailers that they should withdraw some soft vinyl toys from the 
market.  Those recommendations were made after a meeting with 
Greenpeace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened since that time is the results of the Dutch 
study cannot be duplicated.  They did some kind of scientific 
study.   When they tried to come up with the same conclusions on 
the same data a second time, they could not.  In the case of the 
Danish study, any scientist who has looked at the methodology 
used has said that this is not a study at all but a conclusion 
reached on certain data given.  In terms of scientific 
methodology is is not acceptable.  No scientist could form a 
conclusion based on the kind of evidence that was being used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really is not germane to us in this House if in Denmark or in 
Holland governments have been pressured by groups such as 
Greenpeace to make a move based on evidence that is not sound, 
that is not scientific, that is not replicable, that is not 
acceptable.  That is a decision made in those countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember that in Europe there is something called the 
European Union which makes rules with respect to a number of 
issues on a regional basis.  It makes it for those member 
countries.  As recently as February 17, almost a month ago, the 
European Union's scientific committee looked at the evidence that 
was provided by Denmark. It looked at the evidence that was 
supplied by Holland. It looked at the evidence supplied by 
Greenpeace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It said it could not make a decision.  There was not enough 
evidence. There is no science in any of this.  This is a group of 
experts. This is a group of people who make objective, 
dispassionate, scientific decisions.  They said they could not 
make a decision.  They also pointed out in their decision that 
there was no urgency in any of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would ask why is there no urgency if, as is being 
suggested by Greenpeace, this is affecting the health of 
children. The answer is that phthalates are the most widely 
researched chemical polymer going.  Manufacturers in this country 
do not include on purpose components in toys or in their goods 
that are in some way going to affect or harm the lives of 
children.  There is some suggestion that this is a direct attempt 
or that they are being reckless.  That is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 6, 1998 Health Canada had a meeting with 
representatives of the industry to discuss this matter because 
the industry was concerned about the allegations being made by 
members opposite. 
The industry met with Health Canada and said it was responsible 
and that it wanted to deal with it. In that meeting, Health 
Canada agreed to take a lead in this matter.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to all members present that if Health Canada is to 
compile a group of scientists to examine and study this in order 
to reach a conclusion it would be terribly premature for us in 
this place, acting on a hunch from Denmark, Holland and 
Greenpeace, to come to the conclusion that parents are going to 
make an informed decision because we are going to require 
manufacturers to stick a label on toys which states the product 
contains phthalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a community of scientists within the government 
supported by the industry that is going to look at and analyse 
the data and reach a conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry has gone one step further and has said it is happy 
with the process.  It is glad that some independent third party 
is going to come in and look at it.  The industry will support 
the protocol as established, will support Health Canada and will, 
most important, support any conclusions reached by Health Canada 
in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a duty and an obligation in this place that when we 
start passing motions or enacting legislation with a scientific 
basis, where we can look for a cause and an effect, that we have 
the scientific data and all the evidence before us that will 
allow us to draw that correlation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to start reaching conclusions we need some type of 
scientific evidence that allows us to go from point A to 
point Z, being the conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are being asked to do by this motion is to go from point 
A to point Z but we do not know why.  It is based on a hunch, a 
suspicion and it is being driven by a group that has no evidence 
but still wants to propel this matter because it thinks it is in 
some sort of environmental interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end I think this motion must, as a result, be defeated. 
The only thing we are going to end up doing is creating a problem 
in the minds of parents because there will be the suggestion that 
when they buy a toy there is something wrong or something in this 
toy that may, according to the proponents of this motion, be 
harmful.  However, the only evidence, I suggest, is the direct 
opposite.  There is no evidence that will lead us to this 
conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason that I would ask members of this House 
that when this is voted on to vote against it and defeat it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, today we are 
resuming debate on Motion M-85 by our New Democratic colleague from 
Acadie-Bathurst.  It calls upon the government to: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—enact legislation mandating toy manufacturers to label toys 
containing phthalates in order to allow parents to make an 
informed decision when buying products for their children. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois and all of the other parties in the House 
support this motion, unlike the Liberal government, which has 
refused to do so until now. 
Moreover, my colleague from Sarnia—Lambton, who has just spoken, 
has given us one more example of how out of it his government is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us here are parents or grandparents.  As 
parliamentarians, we are, or should be, abreast of the latest 
developments, but how many of us know what serious health hazards 
phthalates represent for our children and grandchildren?  I 
congratulate and thank the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst for 
raising this matter. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this motion is passed, parents will be able to tell whether 
plastic toys contain phthalates.  And what are phthalates?  They 
are chemical agents containing lead or cadmium, which are added 
during the manufacture of plastic toys to make them softer or more 
malleable.  These substances are also found in a number of products 
made of vinyl or polyvinyl chloride, commonly called PVCs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we make a brief list of the commonplace items we have in 
our homes, we shall see that PVCs are common in consumer products 
such as plastic tableware, food packaging, furniture, floor 
coverings, plastic bottles, backpacks, even rainwear.  What worries 
me even more, however, is the frequent use of phthalates in the 
manufacture of toys and products for infants, such as nipples and 
pacifiers, teething rings, and other soft objects specifically 
intended to be mouthed by infants and toddlers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The danger to health lies in the fact that the phthalates do 
not bind with the PVC or vinyl, which constitute the basic material 
of the toys.  They remain freely mobile and can separate themselves 
from the PVCs.  What happens when a child exerts pressure on a toy, 
when he sucks or bites on a teething ring?  It is simple; he could 
directly ingest phthalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the soft PVC toys tested by Greenpeace contained up to 40% 
of their weight in phthalates. Yet, there is no mention of, warning 
about or label indicating the presence of hazardous substances. Should 
we not err on the side of safety instead of taking chances with the 
health of children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been shown that prolonged exposure to phthalates can cause 
cancer, liver and kidney damage, and even infertility. It is very 
strange that, in Canada, such substances are labelled as harmful when 
shipped in barrels but considered harmless, and even safe for eating, 
when used to make toys. That is a paradox, which must be denounced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A more recent study revealed that this substance might also 
imitate, although slightly, oestrogen, an hormone which plays an 
important role in regulating development and metabolism. Finally, lead, 
which is one of the ingredients in phthalates, is often found in PVC. 
Lead poisoning is widely recognized as one of the most serious threats 
to children's health. Exposure to even extremely low doses causes 
permanent damage to the nervous system. Let us not forget that young, 
growing children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of 
these substances. In many cases, the harm caused is irreversible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, European countries like Denmark, Austria, Belgium and the 
Netherlands have warned the public against the risks of playing 
regularly with these toys. Certain major toy store chains have decided 
to take certain toys off the market. 
In addition, Denmark and the Netherlands have banned the use of 
phthalates in all plastics and, of course, in toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is dragging its feet on this issue, Health 
Canada having decided not to take PVC plastic toys off the market in 
spite of the fact that a study commissioned by the department showed 
that lead concentrations were considerably higher than they should 
normally be.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can you believe that, out of the 24 products tested by the 
department, 17 exceeded a level of 200 parts per million, even though 
the Canadian standard, which is one of the most stringent in North 
America, is 15 parts per million? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the department refuses to regulate toys. Yet, it recognizes 
that lead is a neurotoxin that can cause irreversible and permanent 
damage to the brain, even when a person is only exposed to small doses. 
Again, there is a flagrant contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lead is regulated, but only for paintings, ceramics, glass and 
artists' pencils and brushes. Nowhere is there mention of the lead that 
can be found in toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Health Canada is trying to downplay the dangers posed by 
lead, considering that the levels of lead detected in certain toys 
during the study can cause irreversible neurological disorders in 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to reassure the public, the department released the 
results of a risk analysis. However, it is recognized within the 
scientific community that a risk analysis is based on an approximate 
exposure to chemical products, so as to draw some conclusions. According 
to experts, this method can be highly inaccurate in assessing actual 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Dr. Richard Maas of the Environmental Quality Institute, 
at the University of North Carolina, said that the methodology of this 
extremely superficial study was clearly biased to arrive at a negative 
conclusion about the risk involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of legislating, the department is proposing the 
implementation, on a strictly voluntary basis, of its strategy to reduce 
the levels of lead in products for children and other consumer products, 
which will come into effect in the year 2001. This strategy relies 
solely on the industry's good will. The government did not provide any 
incentive to protect children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the best way to avoid any risks related to the ingestion 
of phthalates would be to eliminate PVCs in all malleable toys. However, 
this is not the purpose of the motion before us, which only asks the 
government to enact legislation mandating manufacturers to label toys. 
This would allow parents to make an informed decision when buying 
products for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot oppose a preventive measure. We cannot refuse to provide 
information. 
To my knowledge, phthalates have always been considered a toxic, 
carcinogenic substance under the Canadian Environmental Health 
Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is once again sitting back and letting 
things happen. Yet, it said, in its throne speech, that “the experiences 
of Canada's children, especially in the early years, influence their 
health, their well-being, and their ability to learn and adapt 
throughout their entire lives”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is asking the government to be proactive. It is a 
government's role and duty in the area of public health. Will the 
government wait until tragedies occur before taking action? 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased today to speak to the motion introduced by my 
colleague, the member for Acadie—Bathurst.  I think it is a 
sensible motion that should be taken seriously.  Its purpose is to 
protect our children's health against chemical agents in certain 
toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Phthalates are chemical agents put in plastics to soften them. 
These very widespread agents are present in plastic lids, 
cellophane paper and children's toys.  Studies have shown that 
these materials can cause cancer, damage the liver and lead to 
infertility.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Growing children are more susceptible to these harmful 
effects.  Phthalates are released from toys and ingested into 
children's systems.  Even more alarming, phthalates are released 
from common toys such as pacifiers and other soft toys that 
children put in their mouths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a two-year-old daughter and this situation frightens 
me.  It is something that should be taken seriously.  It is 
infuriating that the Liberal Party does not consider this a serious 
matter.  I should not say the whole party, because we have been 
informed that a number of Liberal members support this motion, but 
it remains to be seen whether or not they will really support it 
when it comes to a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that new European studies resulted in store chains in 
Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Argentina, Spain, Belgium, 
Germany and Italy taking a great number of toys containing 
phthalates off the market.  This is a matter of protecting our 
children, as well as a consumer-rights issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada right now, parents who are concerned about this 
issue have no way of knowing whether the toys they are buying 
contain these chemical agents.  As lawmakers, we must take a stand 
on these issues that have not already been debated in Parliament, 
particularly when it is a question of protecting our children's 
interests and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a question of raising public awareness.  This is a 
very serious matter, when one considers that any young child has 
plastic toys he puts in his mouth.  I cannot stress enough that we 
are talking about our children and grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that we are asking is for these objects to be identified 
so that parents may decide whether or not to buy them.  We are not 
asking for them to be pulled off the shelves.  We are asking for a 
study to be carried out and for there to be labelling in the 
meantime.  Some countries have already withdrawn them.  We are not 
imagining things.  This is real.  It has happened, regardless of 
what any hon. member may say to the contrary. What has already 
happened cannot be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is all the more important because of its proactive 
nature in preventing long-term health problems.  Prevention is 
important because it will protect our children from liver disease, 
cancer and infertility.  It will also impact upon the future costs 
to our health system. 
If we can prevent devastating and costly diseases such as cancer 
now, our already overburdened health system will benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the only instance where this is happening. Many 
decisions being taken across this country are very costly to our 
health system.  We are making people ill.  We are not giving proper 
care to our people in hospitals. We are shipping them back home 
before they are ready, and they end up costing the system more as 
a result.  Some in this country end up paying a still higher price, 
as needless deaths occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are asking here is for these items to be labelled so 
that parents can decide whether or not to purchase them.  I think 
what we are asking is very reasonable.  There are some doubts being 
expressed about these products presenting a problem, that they are 
making our children sick. 
I cannot imagine that this House cannot reach agreement on such an 
important matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for assurance that our children will not fall 
ill as a result of our buying products that are not identified in 
the stores.  It is a sad thing that the Liberals are playing 
politics at the expense of our children's well-being.  This is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking for the moon and the stars, here.  We are 
just asking for a little label on products that make our children 
sick.  One might well wonder which companies with certain political 
affiliations are going to be hurt by this labelling requirement. 
A stop must be put to this.  People must come first, ahead of 
scoring political points, when such important issues are at stake.

products.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to speak to the motion by the member for Acadia—Bathurst.  It 
reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should enact 
legislation mandating toy manufacturers to label toys containing 
phthalates in order to allow parents to make an informed decision 
when buying products for their children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion was introduced following Greenpeace's allegation 
about additives in vinyl toys.  They alleged that phthalate 
esters, a common family of chemical products, represented danger 
to children.  However, they have been used safely for over 40 
years in toys as well as health sensitive applications.  These 
include blood bags, catheters, IV tubing and surgical gloves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As they are used in a wide range of products, no other 
plasticizer has been subject to the same level of scrutiny and 
testing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall Health Canada released a report conducted by the 
product safety bureau, Environmental Health Directorate, that 
concluded that the lead and cadmium present in these vinyl 
consumer products does not pose any significant risk to children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has undertaken a risk assessment of phthalates and 
will be releasing the results later this spring.  It is in the 
best interests of parents and children to wait for Health 
Canada's risk assessment.  The decision to label toys should be 
based upon sound science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present there is no scientifically validated evidence that 
show DINP is presently posing a health risk.  The significance of 
labelling could be seriously undermined as a responsible way to 
inform parents about toy content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party respects and expects the health safety of our children 
to be foremost when buying products.  We must be sure that there 
is a clear and very present risk to warrant labelling.  However, 
our party will be the first to approve appropriate labelling 
should the scientific and regulatory agency state that this 
chemical family presence presents any sort of risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent Danish studies cited by Greenpeace have been 
discredited; one, for producing unrepeatable results and the 
other for false methodology.  Standards must, however, be put in 
place by Health Canada's product safety bureau.  There needs to 
be a regulatory standard for intake just as the European Union 
has already taken the authority to put in place a maximum daily 
intake of DINP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot support this motion until the necessary scientific 
protocols have been established and Health Canada has in place 
regulatory powers under Health Canada's product safety bureau.

Speaker, I am pleased to address the House on this motion dealing 
today with potential health and safety issues for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the general concern over any potential threats to 
children's health, and that is a concern shared by all Canadians, 
and our common interest to see that appropriate measures be taken 
to address these threats, I want to use my time in this debate to 
highlight some of the more effective means the government is 
currently employing to protect the health and safety of Canada's 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of the most effective tools at the government's disposal are 
the Hazardous Products Act and the hazardous products toys 
regulations which are both administered by the Products Safety 
Bureau of Health Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the legislation, certain toys are banned from sale and 
other toys can be marketed only if they meet specific safety 
requirements.  It should be noted it is the responsibility of 
manufacturers and importers to ensure that products comply with 
the regulations of the act and regulations before they are 
imported or marketed into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Product safety officers routinely monitor the marketplace and 
take appropriate enforcement action on any toys that contravene 
that legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mission of Health Canada's product safety bureau is to 
prevent product related deaths and injuries.  Legislation, safety 
standards and consumer information are elements of the bureau's 
activities to ensure safer products for children and to promote 
their safe use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These activities dovetail with the department's national 
information and education program.  Child safety and injury 
prevention in the use of consumer products is one of the major 
programs and major goals of that particular area.  I can say that 
as a former educator with the Waterloo County Board of Education 
I certainly understood fully the kinds of goals that were to be 
achieved by that particular educational program. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will continue to look after the 
interests of all Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, no matter how much safety is built into a 
product, children continue to die or suffer injuries from 
improper use of products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The direct aim of Health Canada's information and education 
program is to reduce that number of accidental deaths and 
injuries to children in Canada.  The program reaches out to 
children, parents, caregivers, day care centres and schools with 
useful safety information such as safety awareness campaigns, 
posters, pamphlets and videos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within Health Canada the health protection branch works to 
eliminate health risks associated with the natural and man-made 
environments that can lead to illness or death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its principal responsibilities involves assessment and control 
of the nutrition, quality and safety of food; the safety and 
effectiveness of drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, 
radiation-emitting devices and other consumer products; the 
identification and assessment of environmental hazards; the 
surveillance, prevention and control of diseases and the 
provision of specialized laboratory services such as those used 
in the testing and assessment of plastic products containing 
potentially hazardous phthalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out, contrary to what has been said in 
this House this morning, that phthalates do in fact bind to PVC. 
There is no evidence that long term exposure to DINP causes 
concern and liver damage.  There simply is no proof in that 
regard.  It is a groundless assertion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out with respect to lead that 15 parts per 
million referred to for lead is not a government standard.  It is 
a proposed strategy.  In fact, the lead strategy is still being 
reviewed and under consultation with the stakeholders and indeed 
the focus groups are meeting next week across Canada with respect 
to that very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the common threads which bind these various programs 
together in the health protection branch is the government's 
concern for the health and safety of Canadian children.  Health 
and safety is paramount, it is important and is something with 
which we are very concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concern is shared with parents and care givers, public 
health workers, manufacturers and retailers across Canada.  By 
pooling existing resources, knowledge and expertise and by 
working with those partners across society, the government is 
indeed taking effective ongoing measures to address potential 
health threats to Canada's children.  It is important that we 
continue in that vein and do the right thing for all our 
children, and for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
indeed happy to be able to enter into the debate on what I think 
has become an important bill because of some important principles 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was doing my research for this, I had an analogy which 
came to mind.  I remember many years ago driving on an Alberta 
highway. At one place there was a corner and a sign which said 
you must slow down.  I forget what the speed was but it was in 
the old days when we had miles per hour.  It said slow down to 35 
and so I did.  I realized that was an incredibly slow speed. It 
was not an accurate evaluation of a safe speed to travel that 
road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over time, travelling that same road, I just kept my usual speed 
of 60 miles an hour and I could do it in total safety even though 
there was this little yellow information sign that said I should 
for safety reasons slow down to 35.  It was unrealistic. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, there is a sign on an exit which leads to the 
road where I live.  It indicates that the maximum speed is 80 
kilometres per hour.  Drivers come off the 100 kilometre per hour 
freeway on to the exit which is at 80 kilometres. However, if 
drivers take that corner at more than 40 kilometres they wind up 
with their wheels in the air.  The sign is not meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one case the sign says “Go slow, but you do not have to”. 
In the other case the sign says “Go 80”, but it should be 
slower.  If the driver does not make the adjustment when he or 
she actually sees the turn of the exit, it will not be a safe 
exit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That principle applies to this bill.  This bill asks for the 
labelling of a product.  That label had better be accurate. There 
are a couple of reasons for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the label says “This is a dangerous product” when in fact 
it is not, that has two important implications.  One is that it 
is an unnecessary cost.  It is an economic handicap to the 
companies which manufacture the product.  The second is that it 
makes the consumers immune to the warning, just like the sign 
which said I should drive slower than was really necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the label on the product says “This is a dangerous product” 
when it fact it is not, it is like crying wolf.  It means that 
people will not respond when they see a label which in fact 
should be a legitimate warning.  That is what happens if, in 
fact, the product is not dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, if the product is dangerous, perhaps there 
should be more than a label.  Maybe the product should be banned. 
If it really is dangerous, and if it has been proven to be so, 
then we should ask ourselves:  Is it sufficient simply to warn 
people that if they buy this product it will be dangerous?  For 
people to buy that product is not a wise decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our labels must be meaningful.  There must be solid scientific 
evidence when we put a label on a product which says it is 
dangerous that it is dangerous.  Then Canadians will be able to 
trust labels.  Otherwise they become meaningless and there is a 
danger of economic hardship and lost jobs for no reason if in 
fact the science is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take another tack, that is the companies which 
manufacture these products would be totally foolish to use 
products which are dangerous.  What would be in it for them?  Why 
would a company produce a product which, over time, will end up 
causing harm to or the death of people?  It does not make any 
sense.  No company in our present society would do that willingly 
and knowingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure my NDP friends will say that I am attributing too much 
morality to private corporations.  I happen to believe that the 
morality is there.  I have not yet encountered a corporation, 
except perhaps the tobacco companies, which would do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, in the case of tobacco companies there is valid 
scientific evidence.  Perhaps we ought to take stronger 
approaches to the curbing of the use of tobacco and smoking and 
wrapping our young people into that habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see solid scientific evidence.  I believe that 
Health Canada has a role to play in this.  It is currently 
conducting a study.  It is my understanding that the results of 
the study will be out shortly.  If the scientific evidence 
indicates there is no real danger, then it would show how badly 
conceived this bill is.  If it comes up with the conclusion, 
soundly based on scientific evaluation, that the products which 
are manufactured in this way are dangerous, then we ought to do 
something more than simply label them and take further steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My argument is very simple.  We need to make sure the labels are 
meaningful. 
They must not be based on emotion nor on the crusade of some 
group that has no scientific evidence. They must be based on 
sound scientific health evaluations and research.  When that 
occurs the Canadian government has a role to play to protect our 
young people and our population.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today and participate in the debate on Motion No. 
85. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first reviewed this motion I could not pronounce the word 
phthalates and I think most Canadians on seeing the word might 
have the same difficulty.  I undertook not only to learn the 
correct pronunciation but also to try to understand what was 
being proposed and why it was being proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the people at Health Canada for sharing with me 
the evidence, information and work they have undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has the responsibility for ensuring the safety of 
products.  I am convinced the department will take appropriate 
action as required to safeguard our children.  I say that not 
just as a member of the House of Commons but as a grandmother.  I 
have three grandchildren under the age of three and a half who 
also put things in their mouths.  If they are putting things that 
are hazardous to their health in their mouths then I do not 
believe a label is adequate protection. That is why I have some 
concerns about the private member's motion before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has been concerned about phthalates since the 
1980s.  Last fall the environmental organization Greenpeace 
released a report on a group of chemicals.  These are 
polyvinylchlorides or PVC plastics. PVC and plastics are 
contained not only in toys but in many things found in our 
everyday lives, from the seats in our cars to coverings on 
notebooks.  The Greenpeace report actually set off the latest 
round in what is a longstanding debate on the potential hazards 
of PVCs in children's toys and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would like to review the Greenpeace claim and inform the 
House of Health Canada's activities in response to this concern. 
I have been listening very carefully to the debate and I believe 
that every member of this House shares the concern about the 
safety of our children and our grandchildren.  We also want to 
know if substances which we come in contact with in our daily 
lives have hazards that we should be aware of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of phthalates is very important.  According to the 
Greenpeace study eight of the 63 toys it tested were purchased in 
Canada.  The report claimed that four of the six toys contained 
phthalate concentrations ranging from 20% to 39%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada obtained a copy of the Greenpeace report and 
departmental officials have studied its findings.  It is extremely 
important to note that the assessment was done in co-operation 
with international experts in this area. It is not just Canada 
and the United States but the world is interested in products 
which may have harmful contaminants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials at Health Canada conducted a field survey and found 
that 63 toys mentioned in the Greenpeace report were available in 
Canada.  All 63 toys were made in the United States and 38 of the 
toys are available in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada's health protection branch conducted its own tests 
on three of the four products that Greenpeace had identified as 
having significant concentrations of phthalates. The tests 
revealed a similar concentration of phthalates as the tests done 
by Greenpeace with levels ranging from 3.9% to 26%.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the phthalate identified in both studies 
is the one known as DINP.  This chemical was introduced by toy 
manufacturers in the United States six years ago to replace 
another phthalate, DEHP.  Why is the difference important? DEHP 
was thought to be potentially harmful and hazardous to children 
and was voluntarily taken from the marketplace and replaced with 
DINP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following its usual precautionary approach to potential health 
hazards, Health Canada expanded its testing and assessment of PVC 
plastic toys to an additional 30 products that were not on the 
Greenpeace list.  With the exception of an unknown phthalate 
found in one sample, the only phthalate detected was DINP. Eight 
additional samples were then bought and tested. Only DINP was 
detected with very small amounts of DEHP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These results support my view that private member's Motion No. 
85 is premature.  I believe it is premature because the 
scientific evidence is not in and available.  I also believe that 
if the evidence showed that the phthalate DINP is a hazard to 
children, then labelling would be inadequate.  Therefore, I do 
not believe we should proceed with this motion.  It is my 
understanding that the research will be concluded this spring. 
The evidence will be there and will be evaluated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that Health Canada will remain vigilant in its 
quest to ensure that potential health risks which are posed by 
PVC plastic toys and others will be brought to the attention of 
all Canadians in an appropriate manner.  If it is a health hazard 
it will be banned and not simply labelled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department is continuing to monitor the situation.  It is 
testing plastic toys.  As the minister has indicated, Health 
Canada and this government will take whatever action is necessary 
to protect the health of Canada's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to have these debates in the House.  One 
of the concerns I have is that we not unduly alarm people about 
potential hazards when there is no evidence to support those 
findings.  I await the results of scientific evidence. I would 
urge all members of this House to make sure they get the facts 
straight when we are having this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the investigations indicate that these additives in vinyl 
products pose or are likely to pose a risk to young children, I 
believe the department will not and should not hesitate to take 
necessary corrective measures.  However, it would be 
irresponsible for us to act without the evidence to suggest that 
our children are in danger. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this important debate this morning and to 
endorse the motion advanced by my colleague the member for 
Acadie—Bathurst on the toy labelling question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to put this motion in perspective, members will recall that 
the motion was debated before Christmas.  The member was 
endeavouring to have the toys removed from the shelves during the 
Christmas rush.  We are on the second hour of debate and we are 
now endeavouring to see if we cannot get some action taken before 
next Christmas rolls around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also noteworthy that it seemed in the initial hour of 
debate last December two of the other opposition parties in this 
place were supportive of the motion.  However, they seem to have 
changed their minds, listening carefully to the debate this 
morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make note of what this motion attempts to do.  It 
recommends that the government introduce legislation requiring 
manufacturers to indicate on the label when a toy contains 
phthalates so that parents can make an informed decision before 
buying products for their children. 
As has been noted several times, we are particularly concerned 
about young children at the teething stage who want to put soft 
malleable toys in their mouths. We are concerned about it because 
phthalates have been proven to cause cancer, infertility and 
liver damage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I speak on this motion for the first time it alarms me to 
hear people say that the evidence is not in yet, that more 
studies must be done, and that Health Canada is doing more 
studies.  Note that Health Canada has been busy laying off 
scientists right, left and centre.  One wonders when and where we 
will get the scientific evidence referred to by the previous 
speaker.  One hopes it will be this spring.  We will wait to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of other countries have taken varying degrees of action 
on the issue of phthalates.  Some of those countries are Denmark, 
Sweden, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Austria, Germany, Belgium 
and the Philippines.  We are studying the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to members opposite that we should not be throwing the 
baby out with the bath water on this issue.  We should be heeding 
what other countries are concluding in this area.  An ounce of 
prevention is worth a pound of cure.  It is better to err on the 
side of safety and wait until the studies are completed.  It is 
better to take the necessary preventive action, put labels on the 
toys and children's clothing such as raincoats. Put the labels on 
now.  If when Health Canada completes its tests it concludes 
there is no reason for alarm, then we would proceed accordingly. 
It is better to be safe than sorry, especially with the youngest 
and most vulnerable in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Health Canada study, of the 17 products tested, 12 
contained lead at levels higher than Health Canada's guideline. 
All of these products were in the range of between 295 parts per 
million to 17,714 parts per million.  High levels of cadmium were 
also present in the products that were tested and two products 
exceeded the guideline for Health Canada's extractability which 
is 90 parts per million. Despite that evidence Health Canada has 
concluded to date that there is not a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe some bona fide criticisms can be made in this area. 
Testing 17 of the many thousands of vinyl products on sale in 
Canada every year is not the comprehensive testing program others 
have done.  Certainly there is the Greenpeace report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only one type of extractability test was done for the Health 
Canada report. Health Canada did not do a surface lead test on 
brand new products, nor did it do an ultraviolet light 
degradation study. This is particularly problematic since a lot 
of products are sold for use outdoors. The majority of products 
tested by Health Canada exceeded its guidelines for total lead 
content.  We fail to understand why this is not deemed to be a 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today is very important.  I urge all 
members of the House to support this motion when it comes to a 
vote.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to stand in this 
estimable place today to address this very worthisome motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far be it for me to be at variance with my colleague from 
Thornhill, but she did mispronounce the word phthalates. She is 
from Toronto, and being from the upper Ottawa valley, from the 
great riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, we have our own 
Ottawa Valley vernacular.  I would ask my hon. colleague from 
Thornhill to forgive me for the way we pronounce it and the way 
we say Toronto or the big smoke.  We do not enunciate Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having cleared up that issue, I am very pleased to address the 
motion before the House on phthalates in plastic toys.   The 
potential health hazards of polyvinyl chloride or PVC in plastic 
toys is not a new issues.  It is one that Health Canada has been 
involved with since the mid-1980s.  Probably the member for 
Calgary Southeast would not remember it being brought to Health 
Canada in the 1980s.  He was probably in diapers at that stage of 
his illustrious career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to provide the House with some 
background information on this important children's health issue 
and to review Health Canada's ongoing response to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department has taken a strong leadership role over the past 
12 years in assessing and acting upon potential PVC health risks 
to children.  The issue of phthalates in children's products, 
especially a potentially hazardous phthalate known as DEHP, has 
been investigated by Health Canada and other foreign governmental 
agencies for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early 1990s Health Canada took an active role in ongoing 
research over children's PVC products, specifically pacifiers. 
The department shared its concerns about DEHP and its research 
with the Consumer Product Safety Commission in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 Toy Manufacturers of America voluntarily decided to 
discontinue the use of DEHP.  In early 1992 Health Canada 
conducted a survey to confirm the toy manufacturers' statement 
and found that the majority of children's products made of PVC 
contained only trace amounts of DEHP which were well below 
maximum acceptable levels.  Building on this progress, Health 
Canada maintains contact with scientific organizations and 
governments around the world to obtain the latest information and 
research on potentially hazardous phthalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last June the department investigated a Danish report indicating 
a potentially hazardous substance in a teething ring. Immediate 
tests showed no scientific evidence of DEHP in the rings. 
However, the department is doing further evaluations to determine 
the potential risk of other phthalates in these and other types 
of plastic toys.  The testing is in line with Health Canada's 
policy of investigating toys or products brought to its attention 
as potentially dangerous.   While the department is not aware of 
any incident in which a child has ever had an adverse reaction to 
phthalates, including the discontinued—

that Bill C-19, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code (Part I) 
and the Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second time

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Bill C-19 erodes a couple of Canada's highest political 
values, both democracy and freedom.  Second, Bill C-19 causes 
division not only between employers and employees but also 
because it creates two classes of citizens in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically the legislation sets the rights of people who ship 
grain above the rights of those people who, for instance, might 
ship other commodities like those of their neighbours next door 
who grow something like alfalfa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out that the legislation has been roundly 
criticized by a number of people.  It is not just me who holds 
the legislation in low esteem.  For instance, we note in the last 
parliament that the Liberal dominated committee which examined 
the legislation found cause to criticize a number of aspects of 
the legislation.  At that time it was known as Bill C-66.  In 
part the legislation died going into the last election. Liberal 
senators wanted to take some time to look at it and as a result 
the legislation died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been reintroduced as Bill C-19 and I want to explain to 
the public and to my colleagues in the House why I strongly 
oppose this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing that concerns me is the fact that the new Canada 
Industrial Relations Board, the replacement for the Canada Labour 
Board, would be allowed to certify a union on virtually any 
pretext without a democratic vote.  That is completely 
anti-democratic.  It stands opposed to everything that Canadians 
as democrats truly believe in.  I am offended that the government 
would choose to introduce this now and to allow that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my colleagues doubt for a moment the impact of that type of 
provision, I refer them to what happened recently in both Ontario 
and British Columbia where provincial legislation allows labour 
boards to essentially go ahead and certify unions either in 
opposition to what workers have decided themselves in a free vote 
or in some cases allowing labour bodies to go around the idea of 
having a vote at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the best examples is a Wal-Mart store in Nelson, B.C., 
where recently the British Columbia Labour Board disallowed a 
vote because “an employer told an employee he would not benefit 
from the union”.  People at the labour board in B.C. have 
determined that someone's right to free speech, to persuade 
employees, is somehow wrong.  Therefore they disallowed the idea 
of a vote.  It was absolutely unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of sweeping power would be granted to the new labour 
board the government is forming now under this new legislation. 
It is anti-democratic and as democrats we must stand against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second big reason we need to oppose the legislation is that 
the jurisprudence of the Canada Labour Relations Board would lead 
us to expect that the new CIRB would deem the use of replacement 
workers to be unlawful conduct.  This causes me grave concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current legislation federally regulated industries can 
use replacement workers to keep their operations viable.  In some 
cases they have to do that if they want to survive as a business. 
The new legislation will give the board the power to say that 
they cannot use replacement workers.  This is extraordinarily 
dangerous.  It is a step backward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To all those people out there who understand that in a very 
competitive global economy these days we need provisions of all 
kinds to keep our businesses going, they understand intuitively 
that this will work against that principle and in fact will 
endanger the livelihoods of the very people who should be 
benefiting, the employees, if a business is able to keep going. 
We stand opposed to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that my colleagues in the Senate raised it as an issue 
they were very concerned about, as they did also about the issue 
of the decertification and certification of unions without a 
vote.  It was absolutely unbelievable.  They raised these as 
issues they were very concerned about.  I point out that these 
are Liberal and Conservative senators by and large.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third point concerns me very much.  I know we do not have a 
lot of time to speak on these issues.  Under this new legislation 
the Canada Industrial Relations Board can order an employer to 
release to a union representative a list of the names and 
addresses of the employees who work off site.  There is 
absolutely no provision for obtaining the employees' consent to 
do that.  That causes me concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends in the Senate were concerned about that as well. They 
have raised this issue.  We know the Sims task force preceded 
Bill C-66.  It provided the basis for some of that legislation. 
In addition to raising concerns about things like replacement 
worker provisions the government was proposing and about the 
proposal to go ahead and certify a union without a democratic 
vote, it raised concerns about the issue of people's right to 
privacy.  The senators pointed out that if people did not want to 
be hassled by a union it should be their right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner also said that people should not have 
to be hassled by a union if they do not want to be hassled by it. 
There could easily be provision for people who work off site to 
be informed of what a union is proposing, if they give their 
consent to the employer to release their names and addresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is private information.  We should not be putting into 
legislation provisions that allow unions to go ahead and contact 
people at home, at their place of work or wherever, when they do 
not want that to happen.  It is important for people who believe 
in that fundamental freedom, that right to privacy, that we 
oppose this piece of legislation.  Those are things people have 
talked about in a lot of detail up until now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about one particular aspect of the legislation 
which affects my riding.  It is the provision that would allow 
service to grain vessels to continue in a strike or lockout 
condition but would not allow other types of service for other 
types of commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is of particular concern in my riding where five plants 
produce dehydrated alfalfa.  When there has been a shutdown on 
the west coast, in the past those plants have lost millions of 
dollars in sales.  It is a $100 million a year industry.  Farmers 
who grow alfalfa will not get their product from the port to the 
ship but grain producers will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to take anything away from grain producers. Their 
gain is wonderful.  By allowing that essentially what happens is 
that the bargaining position of alfalfa producers and shippers is 
weakened.  They can no longer combine with the politically 
powerful farmers who want their grain shipped to markets across 
the ocean.  They are set aside in the legislation.  It creates a 
two tier system and we think it is absolutely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand with my colleagues in the Reform Party and strongly 
condemn the government for Bill C-19.  We believe it is divisive, 
anti-democratic and works against the principle of freedom.  I 
encourage colleagues around the House to work with their 
colleagues in the Senate to oppose the legislation.  We think 
Bill C-19 is wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to the Bill C-19 
amendments to the Canada Labour Code which my colleagues and I 
are opposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an anti-democratic bill which overrides the privacy 
rights of workers and collective bargaining, properly conceived. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT16"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT16"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1215
<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say at the outset that the Reform Party has, since its 
founding, supported the principle of collective bargaining.  We 
believe that workers, by joining together democratically through 
an appropriate, open, transparent and democratic process, may 
decide, quite legitimately, to negotiate collectively and bargain 
collectively with their employers.  That is a fundamental 
economic right which is recognized in every liberal democracy and 
which is also recognized by the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Bill C-19 seeks to do, by amending the Canada Labour Code, 
is to change the legal framework within which those collective 
bargaining rights are exercised by people who work in industries 
regulated by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill changes the name and the powers of the Canada Labour 
Relations Board to the Canada Industrial Relations Board.  The 
cosmetic change of its name reflects a significant change in the 
powers which will be given to the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the principal objections I have to the bill is that the 
new board will have, as my colleague from Medicine Hat mentioned, 
the power to ban replacement workers in federally regulated 
industries.  That means that a company which has done its level 
best in fair negotiation to provide a fair deal to its employees 
but which finds that the union leadership, for one reason or 
another, decides to strike, will be held ransom.  Its livelihood 
and ultimately the livelihood of its workers will be held at the 
whim of the union leadership.  This company will not have the 
right, if proscribed by the Canada Industrial Relations Board, to 
replace striking workers with people who can continue to provide 
those goods and services.  In other words, the economic viability 
of various companies and indeed various industries can and may 
very well be threatened by this bill if it is passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member mentioned, the government recognizes the flaw 
in empowering the CIRB to ban replacement workers by exempting 
those workers employed in the area of grain shipping and handling 
at the ports.  In the past there have been several instances when 
those workers have gone on strike and caused enormous economic 
turmoil for prairie grain farmers because of their inability to 
export overseas the grain they have produced.  These amendments 
do not really solve that problem.  The ability to hire 
replacement workers will not necessarily mean that grain will 
move.  What it does mean is that we are creating a double 
standard for workers, one standard for those who do not work in 
the grain handling unions and one standard for those who do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If banning replacement workers is wrong in the grain handling 
situation, then it is wrong for those who do not handle grain, 
those who handle other commodities, those who provide other goods 
and services, those who are as essential to the Canadian economy 
as our grain workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would seek to remove the provisions of this bill which, in a 
discriminatory way, create a double standard with respect to 
replacement workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another serious concern I have with the bill is its treatment of 
the certification issue.  This bill would empower the CIRB to 
certify a union local at a particular place of business even if 
the majority of the employees at that place vote against 
certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues will correct me if I am wrong, but I thought we 
were living in a democracy.  I thought that in a democracy the 
majority, or at least a strong plurality, prevailed.  However, in 
the case of the amendments to Bill C-19 the government is saying 
that the principle of democracy can be marginalized.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a bunch of appointed members of this board, likely Liberal 
patronage hacks, decide that a particular local place of business 
is to be certified, it will be certified by that board even 
against the overwhelming objection of the people who work there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague mentioned the recent case of a Wal-Mart store in 
Nelson, British Columbia, which has similar legislation to that 
being introduced here, where the B.C. labour relations board 
ordered that the Nelson Wal-Mart employees be unionized even 
though they voted against it in their certification vote.  A 
similar thing happened at a Wal-Mart store in Windsor, Ontario. 
We could see the same thing happening across the country in 
federally regulated industries if these amendments are passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also concerned about the question of privacy.  This bill 
would undermine the privacy rights of union workers.  This is a 
very serious consideration.  People are often forced into a 
union.  We are talking about a labour regime of closed shop 
unions where the board can force the people to be in a certified 
union.  Now we are saying their privacy rights are to be 
compromised by this bill.  This is really big brother manifest in 
this kind of legislation and that is why we are opposed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we ought to do is look at a fair, open and transparent 
regime for regulating labour unions.  We have no objection to 
people legitimately exercising their collective bargaining 
rights.  However, this bill would create a double standard, would 
jeopardize the privacy rights of workers and would jeopardize the 
livelihoods of many businesses and potentially some industries 
through its treatment of replacement workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this bill would override the principle of democracy 
which should govern the treatment of unions in the certification 
process.  Frankly, I think it is an exercise of statist tyrannical 
power to tell a majority of workers that they are going to be 
forced into a union and forced to pay dues against their will. 
That is simply wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ought to look at bills like this at the level of first 
principles.  So often we get buried in the details of technical 
amendments like this and we lose sight of first principles.  One 
of the principles of liberal democracy is freedom.  I know it is 
a quaint notion to some of my friends opposite on occasion. 
However, that notion dictates that people cannot be coerced by 
the state to surrender their freedoms without their consent. Bill 
C-19 would seek to circumscribe the economic freedoms of workers 
to not be unionized, not certified and not forced to pay union 
dues if they choose not to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ought to put Bill C-19 and these amendments back on the 
drawing board.  As the Senate committee suggested, we ought to 
start all over again and listen to the business groups across 
this country that are speaking out against this.  I have received 
several phone calls, letters and faxes from different businesses 
and business organizations that say this bill constitutes a very 
real threat to the competitiveness of the Canadian labour force 
and our labour markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask all my hon. colleagues, including those on the 
Liberal side, to look beyond the spin they are getting from the 
labour department and look at the first principles behind this 
bill and vote against Bill C-19. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise and take part in this debate on Bill C-19.  In 
contrast to the previous two speakers, it is the wish of our 
caucus at this end of the House to encourage that this bill pass. 
We have not seen amendments to the Canada Labour Code in more 
than two decades and it is now time to move on and get up to 
speed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals in the previous House allowed the amendments under 
Bill C-66 to die in the face of business lobbying. Some Senate 
opposition and Liberal tradeoffs to push other bills through 
before the last election prevented Canadian workers from having 
the representation and legal rights they should have and that the 
revisions to the Canada Labour Code will give back to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part I of the code creates a framework for collective bargaining 
by the federal private sector and applies to approximately 
700,000 workers.  In June 1995 the Minister of Labour established 
a task force to conduct an independent review and recommend 
legislative changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force report was released a couple of years ago and the 
minister met with representatives of labour, management and other 
interested parties to hear the views on the task force 
recommendations. Bill C-66, the previous bill, reflected the task 
force's recommendations and these consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Support for revisions to the code are long overdue.  Although 
they do not go far enough we think it is certainly worthy of our 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with a great deal of interest to the member for 
Medicine Hat and the member for Calgary Southeast talking about 
this bill and parading themselves as friends of ordinary 
Canadians and working people, which is anything but what the 
Reform Party is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's leader is opposed to government regulated 
minimum wage laws.  I am sure the member would support him. He is 
on record saying that minimum wages should be linked to supply 
and demand and not to government regulated minimum wage.  We know 
the member for Calgary West comes from the National Citizens' 
Coalition and worked on something called citizens against 
enforced unionism when he was a member of that not so august 
body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking to the bill I was particularly struck by the 
amendments introduced last September by the member for Wetaskiwin 
who I believe was then and is still now the Reform Party's labour 
critic.  He introduced a number of motions at that time and I 
wanted to go through some of them to give people listening a 
sense of what this party thinks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
privilege.  The hon. member for Palliser said that I have worked 
for an organization that I have never worked for.  I would like 
him to correct the record and apologize for misrepresenting my 
background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I would ask the hon. 
member for Palliser to perhaps clarify what he was referring to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Madam Speaker, if I said it, it was 
inadvertent.  I was referring to the member for Calgary West who 
replaced Steven Harper, not the member for Calgary Southeast.  If 
I said Southeast I apologize but I was not referring to the 
member who just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, I am now referring to the comments made by the 
hon. member for Wetaskiwin last September 24.  Motion No. 4 at 
that time said government should support rights for all Canadians 
and young people in particular to enter the workforce and achieve 
their potential. This sounds very innocuous, very laudatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government should ensure that unions and professional bodies do 
not block qualified people from working in a trade or profession 
or from gaining the necessary qualifications to enable them to 
work in a trade or profession.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Right on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  It is not right on, it is the right to 
work. Later the same day the same member said in Motion No. 6:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Expand section 70 of Canadian Labour Code to include rights of 
individual employees to refuse to allow any portion of their dues 
to be paid for any cause not related to the function of their

</I></B></P><P align=left>We go back to the Ontario Public Service Employment Union and 
Merv Lavigne in the 1980s, aided and abetted by the National 
Citizens' Coalition, on this whole question, and what Justice 
Bertha Wilson had to say about it and the awarding of costs to 
the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went to the Americans because they have similar legislation 
to what is being proposed by the member for Wetaskiwin.  The 
following is what Supreme Court Justice Bertha Wilson had to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When American unions speak out on political matters, they must 
refund to dissenting members the prorated costs of such 
activities.  U.S. Corps do not have this problem.  Corporations 
may speak out with a far louder voice heavily outspending Labour 
on dissemination of their views.  Indeed the proof of this 
imbalance can be seen in the results in the decline in rate of 
union reps. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among American workers Madam Justice Wilson noted that it had 
gone from a 35% rate of unionization in the United States in the 
1940s to barely 20% by 1980. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our view on this side of the House that Canadian unions 
would meet the same fate if we had similar legislation adopted in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the area of attack the Reform Party makes against 
working men and women in close concert with the National 
Citizens' Coalition and the Fraser Institute, both of which are 
good friends.  They are in favour of making closed shops illegal. 
We have heard some of that, new laws to undermine effective 
strike action and paramountcy of private property over collective 
rights.  We certainly have heard that from the two previous 
speakers of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the official opposition party and their friends in the 
National Citizens' Coalition and the Fraser Institute could be 
counted upon to pursue any goals toward deunionization in the 
country.  In fact the Fraser Institute, the research arm of the 
Reform Party, has dedicated $250,000 for such work over and above 
the cost of hiring a co-ordinator for a new five-year plan called 
towards a new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They plan to publish a right to work, how to guide on 
establishing right to work in Canada, more conferences in 
jurisdictions sympathetic to right to work, contrasting 
U.S.-Canada labour laws, blaming Canada's high unemployment on 
what they perceive to be unfair, unbalanced labour legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it could be summarized no better than what the previous 
Reform member, Herb Grubel, who is now happily back working with 
the Fraser Institute, had to say some time ago: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most basic contribution that Canadians governments could make 
is reduction of power of unions by appropriate changes in the 
labour codes.  There should also be expanded deregulation and 
privatization and an across the board wage cut of 13%. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member for Crowfoot suggests that we do not know what 
we are talking about when it comes to the Reform Party and its 
views on labour, we think we do know a thing or two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that what they are trying to establish here is Alabama 
north.  It is a race to the bottom, who will do it for the least 
amount of money.  We reject that wholeheartedly and we urge that 
this bill be passed into law as quickly as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to proposed legislation, Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With great respect to the previous speaker, the member for 
Palliser, I learned a long time ago that in fact there are 
certain issues that we are going to agree to disagree on. It is 
philosophical.  I will not convince the hon. member for Palliser 
to think in my direction, nor do I expect that he can convince me 
to think in his direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in saying that, there are a number of differing views 
with this piece of legislation.  I will go back to a piece of 
legislation that I am very familiar with.  I look at the 
parallels of the Canadian Wheat Board Act, Bill C-4, and this 
legislation. 
I raise this because both pieces of legislation were flawed when 
they came to this House.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was and is a great deal of controversy with both pieces of 
legislation.  Both pieces of legislation were introduced in the 
previous Parliament and both died on the Order Paper.  They 
essentially came back with very few, if any, changes or 
amendments although the government at that time had the 
opportunity to listen to the people who would be affected by both 
pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Bill C-4, western Canadian farmers would be 
affected.  Bill C-19 would not only wrongfully impact the 
business community in Canada but also the unions in Canada.  It 
is a very divisive piece of legislation that will not resolve any 
of the current outstanding issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to the member for Palliser that I am not a unionist, 
I never have been, nor have I embraced the philosophies. 
However, I am a fair individual who believes that there is a need 
for labour unions.  I have negotiated across the table from 
labour unions and I believe very strongly there is a need and a 
right to have fair management-labour relationships as well as 
negotiated settlements in any type of labour contract.  I 
honestly believe that, and it can be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe there is a need for balance which must be there 
in order for both parties to put their prospective positions on 
the table and to come to a negotiated agreement.  Bill C-19 does 
not provide the balance.  It has, unfortunately, taken the 
balance and given it to one side of the equation, one side of the 
argument.  I believe the hon. member would have spoken against 
the legislation because there was an unfair balance if it would 
have come forward such that it changed the balance in favour of 
management and corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an unfair balance in this legislation.  There is 
substantial controversy out there.  I wish the government would 
have put forward a well thought out, logical piece of legislation 
that incorporated that balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read some headlines from several local papers: “Business 
anxiety is mounting over the proposed changes to the Labour 
Code”; “Liberals ready to duplicate ill-conceived Ontario 
labour law”; “Shippers fear scheme will increase labour 
strife”; “Grain ports law angers B.C. business”; “New labour 
code rules benefit unions”; “The higher unemployment bill”, 
referring to Bill C-19; “Closer examination reveals flaws in 
rewritten Labour Code amendments”. After having read these 
articles, I understand there is a great deal of divisiveness in 
the business community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has already spoken about a number of concerns with 
this legislation.  Without question our first and foremost 
concern is with the replacement workers clause in Bill C-19.  It 
is unfair.  When the Sims report was tabled, this was one of the 
areas that was not agreed to in the report.  There were some 
serious concerns about it and a minority report argued against a 
general ban on the use of replacement workers.  It changes the 
balance of power to the unions as opposed to having that balance 
between management and labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another area of concern that is very real and serious 
with respect to Bill C-19, that of the offsite workers.  This is 
an invasion of privacy, an invasion into a person's ability to be 
employed in Canada without having others access your employment 
ability on offsite workers from a particular corporation.  It is 
a travesty that the government would put this forward in this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also concerned about certification not requiring the 
majority vote of the employees.  It is very serious when others 
can dictate to the majority what it will have to do according to 
the minority speaking.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of concern is that of the work stoppage at ports, 
the shipment of grain and other commodities.  I have some mixed 
feelings about this particular clause in the legislation.  I 
believe very strongly that for too long western Canadian farmers 
have been held hostage by unionized workers in the ports and the 
railroads.  They are always held hostage at the time of year when 
it is most vital.  The transportation of the grains should be 
allowed through to the ports so that our reputation as Canadian 
producers is not going to be impacted by not having just in time 
delivery with these commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mixed feelings that this particular clause in the 
legislation is a good clause.  However, I would not like to see 
this clause changed to benefit labour.  If it is good for grain, 
it should be good for other commodities.  All commodities should 
be treated equally.  If it is good enough for grain then there 
should not be work stoppages because the ramifications of the 
position in the world marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other commodities should be given the same co-operation.  Those 
other commodities are in most cases directly related to 
production of agriculture.  Fertilizers should be given the same 
opportunity.  We have other commodities such as coal and potash. 
We have major commodities that should be given the same 
opportunity in this legislation as what is given to grain. 
However, I would not like to lose the clause that speaks to the 
grain component if that whole clause was going to be rewritten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party is on record as saying that we will be opposed to Bill 
C-19.  My preference would be for the government to see the error 
of its ways and take this legislation off the table. It should 
take it back to the Canadians, the business community, as well as 
the labour unions to try to negotiate and work out a fair and 
balanced approach to the changes to Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should have been done with Bill C-4 where there was such a 
backlash with the legislation.  In fact, when the legislation is 
being approved, it will not solve or resolve any of the problems. 
It should be done with Bill C-19.  The government should learn 
from past mistakes to take the legislation back and bring forward 
to this House a balanced piece of legislation that will ensure 
that all sides of this equation and argument will be satisfied. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak on Bill C-19.  This bill starts 
with a change in the name to the bill from the Canadian Labour 
Relations Board to the Canadian Industrial Relations Board.  This 
certainly differentiates it from the original bill that was 
brought forward.  It is not as specific. I would like to point 
out that this bill still has to do with labour relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else does this bill do?  The member for Palliser commented 
very strongly on support of the union particularly on the west 
coast.  I would like to make it clear that the NDP, the member 
for Palliser and the rest of his colleagues have at heart only 
the interests of the unions.  The Reform Party has the interests 
of unionized workers and the non-unionized workers such as 
farmers in western Canada.  It is this kind of an approach that 
is required when bringing legislation before this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Serving only the interests of the big unions on the west coast 
is a dramatic hindrance to the economic performance of this 
country and it is a dramatic hindrance to agriculture in western 
Canada. 
We only have to look at some of the problems that arise for 
farmers in the west to see that every dollar counts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past couple of years we have had the transportation 
problems with grain moving to the west coast.  Over the years 
there have been many strikes and grain sales were held up. The 
problems I am referring to in the past years have ended up 
costing farmers in the neighbourhood of $100 million between 
demurrage costs, lost sales and those kinds of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When legislation is brought forward in this House, we have to 
look at whether or not it is good overall in the sense that is it 
80% to 90% good for everyone, or is it really just good for a 
small segment of workers. Good legislation should not 
disadvantage to a great extent any one group in Canadian society. 
As an example, a piece of legislation which comes to mind as good 
and which everyone can support is the RCMP superannuation act. It 
is legislation where everyone wins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 has some good points. However in the whole it is 
insufficient to pass a bill that does only a little good and a 
whole lot of harm.  It certainly does good.  If there is an 
elevator terminal on the west coast full of grain and a strike 
happens, the people who move the grain from the elevator on to a 
ship are required to go back to work to put that grain on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as the days drag on in a strike and if the elevator was 
empty or was not necessarily full at the start, what happens 
then?  This legislation will not enable the agriculture products 
from western Canada to continue moving because there will not be 
anything to move. What is the solution?  Certainly labour has to 
be treated fairly and properly.  There are mechanisms by which 
this can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has very clearly come out with a plan that 
would enable the unions and the workers to be treated fairly. 
They would receive good compensation for the work they do. It 
would also protect those people who do not have protection under 
legislation, for example the farmers in western Canada and other 
small businesses that move their products through ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest as put forward by the Reform Party that a labour 
dispute settlement mechanism such as final offer selection 
arbitration would be useful on the west coast.  It would ensure 
that labour is treated fairly, that it is properly compensated 
for its efforts and that farmers in western Canada continue to 
have their grains and other products moved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strikes in the public sector differ from those in the private 
sector because of the monopolistic nature of most public 
services.  Final offer selection arbitration gives labour and 
management the tools to resolve their differences.  It does not 
favour one side over the over. It eliminates government 
interference in the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes that final offer selection arbitration 
would provide protection from back to work legislation in a 
strike or lockout situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to look back a few weeks to see the mess we were in 
during the post office strike. In that case both union and 
management knew that the House was going to have to do something 
eventually. Therefore they had no incentive to get together to 
come up with a good solution. As a result many Canadians suffered 
drastically as that strike went on, primarily small business and 
small farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends to the left in the NDP represent only the big unions. 
They have no balanced approach to represent all Canadians.  I 
agree the unions have to have the right to organize, the right to 
bargain, but their right is not supreme over the right of all 
Canadians.  That is the point I make in that regard.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quickly comment on how this final selection arbitration 
would work.  If and only if the union and employer cannot make an 
agreement by the conclusion of the previous contract, the union 
and employer would provide the minister with the name of a person 
or persons they jointly recommend as an arbitrator or arbitration 
panel.  The union and employer would be required to submit to the 
arbitrator/panel a list of the matters agreed upon and a list of 
matters still under dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For disputed issues each party would be required to submit a 
final offer for settlement.  The arbitrator/panel selects either 
the final offer submitted by the trade union or the final offer 
submitted by the employer, all of one position or all of the 
other position.  The arbitrator's decision would be binding on 
both parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Brandon—Souris commented, this legislation is 
exactly like Bill C-4.  Nobody but those with a narrow little 
interest wants to see this legislation go ahead. As a result I 
cannot support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the Reform Party's position that we want to see unions 
treated fairly.  We want to see non-unionized people treated 
fairly.  I believe the plan we have put forward will do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-20, 
an act to amend the Competition Act and to make consequential and 
related amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I am particularly glad to have this

suitable for the information age we live in. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This updating is particularly needed in light of a major problem 
addressed by these amendments, that of deceptive telemarketing. 
Telephone scam artists have become a contempory electronic 
plague. 
Law enforcement officials conservatively estimate total losses to 
Canadian victims and lost sales to legitimate business to be in 
the order of $4 billion per year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These predators use the anonymity of the telephone and their 
skills of deception to sound plausible.  They persuade their 
victims to trust what seem like reputable businesses or 
charities.  Sometimes high pressure and abusive sales tactics are 
used to convince consumers to give up their money or give out 
their credit card numbers. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the term consumer includes businesses as well as 
individuals.  Whenever a business purchases goods or services 
from another firm, it too becomes a consumer.  Small and medium 
sized businesses are frequent targets of telemarketing scams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All sorts of ingenious tactics and schemes are used.  A 
potential victim might be told that he or she has won a valuable 
prize or gift, but must pay a fee, or “taxes”, before delivery. 
Then, the prize turns out to be worthless, or non-existent. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes a plausible mailing or advertisement pitches an 
attractive job opportunity.  All the victim has to do is call a 
900 or 976 number for further details and be kept on hold or 
listening to a long recorded message while expensive phone 
charges mount up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scam might be piled upon scam.  Often con artists call people 
who have already been victimized once and pose as professionals 
who can recover their losses, for a fat fee of course, which is 
never seen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dishonest telemarketers might prey upon businesses and charge 
inflated bills for minimal, unnecessary or non-existent supplies 
and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although deceptive telemarketers target all groups in society, 
they tend to focus on those who are most vulnerable, such as 
seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Bureau has prepared a public awareness video 
which shows one scam artist boasting of cheating mothers and 
daughters, fathers and sons.  This individual is shown outlining 
an international telephone routing scheme that he used to provide 
fictitious testimonials for his bogus investment plan. He also 
described plans to target a family's entire savings, including 
their paycheque, their pensions and even their children's 
educational funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These despicable cheats are bringing an entire legitimate 
industry into disrepute. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, given the nature and capabilities of communications 
media these days, telemarketing scams cross multiple 
jurisdictions and make cooperative enforcement particularly 
difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One credit card scam, for example, was run through a corporation 
in British Columbia, by telemarketers in Ontario who targeted 
victims in the U.S..  This is why, at the recent meeting of the 
United States Attorney General and the Solicitor General of 
Canada, the topic of telemarketing fraud was an important part of 
their discussions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telemarketing fraud also came up at the April 1997 meeting 
between the Prime Minister and the President of the United 
States.  As a result our two countries established the 
Canada-U.S. binational working group on telemarketing fraud which 
delivered its report to the Prime Minister and to the President 
last November.  That report made several recommendations, 
including that the “governments of both countries and their 
respective agencies clearly identify telemarketing fraud as a 
serious crime”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present the Competition Act prohibits the use of materially 
false or misleading representations to promote the supply or use 
of a product or the promotion of any business interest.  The act 
also contains provisions relating to promotional contests. 
However it does not specifically forbid certain practices 
associated with deceptive telemarketing.  The current law is also 
not specific enough to nail con artists who do not actually make 
any representations over the telephone.  These inadequacies 
needed to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the Competition Act will create a specific new 
criminal offence for deceptive telemarketing. 
It will apply to the use of interactive telephone communications 
for the purpose of promoting the supply of a product or a 
business interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Persons engaged in telemarketing will be required to disclose 
certain types of information during their phone calls.  The law 
will also prohibit a number of deceptive practices, such as 
requiring consumers to pay money as a condition to receive a 
prize, or to require advance payments for products sold at 
grossly inflated prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Special provisions will expand the responsibility of 
corporations, their officers and directors, for ensuring 
compliance with the law.  It will become easier for the courts to 
issue interim injunctions to halt suspicious activities. 
Penalties will be stiffened. 
Indicted offenders will face prison 
for up to five years, and/or a fine at the discretion of the 
court. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For summary convictions the maximum penalty will be a fine of 
$200,000 or a year in jail or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In certain cases law enforcement officials will be able to 
intercept private communications without consent after obtaining 
judicial authorization.  This new provision will be used to 
gather evidence of deceptive telemarketing and will apply to the 
serious crimes of conspiracy and bid rigging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this provision is not expected to be widely used, in some 
cases it may be the only way to gather evidence effectively.  The 
director would be required to follow the normal procedures of the 
criminal code to obtain authorization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures against telemarketing fraud are part of a total 
package of amendments to the Competition Act.  To put these 
changes in context, we should recall that the Competition Act 
contains both civil and criminal provisions.  Criminal offences 
under the act include price fixing, bid rigging, predatory 
pricing, retail price maintenance, misleading advertising and 
other deceptive marketing practices.  For these, the crown must 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an offence has been 
committed, and the new telemarketing provisions will fall into 
this criminal category. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Competition Act also contains civil provisions, whose 
benchmark is the civil law's less demanding requirement for proof 
on a balance of probabilities.  In civil matters, the Director of 
Investigation and Research has the option of applying to the 
Competition Tribunal of Canada for remedial orders to deal with 
the anti-competitive conduct in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Misleading advertising and deceptive marketing practices are 
criminal offences because they can have serious economic 
consequences; consequences that can merit a criminal sanction. 
They hurt both consumers and competitors who are engaged in 
honest promotional efforts. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, studies since the mid-1970s show that criminal 
sanctions alone are an incomplete response to misleading 
advertising.  Criminal prosecution has a number of drawbacks.  It 
is not an effective way to stop misleading advertising quickly, 
and the criminal law process is expensive and intensely 
consumptive of time and resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes before us will create a combination criminal-civil 
regime to address misleading advertising and deceptive marketing 
practices.  They will foster quick and efficient compliance 
through a series of measures that allow a great deal of 
flexibility.  This flexibility will enable the competitive bureau 
to tailor its approach and use the tools that are most effective 
for each different situation.  Criminal sanctions will remain in 
place but only for the most serious cases of misleading 
advertising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most existing misleading advertising and deceptive marketing 
offences will fall under the less cumbersome provisions of the 
civil law as reviewable matters.  Remedial orders could be 
granted by a judicial member of the competition tribunal, by the 
Federal Court of Canada or by a provincial superior court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remedies available to the court would include cease and desist 
orders, interim cease and desist orders, administrative monetary 
penalties, information notices and consent orders.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Taken together, and combined with the Competition Bureau's 
existing and strong education program, these measures will permit 
the Competition Bureau to take a pro-active and preventive 
approach to anti-competitive practices which go against fairness 
in the Canadian marketplace.  They will expedite decision making 
and ensure that it is done consistently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of these types of cases would be brought before the 
Competition Tribunal, rather than the criminal courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments would also change the title of the Head of the 
Competition Bureau from Director of Investigation and Research to 
Commissioner of Competition. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new title of commissioner will better reflect the 
responsibilities of the position, putting it on a par with those, 
for example, of the commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its other most important changes concern prenotification of 
mergers, regular price claims and prohibition orders.  For 
mergers an effective prenotification process is essential to 
allow the competition bureau to determine in advance whether a 
transaction would have a negative effect on competition.  The 
proposed amendments will make the prenotification process more 
efficient and clarify the law concerning certain types of 
acquisition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information requirements would be revised and outlined in the 
regulations instead of in the act.  There would be greater 
flexibility to waive the requirement for prenotification or for 
some of the information required under certain circumstances. 
Longer waiting periods will provide sufficient time to review 
proposed transactions thoroughly.  Conditions for obtaining 
interim orders will be relaxed so that the commissioner will be 
able to delay the closing of a merger that raises competition 
issues until an inquiry can be completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regular price claims provisions of the act will be amended 
for greater clarity and to better reflect what consumers and 
retailers understand by them.  The legitimacy of regular price 
claims would be determined by an objective standard, a test based 
either on sales volume or the pricing of an article over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers will benefit from this clarification of the rules and 
merchants will have more freedom of choice in selecting pricing 
strategies and will be encouraged to innovate in ways beneficial 
to consumers and retailers alike. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other major area of impact of these amendments concerns 
prohibition orders. Courts will be given more tools to address 
criminal conduct. They will be able to issue orders to require 
those accused to take certain steps, or engage in certain conduct 
to prevent the commission, continuation or repetition of an 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments will establish a more cost-effective, enforceable 
instrument for alternative case resolution, in matters where 
there is no need for criminal penalties, and where the parties 
can agree on the terms of an order. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me emphasize as strongly as I can that these amendments do 
not mean more leniency for those who engage in serious 
anti-competitive behaviour.  When a reasonable solution cannot be 
reached for civil matters, be it consent orders or other means, 
the commissioner has stated that he will not hesitate to take the 
matters to the tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has further stated that in cases where there are egregious 
and serious violations of criminal proceedings or provisions, he 
will not hesitate to refer cases to the attorney general and 
recommend prosecution with the full rigour of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments before us today will give the bureau an expanded 
range of tools to ensure full conformity with the law. Its 
continuum of measures begins with education and goes up the scale 
to guidelines, advisory opinions, information contacts, voluntary 
codes, settlements, consent orders, charges and fines all the way 
to imprisonment.

clear in the case of a lady who had been approached by fraudulent 
telemarketers who bilked her for $38,000.  It was no small amount 
for a retired lady to pay to deceptive telemarketers. That is the 
flagship part of the legislation.  It is high time it was 
introduced in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The specific provisions in the legislation are interesting.  I 
support them completely.  First, telemarketers must identify who 
they are representing.  Second, they must disclose the price of 
the services or product they are proposing.  Third, they must 
tell why they are calling.  Those three provisions are presently 
omitted.  A telemarketer can get along making all kinds of claims 
without ever saying who he represents, what the price might be or 
what the reason is for the call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister made a point about saying how large the 
telemarketing business is.  He referred to the joint meeting 
between the two heads of state, the President of the United 
States and the Prime Minister of Canada.  In 1997 the estimate of 
that business was somewhere around $500 billion, with the 
fraudulent part of it accounting for about 10% or about $50 
billion.  Canada is roughly 10% of the United States, which makes 
it $5 billion in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister suggested that the cost to Canadian taxpayers is 
somewhere around $4 billion.  I am not prepared to debate whether 
it is $4 billion or $5 billion; $1 is too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is refreshing to see this kind of legislation before us at 
this time.  While I support all of its good provisions, there is 
a significant omission to which I will refer later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus on the reason for changing the present Competition 
Act.  The Competition Act dealt with a time when things were not 
as fast as they are today.  A lot of things are happening today. 
Change is happening more quickly.  Information technology has 
advanced dramatically.  The network alluded to by the minister a 
moment ago would not have been feasible several years back. There 
is a changing world out there.  Electronic commerce makes 
possible and makes necessary this kind of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us review briefly what the Competition Act actually does, 
not only these amendments but the act itself. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to do this particularly because many of my 
constituents, perhaps many constituents across Canada, would like 
to know exactly how the Competition Act works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, a tribunal is set up.  The tribunal is headed by 
the director, now the commissioner of competition.  He deals with 
the aspects of the act that are not being observed by the 
participants or players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act contains both criminal and non-criminal provisions.  The 
criminal provisions include conspiracy, bid rigging, 
discriminatory and predatory pricing, price maintenance, 
misleading advertising and deceptive marketing practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of telemarketing falls under Bill C-20 provisions and 
other areas that fall under the act are reviewable matters such 
as mergers, abuse of dominant position, refusal to deal, 
consignment selling and tied selling, market restriction and 
pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw attention to tied selling.  Tied selling is becoming a 
very significant part of our economy today, particularly as it 
relates to financial and other institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tied selling, while not the focus of this bill, not the focus of 
the amendments here, will become a major issue as far as 
consumers and business people are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bureau becomes aware that there is a possible 
infraction or some sort of competition offence, the facts are 
examined, first of all, for whether there is a concern under the 
act. If the director believes there is reasonable grounds or if 
he believes that it could be committed very easily, inquiries can 
commence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister may also initiate concern, and six Canadians may 
get together and complain to the director and the matter will be 
investigated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the director can use formal investigative tools to 
gather information, in cases where the director believes a 
criminal offence has occurred, matters may and are referred to 
the attorney general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has just assured us that that is indeed what the 
intent of this legislation is and that it is one of his servants 
who will cause this to happen.  I commend him for that.  I think 
that is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20, which we essentially support as the Reform Party, 
enhances the current Competition Act.  It makes it stronger.  We 
are pleased to see, for example, the issues of misleading 
advertising and deceptive marketing being enhanced and the issue 
of deceptive telemarketing being addressed in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go into deceptive marketing.  Bill C-20 provides for a 
much more effective means of punishment and is an improvement in 
our opinion.  If consumers find themselves the victims of 
deceptive marketing, for instance false advertising, the bill 
sets out new provisions that will make the system more effective 
both in terms of administration and cost.  That is commendable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current act where infractions are committed, criminal 
prosecution is obligatory.  That is a cumbersome, expensive and a 
long, drawn out process.  The new bill creates a dual regime of 
civil and criminal offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In serious cases involving repeat offenders or fraud, for 
example, a criminal regime will be maintained.  In less serious 
cases where an individual or corporation is unaware of the law, 
the amendments will allow for the infractions to be addressed 
through civil court by means of fines, cease and desist orders 
and information notices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can speak from personal observation of cases that I have 
worked on which have been worked through the previous session of 
Parliament that it is essential that we have these kinds of 
provisions in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the credit of the competition tribunal, one case that I am 
very familiar with was resolved in favour of the client and the 
persons who appealed to the competition bureau, so the 
competition bureau does work.  This makes it work more 
effectively and we support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about deceptive telemarketing?  I have already indicated 
the three things a telemarketer must do if he is going to 
approach an individual for money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can all attest to the telemarketing industry, somewhat 
ruefully perhaps. 
I wonder who in this House has not had dinner or some other part 
of their day interrupted by a telemarketer wishing to sell a 
product or a service.  It might even happen twice during supper. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1320

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my case I am thankful that we have an answering machine. When 
supper time comes the answering machine takes over.  Let the 
telemarketer talk to the machine if they want.  There is no way 
they are going to interrupt my supper hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we appreciate the work of telemarketers, it is a 
legitimate business.  It is the fraudulent use of telemarketing 
we are objecting to.  The serious concern is in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are rules of logic which we should all follow in the 
buying and selling of products over the phone.  For instance, it 
is wise to be suspicious of anyone who might offer money or a 
grand prize over the phone for a small fee.  “You can have a 
prize if you give me money”.  We should all be suspicious if 
someone says something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also be suspicious if someone asks us for our credit 
card number.  Some people have advised us to never give anyone 
our credit card number over the telephone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall, rather interestingly, wishing to make a hotel 
reservation not too long ago.  I wanted the assurance that the 
room would be available for me without my having to give them a 
credit card number.  I said “I do not want to give it to you”. 
They said “then your room will not be there for you”.  Who will 
win?  It is a very interesting question which we need to look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more we are using the telephone to conduct our 
activities.  We have e-mail.  We have electronic commerce.  The 
whole question of the decryption of messages becomes a very 
significant issue.  The old rules simply do not apply any more. 
In many cases there are no rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that many consumers are confused?  Do I or do I 
not provide my credit card number?  Do I or do I not talk to this 
individual? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only solution is to ensure that laws exist to address 
unscrupulous practices.  That is what this bill attempts to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for both the industry and the consumer to benefit the 
consumer needs assurance that the marketplace is being monitored 
to ensure fair and legal practices.  Where telemarketing is 
concerned a sound competition policy not only means a confident 
consumer, it requires an educated consumer.  If it was ever 
necessary for consumers to educate themselves about what is going 
on out there it is today.  By setting out what is required to 
conduct fair telemarketing practices Canadians will know they can 
demand from any person who is conducting a financial transaction 
over the telephone who it is that is calling, on whose behalf 
that person is calling, how much it will cost and why they are 
calling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to move into a broader context and address the entire 
area of competition.  I mentioned earlier that it is important to 
keep discussion on competition open in order to ensure its 
effectiveness and efficiency.  However, the issue of competition 
has taken on a broader context over the last few years.  Global 
competition now plays a direct role in determining the economic 
policies of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competition has become the mantra of the 21st century. 
Governments around the globe promote its merits and its value in 
generating wealth and contributing to innovation.  Competition 
dictates policy in everything from free trade in softwood lumber 
to the information highway and whether we have direct to home 
television. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look closely we will see that competition is the reason 
given by governments to explain many things, including why they 
must spend money on business subsidies and infrastructure 
programs, for example.  It seems the notion of competition has 
dominated every policy paper, federal budget, government 
initiative, piece of legislation, committee report, study and the 
countless conferences which we have seen since this government 
came to power.  The emphasis is always on the need to become 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes, it has to be said, this is the umbrella under which 
are hidden euphemisms for political patronage and vote buying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has been pushed aside.   Since 1996 other bills have 
taken precedence and amendments to the Competition Act have had 
to wait, and yet competition is the thing which drives our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be very confusing to the average consumer if this is the 
case. 
They ask questions. Can competition be good if the result is 
downsizing and the loss of jobs?  Can competition be good if it 
means lower wages?  Is competition good when the success of the 
new Wal-Mart means the closure of the local business down the 
street?

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is all competition good?  Is uncontrolled competition good? 
Obviously not.  That is why we need an act of this type.  The 
average consumer should not apologize for being confused, or for 
asking questions, or for feeling some anxiety.  For too long 
voters have been left out of the economic process.  The answer 
that it is good for competition hardly suffices in their attempts 
to understand which government policies are sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that fair competition is a good thing but notice 
there is a very significant adjective there, fair. Competition in 
and of itself as an end in itself is not sufficient.  Fair 
competition is integral, however, to sound economic policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is a strong supporter of the competitive 
marketplace.  However, we are very aware that competition alone 
is not enough to ensure economic stability, nor will it alone 
create the kind of marketplace that builds strong industries and 
businesses and protects the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers do not accept that in order to have competition it 
must come at the expense of the taxpayer.  Reformers believe in 
competitive strategies that have substance.  We believe that 
there are ways in which we can increase competition by allowing 
the taxpayer to function freely in the marketplace without 
compromising the interests of the consumer or create costs to the 
taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, our definition of a competitive Canada would not only 
save the taxpayer money but provide economic stability.  For the 
sake of good and fair competition, we would take the politics out 
of economic decision making in Canada.  We would not use 
competition as an excuse for the unreasonable waste of taxpayer 
money spent on business subsidies.  We would eliminate grants and 
subsidies to businesses.  Businesses would be able to survive, as 
businesses should be able to survive, on their own merits. 
Taxpayers should not support inefficient and ineffective 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the sake of good and fair competition, we would support the 
removal of all measures that insulate industries, businesses, 
financial institutions, professionals and trade unions from 
domestic and foreign competition.  That would mean dropping 
Canada's internal trade barriers once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the minister is only too well aware of how intrusive the 
internal trade barriers are to trade within Canada.  In order to 
realize fair and good competition, Reform would orient federal 
government activities toward the nurturing of physical and human 
infrastructure.  We would give greater priority to the 
development of skills, particularly those that would provide 
future job flexibility within a co-operative training government. 
We would base physical and infrastructure spending on economic 
criteria rather than on the basis of artificial temporary job 
creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to realize a fair and competitive marketplace, we would 
invest in basic scientific research and ensure grassroot 
investment in research and development in order to keep Canada on 
the leading edge of innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada is to be truly competitive, we will see a better 
Canada where the entrepreneur is valued, the small business 
person is free to grow, where our children are educated and 
provided with the skills they need to succeed, where families are 
relieved from an unfair tax burden, where Canadians are free from 
worrying about their futures, each one empowered to reach out and 
grasp every opportunity that comes their way. Competition must 
mean something to the average citizen, not just the bureaucrats 
and the policy makers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians must see real evidence of competition in their 
everyday lives and feel the effects that a truly competitive 
society provides.  That means things like direct to home 
satellite.  It means fairer and freer internal trade.  It means 
prudent regulation of our financial institutions.  It means 
reasonable interest rates on our credit cards which means fair 
prices at the grocery store and the gas station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to now refer to another major section which I 
believe is an omission in Bill C-20.  It should have dealt with 
this but it did not.  It has to do with mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a reference to mergers and there is a more sensible 
approach to them.  However, it fails to deal with a major issue 
that has come to the attention to virtually every Canadian within 
the last six months, the proposal to merge two major banks.  It 
is conspicuously silent about this merger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine the details of the provisions of the Competition 
Act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT31"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT31"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1330

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 92 of The Competition Act as it currently stands reads 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where, on application by the Director, the Tribunal finds that a 
merger or proposed merger prevents or lessens, or is likely to 
prevent or lessen, competition substantially 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) in a trade, industry or profession, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) among the sources from which a trade, industry or profession 
obtains a product, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) among the outlets through which a trade, industry or 
profession disposes of a product,— 
</UL></UL>
<There is another category and then the director may dissolve the 
merger, dispose of the assets or shares in addition to or in lieu 
of the action referred to in the first two paragraphs with the 
consent of the person against whom the order is directed takes 
any other action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It then goes on to specify these.  That sounds very good and 
that is the provision of section 92 and that is great.  That must 
be okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at section 100.  It is clause 24 in the proposed 
bill.  The proposed bill says that an application to the 
commission certifying that an inquiry is being made under 
paragraph 10(1)(b) and in the commissioner's opinion more time is 
required to complete the inquiry of a merger, the tribunal finds 
that the absence of an interim order a party of the proposed 
measure or any other person is likely to take an action that 
would substantially impair the ability of the tribunal to remedy 
the effect of the proposed merger on competition under section 92 
because that action would be difficult to reverse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions are rather clear and rather far reaching except 
that in section 94 of the Competition Act we read that the 
tribunal shall not make an order under section 92 in respect of a 
merger substantially completed before the coming into force of 
this section, or an amalgamation or proposed amalgamation under 
section 255 of the Bank Act or an acquisition or proposed 
acquisition of the assets under section 273 of the Bank Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 255 of the Bank Act is rather clear.  Section 255 of the 
Bank Act specifically states that that section which deals with 
competition and with mergers states that in lieu of the relevant 
sections in the Combines Investigation Act, the Trust Companies 
Act, the Loan Companies Act, the Canada Business Corporation Act 
and conspicuously absent, the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance, when the Royal Bank and the Bank of 
Montreal announced that they were proposing to merge, said that 
this will be investigated by the Competition Bureau.  He may do 
that and I would commend him if he did.  He wants the tribunal to 
investigate this but the competition tribunal has absolutely no 
authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the existing Competition Act that would 
allow them and direct them to investigate this.  They may if the 
Minister of Industry agrees with his colleague the Minister of 
Finance, to go ahead, get resources, personnel and time to 
investigate.  The Competition Act exempts Section 255 of the Bank 
Act from them considering this particular merger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That I think is a very serious omission.  Why do I think it is 
such a serious omission?  Because a merger of a major bank will 
affect virtually directly or indirectly every Canadian if not 
now, certainly in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is a major issue here that should have been 
addressed but was not.  It is not too late to bring an amendment. 
I hope the minister and the Minister of Finance will see fit to 
introduce an amendment that will bring about this kind of 
jurisdiction to the Competition Act.  It is in the interest of 
Canadians that this be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is much that has been done in this particular act 
there is a lot of direction that we would commend. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I would like to review a couple of those.  First, 
this act creates a new criminal offence for deceptive 
telemarketing, the maximum penalty being five years in jail or a 
fine in the discretion of the court, or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it allows for the judicially authorized interception 
without consent of private communications, that means 
wiretapping.  Neither party needs to consent to the 
wiretapping.  The RCMP may do so to combat the most serious 
cases of deceptive telemarketing, as well as price fixing and 
bid rigging. That is a good provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, to require those engaged in telemarketing to disclose 
certain information, which I have already covered, and prohibit 
practices such as required payment prior to delivery for products 
offered for sale at prices grossly in excessive of their fair 
market value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the enactment of a special provision to expand the 
responsibility of corporations and their officers and directors 
to ensure compliance with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are good provisions and we would support them.  The bill 
should pass speedily through the House.  I suggest to my 
colleagues that there is an omission in this bill that should 
have been included.  With that, I commend this bill to the House 
and would like to encourage its passage and its support with 
appropriate amendments. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House and speak, on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois, to Bill C-20.  If all the bill contained were provisions 
relating to fraudulent telemarketing, there is no doubt that we 
would be pleased to give it our strong support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this bill, which deals with fraudulent telemarketing, has 
many other provisions.  In some ways, it resembles an omnibus bill, 
or an important overhaul of the Competition Act.  We have very 
serious reservations about a number of the amendments and would be 
unable to support the bill at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by stressing the importance of a law to 
promote competition.  In both the United States and Canada, at the 
time of the industrial revolution, there were large social 
movements calling on governments to prevent trusts and large 
corporations from getting together and doing what they wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Support for real competition was the beginning of social 
conscience and of public social conscience. This support came not 
only from consumers, but also from small businesses, which often 
suffered from agreements made over their heads and often against 
their interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the House that the Canadian Competition Act is 
two years older than its American counterpart.  I would also remind 
it that the first prison sentence under the Competition Act in 
Canada was handed down on September 9, 1996 following a driving 
school price war between 1987 and 1991 in the Sherbrooke region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Justice Paul-Marcel Bellavance of the Superior Court was 
quoted in <I>Le Journal de Montréal</I> the following day.  This is what 
he had to say “In order to underline the objective seriousness of 
this kind of crime, which is not always taken seriously by the 
businessmen of this country, the court adopts the recommendation 
made by the crown—the crown meaning the federal attorney—that a 
prison sentence be handed down, even though I agree with the 
probation officer that what we have here is not an individual who 
lives off the proceeds of crime, and that the risk of recidivism is 
minimal, although he has a legal record that must be taken into 
account”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me continue by quoting excerpts from the judge's ruling. He 
said “The difficulty in discovering the crimes of which the accused was 
found guilty justifies harsher penalties than mere fines. Indeed, fines 
are often paid by the corporate body, which lowers the degree of respect 
required to ensure the proper application and effectiveness of the 
Competition Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge added “In fact, the supreme court recommended imposing 
penalties that will force Canadian business people to understand that 
unduly lessening competition and using threats to unreasonably raise or 
lower prices are prohibited. 
The interest of Canadian society requires an exemplary and appropriate 
penalty”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little further, he said “The financial, physical and 
psychological distress of the competitors who were subject to the 
threats of the accused, and the fact that half of the driving schools 
that were then in operation had to shut down following the accused's 
actions—with their competence not being an issue—are also 
aggravating circumstances”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the minister reminded us that consumers are businesses 
that need products made by other companies, as well as ordinary 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember the purpose of the Competition Act, as 
amended in 1985. Why do I go back to it? 
Because we can already see some possible contradictions that explain why 
I have many questions for the minister, for the Bureau of Competition 
regarding the changes they want to make to the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current act reads as follows “The purpose of this Act is to 
maintain and encourage competition in Canada—” So far so good. But it 
goes on “—in order to promote the efficiency and adaptability of the 
Canadian economy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already, this may lead to questions of interpretation. The purpose 
of the act also includes the following “—in order to expand 
opportunities for Canadian participation in world markets while at the 
same time recognizing the role of foreign competition in Canada, in 
order to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises have an 
equitable opportunity to participate in the Canadian economy—” 
That is not all: “—as well as with a view to ensuring competitive 
prices and product variety”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is understandable that these four key objectives may on 
occasion appear to be contradictory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efficiency of the 
Canadian economy plays a considerable role in the evaluation of 
mergers on competition, and the act itself—this may sound like 
gobbledygook but these are the prohibitions or conditions for 
application—states “The Tribunal shall not make an order under 
section 92 if it finds that the merger or proposed merger in 
respect of which the application is made”—even in the case of the 
two major banks that want to merge, just listen to this “—has 
brought about or is likely to bring about gains in efficiency that 
will be greater than, and will offset, the effects of any 
prevention or lessening of competition that will result or is 
likely to result from the merger or proposed merger and that the 
gains in efficiency  would not likely be attained if the order were 
made”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, what this means is that there are two kinds of 
competition.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, for instance, the competition between two banks in 
Canada, and the effects it may have on small business loans, for 
instance, and on Canada's competitive position with respect to 
foreign businesses.  It is therefore understandable that there are 
at least grounds for interpretation here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this review is to indicate just how important 
the Competition Act is, and how it also needs to reassure 
consumers, the public, small and medium size businesses, about the 
efficiency of the competition bureau and the mechanisms in place. 
It is important to keep in mind that the federal government is not 
the only one with a competition bureau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to keep in mind that the provinces have also 
looked out for their consumers. 
Quebec passed a consumer protection act a number of years ago in 
response to public demand.  Several of the provisions in the 
federal legislation are also found in Quebec's law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can these two provisions co-exist?  Because, as the House 
knows, Quebec, as a province of Canada, has authority for civil 
law.  Canada has authority for criminal law.  It is also 
responsible for interprovincial provisions.  So I have to say that 
yes, here again, Quebec's legislation contains many of the 
provisions found in the federal legislation but that, so far, the 
way in which the federal law has been implemented has not resulted 
in overlap, or very little, which will not be the case or, at 
least, we will be in a very good position to ask questions with 
respect to the legislation as the government is proposing to amend 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat: the provisions regarding deceptive telemarketing 
should be passed.  If these were the only provisions, we would be 
happy to see them passed, because of what we have seen, as quickly 
as possible.  But, while this bill creates a new criminal offence 
in the case of deceptive telemarketing, something we support, this 
bill also decriminalizes the present competition act and numerous 
offences under the existing legislation.  Decriminalization would 
give the commissioner, who is now the bureau's director, very 
extensive authority, including the authority to make out-of-court 
rulings and to agree on orders, on what companies must do to comply 
with the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a great many questions.  There is a lack of logic. 
We are talking about a system in which companies could be subject 
to criminal charges, depending on the bill's provisions.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find ourselves with a system where, in the future, the 
commissioner will be able to make deals concerning the enforcement of 
orders. We cannot look at that and applaud. There is a lack of logic in 
there, which will definitely not reassure the public, especially in 
these times we are going through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps this is not what the government intended, but the 
enactments before us are certainly likely to have the impact I just 
described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording of the amendments is all very politically correct. But 
when we look at their implications, it is quite another story indeed. 
The bill is said to be intended to improve the merger notification 
process and to reduce the regulatory burden of businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand that. Under the existing legislation, business 
people who agree to a merger without notifying the competition board 
face imprisonment. This provision has been eliminated. In the future, 
there will be a $50,000 fine. Even the notes from the research branch 
mention that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that the regulatory burden will be reduced. But 
a few explanations are required here. Why was a system designed to show 
businesses that it is important to comply with the Competition Act 
replaced overnight by one that is said to be more expeditious? What 
assurance do we have that it will be as effective in convinving 
businesses to comply? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all businesses deliberately break the law, but we all know that 
there are some that take great glory in it or commonly do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The documents proposing speedy passage of this bill further state 
the following: “Ensure quicker and more efficient action against 
misleading advertising and deceptive marketing practices”. What they 
fail to say is that, with regard to misleading advertising, while there 
is still a provision under which charges could be laid under the 
Criminal Code, conditions that did not exist previously and which have 
significant implications are being added in the new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote a passage from the legislation “No person shall, for 
the purpose of promoting, directly or indirectly, the supply or use of 
a product or for the purpose of promoting, directly or indirectly, any 
business interest, by any means whatever”—and they add three words 
“—knowingly or recklessly, make a representation to the public that is 
false or misleading in a material respect”. 
It is quite something to add these words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, all documents from the Bureau of Competition provide 
that those responsible for misleading advertising, when it is 
misleading, even unintentionally, are liable to penalties, including 
jail sentences and huge fines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the Bureau of Competition and the government are recommending 
that we amend the Competition Act, on the grounds that issues will be 
solved more quickly and efficiently. However, the bill almost totally 
changes the spirit of the act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on, businesses will no longer be taken to court for a 
number of offences that used to be criminal offences. The commissioner 
will go before the Competition Tribunal—or another tribunal of his 
choice—but for what purpose? To have the court determine that a 
person is engaging in or has engaged in reviewable conduct. Members will 
agree that this is much nicer than to be accused and found guilty of a 
criminal offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on, a person might be found guilty of having engaged in 
reviewable conduct. In such a case, the court may order that person to 
do or not do something specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At worst—and this is something new which I am sure academics 
will look at very carefully—instead of being fined or even sent to 
jail, the person will be ordered, under clause 74.1(1)(c), “to pay an 
administrative monetary penalty”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why go that route? Let me try to explain. In Quebec, the same 
provisions are included in the Consumer Protection Act. The province can 
impose penalties in civil actions, something which the federal 
government cannot do through the Bureau of Competition and the tribunal. 
Therefore, it is trying to find another way to do something it cannot do 
directly.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FARM SAFETY WEEK

<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
safe farming is smart farming.  That is the theme for Farm Safety 
Week in Manitoba which began on March 11 and will end on March 
18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent study by Statistics Canada revealed that from 1991 to 
1995 almost 72% of all farm deaths in Canada resulted from 
working with or around agricultural machinery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a doubt a farm can be a dangerous place to work and 
live.  On average, 100 work related fatalities occur on farms 
annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>StatsCan also revealed that the three prairie provinces have a 
much higher rate of injuries than those in eastern Canada.  That 
being said, knowledge, experience and technical advances in 
safety are crucial to reducing farm incidents in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this week that Canadians will take note and further 
educate themselves to the realities of farming life.  It is vital 
that we do our best to make farming communities the safest they 
can be.

<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, earlier this month the Prime Minister appointed Ross 
Fitzpatrick to the Senate.  Besides being a B.C. Liberal 
fundraiser and campaign chairman, Fitzpatrick once hired the 
Prime Minister to serve on the board of his company, Viceroy 
Resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the Prime Minister told the House that he received no 
remuneration for that work.  According to insider trading 
reports, Fitzpatrick gave the Prime Minister a sweetheart stock 
deal worth over $45,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the government explain the contradiction between what 
the Prime Minister said in the House last week and the insider 
trading reports? 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I understand it, the Prime Minister was addressing the 
question of whether he received remuneration as a director. 
Directors are not paid by shareholders, they are paid by the 
company.  So there is no contradiction whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The insinuation in the hon. member's question is totally 
unwarranted. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it sounds like more creative Liberal accounting.  That 
explanation does nothing to clear the air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ross Fitzpatrick gave a lucrative stock deal to the Prime 
Minister.  That private stock deal gave the Prime Minister a 
$45,000 profit in one week.  The Prime Minister owed him a 
favour.  Now the Prime Minister gave Ross Fitzpatrick a B.C. 
Senate seat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this not leave the impression that Senate seats are for 
sale? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, this will leave the impression only in the mind of the 
hon. member.  I cannot account for what is in the mind of the 
hon. member, but it is not supported by the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time the Prime Minister was in private life.  He was 
entitled to engage in business transactions.  He left his 
directorships when he began in 1990, years later, to seek the 
leadership of the Liberal Party.  At the present time all his 
assets are in a blind trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely this is an indication of totally proper conduct. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister told the House that he received no 
remuneration from Viceroy Resources Corporation.  But the insider 
trading reports say he received $45,000 or more in a sweetheart 
stock deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ross Fitzpatrick first denied selling shares to the Prime 
Minister, then he changed his story.  The public does not know 
what to believe but is left with the impression that Senate seats 
are for sale.  All of this shames an already discredited 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister now cancel Fitzpatrick's shady Senate 
appointment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if the hon. Leader of the Opposition thinks that there 
is something shady in what is going on, he is making an 
allegation of improper conduct.  I challenge him to put his seat 
on the line and go outside the House and repeat the allegations 
in front of the cameras.  If he cannot or will not do that, then 
I say that what he is saying is nothing more than Reform rot, 
Reform rubbish.  It is a sickness in the mind of the hon. member 
to make these allegations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will tell the government member what is sick, a Senate that just

thinks it is okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ross Fitzpatrick has a company.  The Prime Minister last Monday 
replied to me in question period that he received no remuneration 
from working at Viceroy Resources.  That is simply not true. Ross 
Fitzpatrick has absolutely agreed that, oops, maybe he did get 
$45,000 on this sweetheart deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two stories here.  We want to know what the real story 
is.  Who is telling the truth, the Prime Minister or Ross 
Fitzpatrick? 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, they are both telling the truth.  The Prime Minister, as 
I understand it, did not receive any remuneration from Viceroy 
Resources for serving as its director. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transaction question was between Mr. Fitzpatrick, a 
shareholder, and the then Jean Chrétien who later became Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The insinuations are unwarranted.  The allegations are 
unwarranted.  The hon. member ought to be ashamed of herself for 
engaging in more Reform rubbish.  She already has been found not 
to know her facts.  Now the same sickness, the Reform rubbish, 
has surfaced.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial

three years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, that

did not answer the question. I do not understand his answer, but that is 
indeed his right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the light of these surpluses of between $6 billion and $7 
billion a year, which will reach $25 billion by the year 2000, is it not 
time my hon. colleague realized that the government can afford to 
substantially reduce premiums and to improve benefits to the unemployed 
in order to preserve the very nature of the plan instead of using it as 
a tax on jobs? 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial

management and the employees themselves—significant cuts to 
benefits and restrictive eligibility requirements enable the

</I></B></P><P align=left>With the arrival of the so-called spring gap, a period in 
which many unemployed workers will be short of funds because 
cheques will no longer be coming in, how can the minister

from the province of Quebec at a cost of $210,000.  The Prime 
Minister's office insulted the Seaforth Highlanders, he insulted 
British Columbians and he insulted the Canadian taxpayers by 
footing that bill, all because of some crazy idea of what it 
means to look Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question again is to the Deputy Prime Minister.  When is the

British Columbians for this ridiculous decision?

Mr. Speaker, once again the hon. member displays the parochialism 
of the Reform Party.  The fact is that the hosting of APEC was a 
Canadian initiative.  We had regiments from across Canada, we had 
a delegation of the mounted police and we had the Seaforth 
Highlanders from the west coast to provide a very important part. 
We wanted to present the face of Canada to our guests from Asia.

apparent is that, in 10, 15 or 20 years, unless things change, we 
are headed for a situation in which there will no longer really be 
a pan-Canadian francophone presence.  The presence of francophones 
from coast to coast is at risk”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech to inaugurate the Semaine nationale de la

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and

of all, I must say we are very proud to celebrate the Semaine 
nationale de la francophonie. It emphasizes the dualistic nature of 
Canada and the fact that we have two official languages, a fact of 
which we are proud and which is part of our national identity.  I 
thank my opposition colleague for pointing this out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Treasury Board has adopted a series of measures to enable

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and

is no doubt that the way provinces treat their linguistic 
minorities must reflect the obligations that the federal government 
has itself undertaken to fulfil vis-à-vis minority linguistic 
groups in each province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the anglophone minority is usually very well 
treated.  I think that this is recognized by everyone.  In all the

<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

continued working with our provincial colleagues on the national 
child benefit system.  Our commitment at the time to child care did 
not receive provincial approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since child care is a provincial responsibility, under their 
jurisdiction, we have found another way to help families, including 
those with a low income.  This is why, over the next three years, 
we will be increasing the child tax credit by $1.7 billion.  The 
effect of this will be to give the provinces manoeuvring room to 
implement child care systems. 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
recognize the federal government's efforts in the child tax 
benefit, be we consider them inadequate.  One of the weaknesses of 
the credit is its lack of protection against inflation.  It is only 
partially indexed and thus considerably reduces Canadian families' 
buying power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, the government fully indexed seniors' pensions.  It 
is just as necessary to protect the value of benefits today for 
families and children.  Why then is the government refusing to 
index the benefit fully?  Is it because, unlike seniors, children 
cannot vote?

year and a further $850 million over the next two years for a total 
of $1.7 billion seems eminently reasonable.

the federal Young Offenders Act costs Quebec over $80 million 
yearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the original 50-50 cost-splitting rule, and despite 
the fact that one quarter of the young people are within Quebec, 
Ottawa pays Quebec only 18.3% of the budget allocated to this 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice is talking about amending the Young 
Offenders Act in order to satisfy the Reform Party, but who will 
end up inevitably paying the increased costs of applying this 
legislation? 
Will the minister not admit that it is time Quebec was paid its 
fair share in this area?

how we could work together and co-operate to facilitate movement 
without any undue interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the specific case as referred to, we have also raised this 
matter directly with U.S. authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can state very clearly to the House that no U.S. official in

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORAL QUESTION PERIOD—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I wish to address the incident that occurred before 
the House adjourned Thursday, February 26, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to speak of the subsequent related events, which appear 
to have overtaken this House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows, when asked to rule, Speakers usually 
restrict their comments to the four corners of the specific 
incident before them.  However, in this case, the original 
incident has been so distorted that it has virtually been lost 
sight of while controversy rages around matters which were not 
originally at issue.  Under the circumstances, then, I ask that 
you bear with me while I address the salient points that have 
arisen in and around this case. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us recall the original incident. During oral question 
period on February 26, the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis was 
recognized. Before she even had the opportunity to begin her question, 
a disturbance among some members prevented her from proceeding any 
further. Once some measure of calm had been restored, the hon. member 
went on to ask her question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After oral question period, the House leader of the Bloc Quebecois 
raised a point of order about this disturbance and several other members 
also intervened to give their views on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recess and the ongoing deliberations of the House leaders 
allowed me to reflect carefully on the disorder that day and on the 
issues that were raised as a result. Although I have been ready to rule 
since the return of the House, I wanted to give the House leaders ample 
time to resolve this situation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that there is a simple, fundamental principle at 
stake here: the duty of the Speaker to maintain order and decorum 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply described, our Parliament works this way. First, members 
have a right to speak.  Second, the rules and practices of the 
House determine how that right is applied so that all members are 
treated fairly.  Third, the Speaker is charged with maintaining 
order in the Chamber by ensuring that the House's rules and 
practices are respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As cited on pages 50 and 54 of Beauchesne's sixth edition: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Speaker has the duty to maintain an orderly conduct of 
debate by repressing disorder when it arises—Those who preside 
must be mindful of the rights of Members to speak freely, and the 
equally important right of the House to be free from obstruction 
and grave disorder. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the Speaker must balance the competing claims of 
different members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of how dramatically our opinions may diverge or how 
passionately we hold to convictions that our political opponents 
do not share, civility must be respected in the House of Commons. 
This means that each member is entitled to speak and each member 
can expect a fair hearing, whether or not we agree with what they 
say or what they stand for. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues that face the nation and that are debated in this House 
are formidable. During debate, emotions can run high and, in the heat of 
the moment, behaviour can sometimes stray beyond the bounds of what is 
acceptable. When that happens, the Chair must be vigilant in bringing 
the House back to order and insisting that our practices be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have looked carefully at practice here in the House of Commons 
and in other Canadian legislatures: in the House of Commons of the 
United Kingdom and in other Westminster-style Parliaments. Everywhere we 
have looked, we have found that the orderly conduct of business is 
fundamental to parliamentary practice. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, in their own vigilant defence of orderly proceedings, my 
predecessors have consistently ruled out of order displays or 
demonstrations of any kind used by members to illustrate their 
remarks or emphasize their positions.  Similarly, props of any 
kind, used as a way of making a silent comment on issues, have 
always been found unacceptable in the Chamber.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably some of the media coverage of this incident and 
subsequent events seem to have missed the point.  Pundits are 
indignant, claiming that the issue is whether the Canadian flag 
has a place in this Chamber.  One newspaper went so far as to 
state in a lead editorial “decorum be damned”.  I think this is 
a foolhardy comment that betrays a sad misconception of the 
nature of parliaments and the way they work.  If it is to 
function effectively and constructively, this House, like any 
other deliberative assembly, must rely on the respect of 
civility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a ruling given on March 24, 1993, Speaker Fraser eloquently 
captured what order and decorum means in an assembly like ours 
when he stated: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the institution and our country has to take precedence over our 
own convictions when it comes to remarks in this place—there 
has to be reasonable order.  When I say reasonable order, I say 
that because without it, there is no free speech and that is 
(fundamentally what) this place is all about: the right to speak. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing here today before the House, with a flag of Canada on 
either side of the Speaker's chair, I can agree without 
reservation that there is no better place than the House of 
Commons for our flag, the symbol of our nation.  Similarly we can 
take pride in the relatively new practice of the singing of the 
national anthem before we begin proceedings on Wednesdays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this ruling is not about the flag.  It is not about the 
national anthem.  It is not about patriotism.  It is not about 
the rights of one political faction over another.  As I said 
earlier—and it bear repeating—the basic principles at issue 
here are order and decorum and the duty of the Speaker to apply 
the rules and practices of the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our law guarantees the right of all duly elected members to speak; 
our practice guarantees their right to be heard. It is the duty of the 
Speaker to guarantee that those rights are respected by guaranteeing 
that the House's rules and practices are respected. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, my duty for which I have taken an oath as Speaker 
requires me to uphold the rules, precedents and traditions of 
this House that have served us so well during the last 130 years 
of parliamentary democracy in Canada.  The events during question 
period on February 26 were clearly out of order, according to our 
parliamentary rules and practices.  I therefore rule that such an 
incident must not be repeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have been challenged to show my colours as a 
patriotic Canadian by allowing the unfettered display of flags in 
the Chamber.  This would constitute an unprecedented unilateral 
change to the practice of the House of Commons, a change, my 
colleagues, that no Speaker has the authority to make.  So, 
whatever pressure that I have to do so, I cannot and I will not 
arrogate such authority to myself.  Unless and until the House 
decides otherwise, no displays will be allowed and current 
practice will be upheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust, indeed I expect, as all hon. members have the right to 
expect, that when the Chair recognizes a member to speak, the 
House will extend to that member the courtesy of a respectful 
hearing of all Canadian members of Parliament.  I ask all hon. 
members to govern themselves according to the House's existing 
rules and practices which the Speaker is bound to uphold. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe it to the constituents who have elected us to make every 
honest effort to maintain what has been—for the most part—civil and 
courteous debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Alfred Hales retired from the House of Commons in 1974 after a 
full parliamentary career which was similar to those of many who 
served in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He worked hard to protect the interests of his constituents and 
his community.  He was chairman of the public accounts committee 
where he worked to promote economy in public expenditures.  He 
lived up to his belief that community service is the rent we pay 
for space on earth.  Had that been the sum total of Alfred Hales' 
parliamentary career, we would be justified in saying well done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Alfred Hales has left a legacy to the House of Commons 
and to Canada which for over 25 years has returned great 
dividends to parliament, to Canada and to hundreds of people who 
have gained a unique insight into parliamentary life in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was Alf Hales who gave leadership to the establishment of the 
parliamentary internship program which operates under the 
auspices of the Canadian Political Science Association.  That 
program has been mirrored in other parliamentary assemblies in 
many provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new member of Parliament who has benefited from the work of 
an intern, I consider it an honour to be able to salute Mr.

continues to bear fruit every day in parliament.

grandchildren and great-grandchildren, I offer the sympathy of my

Wellington South, now my riding of Guelph—Wellington.  On 
Saturday, March 7 many people gathered in Chalmers United Church 
in Guelph, Ontario to say goodbye. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said goodbye to a man whose involvement and drive for a 
better country and community was endless.  His story is one we 
can look to for inspiration and one we can be proud of.  His 
story is how a local boy gave so much to home while reaching the 
highest elected position in the land, a federal member of 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Born in 1909, Alf Hales attended Guelph public and high schools 
and graduated in 1934 from the Ontario Agricultural College, now 
the celebrated University of Guelph. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1936, during the depths of the Great Depression, he married 
Mary Gertrude, a marriage that lasted 62 years, right up until 
the day he died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alf Hales launched his impressive career playing football for 
the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL before becoming director of the 
Guelph YMCA.  He also joined the navy reserve at the outbreak of 
World War II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In quick succession, he joined the Guelph Chamber of Commerce, 
the Guelph Kiwanis Club and, long before environmentalism was 
popular, joined the Grand Valley Conservation Foundation which is 
still going strong today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His political career started with his election as alderman for 
the city of Guelph and quickly changed to member of Parliament 
for Wellington South.  He was the member from Guelph for 
seventeen and a half years, an impressive feat by anyone's 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to his retirement in 1974, he held a number of prominent 
positions such as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Labour and chair of the public accounts committee.  He was known 
around the House as someone who was honest and a good source of 
quotes for the press gallery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of his most important accomplishments in the House of 
Commons was the establishment in 1970 of the parliamentary 
internship program.  After his retirement from active national 
politics, he continued to receive important appointments to 
committees needing the wisdom of his experience.  At the same 
time, he continued to give with vigour and energy to the 
community he had already given so much to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He joined the Guelph historical society.  He was a member of the 
Colonel John McCrae Society and he was the first non-Italian 
inducted as an honorary life member to the Guelph 
Italian-Canadian Club. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alf Hales' life is a testimony to selfless giving to the 
community.  As a volunteer he helped co-ordinate the fundraising 
committee for the Puslinch community centre.  Upon completion he 
handed over the key to the centre to the reeve of Puslinch 
township without one cent owing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of Alf Hales' accomplishments and contributions is 
long, longer than I have time for here today.  I will close by 
saying that Alf Hales will be missed by his wife of 62 years, 
Mary, his children and grandchildren and by all the people whose 
lives he touched.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Alfred Dryden Hales, a former member of 
this House, who recently passed away.  I did not have the 
opportunity or the pleasure of meeting Mr. Hales, but in his 
biography I discovered a number of points we have in common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was born in Guelph, Ontario, in 1909 and earned a diploma 
in agricultural sciences in 1934.  Before becoming active in his 
community in Guelph, he played football for the Toronto Argonauts, 
between 1934 and 1936.  This is the first point we share, as I am 
an avid football fan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He started his political life as a candidate for the 
Progressive Conservative Party in the 1953 federal election, but 
was defeated.  He was elected for the first time in 1957 
representing the riding of Wellington South in the House of 
Commons.  He was re-elected in every election thereafter until his 
retirement from political life in 1974. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1962, in the Diefenbaker government, he served as 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour.  In opposition, 
he chaired the Standing Committee on Public Accounts from 1966 
to 1974.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was responsible for the creation of the parliamentary 
internship program.  In 1965, he tabled a motion in this regard. 
Four years later, Parliament welcomed its first interns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former intern at the National Assembly, I can testify to 
the importance to an institution such as ours of the parliamentary 
internship program and I think we owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. 
Hales' innovative spirit and vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore like to offer my sincere condolences and 
those of all my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois to his family and 
friends. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
pay tribute to a man of character who believed in the importance 
of family, the community and service to others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 28 of this year Mr. Alfred Hales died at the age of 
88, leaving behind his wife of 62 years, Mary Hales, three 
children, nine grandchildren and seven great grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that Mr. and Mrs. Hales had two sets of twins, one of 
them deceased.  I can imagine what an exciting family it was when 
the children were young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reading about the life of Mr. Hales, one is quickly struck by 
his sense of community and passion for causes he believed in.  It 
is truly refreshing to read of a man who took great satisfaction 
from attaining goals not for himself, but with an understanding 
of the greater impact on those around him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hales was quoted in an interview at one time, commenting that 
community service is the rent we pay for space on earth.  That was 
a motto with which he lived his life and, as has already been 
mentioned, the rent was paid in full. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1956 Mr. Hales had his first taste of community service by 
way of politics.  He served as an alderman for the city of 
Guelph.  He then went on to federal politics.  He was elected to 
the House of Commons in 1957 and re-elected seven times.  I do 
not think anything speaks more highly of the character of a 
person than his constituents choosing to re-elect him seven 
times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his 17 years as a member of Parliament, he served as 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour.  He served on 
many committees and was actively involved in a number of foreign 
delegations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, however, the parliamentary internship program which 
stands out as one of his greatest accomplishments.  In 1970 the 
House of Commons, thanks to the work of Mr. Hales, saw its first 
class of interns.  This program, still in place today, gives 
students from all over the country the opportunity to learn about 
life on the Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politics was not the only rent that Mr. Hales chose to pay. 
After 17 years as an MP, he retired and began to look for other 
ways to give back to the community.  Although he was active in 
public causes before and during his time in Ottawa, it was 
following his retirement from politics that Mr. Hales took a more 
local approach to issues, jumping into Guelph community 
activities with both feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to his daughter, he felt deep roots in the Guelph 
community because a long line of Hales' generations had lived 
there.  That is why he worked so hard for the city, serving on 
the Guelph police commission, founding the Guelph prayer 
breakfast, fundraising for and building a community centre, 
preserving the history of Guelph through the historical society 
and serving on innumerable fundraising projects for charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also had time for his four-legged friends in the community, 
serving as the law representative on the Ontario Veterinary 
Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Mr. Hales took on his activities out of a sense of duty 
and responsibility, he was recognized by his peers for his 
generosity.  He was made a Paul Harris fellow by the Guelph 
Rotary Club.  He was inducted into the University of Guelph 
sports hall of fame.  He was awarded the certificate of merit for 
outstanding service to the Red Cross.  He was awarded a 
commemorative medal on the 125th anniversary of the Confederation 
of Canada.  He was made a Mel Osborne fellow by the Kiwanis 
Club of Guelph. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I did not know Mr. Hales personally, I believe it would 
be fair in the reading of his life to comment that his greatest 
awards and rewards were not those which I have mentioned were 
given to him. 
Instead, in the words of his son, it was strong beliefs that 
drove him to work so hard for others.

have been truly rewarded.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am honoured to join with other members in the House in 
expressing the deep condolences of all members in the New 
Democratic Party to the family and friends of Alf Hales and in 
particular to express our heart-felt sympathy to his wife, Mary, 
their three children, nine grandchildren and seven great 
grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned by other members, Alf Hales was a member 
for Wellington South for 17 years and felt very deep roots in the 
Guelph community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been born and raised in a community very close to Guelph, 
a place called Winterbourne, Ontario, I feel a particular sense 
of loss at hearing the news of the passing of Alf Hales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But mostly today I single out the fact that Alf Hales was the 
founder of the federal parliamentary internship program.  He 
conceived of the idea in 1965 and although it was not until 1969 
that the House agreed to implement the federal parliamentary 
internship program, it became a reality and has been with us now 
for almost 30 years. That took incredible foresight, vision and 
courage and in fact a lot of persistence that is so evident in 
the career of Alfred Hales.  He in fact had a private members' 
bill before the House year after year until finally it was agreed 
to and became a reality in 1969 with the first group of interns 
being established in 1969-70. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise not only as a member of the House but as a former 
parliamentary intern, in fact the only parliamentary intern to 
end up pursuing a career in federal politics.  I am deeply 
grateful for his pioneering spirit and the contribution he has 
made to so many in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak today on behalf of all federal parliamentary interns, 
past and present, whose lives have been enriched by this program. 
It has offered an incredible opportunity for so many young people 
over the years to combine practical learning with academic 
analysis, helping us all to pursue our respective careers in a 
more effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact it was in 1972, and I quote from an article in 
<I>Time</I> magazine, that we get the true reason or sense of this 
program from Mr. Alfred Hales own words when he said: “The 
experiment brings the interns out of the ivory tower and puts 
them into a world of reality”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By founding this program, Alfred Hales has done a great service 
for the country and helped ensure a high calibre of young people 
prepared to make a great contribution to the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that we can best honour the life and work of Alfred 
Hales by remembering our own roots, our roots in family, in 
church and community but more specifically by pledging to ensure 
that the federal parliamentary internship program continues as a 
part of this institution and an integral part of our 
parliamentary traditions.

officers and firefighters are required to place their lives at

sufficient compensation to their families. The public also mourns 
that loss and wishes to support, in a tangible way, the surviving 
families in their time of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore call on Parliament to establish a 
public safety officers compensation fund for the benefit of 
families of public safety officers who are killed in the line of 
duty.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>COMPETITION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK202">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-20, 
an act to amend the Competition Act and to make consequential and 
related amendments to other acts, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Going into oral question period, the hon. 
member for Mercier had the floor.  She now has 19 minutes left to 
complete her speech. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, just before 
oral question period, I was saying that Bill C-20, an act to amend 
the Competition Act and related amendments to other Acts, 
introduces a new criminal offence relating to fraudulent 
telemarketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry described in great detail why this 
new offence and the clauses in the bill which relate to it had 
become necessary.  I added that we would be pleased to support the 
bill, if this were all it contained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out, however, that the bill before us, although 
stressing—as do those defending it—the clauses relating to 
fraudulent or abusive telemarketing, in reality conceals numerous 
other clauses with which we cannot agree.  Not all the other 
clauses, but a sufficiently large number to prompt us to ask 
pressing questions and to disagree with the principle of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out that the bill decriminalizes a 
number of former offences. Although the bill introduces a new 
regime which could be termed civil, it in fact creates new 
provisions, some aspects of which are questionable to say the 
least.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After an investigation has been conducted under several provisions 
of the act, after the case has gone before the competition tribunal, it 
may be determined that the business has engaged in reviewable conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purpose of hearing such a case, the competition tribunal 
would be made up differently: you would not have a judge, a counsel and 
other interested parties, so to speak, but just a judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the conduct of a business has been determined to be 
reviewable, this business may be ordered what to do or not to do, 
depending on the offence and the evidence. 
It would face what constitutes, as far as I and the individuals and 
lawyers I consulted know, a new penalty called an administrative 
monetary penalty, which is similar to the penalties imposed previously 
under criminal law, but which seems to be a new, civil version of what 
the government no longer wants to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the evidence rule has been changed. What 
paragraph 74(1) provides is that evidence should be considered as 
convincing prima facie, which, on the face of it, is surprising. The 
least we can do is to question this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is a more serious concern in that the current director of 
the competition bureau is the only one authorized to investigate the 
businesses and ask the tribunal or another court of his choice to make 
a determination of reviewable conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is to say that this is a complex bill, but behind this 
complexity is the concentration of power in the hands of the competition 
bureau and its director, who actually becomes a commissioner under this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These provisions are also intriguing to say the least. In Quebec, 
the consumer protection act contains provisions similar to those found 
in the Competition Act with respect to misleading advertising, to 
conspiracy, and Quebec, which took action in civil matters, is doing 
quite well in that area. What will businesses do? Will they not, in 
Quebec at least, be subject to two systems? Are they compatible or not? 
These are certainly important questions that need to be answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is touted as providing the courts with new means of 
dealing with crime through orders on consent and orders including 
prescriptive terms upon what I described earlier as prima facie 
convincing evidence.

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, these means cannot be requested except by the 
commissioner, who has total discretionary power.  One could assume 
he will choose to go before the Competition Tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, it was stated during the inquiries and committee 
sittings that the Competition Tribunal has limited means at its 
disposal.  It is, therefore, not surprising that only the 
commissioner can act in this connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of this decriminalization is that powers are 
centralized in the hands of a commissioner who is, and I must again 
emphasize this point, a federal public servant answerable only to 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the commissioner applies for an order from the 
competition tribunal, he gives the person whose conduct is to be 
reviewed 48 hours' notice.  This in fact allows plenty of time for 
an out-of-court settlement to be reached. During these 48 hours, 
the commissioner and the party may reach an agreement on the terms 
of the order, including the possibility of their being taxable. The 
order will be filed for immediate registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are moving from a system of criminal offences to one that 
is not only decriminalized but can end up completely sidestepping 
the criminal system with out-of-court settlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may argue that this is more efficient. 
What must be asked is whether this system includes everything 
necessary to ensure that the spirit of the Competition Act is 
respected by all businesses, not only small and medium-sized ones, 
but large ones as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying that one addition was made on deceptive 
telemarketing after introduction of the first bill, C-67. Deceptive 
telemarketing—and this may be essential, but was not included in 
the first bill—may, under sections 45 and 47, be subject to 
electronic surveillance.  This was not in Bill C-67. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada-U.S. report on deceptive telemarketing, dated 
November 1997, recommended that the matter be studied in greater 
depth before a decision was reached on the use of electronic 
surveillance to gather evidence on major offences related to 
deceptive telemarketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of questions need to be asked in connection with the 
application of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, according to the Parliamentary Research Branch, 
deceptive telemarketing costs consumers $60 million.  That is 
serious.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is far from the losses that the same research branch estimates 
at $40 billion in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we must target deceptive telemarketing is that this 
misleading advertising by telephone is generally aimed at defenceless 
people, including the elderly, who stand to lose a lot of money. We have 
seen tragic cases of people who lost just about all their savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advisory committee was not in a position to make concrete 
recommendations, but it agreed that the bill should go ahead with this 
provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill includes worthwhile, innovative provisions, but its 
review of the Competition Act does not fully satisfy consumers—in the 
broad sense used by the industry minister this morning, which includes 
businesses as consumers. Indeed, based on the consultations I have held, 
the administrative monetary penalties may very well be challenged. Some 
practising lawyers and others in the education sector told me that, on 
the face of it, they were practically convinced that this provision 
would be challenged before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we have just started second reading, we will have to insist 
in committee on finding out what kind of studies were conducted. 
In addition, the potential for duplication and overlap with Quebec 
consumer protection legislation is extremely troubling and warrants 
considerable attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there may be some concern over decriminalization 
aimed at centralizing powers in the hands of one official.  I have 
no quarrel with that person's ability.  However, he will have 
absolute discretionary power opposable only by the minister, to 
whom he is accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this period of worldwide economic upheaval, the 
negotiations on the multilateral agreement on investment are 
worrying many people.  While the underlying intentions are 
laudable, there are other intentions that are of huge concern, and 
it is not clear that even Canada will approve, given the exceptions 
sought, in the field of culture, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When negotiations of such importance are being conducted, it 
is vital the government reassure the people that competition will 
be maintained.  Too many small businesses and thus consumers could 
be deprived of opportunities and, worse, heavily penalized. We must 
take a hard look at mergers and doubtful and fraudulent business 
practices, and consumers must be assured that the minister and the 
commissioner will not be tempted to enter into agreements that will 
result in two justices: one for ordinary individuals and one for 
businesses, including major corporations, that would always put 
them above suspicion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For reasons of overlap and because of questions about the 
spirit of the Competition Act and its application, the Bloc 
Quebecois cannot support the bill in principle at second reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to participate in the debate on 
Bill C-20, an act to amend the Competition Act. It is important 
to recognize what this piece of legislation is intended to do and 
then to assess the changes which have been proposed in that 
light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the legislation has been, for a long period of 
time under whatever name the legislation has had, to ensure that 
the Canadian marketplace is as competitive as possible in the 
interest of consumers.  It ensures that consumers have a wide 
range of products available at competitive prices in 
circumstances in which sellers do not use practices which are 
unacceptable, misleading and deceptive to attract sales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the interests of consumers to ensure that various 
assertions about the quality a product or a service might 
possess, about the price at which that product or service might 
or might not have been sold in the past and about various 
qualities of that product or service be truthful.  In that way 
consumers know what it is they are comparing so they can make 
efficient and sensible consumer decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also plainly in the interests of competitors to ensure 
that all businesses within the marketplace abide by the same 
rules and pursue honest, clear and open business practices.  If a 
competitor is able to generate a sale as a result of a misleading 
practice, then competitors who are adhering to proper and honest 
business practices will suffer losses accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in both the interests of consumers and the business 
community that we have effective competition policy. In that 
regard the legislation approaches these practices in the 
marketplace in both criminal and non-criminal ways.  It deals 
with conspiracy, bid rigging, discriminatory and predatory 
pricing, price maintenance, misleading advertising, with which 
many people are familiar, and deceptive marketing practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts have the power in those areas to impose fines, to 
order imprisonment and to issue orders to stop the practice in 
question. They also have the power to issue interim orders to 
stop the practice in question and to administer a wide range of 
remedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition there are issues which at first blush are not so 
close to home to consumers but which have a significant impact 
covered by the act.  These primarily deal with restrictions on 
competition, mergers, the abuse of a dominant position in a 
marketplace, refusing to sell to someone because of some of their 
selling practices and essentially dealing with the more macro 
issues rather than the ones that affect consumers precisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation and legislation before it sets out the rules 
and regulations of the marketplace.  This piece of legislation 
can be divided into two or three segments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first deals with deceptive telemarketing. With the growth of 
telecommunications and the reduction in price of telephone 
services, by using the telephone it is now very easy and 
inexpensive for a marketer in one province or country to sell to 
a buyer in another country or province. As a result we have seen 
a growth both in legitimate and illegitimate telemarketing.  In 
order to protect those who pursue this activity legitimately, it 
is necessary to deal with those who bilk millions and perhaps 
billions of dollars from Canadian consumers. It is also important 
to protect those Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill should be applauded in that it sets out much more 
explicitly what the crime of deceptive telemarketing will be. 
If enforced effectively, the legislation will serve to reduce the 
abuse of Canadian consumers across the country.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As every member of the House will know, the kinds of people who 
have been the target of telemarketing are very often those who 
are most vulnerable in society.  Seniors, at least in my 
estimation, are trusting.  They generally believe that people are 
telling them the truth because that is the way they conduct their 
affairs.  If the evidence is correct, and I believe it is, they 
tend to believe what telemarketers tell them. When they are 
offered the $10,000 prize, if they would only send $500, $600, 
$700 or $800 to cover taxes and other incidental expenditures, 
they believe they will in fact receive the $10,000 prize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To many of us it is an incredulous idea, but we know from the 
evidence that maybe hundreds of thousands of Canadians and 
perhaps millions across North America have been taken in, in this 
way, and for significant amounts of money.  I have met many 
Canadians who have been tricked in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the bill is very significant.  We have done little about 
this criminal activity, this defrauding of Canadian consumers, 
mostly older Canadians, to the order of $4 billion.  Making 
something a crime is only part of the story.  We have to be sure 
that we can enforce the sanctions which flow from making 
deceptive telemarketing a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date there is a very small police department headquartered in 
North Bay, Ontario, called Operation Phonebusters.  At last count 
it had one person who knows the area intimately, Staff Sergeant 
Elliot.  He has done a terrific job on this question.  Many of us 
in the House will have spoken to him and to his very small staff 
attached to that operation in North Bay.  They are dealing with a 
criminal activity which is costing the most vulnerable Canadians 
perhaps $4 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us match that with the resources we spend across the 
country, province after province, to deal with drivers who speed, 
with people who break windows and with street crime.  The 
mismatch of resources attached to and applied to this kind of 
criminal activity is so obvious that we have to ask the solicitor 
general and the government to make sure they commit adequate 
resources to deal effectively with this matter.  It is not enough 
to have a small joint OPP-RCMP force in North Bay to try to deal 
with these cases across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without that commitment the legislation will mean very little to 
ordinary Canadians who have been bilked and are likely to 
continue to be bilked if the kinds of people that engage in 
deceptive telemarketing, those who are not likely to stop just 
because the House says it will be a crime, carry on in the way in 
which they have been carrying on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We absolutely need a commitment from the government.  Maybe the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry will be able 
to commit today to ensuring that the legislation is effectively 
enforced.  It is important to recognize and to support the 
government in acting on the telemarketing fraud that exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of this fraud is centred in Montreal.  A small number of 
people are using very sophisticated telephone and marketing 
techniques across the country into my province, my district in 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, on a regular basis, making billions 
of dollars off other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that Quebec authorities effectively deal with 
this question even when a loss has not occurred in the province 
of Quebec.  We have to make sure we co-ordinate activities across 
the country to put an end to this kind of activity.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me summarize that point by saying that I support the 
government in its measures in this regard.  I hope it will commit 
resources to make sure that the legislation is adequately 
enforced and that Canadians are adequately protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do a little work on informing consumers.  Last year, 
faced with complaints in my riding, I provided a telephone 
security tip brochure which people could put by their telephones 
telling them what not to do and what they might do to protect 
themselves from telemarketing scam artists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see some commitment on the part of the government to 
enforcing the legislation.  Although it is late, I think we 
should congratulate the government for introducing the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another part we have some serious questions which arise as a 
result of what I indicated in the beginning.  The legislation is 
designed to ensure we have a competitive marketplace in Canada. 
Separate from issues like health care and education which we and 
Canadians believe should fundamentally be largely outside the 
markets and administered in a separate way in the public 
interest, things should be bought and sold in the marketplace in 
a competitive environment.  The actors in the marketplace, the 
sellers and the providers of goods and services, should also act 
in a competitive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also support dealing with changes to trade practices and 
misleading advertising to provide the government with a number of 
different ways to approach this problem.  Making something 
criminal is not the only way to attack an issue.  That has been 
made clear.  We need a mixture of criminal, civil and 
administrative measures to ensure that consumers and competitors 
are best protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me come to the point where I have some difficulty, the 
merger part of the legislation.  Canada has one of the weakest 
anti-merger pieces of legislation in the world.  Of any developed 
country we have not treated the question of larger mergers 
seriously.  Only one has perhaps ever been seriously called into 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now faced with merger mania, with big banks merging and 
with big insurance companies merging.  I believe we are just at 
the beginning of merger mania.  Many of our large corporations 
will be telling us that it is in their best interests to have 
less competition in Canada so that they can compete in the world 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure members have heard in their ridings that Canadians 
simply do not buy that argument.  They do not want big mergers to 
take place.  They do not want the Royal Bank and the Bank of 
Montreal to merge.  They do not want big insurance companies to 
merge.  They do not want their fellow Canadians to lose their 
jobs and they do not want to have less competition.  They want to 
have more choice, not less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this merger legislation do with regard to these 
questions?  Essentially it does not do anything.  It leaves our 
whole structure, our whole process, pretty darn weak. It does not 
ensure that we will have serious review of bank mergers, 
insurance company mergers or any others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anybody seriously think that the merger between the Royal 
Bank and the Bank of Montreal is anything other than a foregone 
conclusion?  Is there any expectation across the country that 
because of the power of those two big banks and our weak merger 
legislation this merger will go ahead?  We would be foolhardy to 
think this was not essentially a foregone conclusion.  We can 
work as hard as we can to stop it because Canadians do not want 
it.  Many of these mergers are not in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the legislation, because of the approach the 
government takes and because the approach of the Conservative and 
Reform parties and those parties that tend to support big 
business, there is unlikely to be anything significant in this 
regard without a major change of heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see The Bay and K-Mart merging.  Is anybody going to ask any 
questions about whether it is in the public interest?  I do not 
think so, from those three parties I mentioned.  Indeed the 
public interest seems to be the last thing anybody cares about in 
pro-business parties with regard to mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want better, deserve better and should have better. 
They should have merger legislation which puts proposed mergers 
to the test.  It would require those who want to merge to show 
why it is in the interest of Canada that they do so.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in the bill requires any accounting by the Bank of 
Montreal and the Royal Bank.  We know jobs will be lost.  The 
presidents of those two organizations have made sure they will 
not lose their jobs, but the cashiers in the branches in our 
communities will not be there and the branches will not be there 
because of the merger.  That is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passing legislation of this sort is an opportunity to beef up 
the legislation so the interest of Canadians can be protected, so 
we have an economy that is getting more competitive and not less, 
and so we have an economy that acts in the interest of Canadians 
and not just in the interest of large banks, large insurance 
companies and large retailers.  It is unfortunate that the 
government did not take the opportunity to do what it 
philosophically says it wants to do, that is enhance the 
competition inherent in Canada's marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps some would find it odd that it has to be a social 
democrat who asks why we do not focus on a competitive 
marketplace.  Why do the Reform Party, the Tory Party and the 
Liberal Party say they do not give a damn about competition? They 
would rather have these big mergers taking place.  They would 
much rather have a policy of deregulation, privatization and 
monopolization, which is exactly what has happened in Canada over 
the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we had merger legislation that is actually in the 
interest of Canadians and not just in the interest of those who 
want to merge and consolidate their own power, their own prestige 
and their own ability to control the rest of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are good parts in the legislation.  I applaud the 
government's move on fraudulent telemarketing.  It is very 
important to commit adequate resources to ensure these crimes can 
be effectively policed and Canadians can be effectively 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on the merger part, which in an odd way is kind of 
combined with the telemarketing legislation, much more could have 
been done.  The government deserves significant criticism, as do 
those who support this weak merger regime that we have in Canada, 
for not taking strident measures to make sure we have a more 
competitive economy in Canada rather than a less competitive one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar for his 
comments.  He suggested that the Reform Party together with 
others were opposed to competition in the banking sector.  I 
would like to correct the record.  The Reform Party has said that 
it would only approve the proposed merger of the two large 
chartered banks if we had a more competitive banking regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member about what happened to his 
social democratic principles.  I grew up in Saskatchewan down the 
road from where Tommy Douglas was first elected.  As a high 
school student I read the Regina manifesto, the glorious 
socialist vision of our friends to my far left in this Chamber. 
It said among other things that the CCF and its progeny, the NDP, 
were committed to no competition in the banking sector, not to 
more competition but to none, to nationalizing the banking 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what this hon. member has done with his socialist 
principles.  Did he lose them along with his psychedelic 
Volkswagen bus in 1968? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I never had a 
psychedelic Volkswagen bus in 1968.  I always bought much more 
enjoyable cars than that.  Maybe the member for Calgary Southeast 
had one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Times change.  If we look around the world, the most effective 
governments with regard to growth in the economy are not the 
governments looking back to the past, to the 19th century as the 
Reform Party does on economic policy, but looking forward to the 
21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member is aghast at the prospects of a social 
democratic government in Germany. That will make 14 out of 16 
developed countries in Europe with socialist governments. All of 
them deal with the most important issue which is to provide an 
economy that ensures people can earn a decent living, raise their 
families and look forward to the future with some kind of 
confidence and expectation that they will be doing better rather 
than worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking around at the Canadian economy and Canadian society, it 
is not predominantly the social democrats who take economic 
ventures into public ownership.  There is much more public 
ownership of the economy in the province of Alberta than there is 
in the province of Saskatchewan.  Incidentally, Saskatchewan also 
has the lowest per capita cost of government than any other 
province.  It is much lower than in Alberta.  There are 
significant lessons to be learned by looking left instead of 
looking backward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important element of the social democratic economic strategy 
is that we work in partnership.  Business, governments, workers, 
aboriginal peoples and communities all work together to build a 
vision for that economy.  We all undertake certain 
responsibilities within the performance of that vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not difficult to understand if we look at how the 
Saskatchewan government under Premier Roy Romanow has built that 
province. It has the lowest unemployment rate in the country and 
the best indexes of economic growth of any province because it 
works in partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan is now growing in population.  Only last week I 
learned that last year 1,000 Manitobans moved to Saskatchewan. 
That has not been normal in the past.  We are required to bring 
Canadians from across the country because that economy is 
booming.  We have full employment.  We have skill shortages.  We 
need people for existing jobs and we cannot find them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a successful economic strategy.  It is a modern economic 
strategy.  Social democrats are looking forward to the next 
century, not like the Reform Party which is looking back 
hankering after and longing for the 19th century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member was so eloquent about mergers when he said that he 
was opposed to mergers and that sort of thing.  I do not think he 
listened very carefully earlier this morning when we talked about 
this.  I want to leave that aside and ask the member whether he 
would be as opposed to the merging of co-operatives as he is for 
the merging of private enterprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is not a question of 
being opposed to or in favour of mergers.  It is a question of 
what is in the public interest.  If a merger is in the public 
interest, then of course I and my colleagues would support it. It 
is not a matter of some ideological fixation that someone is 
automatically in favour of these large organizations, as I think 
the member for Kelowna would be. Neither is it a matter of being 
automatically opposed. In this modern world we have to be 
pragmatic.  Socialists are as pragmatic as anybody else.  We are 
supportive of things that are good for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raises the question of co-ops.  Let us look at the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  That has been a huge success story for 
Canadians.  The Reform Party is opposed to it even though it 
works because philosophically Reformers do not like it.  It does 
not suit their philosophy.  It does not suit their 19th century 
view of the world.  Therefore they do not like it.  But it works. 
Canadian farmers know it works.  That is the way that New 
Democrats across this country are approaching our economic 
challenges. If it works, we do it.  If it does not work, we do 
not do it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
terms of referring to an actual economic philosophy based upon 
less debt and less tax, I actually take exception to the concept 
that an economic philosophy based upon less debt and less tax and 
putting more disposable income back into Canadians' pockets is 
considered to be a 19th century philosophy. 
If anything, over the last 10 to 15 years we have learned that 
governments cannot spend their money any better than individual 
Canadians do.  The only economies that actually have any 
consistent growth are the ones that have less debt and less 
taxation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the initiatives in other countries such as Ireland or 
the Netherlands, when they made substantial reductions in terms 
of their personal taxes what was the result? The result was more 
growth in their economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian domestic economy is at its lowest compared to the 
other G-7 countries.  The reason is that there is not the amount 
of disposable income in Canadians' pockets so that they actually 
have an opportunity to spend money and get the economy going here 
in Canada. Any growth we have is based on our export industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member at least admit that the only economies that have 
actually had any consistent growth among the G-7 countries are 
the ones based upon less debt and less tax? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether 
the member for Fundy—Royal is running for the leadership of his 
own party or switching sides to the Reform Party, but certainly 
they sound pretty much alike to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make one response to the member's question.  The United 
Nations has said that Canada is the best country in the world in 
which to live. The <I>Financial Post</I>, not very often a friend 
of the New Democratic Party, said that applying those same 
criteria, Saskatchewan was the best province in which to live. 
That was the <I>Financial Post</I>, their buddies, not mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need in order to make our economies work is a balanced 
approach.  If all they want to do is reduce taxes for the 
wealthy, that will not generate the economic growth and economic 
opportunities for ordinary people.  They have never done that. In 
fact their tax policies would ensure that ordinary Canadians do 
not get a break at all or are in worse shape than they were 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, they might reduce taxes but what are they going to 
do about health care?  They are going to make Canadians pay for 
that.  What are they going to do about Canada pensions?  They are 
going to make Canadians pay for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need is a balanced approach, one which is pragmatic, one 
which answers the questions Canadians are concerned about. We do 
not need one which is based on some old fashioned ideology which 
this country threw away and which most sensible people around the 
world threw away centuries ago.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure today to speak on a bill that is important to the 
success of business competition in Canada.  It is a bill that 
introduces amendments that will modernize regulations for the 
Canadian business environment. The amendments in Bill C-20 strive 
to guide business in a fair and more equitable fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Competition Act was last substantially amended in 
1986.  These amendments gave Canada a powerful law that served 
the business community well.  However with the huge changes in 
the technology of doing business and the rapidly evolving 
marketplace, the law is long overdue for revision and review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that in 1995 the director of investigation and 
research released a discussion paper which had been sent out to 
1,000 interested parties.  About 80 responses were received 
regarding the proposed changes to the Competition Act. We also 
understand that the director set up a consultative panel whose 
mandate was to discuss the comments made within the discussion 
paper and to hold indepth reviews with concerned parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over a year later in April 1996 the report of the panel was 
released and provided the basis for Bill C-67 which died on the 
Order Paper in the last Parliament.  Almost another year later we 
finally get to debate Bill C-20 which is essentially the same as 
Bill C-67. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However through my own consultation with concerned parties, 
there are segments of this new bill that are radically different 
than those existing in C-67.  The addition of amendments that 
have not passed through the same rigorous debate with the 
consultative panel has me concerned. Is this government trying to 
slip these through discreetly? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT66"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT66"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1625
<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were four main amendments that existed in Bill C-67 which 
have not changed.  These will require adjustment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus on these aspects of the bill:  misleading 
advertising, ordinary price claims, pre-merger notifications and 
deceptive telemarketing practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Misleading advertising practices can and do have serious 
economic consequences especially when directed toward large 
groups or done over extended periods of time.  Misleading 
advertising is detrimental to both competitors who follow the 
rules and engage in honest promotion and to consumers themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Covered under the act are such promotional tricks as double 
ticketing, where the higher of the two ticketed prices is 
charged, pyramid selling, and bait and switch selling when a 
product is advertised at a bargain price but a reasonable supply 
is not available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proposed amendments to the Competition Act relating to 
misleading advertising are intended to change the focus on the 
misleading advertising and deceptive marketing practices 
provisions from punishment to quick and effective compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In discussions with key members of the Canadian marketplace, I 
believe this amendment is acceptable.  We are supportive of this 
amendment in philosophy.  The creation of a dual criminal-civil 
system is expected to result in the majority of cases involving 
misleading advertising being dealt with through civil means, 
including such remedies as cease and desist orders, corrective 
notices, consent orders and where needed, administrative monetary 
penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The competition bureau will then have to create a set of 
guidelines which clearly explains to retailers and businesses 
what types of misleading advertising will result in civil 
penalties and which will result in criminal enforcement.  We 
strongly urge the competition bureau to have full public 
consultations regarding these guidelines as this issue is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ordinary price claims is a powerful marketing tool used by 
retailers and businesses.  It is the representation of 
significant savings by the reduction of a regular price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers often wait for items to go on sale before purchasing. 
Many companies will say that their product is on sale when in 
fact a number of these businesses usually sell that item for that 
price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 52.1(d) currently prohibits materially misleading 
representation to consumers regarding the price at which items 
and similar products are or will ordinarily be sold.  There are 
certain criteria which must be met for a business to claim that 
an item is at a discounted price as opposed to its regular price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current provisions in the act do not clarify sufficiently 
the circumstances which determine whether a retailer is making an 
ordinary price claim properly.  The competition bureau listened 
to concerned members of the retail industry who asserted that a 
significant number of businesses could not comply with a test 
based on sales volume and that a time based test would be better 
suited to their situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through discussions with the consultative panel, the competition 
bureau and the members of the retail industry, it was agreed that 
the amendments represented in Bill C-20 for regular price claims 
are fairer and more equitable.  The test for ordinary selling 
price will now consist of two parts:  a substantial volume of the 
product that has been sold at or above the claimed regular price 
within a reasonable period of time before or after the making of 
the representation, or the product has been offered at or above 
the claimed regular price in good faith for a substantial period 
of time or immediately after the making of the representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although some of the terms in the testing prescriptions are 
ambiguous, members of the retail and commerce community which I 
have spoken with feel that the setting of rigid tests would not 
be in the interests of Canadian businesses or consumers. 
Stringent tests would not allow retailers to act and respond 
according to competitive initiatives and other market dynamics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are comfortable that the guidelines as they exist in the 
amendments will effectively eliminate some of the confusion 
around the regular price claims and that setting guidelines in 
this area will also help businesses understand the parameters for 
effective pricing policies, yet there is flexibility for the 
exercising of judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one area that should be excluded from the regular price 
claims arena would be the critical issue of clearance sales.  We 
urge the government to look into this aspect of pricing and 
ensure that the scope of the ordinary price claims provisions 
explicitly excludes clearance pricing.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pre-merger notifications is another area I would like to 
address. Companies are obligated to notify the Competition Bureau 
of a proposed merger when two thresholds set out in the 
Competition Act are met.  However, the consultative panel and 
many of the business community recognize that a vast majority of 
transactions that are subject to pre-merger notification do not 
raise serious competitive issues.  This concern can be mended by 
raising the thresholds in sections 109 and 110 of the Competition 
Act and by creating additional exemptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Raising the pre-merger notification thresholds and creating 
additional exemptions is now more essential than ever.  As of 
November 1997 there was a substantial fee of $25,000 plus $1,750 
in taxes imposed with pre-merger notification filings.  Because 
so many transactions are caught due to the low thresholds, we 
believe that raising these thresholds would not only alleviate 
the number of cases the bureau would have to review, but it would 
also allow the thorough research of the cases that are truly 
detrimental to competitiveness in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increases that have been suggested to me from key members of 
the business community include raising the size of parties and 
their affiliates' threshold in section 109 from $400 million to 
$500 million.  I believe when this came out it was $400 million, 
but through inflation that is equivalent to $530 million, so $500 
million is reasonable.  Raise the size of transaction thresholds 
in section 110 from $35 million to $50 million, and in the case 
of amalgamations from $70 million to $100 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommended increases in the above noted thresholds are 
particularly warranted in view of the fact that these thresholds 
have caught substantially more transactions than initially 
contemplated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is little risk of substantially lessening or preventing 
competition by increasing the size of parties and their 
affiliates' thresholds because, one, the director has the ability 
to challenge a merger up to three years after its completion. 
Two, this fact clearly leaves merging parties, where there is any 
material overlap between their operations, to submit a 
significant amount of information to the bureau in support for a 
request for some type of comfort that their transactions will not 
be challenged subsequent to closing by the director.  Finally, in 
any event, only a handful of mergers each year raises serious 
competition issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to raising the thresholds, we are looking also at 
the possibility of reducing the burden of information that the 
bureau requests for pre-merger notification.  The amount of time 
and effort it takes for a member of the private sector to prepare 
the pre-merger notification is not justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the bureau receives information not pertinent to 
mergers and that the filing of this information is time consuming 
for the companies giving notice.  We suggest that this burden 
could be reduced by streamlining the amount of information 
required to be filed.  This streamlining is likely to be 
accomplished through the joint operation of the proposed 
amendments of the act, which would transfer the information 
required currently in sections 121 and 122 of the act to the 
notifiable transactions regulation and the proposed revisions to 
the regulations.  However, those revisions will substantially 
increase the amount of information required for long form filing 
imposing a substantial burden on merging parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 31 of Bill C-20 still allows parties to have a choice 
between filing either a short or long term form.  The 
commissioner, formerly the Director of Investigations and 
Research, would have the discretion to require a long form filing 
if the short form filing is considered to be insufficient.  The 
information that is required for these filings would be set out 
in the regulations rather than the act, as is currently the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the information requirements being moved from 
legislation, which would receive full public review before 
amendment and being transferred to regulations, there are many 
parties concerned that the final wording will be decided by the 
commissioner alone.  We have some serious concerns that we will 
present in the committee stage as amendments to Bill C-20 as we 
see fit and what has been suggested to us by those outside the 
Department of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody is concerned about deceptive telemarketing practices. 
We recognize that telemarketing is now a $500 billion business in 
Canada and in the U.S. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT68"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT68"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1635

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, total telemarketing sales in Canada and the 
U.S. have exceeded $500 billion per year.  While most 
telemarketing activities are legitimate, unfortunately some are 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of the Canada-U.S. working group on telemarketing 
fraud highlights that telemarketing has become one of the most 
pervasive and problematic forms of white collar crime in Canada 
and the U.S.  It is estimated that this form of crime accounts 
for as much as 10% of the total volume of telemarketing.  In 
Canada that would mean $4 billion annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that telemarketing has seen an increase in 
deceptive marketing practices.  However, it must also be 
recognized that telemarketing has its place in today's 
competitive marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some specific concerns that members of the marketplace 
have expressed regarding the wording proposed to define what 
telemarketing is.  Subsection 52.1(1) defines telemarketing as a 
practice of using interactive telephone communications for the 
purpose of promoting a product or any business interest.  This 
definition requires either a greater clarification or the 
addition of exceptions to ensure that the provision is not 
amenable to an overly broad application to entities whose 
services are not meant to be targeted by the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We suggest that it be made clear in the legislation that the 
provisions be confined to live voice communications.  We would 
like to see the words “live voice” placed before the words 
“interactive telephone communications” in the wording of 
section 52.1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other changes to the current act will require the disclosure of 
certain matters either at the outset of the telephone 
communications or in a fair, reasonable and timely manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The item which many want to see expressed outright in the 
telephone interaction include the identity of the person on 
behalf of whom the communication is made, the nature of the 
product or businesses being promoted, the purpose of the 
communication, and in the case of price of the product being 
promoted and any material restrictions or conditions applicable 
to its delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We request that there be a particular exception made with regard 
to instances where the price of the product cannot be determined 
at the time of the telephone call.  For example, in the case of 
mutual funds and other securities whose prices may not be known 
until the end of the day, we ask that the required disclosure be 
made within a reasonable period of time subsequent to the 
determination of the item's price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that telemarketing fraud is a serious crime and 
needs to be identified as such.  We will not stand by and allow 
there to be $4 billion in losses a year in Canada because of this 
type of behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the competition bureau tells us that it intends to seek 
permission to use wiretapping in cases of egregious behaviour. 
There is some uncertainty as to how this wiretapping will be 
used.  This is an extremely sensitive area for the business 
community and yet it has been given no discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal in Bill C-20 which deals specifically with 
permitting judicially authorized interception or wiretapping 
concerns many individuals, corporations and members of the retail 
and commerce groups across the country.  This segment of Bill 
C-20 was never brought before the consultative panel, was never 
reviewed in discussion papers or made its way into any panel 
report.  The government has decided to slip in this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does it exist in Bill C-20?  The proposal in Bill C-20 will 
amend section 183 of the Criminal Code to allow wiretapping 
without consent of private communications in connection with 
investigations under the conspiracy, bid rigging and deceptive 
telemarketing offences of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conspiracy provisions in section 45 of the Competition Act 
set out two points that must be proven to convict of conspiracy. 
First, there must be an agreement and, second, the agreement must 
be anti-competitive.  Wiretapping only proves the first point of 
the two necessary to convict under the Competition Act.  However, 
in most cases this point is not the one that makes or breaks a 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What must be proven for a conviction in most cases is the second 
point and this is not provable with a wiretap. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most cases are lost solely on the point of trying to prove that 
the agreement was anti-competitive.  Given the broad definition 
of telemarketing that currently exists, we are concerned that 
wiretapping powers could be used in a wide range of situations 
that most Canadians would not consider to be justifiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to clarify what situations will warrant wiretapping. 
There must be stringent administrative filters and strict legal 
procedures that will limit usage to what is only absolutely and 
undeniably necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not feel a need to push this provision through at this 
time and would like to have a further round of consultation on 
this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the Competition Act are long overdue.  I look 
forward to reviewing Bill C-20 in committee and working with 
other members of this House to come up with a bill that is 
practical, understandable, equitable and fair to all, a bill that 
does not give unnecessary and overly evasive powers to the 
government where private ventures are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competitiveness is essential to a successful Canadian 
marketplace and the Competition Act has served all Canadians well 
for decades.  Now we must work to keep it moderate and 
functional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before I 
call for resuming debate, it is my duty pursuant to Standing 
Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Davenport, Alternative Fuels Act; the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup-Témiscouata-Les Basques, Employment 
Insurance; the hon. member for Bras D'Or, Cape Breton Development 
Corporation; and the hon. member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, 
Trans-Canada Highway. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today the House is considering amendments to one of Canada's most 
important pieces of framework economic legislation, the 
Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Act provides basic principles for the conduct of 
business in Canada.  It is, therefore, vital to the functioning 
of our economy and in some way, directly or indirectly, touches 
the life of virtually every Canadian every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major purposes of the act is to promote competition 
and efficiency in the Canadian marketplace.  This, in turn, leads 
directly to innovation, a wide variety of consumer choices that 
are quality goods and services, competitive prices and greater 
international competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Act was last revised in a significant way in 
1986.  Clearly, Canada's Competition Act must be kept up to date 
and remain suitable to economic reality in the 21st century. That 
is why we are considering the amendments that are before us 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are a carefully crafted series of measures that reflect the 
views of a very wide spectrum of stakeholders who expressed their 
opinions over the course of extensive consultations.  The bill 
includes provisions that would create a strict liability criminal 
offence to deal with deceptive telemarketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would allow the law enforcement officials in certain 
circumstances, and after the authorization by a judge, to 
intercept private communications without consent to fight 
deceptive telemarketing, as well as conspiracy and bid rigging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would provide for the quicker and more effective resolution 
of instances of misleading advertising and deceptive marketing 
practices and revise the law regarding regular price claims by 
retailers.  It would improve the prenotification process for 
major transactions and the mergers review process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it would revise and increase the flexibility of the 
prohibition order provision to make it a more effective tool for 
promoting compliance with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telemarketing predators put this entire industry at risk when 
they cheat Canadians out of sums of money that law enforcement 
officials estimate to be a minimum of $76 million in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments will create a new criminal offence of deceptive 
telemarketing which will carry criminal penalties for those who 
break the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new law will also require that telemarketers provide 
consumers with information on the purpose of the call, the 
product being promoted and any material, conditions or strings 
attached to such products.  Amendments to the Competition Act 
will also address misleading advertising and deceptive marketing 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware that advertising is one of the most important 
and universal tools for business success.  Fairness and 
truthfulness in advertising by all players is essential for a 
healthy, vigorous marketplace. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach of the current Competition Act is too cumbersome 
and inflexible.  Moreover, experience has shown that criminal 
sanctions, the only remedy available in relation to these 
offences under the act now, do not always respond well to the 
problem.  What is needed is a range of responses that can be 
applied to fit the nature and severity of the deceptive practices 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Better tools could stop misleading advertising quickly before 
there is an adverse reaction in the marketplace.  More flexible 
tools would also have greater scope to foster business compliance 
and voluntary resolution of problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill retains criminal provisions for flagrant cases of 
deceptive marketing practices.  It also introduces a range of 
civil remedies that can be applied promptly so the alleged 
misleading advertising does not continue while lengthy criminal 
prosecution winds its way through the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts and the competition tribunal will be able to issue 
orders requiring parties to stop misleading advertising. 
Advertisers who fail to exercise due care may be required to 
publish information notices to alert the affected public of the 
nature of the deception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments will also facilitate voluntary measures to 
correct the deception that has occurred and provisions will allow 
such a resolution to become registered and enforceable as a court 
or competition tribunal order.  The area of regular price claims 
is another where the present act needs updating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The retail industry has changed dramatically in recent years. 
Comparative price advertising is more than ever a critical means 
by which retail competes.  Moreover, consumer purchasing patterns 
are closely linked to sales advertising.  Both consumers and 
retailers have commented that the current law does not reflect 
the current marketplace reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provisions in the new bill will clarify a critical area of 
advertising law for business and provide clearer guidance for 
consumers about the meaning of price comparisons.  Two 
straightforward tests will provide simple criteria for defining a 
genuine regular price.  One test will be based on sales volume 
and the other pricing over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of these and other changes to the Competition Act 
the changes before us take into account business realities, 
shifting consumer behaviour and attitudes and the marketplace 
developments that affect law enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that these are worthy of the support of all 
members of the House.  The discussions that will be coming up in 
committee will be very interesting as we all have additional 
information that we can add to and improve on the legislation now 
before the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the hon. parliamentary secretary for his comments and 
also his party for bringing this bill forward.  I am wondering 
whether the hon. parliamentary secretary could talk to us a bit 
about what he sees in this bill that would actually come to grips 
with the question of competition and the misleading advertising 
or fraudulent pressure should e-commerce become an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electronic commerce, as the hon. member I am sure recognizes, is 
a growing field.  More and more merchandise, services and 
products are being offered via electronic commerce.  The transfer 
of funds, the incurring of loans and the making of deposits and 
things of this sort are all part of the various agencies that are 
covered under the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if he could address this part of the bill because 
my reading of the bill would suggest that perhaps this is not 
covered in the bill.  Does he have some opinions about the 
fraudulent or competitive abuse of electronic commerce? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the 
hon. member on his remarks earlier.  I know that his items will 
be considered within the industry committee and I am sure will 
have some discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member brings up a very good point on e-commerce. This 
is still a developing area, an area on the global scene, and 
there is more and more discussion going on.  I believe there will 
be a stage when we get more global understanding of what 
e-commerce is, how it is going to operate, how it is not going to 
operate and the basic rules of e-commerce which need to be 
established on the global scene.  Those items will then have to 
be rolled into the Competition Act as we move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other items in the Competition Act which will make it 
very important for us to consider, the telemarketing of today and 
the telemarketing of tomorrow, as the member opposite has brought 
forward through the e-commerce.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that those items be considered in committee in 
order to detail how these things are going to happen in the 
future.  I thank the member for his remarks.  I know he is 
looking down the road at additional things in terms of how the 
world will change.  That is the situation we find ourselves in 
with this Competition Act.  We need to bring it up to date.  It 
has been brought forward since 1986.  We need to get the best 
information we can in relation to the Competition Act so we can 
prepare ourselves for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
response.  The hon. parliamentary secretary might go one step 
further and talk about another dimension of electronic commerce, 
the privacy component or the security of information that is 
transferred from one point to another. I am concerned in 
particular with the encryption of information so it cannot be 
side tracked by someone getting into the communication 
inadvertently or by design, actually stealing the information. 
Then there is decryption which allows a person to get into that 
system and make the information sensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member knows that it is the way in which the 
information is coded and then decoded, which is really what we we 
are talking about here, that is fundamental to this whole 
business.  Perhaps he could answer that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member brings up some 
very good questions.  He is basically talking about a code of 
conduct that we need to put in place and about how e-commerce is 
to operate around the world.  More work needs to be done in that 
area.  I do not have all the details that he would like at this 
time but I am sure those are the types of questions that will be 
referred to during the industry committee's deliberations.  I am 
sure these deliberations will take some additional time because 
of the complexity of this type of legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going 
to use my time to point out that the Standing Committee on Industry 
will have its work cut out for it.  As I see it, there are really 
two different things involved.  On the one hand, there are the 
provisions on deceptive telemarketing, where consensus will rapidly 
be reached on all the provisions. On the other hand, there are the 
remaining amendments to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting immediately, I think the committee will have to take 
the time required, since it took all these years to come up with 
proposals that would eventually take the form of a bill. The 
advisory committee's report leaves many questions unanswered. 
I asked some, as did others, and according to the people who were 
consulted, this bill does not enjoy unanimous support, far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once it is amended, this Competition Act will have to reassure 
Canadians and Quebeckers.  We are going through a period of 
transformation somewhat like the industrial revolution at the end 
of the 19th century.  We therefore cannot do without a strong 
instrument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask the parliamentary secretary, who has always 
been very open-minded, whether he is aware that there are actually 
two kinds of proposals going to committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
her remarks.  It is a major piece of legislation. Many 
stakeholders and groups were involved in the preliminary work. 
The Competition Act and the changing world around us are part of 
what the committee will have consider in depth.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have three pages of people who have provided input.  Some of 
the provinces have participated and some have not.  Some 
departments in the provinces have participated.  I believe very 
strongly that the legislation before the House today, the 
Competition Act, will require an in-depth study by the Industry 
Canada committee.  It is something that touches everybody in 
Canada in one way or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to take our time as we go through the industry 
committee to make sure we have heard from Canadians from all 
provinces and territories to understand how lives will be 
affected and how lives will be protected at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is $4 billion or $5 billion made from telemarketing 
fraud, the numbers are very high.  People have lost their 
complete life earnings as a result of telemarketing fraud people 
who do not care at all and want to get as much as they can. We as 
a committee have to make sure we have laws in place to stop it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Canada-US working group has spent a lot of time on it.  There 
are a number of items in the Canada-US working group that both 
countries need to address.  This legislation is trying to address 
our portion of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other areas that need to be looked at.  As previous 
speakers said, there is a lot of work to be done to try to make 
the legislation we have reflect the changing world around us 
today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am happy to rise today to join the debate on Bill 
C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members will know, this is a bill which seeks to modernize 
the Competition Act to respond to a changing business environment 
by increasing flexibility in the administration of the act and 
efficiency in its enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus my speech today on what New Democrats see 
as the two main parts of Bill C-20.  The first part of my speech 
will deal with the aspects of Bill C-20 which are aimed at 
getting tough on telemarketing fraud.  New Democrats support this 
part of Bill C-20 without any reservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second part of my speech I will talk about Bill C-20 as 
it changes the administration of the merger notification process. 
This is where New Democrats have reservations with Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by talking about the serious problems of 
telemarketing fraud in Canada.  We know that it is a $4 billion 
industry in Canada and it is growing.  We know that after being 
chased out of the U.S. by aggressive law enforcement efforts, the 
scam artists started moving north to Canada.  Offering prizes, 
cheques, trips and more, these silver tongued artists have 
targeted Canada in their latest wave of greed.  Victims are 
usually people in a vulnerable position, most often seniors and 
even sometimes people suffering from Alzheimer's disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that I will be sharing my time with my colleague 
from Colchester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we should all applaud and encourage the efforts of our 
police to catch and prosecute these offenders, I believe it is 
important that we also try to make members of our communities 
aware. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may have been a victim if I had not caught on. I got a phone 
call at 11 o'clock at night to say I had won a trip to Florida. 
All they needed was my cheque number so they could get some 
money.  During that same week people unfortunately did get caught 
in that scam.  We have to make sure people are phone smart so 
that they are no longer in danger of being victimized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time last year New Democrats launched a public information 
campaign in our ridings to educate the most vulnerable members of 
constituencies about telephone fraud.  New Democrats included in 
their householders a quick reference card entitled be on guard 
which could be hung by the telephone. 
New Democrats also went around to senior residences in our 
ridings and handed these cards out personally.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few minutes ago I said that I would talk more about the 
efforts of the police in tackling this awful crime.  I want to 
single out a certain OPP force which is dealing specifically with 
the crime of telemarketing fraud.  It is called Operation 
Phonebusters and is a joint OPP-RCMP clearing house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several New Democrats have had the opportunity to work with Mr. 
Bob Elliot, the OPP officer heading up this effort called 
Operation Phonebusters.  I want to express to the House the 
tremendous job Mr. Elliot is doing, and with limited resources I 
might add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hard work of Mr. Elliot can be seen directly in Bill C-20 
and the changes which will make it easier to prosecute these con 
artists.  I do however feel the need to express to the House and 
all hon. members the concern that Operation Phonebusters has 
become virtually a one person operation.  While its prosecution 
record is impressive, its limited resources means that there is a 
serious delay between the reporting of a crime and the laying of 
charges.  In some cases this allows the offending operation to 
bilk seniors, close its doors and move on before prosecutions can 
be undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the solicitor general to provide the much needed 
policing support by bolstering the federal government's 
commitment to Operation Phonebusters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also encourage the solicitor general to instruct the RCMP to 
take a leadership role in fighting this fraud on a national 
level.  We cannot tackle this problem on a city by city basis 
because these guys will just pick up their shop and move to the 
next city.  With just a handful more full time RCMP officers, we 
can send a clear message to the con artists and those who would 
steal from the innocent, that Canada is not open for that kind of 
business and is working hard to pull the plug on phone fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some urgency in taking a hard line on this type of 
crime.  In fact, it seems kind of silly to me that it has taken 
the government so long to realize that this is a serious crime. 
The problem in my mind has been very serious since the 1980s when 
lower cost telecommunications offered crooks a cheap, effective 
way of picking pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victims with whom I have met in my riding are truly the 
honest and the innocent.  They should be able to answer their 
phones with the confidence of knowing that they are protected by 
law, especially since the laws are in place to protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats support any effort which leads to a harder line 
approach against this type of crime.  Canada has been without a 
national strategy to fight telemarketing fraud for too long.  New 
Democrats are willing to work together with the government to 
achieve this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I finish, I want to stress that telemarketing fraud is a 
very important part of the bill.  It is a serious problem.  I 
think we all know somebody who has either been or almost been a 
victim.  We can also relate that to where one lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when I was a seasonal worker I was told I had won a 
trip to Florida and thought is was great.  They target areas 
where people are vulnerable and will go for it. It is very easy 
for some people to get access to phone numbers, even private 
phone numbers.  It is scary how easily some groups access such 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be 
able to join in this second reading debate on what I think is 
very important legislation.  I heard the parliamentary secretary 
indicate that the government is very anxious to hear all ideas on 
the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that I very much support the legislation.  It is very 
timely and indeed overdue.  It addresses a serious problem that 
affects some of the most vulnerable in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I particularly like the provision in the bill that blends 
criminal penalty with civil penalty. 
One of the problems with the existing Competition Act is that too 
much of it is done through the Criminal Code, a pretty heavy 
instrument to use on what can be in some instances relatively 
minor infractions in the area of misleading advertising.  In the 
case of telemarketing it would be the same. We need to have a 
blend of penalties. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I have significant reservations about one area of the 
bill. The bill, while very well intentioned, will miss the mark 
when it comes to applying the provisions for improper 
telemarketing against organizations which wish deliberately to 
carry on deceptive practices and wish to evade the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There exists in the legislation an ideal way for organizations 
to evade the intent of this law.  I refer to clause 12 of Bill 
C-20 which will amend section 52.1 of the original Competition 
Act.  This is basically the clause which applies the bill to the 
various entities that may be affected by it.  The clause states 
that no person shall, for the purpose of promoting, directly or 
indirectly, the supply or use of a product, or for the purpose of 
promoting, directly or indirectly, any business interest by any 
means whatsoever, knowingly or recklessly make a representation 
to the public which is false or misleading in a material respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that there are two problems with that clause.  First, 
it refers to the supply or use of a product.  What happens if 
there is no product involved and what in fact is being 
telemarketed is a campaign?  What if it is fund raising for a 
non-profit organization? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we go on a little further and it states for the purpose of 
promoting, directly or indirectly, any business interest. 
Unfortunately a non-profit organization or a charity, either of 
those two separate entities, by definition are not engaged in a 
business interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sorry to 
interrupt the hon. member, but we are now in the time allotted 
for questions and comments.  Are you speaking on debate, sir? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Excuse me, Madam Speaker.  I had 
presumed I was speaking on debate.  I did not know we were on 
questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Are there any 
questions or comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There being no questions or comments I will recognize the hon. 
member for Palliser on debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
happy to rise today to join the debate on Bill C-20.  I was 
waiting for the previous speaker to get to his question, but I 
guess we will hear it later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill seeks to modernize the Competition Act to respond to a 
changing business environment.  It seeks to accomplish that by 
increasing the flexibility in the administration of the act and 
by improving the efficiency of enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac spoke about the 
telemarketing aspects of the bill.  That is a section of the bill 
which we in this caucus strongly support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus my remarks on the administrative changes in the 
merger notification process about which we in the NDP have 
reservations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, before I do that, since it has been raised by the hon. 
member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar and the hon. member for 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, I want to talk about the be on guard 
telephone security tips which were sent out last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the kind of television audience we often get it is 
worth running through the list.  I believe every member of the 
House would want to ensure that citizens, particularly senior 
citizens, do not get caught up in some of the scams out and about 
these days on the telephone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge a resident of Regina, a gentleman named Al Knox, 
who spoke to me about this matter last fall.  His story was that 
he was at the post office one day when an elderly woman came in 
and wanted to send a money order for $2,000 to a company in 
Montreal.  She had just won a prize and she had to send the money 
in order to collect it.  He was there as a customer of the post 
office.  Another customer and the postal agent who was also there 
tried to talk this woman out of buying the money order and 
forwarding it, all to no avail.  She was so convinced she had won 
the prize that nothing or no one was going to be able to put a 
stop to her desire to get that prize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of dos and don'ts.  I will read them into the 
record because they would be useful for people who may be 
listening: don't believe that everyone calling with an exciting 
promotion or investment opportunity it trustworthy; don't be 
fooled by a promise of a valuable prize in return for a low cost 
purchase; don't disclose information about your bank account or 
credit card, not even a credit card expiry date; don't be 
pressured to send money to take advantage of a deal; don't be 
afraid to hang up, a very important one; don't purchase or invest 
without carefully checking the product, the investment and the 
company; and don't be afraid to demand more information from the 
caller. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I will refer to a couple of dos:  do demand the name and 
the phone number of the caller; do contact your local fraud squad 
if you believe that is what the call is all about; and remember, 
perhaps most of all, that if you have really won a prize it 
shouldn't cost you a dime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are important things to remember about this telephone 
scam. I am pleased the government has moved ahead in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the merger notification process.  As I 
indicated it deals with the administration.  This is where we 
have some reservations.  It is our opinion that if the 
notification of merger process is to be changed, it should be 
done so in a way which strengthens the legislation, not weakens 
it, or keeps it at the status quo level. The changes we see to 
this notification of merger process in Bill C-20 are simply 
cosmetic changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the few moments available to me to lay out 
some of our concerns. In the implementation area the changes in 
Bill C-20 are not necessarily the problem.  Rather the problem is 
implementing what the bill seeks to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rarely has a merger ever been sent to the review tribunal and 
actually been reviewed extensively.  We all know what happens 
normally.  The head of the tribunal, who after Bill C-24 passes 
will be known as the commissioner, has the two parties join 
together and tells them what needs to be done in order to make 
the merger a successful one.  This is ridiculous and will 
certainly not work.  The provisions of Bill C-20 in my mind will 
never really be enforced when they certainly need to be and 
should be enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the sanctions, failure to give proper notification in 
the past has left the government with the option to pursue 
criminal charges against the parties involved.  Under the 
provisions of Bill C-20, the bill before us this afternoon, the 
criminal sanction elements of the previous bill are being dropped 
and being replaced with a fine which has a maximum of $50,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the great scheme of things with megamergers of banks and 
insurance companies, $50,000 is simply peanuts and will not act 
as a deterrent in any way, shape, or form.  We think of the Bank 
of Montreal and the Royal Bank merger talks.  A total of four 
insurance companies are now involved.  Two are merging and 
another two are proposing to merge.  We are talking multibillion 
dollars and $50,000, as I indicated, is peanuts for them to pay 
any kind of a deterrent fee if they wish to go ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the job front, this is perhaps the most important element of 
our concerns.  There is nothing in the bill that deals with job 
losses as a result of a merger.  There is absolutely nothing by 
way of offering to protect the workers from job losses in huge 
takeovers and megamergers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from newspaper and media reports that as a result of the 
proposed Royal Bank-Bank of Montreal merger that roughly 10,000 
Canadians will experience job losses.  It is noteworthy that CEOs 
of these banks, Mr. Matthew Barrett and John Cleghorn, have 
refused to commit that the workers in their two respective banks 
will not have to bite the bullet as a result of this merger 
proposal, which in all probability as the member for 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar said earlier, will go ahead earlier 
this year despite the fact that Canadians are very much opposed 
to the two banks merging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-20 the government had the opportunity to and should 
have instructed the commissioner of notification of merger 
process to take into account the significant number of job losses 
when considering any merger.  We believe that Bill C-20 fails to 
order the commissioner to consider the public interest in 
megamergers and New Democrats believe that the public interest 
must prevail over megamania. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats do not see these megamergers as good for Canada's 
community of workers.  In our opinion, Bill C-20 does not make 
the merger notification process any stronger.  That is why the 
New Democrats oppose this portion of the bill.  We will have to 
decide whether the government will break up this bill and allow 
it to be looked at in its various entities, otherwise it will be 
a dilemma for many of us as to whether to support or oppose it. 
We certainly support the attempts to reduce telephone scams, but 
on the merger aspect of it we have major reservations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by the NDP member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues have already mentioned, the Reform Party always 
supports vigorous measures to ensure the successful operation of 
the marketplace such as promoting competition or competitive 
pricing, strengthening vigorously and enforcing competition in 
the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to throw some light on the duopoly and 
monopoly situation in certain areas in the market.  He said he 
likes to support the bill, as I am doing.  I would like him to 
comment on certain monopolistic and duplistic situations in the 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would be happy to but 
I would like to ask the previous speaker if there were some areas 
that he was particularly interested in. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I appear to have wound up dividing my time quite 
inadvertently but nevertheless as I said earlier I am very happy 
to be a part of this debate because it is an opportunity to offer 
some constructive criticisms and comments on this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is deficient because of a deficiency that already 
existed in the Competition Act.  This act describes the person 
who is affected and constrained by this legislation as a person 
having a business interest.  It also restricts the scope of the 
activity to the production or the promoting of a product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with this is it lets fall through the net entirely 
any organization that is a not for profit organization which 
could be on the one hand a not for profit organization registered 
as a non profit organization under corporate Canada legislation 
or as a charity registered under the Revenue Canada definitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both these instances, both types of not for profit 
organizations by definition are not engaged in business 
interests.  If a telemarketer that is deliberately engaged in 
scamming or wishes to promote in a way that circumvents the 
spirit of this act, that organization can simply reconstitute 
itself as a not for profit organization. 
It can either seek charitable status or, on the other hand, it 
can be a registered non-profit organization.  That organization 
or telemarketer would then fall completely outside this 
legislation. It could engage in any kind of practice it pleased.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect of the problem is that telemarketing is very 
much a transborder phenomenon these days.  What is happening is 
that when you receive that phone call, often from a charity I 
might say, often from organizations that are soliciting funds, 
that phone call may in fact be emanating from the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, some of the very large telemarketers are based in either 
Pennsylvania or Maryland and are using transborder trunk lines 
to telemarket anywhere in Ontario or in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the other side of it is that while we have to be 
worried about organizations that will deliberately evade the law 
by becoming non-profit organizations, we also have to be very 
concerned about charitable organizations that may be engaged in 
what are very unethical activities, at least in the context of a 
for-profit industry when they are engaged in raising funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may say that if it is a charitable organization surely it 
would not be engaged in any form of misrepresentation, be it 
misrepresentation by advertising or telemarketing or whatever you 
may have.  The Internet provides us with all kinds of wonderful 
information.  I was surfing the net, as they say, and I came 
across an article from the Professional Marketing Research 
Society which did a study of a practice engaged in by charities 
called frugging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently frugging involves charities that deliberately through 
telemarketing phone up and say they are doing a survey on perhaps 
social welfare, or tastes in tea, whatever it is.  Or they might 
be doing a survey asking if there should be homes for battered 
women and this kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article from the Professional Marketing Research Society 
pointed out that often the surveys are really false surveys which 
are not a very transparent attempt to draw the client, the donor, 
the victim or the target into a survey which is really just a way 
of raising funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two organizations are cited in the article as being engaged in 
the false survey activity.  It is misleading.  It is 
misrepresentation and there is no getting around it.  One was the 
Coalition for Gun Control which did all kinds of surveys trying 
to get people to say they did not like firearms and that kind of 
thing.  But really it was actually a way of promoting support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another organization cited by the report as being engaged in 
questionable survey practices, which was really another way of 
fund raising or getting the message out there, was the National 
Anti-Poverty Organization.  It was asking all sorts of questions 
and said if the recipient responded to the survey a letter would 
be sent to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Behind many of these false surveys is simply misrepresentation 
for the purposes of fundraising.  That is the kind of thing that 
goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to telemarketing, charities are not very clean in 
some respects.  Telemarketing is a very popular feature with 
charities now.  A lot of organizations are turning to 
telemarketers.  I think everyone in this House, and everyone in 
Canada, has received phone calls from people soliciting their 
donations by telephone.  That would be all right so long as the 
representations are indeed honest.  What is said by the 
telemarketer is not honest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer you to a program that was done by CBC's 
<I>Marketplace</I> about a year and a half ago, I think it was, in 
which the theme was telemarketing.  The thrust of the 
<I>Marketplace</I> show was to demonstrate that many of these 
charitable organizations that use telemarketers where so much of 
the donated money goes to paying the for-profit telemarketer that 
very little actually goes to the charitable activity.  It may be 
as little as 10% and often in the outset of a telemarketing 
campaign it is 0%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, the reporter interviewed the president of the 
Canadian Haemophilia Society.  Her name is Durhane Wong-Reiger 
The reporter challenged her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The telemarketer in setting up the Canadian Haemophilia Society 
said that he was proud to say that by putting your gift on a 
credit card—this is what the telemarketer says—over 87% of your 
donation would go directly to the Haemophilia Society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the Haemophilia Society did not even reply to 
the reporter's question.  She could not reply.  Very obviously, 
87% of the donated dollar is not going to the charitable 
activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we have a case where there is an absolute 
misrepresentation by a telemarketer speaking on behalf of a 
charity.  The problem is, as Bill C-20 sits now, because it does 
not cover charities or non-profit organizations, the Canadian 
Haemophilia Society will have been seen to have done no wrong., 
There is nothing to be done about it. Imagine.  It is a blank 
cheque to every non-profit organization, be they charity or 
not for profit organization, to engage in telemarketing 
practices, to misrepresent or mislead as much as they please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telemarketing does not work in isolation.  This is another flaw 
with the bill.  Telemarketing usually works in co-operation and 
in tandem with a direct mail campaign. In fact, what we are 
talking about here is not just telemarketing at all, but direct 
marketing.  It is the whole business of sending flyers through 
the mail and that kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People will find that wherever there is a telemarketing campaign 
or a media campaign, a fundraising letter will come through the 
mail as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is a deficiency of the bill because in fact, as the 
Competition Act stands now and with Bill C-20, it does nothing 
whatsoever about misrepresentation through direct mail 
advertising if it is a charity or a non-profit organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a great example.  As members in this House will remember 
recently, there was a hubbub in the press about the seal hunt. It 
was the International Fund for Animal Welfare that had conducted 
a major campaign under another title to claim that seals were 
being wantonly slaughtered on the ice floes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think every one of us received form letters cut out of the 
newspapers from our constituents.  They were to protest the seal 
hunt to their MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite apart from that, much of the literature produced on the 
seal hunt by the International Fund for Animal Welfare was false. 
What was going on simultaneously with this campaign was another 
campaign called Pet Rescue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some documents here.  I cannot show the actual pictures 
here but Pet Rescue was a direct mail campaign actually launched 
out of the United States.  This is coming from the United States, 
as most telemarketing does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pet Rescue was about how all these animals were being tortured 
and being kept in facilities that were really awful and that kind 
of thing.  There are pictures of poor cats that were in 
difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see a title here “Your support saves lives”.  This is 
really a fundraising promotion by the International Fund for 
Animal Welfare at the same time as the seal hunt protest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what we have.  This promotion literature says “Here is 
how you can help stop the cruelty:  `Seventy-nine cents of every 
dollar spent went toward animal welfare during our 1996 fiscal 
year, so you know your contributions are helping to stop 
suffering.  The International Fund for Animal Welfare—”'. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that this is absolute misrepresentation and that, if 
the International Fund for Animal Welfare was indeed a for profit 
company, if it was indeed engaging in a business interest, if 
indeed it was doing something other than fundraising, it would be 
subject to penalty under the law and rightly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My feeling with respect to Bill C-20 is that it is a step in the 
right direction, even though that step is incomplete.  We have to 
recognize that with telemarketing spreading across the country 
and direct mail becoming increasingly an avenue of fundraising, 
telemarketing and direct mail advertising is a costly way of 
fundraising. 
Seventy per cent to eighty per cent of the actual dollar goes to 
the cost of telemarketing and direct mail solicitations, much of 
which come from the United States.  This bill can do nothing even 
if it is a for profit direct mail advertiser or telemarketer 
operating out of the United States.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government and the committee will very carefully 
consider taking the opportunity Bill C-20 gives us to widen the 
catch of the Competition Act so it includes not for profit 
organizations as well as for profit organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two suggestions.  In clause 52(1) we could insert the 
words “or fundraising and any fundraising activity” after the 
words “any business interest”.  Second, we should make 
charitable and not for profit organizations responsible for the 
activities of the telemarketers they hire.  At present, if a 
charity hires a for profit telemarketer and the telemarketer 
misrepresents the charity, under Bill C-20 only the telemarketer 
can be caught.  I believe that if it is the intent knowingly and 
recklessly of a charity or a not for profit organization to use a 
telemarketer or a direct mail advertiser to misrepresent that 
charity to the public then the charity itself or the not for 
profit organization should be subject to the same penalties under 
the law.  I hope the committee will consider these thoughts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the point of view of the member from the 
government side.  I am prepared to support Bill C-20 as long as 
this act achieves its intended objectives to modernize and amend 
the Competition Act and to make consequential and related changes 
in other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two brief questions for the member.  One is about 
telemarketing.  We know that Air Canada is tripling its call 
centres in Canada, in particular in Winnipeg.  It is tripling its 
staff in the Winnipeg call centre.  Banks, credit unions and 
other financial unions are vigorously promoting and pursuing the 
operation of call centres across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some businesses operate by selling lottery tickets to senior 
citizens normally in Canada and abroad, Lotto 649 and so on. From 
time to time they sell emotions to seniors.  It is gambling sold 
over the telephone.  Can the member tell the House if this bill will 
restrict selling gambling or pressure selling over the telephone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all receive a certain type of unsolicited mail which we 
define as junk mail.  We sometimes receive car keys with the 
message that we have won an automobile.  Sometimes we see nicely 
printed certificates that indicate we have won millions of 
dollars.  People usually perceive these as scams.  Can the member 
tell the House if these things are being taken care of in this bill?  As 
a member of the government side could he throw some light on 
that?  Can we restrict these types of scams? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not a lawyer but my 
interpretation of the bill is that it aims at transparency.  If 
the telemarketer or the direct mail campaign tells the truth then 
it is up to the person who receives the solicitation to make a 
decision.  The bill is aimed at misrepresentation. My problem is 
that if that misrepresentation is for a product or for business 
interests then all the penalties of the bill apply. It is the 
law.  You could go to jail under this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that if a charity or a not for profit 
organization like the Canadian Automobile Association does the 
same thing, the bill will not catch it. 
These organizations can misrepresent as much as they like and the 
bill does not catch them.  That is why I think an amendment is in 
order to the bill itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask two brief questions of the 
member.  He talked in glowing terms about his support of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus on two points, the first being the meagre 
enforcement measures which have been dedicated to deceptive 
telephone canvassing in this country.  We have perhaps $4 billion 
or $5 billion worth of crimes being committed with one very small 
unit headquartered in North Bay that is dedicated to dealing with 
this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What steps will the member take with the solicitor general to 
make sure that there is adequate policing resources available to 
deal with this significant crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is there in this bill that would deal with assessing the 
desirability to Canada and Canadians of the mergers between The 
Bay and K-Mart, the Royal Bank of Canada and the Bank of 
Montreal, and the insurance companies of Mutual Life and 
Metropolitan Life?  What is there to suggest in this bill any 
commitment to a competitive market economy in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, on the first point, I do 
not think there is any question that this bill is well aimed at 
the deceptive telemarketers because of its provision for 
wiretapping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems with telemarketing as it exists now is how 
does one get the evidence if one did not receive the phone call. 
I believe this is the reason why the government has put this 
provision in the bill.  It is a very controversial provision and 
I would hope there is considerable debate in committee on it. 
However, at this glance I do support the provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, very clearly the bill is aimed at deceptive 
telemarketing by providing Criminal Code penalties for deceptive 
telemarketers.  Again, not to repeat myself, I just wish the bill 
were designed so that it would catch not for profit organizations 
as well as for profit organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there are difficulties with the mergers of major 
corporations.  It is a heartbreak when a store closes down and 
people are put out of work.  However, it is very dangerous in a 
free enterprise society for a government to intrude with the 
rights of the marketplace to sort out the weak from the strong. 
Usually in a merger environment what is happening is that there 
has been change in public taste and because of that certain 
businesses and industries have weakened.  Insurance and retail 
shopping are two classic cases where there have been major 
changes in public taste and public purchasing.  The ultimate end 
to that is that there is a consolidation of the industry which 
leads to mergers which, I do regret, leads to the loss of jobs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
always enjoy the comments of the hon. member who just spoke.  He 
always provides another perspective and impresses me with the 
research he has done.  He did not disappoint me today either.  It 
was wonderful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to get off the charitable and 
non-charitable organizations and get into another area which is a 
rather significant one.  It has to do with the business of tied 
selling, offering a product or service on the condition that one 
buys another product or service from the same organization.  It 
is one of the ways a business actually forces a customer to do 
something.  While it is not misleading advertising or deceptive 
in some way, it does restrict completely the competition between 
one business and another one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether the hon. member could make a comment about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  I certainly agree, Mr. Speaker, that 
this issue of tied selling is a very difficult one because it 
pertains to the freedom of competition.  I do not have the answer 
and I do not know if this bill really addresses it in any 
satisfactory way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the minister and the department have been looking at the 
issue of tied selling for years.  I wish I could offer the member 
an easy answer as I can with respect to my own hobby horses.  I 
thank him for the question because I believe it is very 
appropriate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question is with regard to the criminal offences that 
have been mentioned in this act.  I would like to know if the act 
amends the Criminal Code to have these criminal offences 
designated under the Criminal Code for the purposes of the 
proceeds of crime legislation.  Can the moneys be recovered under 
the proceeds of crime legislation?   Are there provisions made 
for that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish it were the 
parliamentary secretary on the spot instead of me.  Again the 
hon. member takes me out of my area of expertise.  I would prefer 
to give him a simple answer but he is now looking at the issue of 
the legal impact of the legislation as it sits before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying in a longwinded fashion that I cannot reply to the 
hon. member's question.  What really is key here is that when we 
debate legislation, we can only debate it in principle.  It is 
for the lawyers afterwards and before committee to look at the 
legal nuances. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to say a few words on Bill C-20 before the House this afternoon, 
specifically on the part that deals with the administration of 
mergers and merger notification process.  I do that for only one 
reason.  Very recently back in January we had a blockbuster 
announcement which surprised everybody in this country, namely 
the proposed merger between our largest bank, the Royal Bank, and 
our third largest bank, the Bank of Montreal.  The concern that 
we have seen across the land since then should make us think 
seriously about strengthening the competition policy in this 
country, particularly with the administration of mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to the House that what has been done in Bill C-20 is 
very weak in terms of what it does with merger legislation in 
Canada.  This is one of the few opportunities we have to talk 
about mergers and why we need stronger competition policy in this 
country.  It is important to put that on the record today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case in point is the one everyone hears about on coffee row 
no matter where they are in the country, the two largest banks. 
The banking industry in this country has been very protected over 
the years in terms of content rules.  No individual can own any 
more than 10% of an individual bank.  That rule has been very 
clear.  We have five or six very large banks and there has been a 
policy that large does not buy large or big does not buy bigger. 
Despite the fact that an individual may have a lot of money, he 
or she cannot buy more than 10% of any particular bank.  This of 
course applies to my friend from Palliser or my friends from 
anywhere else.  One cannot buy more than 10% of a bank in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a real surprise.  Our largest bank, the 
Royal Bank of Canada, proposes to merge with the Bank of 
Montreal.  The two of them have stock market value of around $40 
billion.  The largest merger to date in the history of this 
country is a merger of two companies worth about $14 billion. 
This merger is three times bigger than anything we have ever had 
in the history of this country.  It is a very large proposition 
in terms of merging.  The assets of the two banks are worth about 
$453 billion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four hundred and fifty-three billion dollars is a lot of 
money.  It is a major proposal between two large banking 
institutions in this country that would lead to the creation of a 
mega-bank. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet in this country we do not have competition policy that is 
strong enough to adequately, in my opinion, look at a proposition 
of this sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks announced this very quickly.  They took the Minister 
of Finance off guard.  Since the announcement of the merger we 
have had skyrocketing in the share value of not just these two 
banks but the other banks as well. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many ways the banks are saying to the Minister of Finance 
“We dare you to say no.  We dare you to stop this merger”. 
They are saying to the competition bureau “We dare you to stop 
this merger”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless we have stronger legislation or political will in this 
country, a domino effect will occur very shortly, by the fall of 
this year.  Not only will there be the merger of these two banks 
to create a large mega bank, there will be other mergers as well 
which will lead to the great consolidation of banking in our 
country.  If that happens there will be a couple of large 
Canadian banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These banks want to merge because they want to have access to 
foreign markets.  Mr. Cleghorn and Mr. Barrett have made that 
very clear.  Mr. Cleghorn is the president of the Royal Bank of 
Canada and Mr. Barrett is the president of the Bank of Montreal. 
They have made it very clear they want to be large on the world 
scene so they can compete in Europe, in Asia and in third world 
countries. If they have access to markets in other countries, 
then of course as a quid pro quo banks in other countries will 
want to have access to the Canadian market. Today they do not 
have that access.  If our banks are to have that access, then of 
course the argument goes that our doors will be open for their 
banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden we will lose control of the financial industry 
in this country. If that happens there will be immediate pressure 
to get rid of the 10% rule.  If the 10% rule is gone, we will see 
the buying of Canadian banks by foreign banks and there may be no 
Canadian owned banks left. That is why this is such a vitally 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we flag this issue in the debate on the 
competition policy bill before us today in terms of mergers and 
acquisitions.  We can change forever the direction of the 
country, the financial independence of the country, the autonomy 
and the sovereignty of our great country of Canada.  I am sure 
members would agree with me that it is a very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only the sovereignty, the integrity and the 
independence of our country which concerns me.  I am also 
concerned about service to ordinary Canadians. If we look around 
the country we will find that there are a lot of bank branches. 
In fact these two banks themselves have about 2,800 branches 
stretching across Canada.  In a consolidation of this sort it is 
almost certain that a large percentage of those branches will 
disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the day in January on which the merger was announced I 
was in the small town of Outlook, Saskatchewan.  Besides the 
credit union there are two banks. They are both on Main Street. 
One is the Royal Bank and the other is the Bank of Montreal.  I 
could imagine the tellers in those banks looking across the 
street and wondering “Do you go or do we go?”  Which one will 
go?  There will be a consolidation and some branches will 
disappear.  Many Canadians will no longer receive the service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not just thinking of the rural people in small towns such 
as Outlook or Esterhazy, Saskatchewan, or indeed any town across 
the country; I am thinking about the metropolitan areas as well, 
the large urban centres.  A lot of neighbourhoods will not have 
bank branches.  Bank branches will be closed down in the inner 
cities because it will not be profitable to have all of these 
branches once there is a large, centralized mega bank in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a competition point of view it is important that we look at 
strengthening the merger legislation in terms of service to 
ordinary Canadians.  It is a great concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have is the loss of jobs due to the merger. 
Some 92,000 people work for these two banks.  Mr. Barrett and Mr. 
Cleghorn would have us believe that there will not be a loss of 
jobs, that jobs will be maintained.  They have told us not to 
worry about the jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look around the world where banks have merged.  Look in this 
country where banks have taken over trust companies and other 
financial institutions.  What has happened?  Around 20% to 30% of 
the jobs disappear.  People are laid off.  The same thing will 
happen with the merger of the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank 
of Canada if it is allowed to go ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not only concerned about the ordinary workers in the banks. 
These two banks have head offices.  What will happen to the jobs 
in the head offices when they consolidate?  What will happen to 
the jobs of the people who run the technological systems and the 
information services as those two banks consolidate into one 
large corporation?

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is another argument why we need a strong competition 
policy.  It is so when people are concerned about an issue like 
this one have recourse in terms of going to the competition 
bureau.  We can do that today.  I hope there are people who will 
take the initiative to go to the competition bureau and demand an 
investigation.  I hope that happens.  Even more importantly, what 
this country needs is some very strong legislation to make sure 
that does occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, it is a question of jobs.  It is a question of 
service to rural communities.  It is also a question of the kind 
of financial future we want in terms of our financial 
institutions. If this occurs, we are opening a whole new can of 
worms, a whole different future in banking and financial 
institutions in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that these two big banks think they have the Minister 
of Finance on a leash. They have ambushed him.  They believe he 
is going to give in and listen to the big bankers on Bay Street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is saying “Let us wait a while”. There 
is a financial services task force looking at banking in this 
country.  It is headed up by a very fine gentleman from Regina, 
Harold MacKay.  That financial services task force has now been 
under way for quite some time.  It is looking at all these 
important issues.  The task force is going to report sometime in 
the month of September.  After that the Minister of Finance is 
saying that the finance committee will look at the report and 
what is going to happen in the future of banking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. MacKay's task force is not looking at this particular 
merger.  It has no specific mandate whatsoever to look at this 
particular merger.  It is looking at all the other questions in 
terms of the future of financial institutions in Canada. For 
example the task force is looking at the issue of whether or not 
banks should be allowed to get into a full array of financial 
services in this country; whether or not banks can buy up 
insurance companies and sell insurance throughout their branches; 
whether or not banks can get into the auto leasing business. That 
is what the task force is looking at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we need right now a committee consisting of members 
of Parliament from all five parties in this House to look at the 
wisdom of this particular merger.  That is why I am rising at 
this time to say that when we deal with competition policy we 
should be talking about the most important merger proposition in 
the history of this country, one that is so large that all the 
others pale in comparison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks have been lobbying for years to sell insurance.  The 
banks want to sell insurance.  The insurance industry has been 
lobbying against the banks selling insurance.  The Minister of 
Finance was very close to saying yes before the last federal 
campaign but the election was too near.  Finally he said no, the 
banks cannot sell insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks have been lobbying since then.  They have engaged a 
very prominent lobbying firm which is based in Toronto and Ottawa 
to do the blue chip lobbying for them to allow them to go ahead 
and do their mergers, or to sell insurance, or to buy up 
insurance companies and to get into the auto leasing business. 
The more I talk about this, the more important issues there are 
that we have to deal with as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few years the banks have bought up brokerage firms. 
The only brokerage firm now of any size in this country that is 
not owned by a bank is Midland Walwyn.  The rest are all owned by 
the banks.  The Royal Bank has a large brokerage firm.  The Bank 
of Montreal has a large brokerage firm.  They both have trust 
companies.  They are getting bigger and bigger all the time.  Is 
that the right way to go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supposed to represent the people of this country in this 
House.  All of us.  We are all elected as equals to represent the 
people, yet we do not have a parliamentary committee looking at 
the very important issue of the mergers and the future of banking 
and the financial service industry. That is absolutely and 
totally wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should turn this debate into a debate on a big specific 
issue, the merger of banks.  I hope other members will get in 
this debate today and talk about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the Minister of Finance to do a very simple thing.  I 
want him to strike an all party committee that has the power to 
travel this country, to hear witnesses, to hear input from the 
Canadian people about whether or not this merger should go ahead.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening is the majority government across the way is 
being lobbied by blue chip lobbyists who say that the merger 
should go ahead.  They say that the banks should have more and 
more power, the banks should have the right to buy and sell 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact some of the banks are getting into what is called tied 
selling. There was an example of that last week. If you bought 
certain items from the bank or if you wanted a loan or a mortgage 
from the bank it was expected for example that you would shift 
your RRSPs to that financial institution. Those are the kinds of 
things that are happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre has just made a 
comment about how they expect the whole family to be involved. We 
bring our whole family into that bank.  How big do these people 
want to be?  They are like the big sumo wrestlers. They get 
bigger and bigger all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Only sumo wrestlers are prettier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Well, I do not know if sumo wrestlers 
are prettier.  That is in the eye of the beholder I suppose, but 
that is what these banks are like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony of this whole thing is I know how lots of members of 
the Liberal Party feel about this.  They have a caucus committee 
which is looking at the merger.  We in the NDP are doing the same 
thing.  I assume members of other parties are concerned as well. 
Why do we not get together and have a parliamentary committee 
look at it formally?  We could subpoena the banks to come before 
us and give the Canadian people a chance to come here or we could 
go out to the provinces and territories and hear witnesses.  Why 
do we not do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we content as members of Parliament to be controlled by 
the Prime Minister's office all the time?  Why do Liberal members 
not get up on their hind legs and say enough is enough?  Let us 
have a democratic parliamentary institution where we can have a 
parliamentary inquiry into one of the most fundamental issues we 
are facing in this particular Parliament, the future of our 
financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see a Liberal member across the way and I know he agrees.  I 
can hear his head shaking all the way across the floor.  He 
agrees with me.  He thinks there should be a parliamentary 
committee.  I am sure the Reform Party feels the same way. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the Bloc Quebecois also wanted a parliamentary 
inquiry on the future of our country's financial system. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Parliament is not to debate important issues of public 
policy, then why in the devil is Parliament here in the first 
place?  Why are we here if we cannot debate these issues, if we 
cannot have public hearings across the country, if we cannot 
subpoena witnesses and allow the people to speak their minds? 
That is what Parliament should be all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member for Windsor—St. Clair certainly agrees with 
me.  She is rising to her feet.  Now she is smiling.  She wants a 
parliamentary inquiry.  She wants a chance to go after these mega 
banks. She does not agree with these large mega banks, but what 
can she do?  She is muted.  She cannot say a word.  If she wants 
to be a cabinet minister, she does not dare speak out as the 
Prime Minister might get a little upset with her, and she will 
not be a cabinet minister.  That is the kind of parliamentary 
system we have.  That is why we have to reform this place and 
change it to make it more relevant to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect if we took a vote in the House we would find that the 
overwhelming majority of members of Parliament are concerned 
about this proposed merger.  The Reform Party probably is. 
Liberal members are.  The Bloc is.  I assume the Tories are.  And 
what are we doing about it?  We make one or two speeches in the 
House. Let us turn this debate into a debate on this particular 
issue right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks have engaged a lobbying firm which is lobbying like 
mad to make sure the banks get their way.  The banks across the 
country are advocating what they want and campaigning to have the 
right to merge.  We are giving the banks a free run.  That is 
exactly what is happening. As parliamentarians we are sitting 
here like a bunch of bimbos on our butts and not doing anything 
about it in terms of striking a parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us turn this place into a relevant institution and have a 
parliamentary investigation into the wisdom or lack thereof of 
these mergers. 
However the Minister of Finance will not do it.  He wants to be 
prime minister of the country.  Who will he side with?  Will it 
be the bankers of Bay Street or ordinary people?  The member for 
Windsor—St. Clair has re-entered the House.  I know she does not 
side with the bankers of Bay Street, but what about the Minister 
of Finance?  Does he side with the bankers of Bay Street?

</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he do?  He is afraid to face the music and have a 
parliamentary inquiry.  I am surprised Reform Party is not up in 
the House demanding a parliamentary inquiry.  I know it is a very 
conservative right wing party.  It has more and more friends in 
the corporate elite.  It falls in love with the Conrad Blacks of 
the world.  Perhaps that is why its members are silent in the 
House about an inquiry into banking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the member from Calgary, the revenue critic, shaking his 
head.  I can hear that from here too.  That is why the Reform 
Party does not want a parliamentary inquiry.  I thought it was 
supposed to be a people's party, a grassroots party, speaking on 
behalf of ordinary people.  It is not.  It is becoming a party 
reflecting the corporate elite.  It would not know a worker if it 
saw one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are Reformers in a coalition with the Liberal government? 
Why do they stand four square with the Minister of Finance and 
the Prime Minister in terms of the way they are handling the 
banking issue?  They should be out there saying let the people 
speak, let the people decide, let us have a parliamentary 
inquiry, let us have a parliamentary investigation to see if this 
is good for Canada or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have a new opportunity with the bill before the House 
to talk about competition policy and why we have to strengthen 
it.  We have the case in point today to deal with, the merger of 
the Royal Bank of Canada and the Bank of Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know if you were a member on the floor of the 
House you would be getting up to make the same kind of speech. In 
fact you are applauding me there in the chair right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry to interrupt the hon. 
member.  I was not applauding.  I was simply indicating to him 
that his time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I enjoyed the comments of my colleague in the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to inform the House that soon after an offer was made by 
the Royal Bank and the Bank of Montreal I sent out a 
questionnaire in my riding.  The response was four to one in 
opposition to the merger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on that response I wrote a letter to the <I>Financial 
Post</I> in which I said the situation reminded me of the 
<I>Titanic</I>.  It was big too at one time but once it hit the 
iceberg it sank, taking 1,500 people with it.  The point I was 
trying to make was that we were not ready.  That is why we have 
debate in the House, to make sure we are prepared if it ever 
takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member agree with me that when the recession hit 
us in the 1930s no Canadian bank ever went bankrupt?  That was 
because we had laws to protect consumers, unlike the United 
States and now as we see in southeast Asia.  If we have no 
protection for the consumers we will go the same way.  However, 
the way it is we have lots of protection for consumers.  I do not 
think we will be hit or that it will happen the same way it 
happened in southeast Asia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the protection we have for consumers enough to protect us in 
case we are hit by an iceberg? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very happy the 
member sent a survey out to his riding which came back four to 
one in opposition to the merger.  I believe that tells us what 
the Canadian people are thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess my question back to him is whether or not he would agree 
with me that we now need a parliamentary inquiry, a parliamentary 
committee, so his constituents and my constituents have a chance 
to speak out publicly on how they feel about that particular 
merger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be very helpful if some members of the Liberal Party 
would rise and say publicly that we need a parliamentary 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say to him that I do not believe the consumer 
legislation is strong enough for ordinary people.  That is why we 
want to strengthen the competition bill.  That is one reason for 
the particular debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically our banks have been a very protected sector of our 
economy.  That is why they have an obligation to be more 
forthright with Canadian people.  That is why they have an 
obligation to reduce bank service charges, for example.  That is 
why they have an obligation to be more generous in terms of loans 
to small businesses and farmers.  I am sure the member agrees 
with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we need stronger competition policy to protect the 
consumer, but I also invite him to rise with me in the House and 
ask the Minister of Finance in a very polite way for a 
parliamentary committee investigation right now made up of all 
five parties and not just Liberal backbenchers having hearings 
behind the scenes.  That is not a parliamentary democracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is very interesting to hear the discussion regarding 
wanting to keep both the Royal Bank and the Bank of Montreal in 
Outlook, Saskatchewan.  I would like to contrast that kind of 
thinking with the Reform type of thinking that happens to come 
out of my constituency and out of Reform country, which is most 
of western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are quite pleased when one of the banks happens to pull out 
of town because one of our local credit unions walks right in and 
opens a branch.  The first thing we know the credit union that is 
owned by our small farmers and the union people who work at 
various unionized shops in my riding get together and put 
together a credit union that then provides banking services.  We 
keep the profits and all those good things at home.  That is 
Reform country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member support the big banks or does he support the 
little guy as he is supposed to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is like the chicken 
lecturing Colonel Saunders, a Reformer supporting the 
co-operative movement and credit unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For my whole life I have been involved in the co-operative 
movement.  I guess the member does not know my background, about 
my family being farmers.  They have always taken their wheat to 
the wheat pool and have been members of the credit union.  I am a 
member of the credit union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  I said “wheat pool”.  Somebody does 
not know the history of co-operatives in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the merger goes through, it opens up a great opportunity for 
credit unions.  We will see the closure of a lot of branches.  We 
will see the opening of more and more credit unions.  If this 
happens, I certainly encourage the credit union movement to get 
out into more communities and to expand existing credit unions. I 
support them all the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is refreshing to hear a member of our most conservative far 
right wing party, the Reform Party, actually supporting credit 
unions.  I am really pleased to hear that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I too am shocked with the support the hon. member for Qu'Appelle 
has given to the big banks.  It is terrible that the NDP has not 
only turned its backs on the Regina manifesto's clarion call to 
nationalize the banks, this party of markets and competition, but 
now it wants banks to populate small town Saskatchewan.  The 
member wants all the big banks to go into small prairie villages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up in the little town of Wilcox, Saskatchewan, with a 
population of 220 on the Sioux line between Drinkwater and Yellow 
Grass.  When the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce shut down 
three decades ago, a local credit union emerged.  It was a local 
co-operative bank established by the farmers and workers in that 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That member does not like it because he would rather have the 
millionaires from the Bank of Commerce running the banking 
business in Wilcox, Saskatchewan.  I say shame on the hon. member 
standing up for his friends with the big banks.  I will point out 
he did suggest in his remarks that the Reform Party was friendly 
with the big money people on Bay Street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party more than any other party, with the exception 
of our socialist friends, relies more on the contributions of 
individual donors than corporate donors.  Three dollars to one is 
what we get in terms of individual contributions to corporate 
contributions.  There is a good reason the NDP does not get any 
business contributions.  It is because businesses know it is not 
in the best interest of Canadian workers to support its kind of 
monopolistic policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member comment on what happened to their policy 
to nationalize the banks?  Even Ed Broadbent used to talk about 
nationalizing one of them.  Did that just sort of flitter away 
with their other socialist principles? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I say to my socialist 
comrade from Alberta that talking about turning away from this, 
my friend from Alberta used to be the executive assistant to the 
now minister of agriculture when he was a Liberal.  He knows all 
about turning away from things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Was he not kicked out of the Liberal 
Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  No, he was not kicked out of the 
Liberal Party.  He saw the light but he went the wrong way and 
went right instead of left. 
My friend from Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre obviously must be 
thinking of somebody else.

named Bill Knight.  Bill Knight used to be a member of Parliament 
for the NDP Saskatchewan riding of Assiniboia.  I know that my 
friend from Alberta knows that, because the former leader of the 
Liberal Party in Saskatchewan was an MLA from that riding when he 
worked for that particular MLA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill Knight, as member of Parliament for our party and now the 
head of Credit Union Central, will be trying very hard to make 
sure we establish more and more credit unions across the country. 
I support the credit unions as the people's bank.  It is 
grassroots and owned by the people.  It is a co-operative and the 
profits are shared by the people.

this to be a most interesting diatribe out of both sides of the

single message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the revenue

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I just want to say a very few words.  Bill C-20 
respecting the Competition Act is a bill I have had some 
experience with in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of good things in it.  I will get the good 
things out of the way quickly because I want to provide some 
suggestions as to how we can improve the bad things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The telemarketing fraud section is a good amendment.  A number 
of seniors in my constituency in the province of Saskatchewan 
have been the victims of telemarketing fraud.  As a matter of 
fact, it has been such a problem in western Canada that we have 
had to undertake to educate as many seniors as possible by 
sending out householders in my constituency to alert them to the 
potential problem of telemarketing fraud and what sort of action 
they can take if they receive calls or have been victims of this 
very nasty approach by suspicious so-called business people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind people that on CTV <I>National News</I> last night, 
David Goldhawk, a very well known crusader for many issues that 
are important to Canadians, in particular seniors, told a story 
about a senior citizen who was bilked out of a fair amount of 
money through telemarketing fraud.  Through his intervention he 
was able to salvage most of the money she had been fraudulently 
bilked of.  I wanted to mention that in my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the other parts of the bill with which I am not 
so happy, they pertain mostly to the merger notification process. 
It is my view that the merger notification process in the bill is 
inadequate and very weak.  It does not address the real problems 
that I think Canadians want addressed.  It is my view that it 
should be done in a way which strengthens the legislation as 
opposed to weakening it as it now does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a very brief comment about the changes in Bill 
C-20 that are not necessarily attractive to me when it comes to 
mergers.  Right now, as my colleague from Qu'Appelle outlined, 
the big bank merger before the country and parliament is an issue 
very near and dear to the hearts of many Canadians.  Many people 
bank with those two institutions and have a lot of friends, 
relatives, neighbours, acquaintances and so on who are employed 
there.  These mergers could potentially cost jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering whether the government of the day, which has put 
forward these recommendations, has given any consideration to 
this aspect where mergers result in fewer jobs.  As I read 
through the bill and through the accompanying notes of the 
minister, I found that this issue was not addressed at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make reference in particular to how Bill C-20 deals 
with the Conrad Black and Hollinger takeover of Saskatchewan 
newspapers.  In essence they purchased the <I>Leader-Post</I>, the 
<I>Star-Phoenix</I> and the <I>Yorkton Enterprise</I>, basically 
all the daily newspapers in the province.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Competition Act, which we are now debating, this was 
processed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purchaser of the newspapers, Mr. Black from Hollinger Inc., 
would sit down and say “Here are the benefits of a merger”.  In 
fact, the Competition Bureau would sit down with them and say 
“Here is a process in which you can undertake to accomplish the 
merger”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other than that, they have no responsibility to ensure that 
basic services are required or that some of the employees who 
will lose their jobs should be provided with alternate training 
or some sort of severance arrangement, enabling them to gain 
employment in other parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned about this in relation to jobs in particular 
because mergers, whether the newspaper mergers of Conrad Black 
and his company Hollinger Inc. or the bank issue before the House 
of Commons, will result in significant numbers of families being 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that for the bank merger alone, somewhere 
between 15,000 and 30,000 jobs are potentially at risk.  I think 
that is a serious enough implication of a merger that the House 
of Commons and the Government of Canada should be taking a review 
of this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join with my colleague, the member for Qu'Appelle, in calling 
for a parliamentary committee to ensure that the mergers (a), are 
necessary, and (b), are going to be beneficial to the country 
that provides them with the charters to bank in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my sense that the resulting review of the merger situation 
does not provide satisfactory evidence and that it will benefit 
Canadians and people working in Canada if the merger is allowed 
to proceed anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we can provide other people who will provide banking 
services to Canadians with the charters that they are due and 
entitled to under the Bank Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course where these jobs will be lost will be all over Canada 
but mostly in rural Canada, in small town Canada, particularly in 
communities where both the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank 
have branches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder, when we are considering a merger and we have the 
commissioner of the mergers reviewing the merger, why we cannot 
have a commission and a Competition Act that asks merging 
companies how many jobs the merger will create in this country as 
opposed to how many jobs will be lost.  There should be some 
regulation about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we should have in this Competition Act some sections that 
call for a community reinvestment act.  That would be a novel 
idea.  It means that if they are going to merge or move an amount 
of capital around, they should be answering about how many 
dollars should be reinvested in the communities where they made 
their profits.  That would ensure there is certain economic 
activity and that they were returning some of those profits to 
the community where they were earned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in parts of Canada say “This is just another left wing 
idea”.  It is not that left wing.  It is actually in existence 
in many countries in this world. The home of free enterprise and 
capitalism, the U.S.A., has a reinvestment act, the Community 
Reinvestment Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Bank of Montreal bought the Morgan Bank in Chicago just 
a few years ago, before the purchase of the Morgan Bank was 
allowed to proceed under U.S. regulations, the Bank of Montreal 
had to commit $497 million to reinvestment in Chicago and 
district alone because that is where the Morgan Bank was 
servicing clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It had to commit $497 million over a period of time.  I believe 
it was over five years.  They had to invest in small business, in 
low cost housing and in other areas where they were getting a 
return.  It had to commit that amount of money to reinvest in 
those communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can we in this Competition Act which we are debating today 
not have sections that would encourage, if not provide, an 
opportunity for a reinvestment act in this country?  I think 
Canadians would welcome this.  They would embrace this act.  I 
would assure the government opposite that the NDP would certainly 
support that initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to leave these recommendations with the government.  I 
think they are very important.  I also want to say that the 
Competition Act should also consider the MAI, the Multilateral 
Agreement on Investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Multilateral Agreement on Investment will affect the 
Competition Act. 
If the Competition Act is in law and is operating in this 
country, will the MAI supersede an act of this Parliament with 
respect to competition?   We do not know the answer to that.  I 
hope the government will respond to it.  Although the Competition 
Act is fairly weak, we should be mindful of the opportunities and 
the challenges which the MAI will provide with respect to this 
particular issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point I want to make pertains to the lack of teeth in 
this bill.  I have brought forward issues in the House of Commons 
such as gas pricing, where the competition bureau reviews 
superficially gas pricing practices in this country, but does not 
have the authority to go into corporations to look at documents 
like it used to be able to do under the Combines Investigation 
Act, which was abolished by the former Conservative government of 
Mr. Mulroney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That legislation was abolished because, from the large 
corporations' perspective, it was intrusive.  Of course intrusive 
meant that the anti-combines people could in effect look at 
mergers or the purchasing of companies to ensure that the public 
interest was defended and protected.  Consumers were protected 
and defended.  Now that legislation is gone and we have the 
Competition Act, which is a shadow of its former self. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the United States of America has anti-combines legislation 
on its books to this day.  There is more powerful legislation in 
the homeland of capitalism, in the land of free enterprise, than 
we have in the so-called social democratic country of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Social democratic country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  I am referring to the governments of 
Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Yukon and Quebec which have 
introduced social democratic policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my sense that the Competition Act, before the amendments 
were put forward, was a shadow of what it used to be.  The new 
proposals will not strengthen it that much.  It will be a little 
better in terms of responding to telemarketing fraud.  However, 
it is a total failure when it comes to defending consumers, small 
business and jobs in this country.  As a result of that, I am 
looking forward to the government making some amendments in those 
areas so we can support the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for his fine speech.  I want to ask him if he 
could be a little more precise and elaborate a bit more on why he 
thinks the Competition Act is not strong enough today to deal 
with the bank merger which we face in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that these two banks have a stock market value of 
around $40 billion.  They are very large.  They have assets of 
$453 billion.  By far and away this is the largest proposed 
merger in the history of the country.  The largest merger before 
this involved some $14 billion, if I am not mistaken, which was 
the merger of TransCanada Pipelines and another gas company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to elaborate a bit more as to why he thinks the 
Competition Bureau and the Competition Act are not strong enough 
to deal with this merger.  I certainly do not think it is.  I 
believe we have to strengthen it.  With the existing legislation 
it would just get snowed under. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is very important that he elaborate on this very 
important point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Qu'Appelle for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of question period when a Liberal backbencher 
stands to ask a question of their Liberal colleague.  There does 
not seem to be a lot of opportunity to discuss issues because 
they are all very busy people.  Likewise, the members of my 
caucus are very busy, so my colleague has asked me a question 
with respect to how we should enhance this legislation so it can 
be effective when dealing with bank mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of ways in which it can be strengthened.  The 
commissioner should have the power to ask these questions when 
considering a merger:  What will be the benefits to Canada if the 
merger proceeds?  How many new jobs in Canada will be created if 
the merger proceeds?  Will the banks commit a percentage of their 
deposits to reinvest in the communities in which they are 
operating? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those three criteria were dealt with, discussed and met, and 
there was generosity in co-operation with the Canadian 
Competition Bureau, as there has been with the Bank of Montreal 
in co-operating with the Chicago Morgan Bank and the U.S. 
regulations to invest money in their communities, then I believe 
that Canadians would look at this in a broader way. 
These are three very quick things off the top of my head in 
answer to the member for Qu'Appelle.  I would be happy to 
entertain any more questions from my dear colleagues in the 
House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the member.  He will know, as 
we all do in this House, that large corporations contribute 
significant numbers of dollars to the Reform Party, the 
Conservative party and the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he has any comments or thoughts on whether or not 
there is a link between the opposition of the large corporations 
to the significance of pro-competitive merger legislation, and 
the support of the Reform, Tories and Liberals for this present 
situation and present legislation which really does nothing to 
enhance competition in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows that the reason the Liberals, the Reform and the 
Conservatives support the bank merger is because the Liberals, 
for example, received on average between the two banks, the 
Montreal and Royal, $150,000 in political contributions, in the 
last year available to us where we have the records that are 
public.  That is $150,000 from two individual companies to 
support the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The oil companies that support the Reform Party give substantial 
contributions.  Imperial Oil and Shell give substantial 
contributions to both the Liberals and the Reform.  Each of those 
big companies give the Reform Party about $50,000 or $45,000, 
depending on the year.  Pan Canadian also makes substantial 
contributions.  This should not surprise anybody because lo and 
behold, all the legislation that we have seen the Reform and the 
Liberals support has been to reward these particular companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other sector that seems to get rewarded for their generous 
contributions to both parties is the pharmaceutical industry. 
Bill C-91 provides monopoly protection for 20 years to the 
pharmaceutical industry, to charge whatever they want for 
prescription drugs.  Lo and behold, those huge corporations 
financially support substantially the Liberals, the Reform and 
the Conservatives Parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform and the Conservative Parties get substantial 
contributions from the banks, the oil companies and the 
pharmaceuticals.  Guess what?  In all the legislation, we have a 
specific bill for the pharmaceuticals that gives them monopoly 
protection.  I wonder what effect the Competition Act, Bill C-20, 
that we are debating today in this House, will have on Bill 
C-91?  I bet it will not have any affect.  It will actually 
ensure that Bill C-91 is there forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is the banks, the oil companies or the 
pharmaceuticals, who tend to be gouging consumers and defending 
only their shareholders outside of Canada rather than Canadian 
consumers, they are the ones who are always getting the benefit 
of legislation from these three parties that happen to embrace 
this legislation with both arms.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
a question for my colleagues here on the left, the New Democrats. 
They have spoken a fair amount, from a competition perspective, 
with respect to the potential bank merger which we may or may not 
see in the coming weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions that I have for the hon. member relate to the bank 
merger.  Given the fact that there are nearly 92,000 jobs that 
actually come into play, does he not think that there is actually 
some kind of a moral obligation on behalf of the government to 
ensure that this decision is actually done in a reasonably 
expedient fashion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little while ago two insurance companies that merged were 
London Life and Great West Life.  When that was done the 
government was able to make some kind of a rapid analysis of 
whether it met the criteria for the Competition Act. 
Given the fact that on February 14, 1997 a WTO ruling made the 
banking industry open to foreign competition, is it the hon. 
member's assessment that the finance minister should be surprised 
that the other banks would actually be talking at some time or 
other?

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALTERNATIVE FUELS ACT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question deals with the implementation of the Alternative Fuels 
Act which was proposed by Senator Kenny and adopted in 1995.  It 
requires federal departments and agencies to select motor 
vehicles capable of operating on alternative fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act takes a flexible approach in defining alternative fuel 
as a fuel that is less damaging to the environment than 
conventional fuels.  Widely available alternative fuels include 
ethanol and ethanol gasoline blends, propane, methanol and 
natural gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alternative Fuels Act requires the shift to alternative 
fuels by the federal government to occur in three stages.  The 
first phase requires 50% of the fleet in the fiscal year that 
began in April 1997.  The second phase requires 60% of the fleet 
by the fiscal year that will begin on April 1.  The third phase 
requires 75% of the fleet for the fiscal year commencing April 1, 
1999.  For every fiscal year thereafter there will be an 
increment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are good reasons to switch to cleaner fuels.  The question 
now is whether the right example is being set.  In some cases we 
are setting a good example.  I am told that the Minister of 
Natural Resources and the deputy minister of that department use 
vehicles operated by propane and ethanol blends.  The President 
of the Treasury Board uses an ethanol blend.  The minister and 
deputy minister of the environment use propane in their vehicles. 
The deputy minister of finance uses an ethanol blend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am told that the Minister of Finance is not yet using 
alternative fuels.  The minister and deputy minister of national 
revenue use gasoline vehicles.  The minister and deputy minister 
of fisheries and oceans use ethanol blends only “where available 
and cost effective”.  Neither the minister nor the deputy 
minister of health uses an alternative fuel vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the departments, I am told that National Revenue operates 
588 vehicles but only 12 use alternative fuels.  This is in spite 
of the fact that there are 423 propane stations, 48 natural gas 
stations, 97 ethanol stations and 6 methanol stations within 10 
kilometres of the fleet operated in various locations by this 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Health has indicated that in the fiscal year 
1997-98 it will purchase 75 vehicles.  I am told that not one of 
those vehicles will operate on alternative fuels. In reply to a 
question on the order paper in the Senate presented by Senator 
Kenny the Department of Health said that it has 575 vehicles in 
its fleet, with none operating on alternative fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was told that the Department of the Environment would purchase 
30 vehicles in the upcoming fiscal year and that 20 of these 
would run on alternative fuels.  However, of 657 vehicles 
currently operated by Environment Canada only 60 are run on 
alternative fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are at least 17 refuelling stations offering alternative 
fuels within 10 kilometres of this House.  These stations provide 
propane, natural gas, ethanol and methanol, four of the most 
commonly available alternative fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few words about cars running on gasoline.  Here the 
departments could give leadership by using a gasoline ethanol 
blend.  When it comes to adding new vehicles to their fleets, 
departments can show leadership by ensuring the engines can run 
on propane.  Using propane makes a lot of sense because it is 
less expensive than gasoline and other fuels.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the President of the Treasury Board is what 
progress will be made in implementing this important legislation 
and, in particular, is half the federal fleet operating today on 
alternative fuels as required by the Alternative Fuels Act? 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government has 
undertaken a number of actions to facilitate the use of 
alternative fuels and emissions in our fleets.  We have provided 
the departments with the tools to make assessments of the 
potential of each vehicle.  We have established and demonstrated 
a project in the showcase to alternative vehicles and we have 
provided environmentally friendly policy frameworks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all this the assessment is that a limited number, in fact 
only 6% of the existing vehicles in the fleet, would be cost 
effective to operate on alternative fuels.  The results of this 
limitation include the restricted selection of vehicles available 
in 1998 models offered by manufacturers.  Only six trucks and 
vans and three sedans are available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of cost effective components by suppliers to convert 
the vehicles is another impediment.  Limited infrastructure for 
alternative fuels in some parts of our country is severely 
limiting our applications for alternative fuel vehicles in the 
federal fleet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If gasoline remains a primary fuel for most of our fleet we must 
find other ways, in addition to alternative fuel measures, to 
reduce emissions.  This can be done primarily by reducing fuel 
consumption through the use of efficient vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our analysis indicates that 53% of the fleet travels less than 
20,000 kilometres and 24% travels less than 10,000 kilometres. 
Under the new policy emission reductions will come from greater 
use of alternative fuels combined with greater efficiency in the 
use of the Canadian government fleet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are well aware of my colleague's exploits in the 
environmental field and the Government of Canada is continuing to 
pursue methods to ensure we have clean air for Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on February 12, 1998, following the 
report on the first year of the EI reform, I questioned the 
minister as to the short term action he intended to take, given 
that this report, which I would call a rather rosy one, made no 
recommendation concerning the EI amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister had been saying for a number of months that he 
was following the reform very closely and that we must wait for the 
first-year report to see if any changes were required. 
The report itself contains no recommendations.  It even claims to 
have been unable to really evaluate the effect of the EI reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, those in the field have already seen the 
results of this punishing reform only too well.  They will see it 
even more clearly, unfortunately, in the coming days and months 
with the so-called spring gap.  This is the period when those who 
have not been receiving EI benefits long enough to carry them 
through to their next job, particularly seasonal workers, will have 
a difficult six, eight or ten weeks with no income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not take an extensive report to understand the reality 
of the situation, and we would like the government to do something 
about this quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to my question, the minister talked about how 
successful his economic policies have been in creating jobs. But the 
minister gave the wrong answer, as what is being assessed is the success 
of social policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been clearly demonstrated by the distinguished economist 
Pierre Fortin. He has established beyond a doubt that, in Quebec alone, 
200,000 individuals who have been forced onto welfare since the EI 
reforms were implemented would still be receiving EI benefits if the 
basic rules had remained the same. Not only is the loss of income 
substantial, but individuals are also marginalized by being moved from 
the employment system to the welfare system. The minister's EI reform 
policy is an abject failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense, what I would like the parliamentary secretary to 
explain to me is how they can possibly accumulate a surplus of $135 
million a week in the employment insurance fund and allow eligibility 
requirements to marginalize and impoverish people when it has been 
clearly demonstrated that people do not abuse the system.

to be back in the same place at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows very well that the new Employment 
Insurance Act requires that we monitor and assess the impact of 
the reform on individuals, communities and the economy.  He knows 
that the first report had to be tabled in early 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the magnitude of the reforms, the limited time some of the 
changes have been in place and the time required to obtain and 
analyse complete information, the 1997 report gives a preliminary 
assessment of the start-up year of the reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first of five reports.  It lays the groundwork for 
subsequent reports that will take a more comprehensive look at 
how people are adjusting to the reforms.  We have already 
demonstrated that we will respond to concerns.  Last year we put 
in place adjustment projects to address concerns that the reform 
had created a disincentive to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the monitoring and assessment process is so 
important.  It ensures that we are gathering and assessing 
information on an ongoing basis and enables us to respond when 
there is a need to do so.  However, we will not abandon the 
reform on the basis of the hon. member's exaggerated claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we have preliminary results, there are encouraging 
signs that people are adjusting to the reform and an improved 
economy is helping them to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that we are on the right track.  The fact that we 
are not wasting our time in committee presenting a report to the 
House of Commons on a preliminary report is a good use of our 
time as a committee.  For the member to suggest that we should 
review the monitoring report in committee and spend weeks talking 
to people about it is rehashing what we did last year in 
committee when we brought in this report. I think we should get 
on with the business of seeing that Canadians get employment and 
the economy continues to progress the way it has.

<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
just over a month ago, on February 4, I stood in this House and 
asked the Prime Minister to explain a document that had come into 
my possession that detailed a government plan to shut down the 
Cape Breton Development Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan, stamped “secret” on every page, included a precise 
chronology for the privatization of Devco.  Then, in the likely 
event that privatization would be unsuccessful, the government 
was told exactly which parts of Devco could be sold off, parts 
like the Donkin mine.  Most important, the plan told the 
government what it had to say to convince the people of Cape 
Breton that the destruction of their jobs, of their traditions 
and of their communities was a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I revealed this document the Prime Minister would not 
answer my question.  He passed me off to the natural resources 
minister who had not even been paying attention.  That is how 
seriously this government takes the voice of Cape Breton Island. 
The Prime Minister had advance notice of my question and he did 
not even bother to brief his minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took a week for the Liberals to respond to my release.  It 
took them a week to come up with a line to explain away written 
proof of their underground strategy to destroy the Cape Breton 
coal industry.  The best they could do after a week was to say 
that the plan they had authorized at cabinet level had never been 
presented to the cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This defies belief.  Is the government asking us to believe that 
when the cabinet requests a study it simply disappears?  If the 
cabinet tolerates civil servants behaving that way then our 
country and this government are in more trouble that I thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually the Liberal spin doctors decided this line was a 
little too unbelievable as well because they dropped it and said 
that yes, there had been a plan but that it was abandoned because 
of the pressure applied by the island's Liberal MPs David 
Dingwall and Russell MacLellan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cabinet minister who was explicitly mentioned in the cabinet 
memorandum as being a key player in implementing the 
privatization or shutdown was suddenly transformed into the 
saviour of the corporation. 
Even better, Russell MacLellan, a backbencher, was supposed to 
have input into a cabinet document that he could not have known 
anything about.

a backbench MP is getting access to secret cabinet documents, 
then at least one cabinet minister should be forced to resign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fudging of answers has reached a fever pitch as the Nova 
Scotia election gets closer.  The backbench Liberal MP turned 
Liberal premier struggles to convince Nova Scotians that his 
total lack of activity on their behalf over the past two decades 
is not due to his total lack of ability. Paul any economic

they actually remember who he is.  But this will not work.

answer the question I asked last month.  We do not want any 
promises, we just want the truth.  If the truth is that the

and has tried and failed to privatize it, why will it not be

that should be presented in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future of the Cape Breton Development Corporation or Devco 
is a very serious issue for miners, the people of Cape Breton and 
not the least to the Government of Canada.  Coal mining and Devco 
contribute to the economic well-being of many families in many 
communities in Cape Breton and provides opportunities for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know workers at the corporation are dealing with 
geological issues and technical uncertainty about the future of 
the Phalen mine.  It is in this context that I am concerned the 
hon. member may be politicizing the matter which provides 
disruption to the community, to the workers and to the 
corporation which is trying to support jobs in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want the hon. member to have to live up to the 
editorials that are coming down about her within her riding. They 
basically suggest that the spin of the hon. member for Bras d'Or 
is ignoring the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's position with respect to Devco has been very 
consistent.  Therefore I appreciate the opportunity to clarify 
the government's position on this very important crown 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devco must be commercially viable.  Nothing more, nothing less. 
It is worth repeating that we believe this is a necessary step 
toward ensuring the survival of both the corporation and the coal 
mining industry in Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of the hon. member's question from this afternoon 
and from previous questions, let me assure this House that there 
is no secret plan to privatize Devco nor is there a 15 month 
shutdown plan for Devco. The hon. member's frequent assertions 
that such a plan exists appear to be based on a draft document 
that was never presented to cabinet.  Instead, as we all are 
aware, a decision was made to focus on commercial viability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only approved plan that exists for Devco today is Devco's 
business plan.  Based on this plan the government has made a 
decision to continue to provide financial support.  The 
government has confidence in the management and the employees of 
the corporation. These people will work toward the goal of 
commercial viability.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I once again would like to bring attention to the River 
Glade to Moncton toll issue. In short, I disagree with tolls 
charged on highways because highways are basic public goods 
needed for economic and safety reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the New Brunswick government announced its secret deal 
with the Maritime Road Development Corporation to build a new 
highway between River Glade and Fredericton, I have opposed the 
deal. The process by which negotiations were conducted between 
the provincial government and Doug Young's company should not 
have been secret but instead should have been open to public 
scrutiny before any contract was signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  I know the Liberals hate to hear this 
because it is the truth and that is why they are all complaining 
at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Highways should be paid for by our income tax which lets people 
pay for services based on a percentage of their incomes instead 
of tolls which are unfairly applied at the same rate to both poor 
and rich citizens.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I oppose the tolls on the Trans-Canada section 
between Riverglade and Moncton to MRDC because this section 
should not be part of the deal.  The section in question has 
already been paid for by our taxes, both provincially and 
federally.  The highway is part of the Trans-Canada, a national 
symbol which links Canadians from the Atlantic to the Pacific. 
This section is the only highway linking residents of the riding 
with health care needs which they can only obtain in Saint John 
or Moncton.  The federal government has double-dipped in the 
pockets of Atlantic Canadian businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This toll tax on the main corridor between the maritime 
provinces and the rest of Canada will result in an increase in 
the cost of goods and services imported and exported from the 
maritime region.  The tourist trade will also be directly 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the people of New Brunswick will be looking at a $2 
billion tax increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the Liberal government eliminated the Atlantic Canada 
freight rate subsidies, promising to invest $326 million over 
five years to modernize the highway system in Atlantic Canada and 
eastern Quebec.  Where did it go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Atlantic Canada freight rate subsidies existed to help 
Atlantic Canadian businesses compete with central Canadian 
businesses which were favoured because of lower transportation 
costs.  This represented thousands of dollars in subsidies every 
year for many Atlantic Canadian businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the toll highway, already paid for by tax dollars and the 
savings of the subsidies eliminated, is costing these businesses 
more than before.  It does not add up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a company which used to pay $1,000 to ship its 
products to Ontario would get a rebate of $250.  Now they have to 
pay the $1,000 plus an extra $110 fee per day to travel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to say that the Trans-Canada Highway 
should be toll free from coast to coast.  In the words of Ruth 
Jackson, present mayor of Salisbury:  “A toll on any part of the 
Trans-Canada Highway is a breach of trust to the citizens of 
Canada, removing them from the freedom of unifying transport 
across this country.  Any tolled road, be it provincial or 
private, must be separate and distinctly not part of the 
Trans-Canada Highway system.  If this toll is allowed to proceed, 
all geography east of Moncton will be denied the freedom of 
national highway access to any commercial transport”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the hon. 
member that highways, including those segments which make up the 
Trans-Canada Highway, fall under provincial jurisdiction.  Both 
the existing and proposed Fredericton to Moncton highways are the 
responsibility of the province of New Brunswick.  This means that 
the Government of New Brunswick decides on their alignment, 
design, construction standards, tendering process, financing, as 
well as subsequent operations and maintenance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision to establish tolls on these highways is exclusively 
a provincial decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government had co-funded some of the completed work 
under existing federal-provincial cost-shared agreements.  The 
total federal contribution toward the completed work was $32 
million.  Of this, $16 million was spent on the 23 kilometre 
section between Riverglade and Moncton, which will become part of 
the toll highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Brunswick has not included the federal contribution in the 
cost base that was used for establishing tolls and the annual 
provincial payment for the remaining capital cost.  In effect, 
the federal funds have reduced the capital cost of the total 
project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government entered into cost shared 
federal-provincial highway agreements because it wished to 
accelerate the construction of safer and more efficient highways, 
and this objective was met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once project construction is completed to the satisfaction of 
both parties, the federal role ceases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Past and current agreements contain no provisions preventing the 
establishment of tolls or requiring the agreement of the federal 
government. The government has no legal basis to prevent 
provinces from imposing tolls on provincial highways, including 
those which have received federal contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It being 6.55 p.m., the motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 
a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.54 p.m.)
