<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 15 consideration of the motion 
for an address to Her Excellency the Governor General in reply to 
her speech at the opening of the session, of the amendment and 
of the amendment to the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  When debate was last 
interrupted the hon. member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale had five 
minutes left for questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member's speech was so unmemorable that I cannot 
recall all of the points which I wished to ask him about. 
However, I have a couple of things which I would like to raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about a balanced approach to financing.  We all know 
that in the last couple of years the federal government increased 
its tax take in this country by $18 billion.  The hon. member 
makes much of the fact that the government is promising to lower 
taxes by $16.5 billion over the next three years.  Is that what 
he means by balance, that the government will take $18 billion 
away from us and it might think about giving $16.5 billion back? 
Is that Liberal balance? 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in view of the hon. member's comment about my 
unmemorable speech, maybe I could give a memorable answer to him 
by saying, yes, that is absolutely my idea of balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain.  The hon. member knows as well as I do that in 
the past years we were not in a position to reduce taxes.  I 
trust that members of the party opposite would not have advocated 
reducing taxes given the budget problems we had and the deficit. 
They had huge complaints all the time about the size of the 
deficit and the debt.  So that was the responsible attitude to 
take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are in a position to do something about taxes.  In answer 
to a question, the Minister of Finance said in the House, I 
believe on Friday, that there were $16.5 billion in tax 
reductions on the table for the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What differentiates the hon. member and myself and his riding 
from my riding is that my riding, as I pointed out in the 
introduction of my speech, requires an act of sensitive 
government to issues.  It requires a government that says there 
are homeless people in Toronto.  It requires a government that 
says there are children who need housing and homes and that it 
will actively pursue an agenda which will enable them to have 
better enriched lives, which will help all of us and reduce the 
ultimate tax burden by reducing the problems of social conditions 
which produce delinquency and other issues in our society.  This 
is what we need in government.  This is the balance of which I 
spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is investment in infrastructure at the university level. 
The students and faculties at the University of Toronto, Ryerson 
and George Brown College are all thrilled to see an active 
government of this country saying that it will reward excellence 
and ensure that our institutions of higher learning are well 
equipped to ensure that we have the best brains in this country 
contributing to the ability of the country to go into the 21st 
century well prepared.  That is what I mean by a properly 
balanced approach.  Yes, tax reductions; but, yes, a government 
which recognizes there are needs for our citizens at all levels 
that have to be fulfilled.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale is a person with an 
extraordinarily good grasp of global and economic issues who 
always brings to the House very erudite and insightful comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he see the new spending that the federal government is 
committing to, the sparse commitment to tax reduction and the 
meagre commitment to debt reduction as being negative given the 
state of the Canadian dollar and the importance of addressing the 
fundamental issues of lowering debt, lowering taxes and 
controlling spending in the long term, in terms of fiscal and 
monetary policy and currency levels?  I would appreciate the hon. 
member's comments because our Canadian dollar has been weakened 
significantly under this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I should have recognized 
that the hon. member's kind words at the beginning of his 
question were about to cover some sting that was coming at the 
end of the scorpion's tail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that the he is coming so close to the previous 
hon. member who spoke.  I thought there was an attempt to 
differentiate his party from other members further to the centre 
in the House.  I am a little surprised by the tenor of the 
question, but I am really surprised that the hon. member, because 
I respect his economic judgment, would say the government is 
responsible for the weakening of the Canadian dollar in the last 
few years.  As he knows, it is exactly our fiscal and our 
appropriate approach to the management of the economy of the 
country that has protected the Canadian dollar and allowed us to 
get to where we are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I believe strongly that we need not just a focus on 
tax reduction or on debt relief, but a focus on those social 
requirements of Canadians that I referred to earlier in my 
speech.  That is where the balance comes.  That is where the 
differentiation is between his party, other parties and the 
government.  I think that is where we will find that the Canadian 
people are comfortable with what is being done on this side of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we continue 
I thought it would be a good idea to go over how 
we will handle questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to proceed pretty much as we did in the first 
session; that is, we will always recognize a member from another 
political party for a question or a comment.  We will try to do 
it in balance.  If there are a lot of members interested in 
asking questions, they will stand when I first call questions and 
comments.  At that time I will try to pick three and I will ask 
that the questions and responses to be kept to between 30 and 60 
seconds.  That way more people will be able to get their oars in 
the water.  If it seems that there are just one or two people, or 
perhaps just one, then we will relax that rule a little. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Winnipeg 
Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Speech from 
the Throne and to send a message to parliament from the people in 
my constituency of Winnipeg North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in my constituency are working very hard to build 
their future, our community and to contribute to Canada.  They 
are people who get out of bed, work hard every day, who look 
after their kids and organize programs at the local community 
centre, who coach at the rink or help out at the seniors' centre. 
They share a sense of pride for their neighbourhoods and are 
determined to make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will provide a little idea of just how people in my riding are 
making a difference in spite of some very difficult odds and 
conditions.  In the last little while we have celebrated many 
important anniversaries.  I want to mention, for example, the 
15th anniversary of the North End Women's Centre, an organization 
working to provide counselling, training opportunities and 
employment for hard pressed women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention the 50th anniversary of Inkster School, a 
wonderful example of good, solid public education that needs the 
support of all levels of government.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also mention the 50th anniversary of the Shaughnessy 
United Church which is working very hard in my constituency to be 
a presence, to bring a spiritual contribution to our area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me mention the 20th anniversary of Bleak House, a very 
important centre for seniors working to ensure social and 
recreational opportunities for all of our senior citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, let me mention the 100th anniversary of the Holy Ghost 
Parish, a church that is located in the heart of my constituency. 
It represents an incredible achievement for not only my community 
and the province of Manitoba but for all of Canada.  It reveals a 
history of courage, tenacity and faith.  From its earliest days, 
the Holy Ghost Parish helped early settlers adjust to life in 
this new land.  It became a focal point for, in this case Polish 
culture, but it also worked to serve the needs of new immigrants 
right across western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I mentioned this centennial because it represents the 
pioneering spirit in the country.  It talks about those who built 
this great country, who devoted so much time and energy and who 
sacrificed so much in order to foster the spiritual and cultural 
growth of our community and the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of those organizations are trying very hard to make a 
difference but the odds are working against them because of a 
failure of federal leadership.  In my own area, along with the 
constituency of Winnipeg Centre, we have the highest rate of 
poverty anywhere in the country.  We have a housing crisis that 
is beyond description in the Chamber.  Just in the last couple of 
weeks we have had another dozen or more arsons of vacant 
properties in the inner city and north end of Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context, let me reference the Speech from the Throne 
which suggests that the government, in response to the housing 
crisis of the land, is going to study the roots of the problems 
of homelessness.  The situation in areas like Winnipeg North 
Centre do not need to be studied any more.  I can tell the House 
right now just what the problem is.  This is an area that has few 
economic opportunities because of the policies of the government. 
This is an area that has been totally abandoned by the government 
offloading its responsibility for housing onto other levels of 
government.  This is an area that has been abandoned by the big 
banks.  In the next couple of months we will see another two 
branches close in my area.  There are other examples right across 
the country.  This is a situation where people are very much the 
victims of federal government neglect and of the failure of 
leadership that permeates every aspect of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in Winnipeg North Centre are prepared to do their 
part to build communities but they want the support of 
government.  They need the co-operation of government and they 
need the vision of government to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was at the celebration marking the very important 
occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Holy Ghost Parish, the 
pastor at that church, whose name is Father Karciarz, actually 
summed up the situation in the best way possible.  He quoted from 
a prayer by Archbishop Oscar Romero who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We plant the seeds that one day will grow.  We water seeds 
already planted, knowing that they hold future promise.  We lay 
foundations that will need further development.  We provide yeast 
that produces far beyond our capabilities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That prayer is exactly what people in my area and in areas right 
across the country are saying to the federal government. Together 
we must plant the seeds of hope.  We must ensure that those seeds 
are watered daily.  We must lay the foundation for building a 
better society and a better day.  They turn to the government and 
especially the throne speech for that sign, the road map of how 
we will create a better day.  They look to the government for a 
vision to help us overcome these great difficulties around 
poverty, homelessness, deplorable housing conditions, 
unemployment and lack of recreational opportunities for our young 
people. 
They expect a throne speech to be in tune with that vision, those 
ideas and those seeds of hope.  What did they get from the Speech 
from the Throne?  They got an absolute failure of leadership and 
an abdication of government responsibility.  There was no sign of 
a vision and no hope for the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On every critical issue facing the country, the government is 
either silent or it claims to be studying the issue.  There is no 
mention of the housing crisis, the fishing crisis or the farm 
crisis.   There is no mention of the real problems facing 
families and communities right across the country.  Nowhere is 
this more apparent than when it comes to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are under a serious assault in the country as a result of the 
failure of federal leadership and an agenda that very much 
supports the privatization of our health care system.  We are 
under the double assault of the dismantling of our universal 
health coverage system and the dismantling of our health 
protection system.  This should be readily apparent today as we 
hear that there are 200 scientists in the government's own 
department who are crying out with a message that we are headed 
toward despair and doom on the health safety front unless the 
government decides to resume responsibility and provide 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If nothing else, perhaps the government will listen to the words 
of its own former minister of health, Monique Bégin, who said: 
“Canada's cherished medicare system is steadily eroding and 
could one day collapse because of federal disregard”. If the 
government will not listen to the words of the opposition, surely 
it will listen to the words of those who have helped to preserve 
and protect our health care system, one of its own former 
colleagues, the Hon. Monique Bégin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent an area that was held by both Stanley Knowles and 
David Orlikow, two people who stood and fought for health care, 
pensions, unemployment insurance, protection for our families and 
ways to end poverty and despair in our communities.  We have a 
great responsibility to carry on that legacy and it is one we 
take very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we can impress upon members of the government the need 
for addressing the real concerns of Canadians:  being there at 
times of crisis and offering leadership that builds upon the 
sense of co-operation and community that has been so much part of 
the history of the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member mentioned the former minister of health, 
Monique Bégin.  I had the opportunity to be her critic for four 
years in the House of Commons between 1980 and 1984, a period in 
which we were leading up to the introduction of the Canada Health 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act is fresh in my mind because I just 
finished reading a copy of the <I>Hill Times</I> in which the 
headline stated that the Canada Health Act was 35 years old, 
although the article was a little more accurate.  The Canada 
Health Act was only introduced in 1984.  Prior to that, we had 
other legislation with other names.  The purpose of the Canada 
Health Act was to discourage extra billing by physicians and user 
fees.  The Canada Health Act incorporated all the previous 
legislation into this one piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the mention of Monique Bégin because it seems to me 
that she was the last minister of health we have ever had in the 
country who did something to actually protect medicare. 
Subsequent ministers of health have, for one reason or another, 
presided over the dismantling of our health care system, 
generally through the introduction of unilateral cutbacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member mentioned, we now see two threats.  I am sure 
that if she had more time she would have mentioned a third 
threat, which is that health services may be put on the table at 
the upcoming round of negotiations at the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure I have said enough for the hon. member to comment more 
on the issue that she is so concerned about and on which she does 
such a good job of caring about in the House, the protection of 
our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
wisdom of my colleague, the member for Winnipeg—Transcona, who 
has been involved in these issues for some 20 years.  He probably 
knows better than anyone else the struggle in Canada for a 
universal, comprehensive health care system.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely clear that Monique Bégin will go down in 
history as the last person in the federal government to be seen 
fighting for medicare.  She was very clear in her recent comments 
about what is required.  She pointed to the fact that “erosion 
of medicare is the slow concealed process which suddenly leads to 
landslides and collapses.  Is that what we want?”.  Obviously we 
do not want that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a universal health care system in the country that must 
be defended against all pressures including our own worst enemy, 
the Liberal government, which has overseen the dismantling of the 
system through steadfast cutbacks over the years, has willingly 
allowed the private sector to invade the health care sector and, 
as my colleague for Winnipeg—Transcona has said, is prepared to 
allow free-floating discussions at the WTO around health care 
services to be up for grabs at the table in the international 
sphere.  Those are two obvious threats to health care in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third threat, which I hinted at earlier, is the dismantling 
of our health protection system.  We have in the country a 
tradition of a tough regulatory approach to ensure that the food 
we eat, the drugs we need, the water we drink and the medical 
devices we need to use are safe beyond a reasonable doubt. We 
have operated in the country on the basis of a “do no harm” 
principle.  If there is a concern or a doubt then we ensure that 
we do not allow that product to be consumed by Canadians until we 
know the long term health consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from events of the past week that we have been inundated 
with all kinds of concerns from groups and individuals about the 
flood of genetically modified foods on the market around which 
there has been no scientific investigation or research from the 
federal government.  Members also know that we have had a number 
of instances where our government inspectors are so 
under-resourced and short staffed that they are not able to 
address very serious situations around toxins and poisonings in 
our food supply.  It is an area that cries out for government 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are desperately hoping that the government will address both 
areas of health care:  the preservation of a universal, publicly 
administered health insured system and the strongest possible 
national food safety and health protection system imaginable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there 
can be no doubt that the Speech from the Throne is a very 
carefully crafted document.  One thing I have come to realize in 
the short time I have been here is that there is probably no 
other piece of work that is done on the Hill that is so 
scrutinized and carefully put together.  One can almost see 
dozens of bureaucrats burning the midnight oil in the catacombs 
of this building agonizing over every word that goes into it to 
make sure it is exactly, perfectly put together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I point this out is that there are no accidents in 
the Speech from the Throne.  If there is something missing from 
it, it is not by omission, it is missing for a good reason.  It 
has been thought through very carefully for the message that it 
sends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know there are two ways to send a message.  One way is by 
putting the message in the document and one is by leaving it out. 
As a westerner from the prairie region, the most glaring omission 
in the Speech from the Throne has to be the complete absence of 
any reference to the agricultural crisis that we face in the 
prairie region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not come to Ottawa to get on the hobby horse about western 
alienation.  Frankly, I did not even think I would ever be 
standing up in the House speaking about western alienation, but 
the longer I am here the more I realize how important and grating 
this issue really is for a person from the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all very sympathetic to the issue of the lobster crisis 
on the east coast.  We realize it is a real problem.  However, we 
have an emergency in western Canada in the prairie region. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just an isolated incident.  It is not just a part of 
our industry that is suffering.  The whole shebang is at risk of 
losing what developed western Canada, which is our agribusiness. 
Forty per cent of all prairie farmers run the risk of being out 
of business by the end of this selling cycle if something does 
not happen.  If some intervention does not take place, 40% of all 
people who work on family farms today will be gone, kaput, and 
that does not even begin to talk about all the many industries 
that rely on a vibrant agricultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect to our colleagues from eastern Canada, we 
do not see the minister hopping on the plane to get to western 
Canada immediately to deal with the crisis, as we do with the 
lobster fishery.  The minister was on the plane the next morning, 
meeting with all the stakeholders down there and trying to carve 
out some way of dealing with that crisis.  We do not see that in 
western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we supposed to think?  Is it that our crisis is not as 
important as their crisis?  Are we to weigh whose crisis is most 
severe?  I put it to the House quite frankly that the other issue 
pales in comparison to what is going on in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might wonder why I would use my 10 minutes to talk about 
agriculture.  I represent an inner city riding.  I do not have a 
single farmer in my riding.  There is hardly even a garden plot 
in my riding, frankly.  It is the core area of Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I do have the United Grain Growers.  I have Cargill.  I 
have the Winnipeg Grain Exchange.  All the evidence of what built 
the prairies is located within the riding of Winnipeg Centre. 
That whole exchange area was built up because of a vibrant farm 
economy that we now stand to lose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this as the first point or as the most noticeable point 
about the Speech from the Throne for me as a westerner.  There is 
not even a word, not a single line in there.  I realize that the 
Speech from the Throne does not deal with specifics.  That is for 
the budget.  However, if there was a single line which said the 
Government of Canada recognized that it has to intervene in some 
way to protect the agricultural industry in western Canada, that 
would be some comfort.  It would be some solace and people in 
that industry might say that at least the government appreciates 
that they have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It not just a matter of throwing money at it.  I am not saying 
that everybody who lives on a farm, whether they are good farmers 
or bad farmers, should get a bailout from the Canadian 
government.  Nobody is advocating that.  It is a host of problems 
that have compounded and conspired to defeat the family farmer, 
whether it is world commodity prices or the corporate domination 
of the whole industry in terms of access to seeds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that scared the heck out of me recently was told to me 
by a group of farmers.  It almost seems like this is part of some 
master plan:  drive the small farmer off the farm so that the 
corporate sector can come in and make farming a corporate 
industry instead of a family enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One graphic illustration of why that is not just paranoia is the 
way that canola seed is dealt with.  One has to buy canola seed 
from one corporate institution.  I will not mention the name. One 
also has to sign a contract that one will sell the yield to that 
same institution.  It controls the supply and purchasing of the 
product.  At the same time it genetically alters the seed so that 
it cannot reproduce itself.  It dead ends after one season. 
Unlike normal plants it cannot reproduce itself.  It has been 
neutralized that way and the next year one has to go back to the 
same company to buy seed again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a serfdom.  It is a return to serfdom.  Agro-serfs is what 
they really are.  They are not farmers any more.  They are 
agro-serfs, multimillion dollar agro-serfs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of things that Canadians are trying to 
awaken the Canadian public to and nobody is listening.  There 
used to be champions in the House of Commons for the prairie 
farmer.  At one time we had a western protest party that actually 
spoke out on behalf of prairie farmers instead of just the 
corporate agricultural industry.  Unfortunately we do not hear a 
great deal of that today and, try as we might, we cannot get that 
issue in the forefront.  The Liberal government has missed an 
opportunity to buy some support in western Canada by at least 
being sensitive to that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is really how one could summarize the Speech from the 
Throne.  It was a missed opportunity, in fact a series of missed 
opportunities, and that is only the first and most glaring one 
that I can identify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another missed opportunity that is self-evident for me because 
it is in my critic area is immigration.  All summer long, for the 
past six months, we have been seeing an hysteria about 
immigration whipped up by my colleagues in the Reform Party and 
their right wing counterparts in western Canada. 
They are trying to convince us that we have an emergency on our 
hands because 400 or 500 Chinese migrants have drifted to our 
shore.  I have heard terms like this is the biggest breach to 
national security since the FLQ crisis.  That is one of the 
points they have made.  I do not know how to say balderdash or 
poppycock in terms that are parliamentary, but I have never heard 
such nonsense in my life.  I guess I just did.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow we have to put the hysteria back into perspective and 
ease the public's mind that we are not facing a breach to our 
national security because a couple of hundred desperate people 
have foundered on our shore in British Columbia.  It is a 
manageable issue and it is not the end of the world.  However, 
again it is a missed opportunity where the Liberal government 
could have put one line into the Speech from the Throne to calm 
people down on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague for Winnipeg North Centre raised the issue of child 
poverty.  I was just reading the comments of the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona in his speech.  He reminded the House of 
Commons that we are up to the 10th anniversary of a unanimous 
motion in the House of Commons which said we would eradicate 
child poverty by the year 2000.  That was moved by the leader of 
the NDP at that time in 1989 and it passed unanimously.  Not a 
single person voted against such a laudable concept that by the 
year 2000 we would somehow eradicate child poverty within our 
borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members of the House that we live in the richest and 
most powerful civilization in the history of the world.  I ask 
members to defend in any way they can why there should be anybody 
living in poverty within our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I represent an inner city riding and so does the 
member for Winnipeg North Centre.  We have three of the five 
poorest postal zones in the country.  Poverty is an issue that we 
are seized with every day.  There is not a day when we go to work 
that we are not dealing with somebody's urgent social emergency 
in terms of poverty issues.  Yet in the Speech from the Throne we 
heard very little.  We heard nothing about the important 
resolution that was passed in 1989, and only passing remarks 
about the issue of the fair redistribution of wealth building 
equity into our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government mentioned that in the EI program it would 
lengthen maternity benefits.  That is a laudable idea, a 
wonderful idea.  I would like to see some costing of it.  I 
cannot wait for the budget to come out to see what it will cost 
the Government of Canada.  I would suggest that it will cost very 
little.  First of all, fewer and fewer women qualify for any EI. 
They have to get on to EI before they can have their benefits 
lengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI surplus is $600 million a month and not per year.  What 
the government will spend in lengthening the EI benefits for 
mothers on maternity leave might cost $50 million a year.  I have 
sort of done some costing on my own.  Some $50 million a year 
versus $500 million or $600 million a month.  Where is the rest 
of that money going?  The Canadian public is still being cheated 
and the EI reform is not nearly far enough.  It is another missed 
opportunity.  The government could have addressed that glaring 
oversight. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for my colleague who explained a few seconds ago that 
we have a surplus of $24 billion in the EI program which was 
transferred in 1986 from the EI program to the general fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the throne speech came down it talked about wanting to give 
it only to maternity leave.  Would the hon. member agree with me 
that the government is not taking responsibility for the new jobs 
and for women returning to work?  To go on maternity leave now 
they need 700 hours.  Many women do not qualify for EI.  We saw 
again this morning on the first page of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
that many women do not qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government forgot in its throne speech all the women who do 
not qualify for maternity leave because of the 700 hours and the 
910 hours needed to qualify for first entry.  Most women work 
part time and do not qualify for EI.  Our youth who come out of 
university have a hard time finding jobs and end up in part time 
work. 
They do not qualify for EI.  Eight hundred thousand people who 
have paid into the employment insurance fund do not qualify for 
EI.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like some comments from our labour critic about how he 
feels about that.  This money belongs to the workers.  As I have 
said many times, the Liberal government has stolen from working 
people and another $30 billion from the public sector pension 
plan. Some $54 billion have been stolen from the working people. 
The government is not taking responsibility for working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I want to caution 
members.  The member for Acadie—Bathurst indicated that the 
government has stolen or the Liberals have stolen.  As long as 
there is not a direct attribution to a specific minister or a 
specific ministry it is a political metaphor but certainly it is 
not to be taken literally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
pointing out those pressing issues regarding the EI program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that when unemployment insurance reform took place 
it made it more difficult to qualify.  People could collect for a 
shorter period of time and receive less money per week.  It was a 
recipe for a surplus.  The government is using the EI system as a 
cash cow to harvest money from employers and employees to use for 
whatever it wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member pointed out, there is no such thing as the EI 
fund.  All that money goes into general revenues and the 
government can spend it on whatever it wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always argued that to deduct something from a person's 
paycheque for a specific reason and then use it for something 
entirely different is fraud.  At the very least it is a breach of 
trust.  The government told us it would use if for one purpose 
and used it for another.  It is completely misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never mind what it does to workers, which is bad enough.  As 
labour critic I am sympathetic to that and what the changes in 
the EI fund are doing to my community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Labour Congress hired Statistics Canada to do some 
research on the impact on a riding per riding basis.  In my 
riding alone the changes in the EI fund take out $20.8 million a 
year.  Can we imagine losing that amount of income, wages or 
salaries out of one intercity riding per year?  In one area of 
Newfoundland it is $70 million per year. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for Winnipeg Centre who indicated that 
agriculture was not referred to in the throne speech at all.  He 
indicated that there was no direction from the government with 
respect to agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member believe that the government should have at the 
very least put together some sort of vision in the throne speech 
as to the support the government should be putting into 
agriculture right now?  The government does not seem to have any 
direction at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member for 
Brandon—Souris is very knowledgeable about these issues.  To 
answer his question simply, all it would have taken is one or two 
lines in the Speech from the Throne to recognize that we have a 
problem in western Canada, that we have an emergency that needs 
to be addressed.  The government did not have to write pages and 
pages.  There should have been a couples of lines to sympathize 
and say that there is an ongoing emergency in western Canada.  It 
would have give some comfort and some solace to those people who 
find their livelihood at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the member's question, it is a missed opportunity on 
the part of Liberals to give some comfort to those of us in 
western Canada who feel more alienated than ever.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate Her Excellency the Governor General on both her 
appointment and inspirational address which she delivered on the 
occasion of her installation.  Those of use who were privileged

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is traditional that participants in this debate describe and 
praise the unique character of their constituencies.  I have 
always felt particularly fortunate to represent Lanark—Carleton 
in the House of Commons. 
It encompasses one of Canada's major high technology clusters 
centred in but not restricted to the city of Kanata.  It has a 
large rural area which includes much of Kanata and extends 
through West Carleton township in the county of Lanark, 
officially the maple syrup capital of Ontario.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In its towns and dotted throughout its landscape are numerous 
substantial and handsome stone homes and public buildings, a 
legacy of the Scottish stonemasons who were among the settlers 
who arrived in the last century. The people of Lanark—Carleton 
are very aware and proud of their heritage.  At the same time, 
explosive growth of Kanata driven by successful high tech 
companies and entrepreneurs has added a dynamic sense of energy, 
pride and optimism to that historic and beautiful part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coupled with pride in its heritage is a sincere and energetic 
concern for the environment.  One does not have to travel far to 
be close to nature.  The increased pressure on water resources 
for industrial and recreational use has led to real concern in 
particular within the farming community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spirit of co-operation that exists among those seeking 
solutions in an era of diminished financial resources is reason 
to be hopeful.  However, I believe there is widespread public 
support for moving environmental issues back near the top of the 
agenda for all levels of government. I was pleased that the 
Speech from the Throne committed the federal government to 
addressing the management of toxic substances, increasing 
protection for endangered species and strengthening our capacity 
to perform environmental research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned the contribution of high technology to my 
riding.  Its importance cannot be overstated.  I was pleased 
therefore to see that the government recognizes the interrelated 
role of so many factors that allow high tech companies to 
flourish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been an ongoing debate about the brain drain. Despite 
the clash of statistical and anecdotal evidence, I am on the side 
of those who see this as a serious issue.  The success or failure 
of any business depends on the quality of its management and the 
skills, knowledge and enthusiasm of its employees.  Very simple 
rules of human behaviour govern the response of individuals and 
therefore companies to both threats and opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a era when changes to global trade rules and patterns 
have subjected business to unprecedented competition.  Companies 
that once hid behind high tariff walls disappeared as those walls 
crumbled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ability and willingness of governments to prop up or bail 
out non-competitive firms has eroded.  There is also little 
public appetite for government grants to business.  Governments 
do though have the ability to create the conditions and 
environment that will encourage companies to take risks and 
encourage individuals to be entrepreneurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aspect of that is the burden of taxation, both personal and 
corporate.  Taxes in Canada are high both historically and in 
comparison with our neighbour and major trading partner, the 
United States.  However, the relatively recent and sustained 
campaign in favour of major tax cuts demonstrates just how short 
term some people's memories can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government inherited a $42 billion deficit when it took 
office in 1993.  Canadians enthusiastically supported the 
Minister of Finance as he brought in budget after budget that 
moved us steadily toward the surplus position we now enjoy. 
Prudence was the watchword. There was always the recognition that 
economic growth could stall.  We were not prepared to achieve a 
budgetary surplus only to be thrown into a deficit situation by a 
future economic downturn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax cutting has begun.  Measures from the last three budgets 
will mean 600,000 low income Canadians will no longer pay federal 
income tax.  The current clamour for tax cuts comes from those in 
the top tax bracket.  That is understandable and the fact is one 
does not have to earn an enormous salary to be in that bracket, 
which brings me back to the brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada depends on successful business people to create jobs for 
other Canadians.  We cannot afford to lose highly educated, 
highly skilled and highly mobile people.  The disparity in income 
tax levels between Canada and the United States has been a 
significant factor for high tech companies in my riding that need 
to attract and keep skilled employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My message to both employers and employees is simple:  your 
patience is about to be rewarded.  I will quote from the throne 
speech: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax reduction is a key component of a strategy to increase 
individual incomes and to ensure an economy that produces the 
growth and wealth which enable those public and private 
investments necessary for a high quality of life. In its next 
budget the government will set out a multi-year plan for further 
tax reduction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I included that quotation because many media reports suggested 
the speech gave little importance to lower taxes.  The message is 
clear and the details will be spelled out in the February budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This session of parliament appears to be built around the theme 
of “Canada, the place to be in the 21st century”. I applaud the 
idea.  It reminds me of a suggestion made by Dr. Howard Alper, 
vice-rector of research at the University of Ottawa. While 
considering the Canadian scientific diaspora, those top 
scientists and academics who are now abroad, Dr. Alper suggested 
a rediscover Canada program. 
Canada can only benefit by having many of its finest researchers 
available to, in particular, graduate students.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was excited therefore to hear of the government's decision to 
fund a program known as the 21st century chairs for research 
excellence.  The federal granting councils already play a very 
significant role in funding university research.  They will now 
be responsible for enabling the establishment of 1,200 new chairs 
for research excellence in universities across the country. The 
objective is to have a total of 2,000 chairs as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of bold leadership required if Canada is to be 
known as the country that celebrates excellence.  I would extend 
that idea, though not the model, to other areas of human 
endeavour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a recent and overdue recognition of the need to 
celebrate our national heroes.  Fellow Canadians who are 
successful on the world stage make us feel good about ourselves 
and serve as role models for others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An obvious area is amateur athletics. In this era of 
multimillionaire professional athletes, to whom few of us can 
relate, we should remember the pride we always feel when our 
Olympic athletes perform well.  At a time when study after study 
raises the alarm about how physically inactive our children are, 
we should look for ways to encourage amateur athletics.  That 
will also require an investment in developing top quality 
coaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with celebrating excellence we should be known as a 
country that welcomes and supports creative minds.  That means 
Canada is the place to be for artists, among others.  One has 
only to look at the excitement created by Pinchas Zucherman 
becoming music director of the National Arts Centre Orchestra. 
Often relatively small incremental costs mean the difference 
between experiencing the merely competent and the truly 
outstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many small steps can lead to a better country.  One example is 
the annual Prime Minister's awards for teaching excellence. 
Another is the Governor General's award for caring Canadians.  It 
is important to recognize and highlight the achievements of 
unsung heroes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One group of heroes we can never properly thank is our war 
veterans.  Those of us who have been fortunate enough to never 
experience war can have no real idea of what it was like.  The 
reality that over 100,000 very young Canadians died on foreign 
soil in defence of their country can be acknowledged every 
November 11.  But the enormity of the sacrifice and the loss and 
grief experienced by so many families rarely invades our own 
consciousness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We became a country in the eyes of the world thanks to battles 
like Vimy Ridge. To recognize and celebrate the lives of those 
who died for Canada is not to celebrate war.  It is a fundamental 
overarching responsibility we have to make succeeding generations 
know the price that was paid for our freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention this in the course of this debate because another 
debate has been going on for far too long about building a new 
Canadian war museum.  I believe the government should release 
from their commitment those who offered to raise money for the 
museum.  Just build it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen much of the museum's collection that is unavailable 
to the public because of space restrictions and I can assure 
everyone that it deserves to be on display.  I am aware of no 
other national institution that depended on private fundraising 
to be built.  I hope there will be an early announcement that 
construction will soon begin on the new museum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne addressed the need for an 
infrastructure for the 21st century.  The most visible is the 
physical infrastructure we require as a trading nation to enable 
the free flow of goods and services.  In addition to transport, 
the five year plan will focus on tourism, telecommunications, 
culture, health and safety and the environment.  That is an 
ambitious objective but one which I believe Canadians will 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has set a goal to be known around the world as a 
government most connected to its citizens.  It will also take 
steps to accelerate our adoption of electronic commerce and 
encourage its use throughout the economy.  There are challenges 
associated with electronic commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last session of parliament we worked on legislation to 
protect personal and business information and to recognize 
electronic signatures.  It is important that Canadians recognize 
and seize the opportunity we enjoy, because of our leadership in 
communications technology, to be a world leader in the control 
and use of electronic commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to acknowledge and support the government's commitment to 
building stronger communities.  In much of the industrialized 
world we have seen a growing gulf between rich and poor.  There 
are almost daily media reports of newly minted high tech 
millionaires and corporate executives enjoying incomes that are 
many multiples of those earned by their rank and file employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Globalization has led many to question the importance of 
national boundaries.  Every new round of trade negotiations 
appears to lessen the ability of governments to act on behalf of 
their citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians are asked what separates them from Americans, we 
often point to our system of health care.  A search for the 
defining idea of what makes Canada unique remains elusive.  I 
suggest however that the answer may lie in embracing the idea of 
community.  It is not a weakness to be seen around the world as a 
country that supports the less fortunate.  It is not a weakness 
to be known as a country that embraces cultural diversity and 
welcomes new immigrants with their skills, energy and ambition to 
build a better life for themselves and their children.  The 
danger would be in a retreat toward isolation as provinces, as 
communities and as individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as members of parliament have an ambitious agenda before us. 
The challenges set out in the Speech from the Throne are many and 
real.  The goals are clear and within our grasp.  Canada deserves 
nothing less than our best effort.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the member for Lanark—Carleton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He addressed the issue of the brain drain as being very serious. 
I know the member.  I know he is serious about it and is 
concerned. I wonder how that squares with his government's record 
on a lot of these issues and the reasons for the fact that our 
society has this brain drain.  The conference board two weeks ago 
came out with a report which said that Canadians are falling back 
in terms of innovation and that we are losing some of our 
brightest people to the United States.  That is a fact of life we 
all know about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our committee on international trade asked small and medium 
size companies why they did not export outside of Canada, they 
said that too much government regulation was a serious inhibitor 
to doing business in Canada. Taxes, including payroll taxes, were 
a deterrent. There were interprovincial trade barriers.  I 
noticed the premier of Ontario on the weekend said that it was 
easier to do business with several American states than it is 
with Canadian provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been in power for the last six years and we 
still have these serious problems.  There is a 50:50 split on how 
it is going to decide what is going to be spent on spending and 
on debt and tax relief.  Yet we have seen social spending 
increased so there is nothing left to split 50:50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government doing?  It has had six years to address 
these issues and nothing much has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ian Murray:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is important to remember 
that these problems did not spring up overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the history of research and development 
expenditures in Canada, they have languished at the low end of 
the G-7 for many years.  That is largely because of the branch 
plant economy we had in Canada.  The brain drain problem is 
partly related to taxes. It is a very important component and I 
am pleased it is going to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member referred to trade.  It is important to look at 
the team Canada initiative of the Prime Minister. It has been 
quite effective in stimulating increased trade abroad.  A lot 
people ridicule these trips abroad as junkets that do not 
accomplish anything.  The fact is for years businesses have been 
asking ministers— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry to 
interrupt the member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know 
the hon. member opposite rather well.  He is one of the august 
members on the Liberal benches.  In fact, he should be a Reformer 
with some of his philosophies and the hon. member is welcome any 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address a point that was not in the Speech from 
the Throne.  It has to do with traditional activism, in 
particular, the reference with regard to the possession of child 
pornography.  I do not know a single issue that has been raised 
more by constituents across Canada as to why this is the case. 
Not one single solitary statement was made in the Speech from the 
Throne dealing with this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a matter of what is right or wrong with child 
pornography, it is that the judge completely ignored what the 
people wanted.  He completely ignored what the intent of 
parliament was when that law was first passed.  He used his own 
technical legal interpretation of a particular issue.  When we 
asked the government to invoke the notwithstanding clause, there 
was deathly silence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member say if it has come to the point where the 
government does not have the courage to deal with issues that are 
controversial and reflect the interests and the wants of the 
people of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ian Murray:</B>  Mr. Speaker, not at all.  It is important 
to remember that until 1993 the country existed without the law 
my hon. colleague is referring to.  The law was rushed through 
during the Kim Campbell government just before the 1993 election. 
We have to keep that in mind as we look at this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, it is important to remember that any exploitation of 
children and the production and distribution of child pornography 
is still illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that the law may have been carelessly drafted. 
Apparently it is possible that if somebody has written something 
themselves and maintains it in their possession and it can be 
defined as pornographic, then they can be charged.  That is not 
the sort of thing we are worried about in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was one of those who very early on called for the Prime 
Minister to address the problem created by that judicial decision 
in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been quite willing, though, to wait for the courts to 
look at it.  If the problem is not resolved by the courts, I 
think the House should look at redrafting the legislation to make 
sure it is ironclad that the possession of child pornography 
remains a crime throughout Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on the Speech 
from the Throne.  I want to begin by complimenting the governor 
general on her appointment and note the signal of hope that 
appointment has given to many in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to begin by wishing the legendary former prime 
minister, the Right Hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a happy 80th 
birthday, with wishes from my constituents for many, many happy 
years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne gives reasons to my constituents and 
to all Canadians to be optimistic about the future of Canada.  I 
said that on Friday when I spoke to four classes of grade 10 
students.  I encouraged them to watch the debate in the House 
today, and I am convinced that many of them will be watching. 
Therefore I am pleased to make my remarks with the hope that it 
will enlighten them and with the hope that the remarks from other 
members will show them the extent to which the Speech from the 
Throne has set out a vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has set a course for Canada in the next 
millennium.  It has paved the way in building a nation in which 
the quality of life of Canadians will continue to be unmatched in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several years in a row the United Nations has declared 
Canada to be the best country in which to live.  The commitments 
we made in the Speech from the Throne will ensure that our 
country will remain so for many years.  To the students who are 
watching, we hope that it will also be the case for many years in 
their lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Wednesday the Prime Minister stated that Canada is the 
place to be in the 21st century.  I agree.  Six years ago when 
the government took office our country was described as a third 
world country.  Our economic growth was slow.  The deficit and 
unemployment were high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This economic malaise impacted our communities across Canada, 
including those in Etobicoke—Lakeshore.  I recall a time when 
there were many closures in my riding:  stores, businesses and 
manufacturing areas.  Today I know that our country will be well 
situated economically and socially to be a world leader in the 
next century and beyond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are enjoying the longest economic expansion since the 1960s 
with over 1.7 million new jobs created.  Our nation's fiscal 
house is in order.  Taxes have been cut in the last two budgets 
by $16.5 billion over three years and, important to me, 600,000 
low income Canadians will no longer pay federal tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done this by adopting a comprehensive, 
balanced economic strategy that has transformed Canada to 
becoming one of the strongest economies of the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this strategy our government will continue to strengthen 
Canada by recommitting itself to economic policies that will 
allow us to keep the national debt on a permanent downward track, 
reduce taxes for Canadians and invest in knowledge, innovation, 
children, youth and health.  These are the themes of the throne 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne enables the government to further its 
efforts.  Canadians may recall that this is what the government 
said it would do:  50% for tax and debt reduction, 50% for 
economic and social needs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I held several budget consultation meetings and over and over I 
heard from my constituents that those are things they would like 
to see the government pursue in dealing with the surplus, and 
they urged us to manage whatever surplus there is in a 
progressive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituents of Etobicoke—Lakeshore believe that in the 
global economy knowledge and technological innovations are the 
cornerstones of the highest standard of living and a better 
quality of life.  Our quality of life and standard of living can 
be secured in the future if we are willing to explore new 
frontiers in innovation.  Investment in research and development 
is central to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to build an infrastructure of skills development and 
innovation to foster opportunities for Canadians to pursue 
lifelong learning.  I see this in my constituency.  The federal 
government has created initiatives such as the Canada Foundation 
for Innovation, and Technology Partnerships Canada to put 
Canadians on this path.  Many of my constituents have received 
benefits from the $1 billion endowment to the Canada Foundation 
for Innovation which is helping to build a leading edge national 
system of innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technology partnerships program is being taken advantage of 
by businesses in my riding to help them keep up in the 
development of marketing, production and new technology in 
Canada, thereby creating jobs for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the commitments in the throne speech the government is 
expanding its efforts.  Let me cite some of them, especially for 
those grade 10s who are watching.  There is good news.  Through 
the research granting councils the government will fund the 
creation of 1,200 new 21st century chairs for research excellence 
in Canadian universities over the next three years.  The cost of 
the program will be $60 million in the first year, $120 million 
in the second, $180 million in the third year and it will be 
ongoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shared this information with those grade 10 students.  Many of 
them come from diverse communities.  Perhaps they can see that 
there is an advantage for their parents and older siblings who 
are presently at university in research areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's place in the 21st century cannot be secure unless we 
commit to investing in children.  They are the future of our 
country and the strength of our society.  We know that when the 
development of children is neglected in the formative years of 
life society as a whole is disadvantaged.  I spent six years as 
chair of the Metro Toronto Housing Authority.  We dealt with 
individuals in rent geared to income facilities and I saw the 
socioeconomic situation of many of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past six years the federal government has endeavoured 
to provide families with support in caring for their children. We 
put several programs onstream.  I want the young people of 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore and across Canada to know that as we look 
forward to the progress in broadening experiences and the 
understanding of our fellow Canadians it is important for us to 
do what needs to be done to ensure that the mantra of no 
experience, no skills, no job becomes something of the past, 
especially among young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents expect nothing less from the government but to 
ensure that our health care system is modern and sustainable.  I 
know of several who are watching the direction in which the 
government is going.  It is trying to ensure that we meet all of 
those commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are committed to preserving and protecting the 
environment.  Several individuals in my area work on a daily 
basis in the protection of the environment.  The Humber River was 
recently declared a Canadian heritage river. 
There are many other very important environmental niches in 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore where we must ensure that we clean up areas 
that are contaminated and that we protect the health of all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members on all sides of the House to view the 
Speech from the Throne, as it outlines the Liberal vision for 
Canada's future in the new millennium, as building and creating 
strong communities that will enable us to have a more equitable 
society for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I found 
the speech to be rather interesting, but I was actually somewhat 
disappointed by what it omitted.  I would like to give the member 
an opportunity to address some of the issues that she might have 
included in her remarks rather effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like her to respond to the whole situation of youth in 
Canada today.  We have a number of young people who are looking 
somewhere for a job, hopefully at home in Canada. Many of them 
are finding, though, that the tax situation is such that it is 
preferable for them to find a job elsewhere where they will get 
more money because the taxes are lower than they are in Canada. 
There is a disadvantage for them to stay at home, assuming they 
have a job in the first place.  I would like the hon. member to 
address that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question concerns the youth exchange program across 
Canada.  If there is a shortage of funds, which there is, which 
would the young people rather have, an exchange trip across 
Canada or a job? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to respond to the member because in my discussion 
with our young people we talked about how debate occurs in the 
House.  Someone speaks and someone questions or responds.  I am 
sure this is a really good example for the young people who are 
watching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address the issue of jobs I will speak about my riding in 
particular.  We have a number of agencies that are working with 
our young people and a number of initiatives that are on the 
ground to assist them in finding employment through small 
business, entrepreneurial adventures and through support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  What about taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  The issue of taxes is one that all 
Canadians are concerned about.  At the same time we also 
recognize that the taxes we pay go into programs that benefit all 
of us and that is important to our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of moving out of the country, I think the Prime 
Minister put it very well when he talked about the environment 
and culture and everything else that makes us Canadian and the 
importance of holding on to this and not going after small gains 
in terms of dollars. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
quite pleased to hear the hon. member's remarks concerning 
education for our young people because we know this is a very 
important issue that has to be dealt with in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to elaborate a bit upon what the 
government is doing to make it easier for young people through 
cuts in tuition or something similar which would make their debt 
load easier as they struggle through university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are several things 
that the Speech from the Throne addressed and several programs 
that we have been working with.  I will cite some examples that I 
had written out, guessing that this might be a question that 
would be thrown my way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our expanded commitment to young people now includes the hiring 
of youth to put in place additional community Internet access 
sites in communities across Canada, which we know is the most 
connected country in the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have launched Exchanges Canada which will provide 100,000 
young Canadians every year a chance to learn about a different 
part of Canada and support them in that effort.  We are giving 
young Canadians from the age of 13 an opportunity to produce 
their first works using traditional and new technologies in the 
arts and in cultural, digital and similar industries.  We are 
giving young Canadian volunteers the opportunity to help with 
literacy skills and participate in community and national 
environmental projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we have signalled what we will do in terms of 
student debt and loans and ways in which we can deal with the 
postponement of the huge debt that young people carry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
be splitting my time this morning with the hon. member for New 
Brunswick Southwest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very privileged to represent the riding of Kings—Hants 
in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia.  Living in Kings—Hants, 
we understand the power of tides.  We have the highest tides in 
the world in the Bay of Fundy and the Minas Basin.  The Liberals 
felt the force of those tides in the last general election. There 
was nothing in the throne speech that will reverse those tides in 
the next federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that the fundamentals are strong when 
speaking about the economy.  It is very important to remember the 
words of John Kenneth Galbraith, the Canadian economist, who said 
that we should beware of governments who say that the 
fundamentals are strong.  The fundamentals that are important to 
Canadians are simply not strong under the leadership of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important fundamentals is the issue of brain 
drain.  The choice that each of us has, particularly young 
Canadians, in pursuing our lives and careers in Canada or in 
other countries, particularly with the mobility of populations 
that exists today, is very important.  Whether or not we are 
attracting the best and brightest to the country, and 
particularly whether we are maintaining and keeping the best and 
brightest here, is a very important fundamental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that in 1986 we lost 17,000 young Canadians to the 
U.S. through the brain drain process.  In 1997 that number had 
grown to 98,000.  Those are 98,000 of our best and brightest 
people with the education levels to contribute, to pay taxes, to 
prosper and to help provide the social infrastructure that in the 
future would allow for more economic growth and the type of 
caring society that Canadians want, but more importantly the type 
of caring society that we can afford in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another fundamental is the Canadian dollar.  Under this 
government the Canadian dollar has dropped from 77cents in 1993 to 
the 67cents range currently, with the dollar being as low as the 64cents 
range a year ago last summer.  The currency of a country 
represents in many ways the share value of that particular 
country.  Under this government, the share value of Canada has 
effectively dropped from 77cents to the mid-60cents range.  Those are 
very important fundamentals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight we are going to have an opportunity to see the screening 
of the documentary film about the former Liberal prime minister, 
Pierre Trudeau, and it is called <I>Just Watch Me: Trudeau and 
the '70s Generation</I>.  Part of that was Mr. Trudeau's response 
to the FLQ crisis at that time and the question of how far would 
he have gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that if we were to ask the Prime Minister how far he 
would go in pursuing the types of economic policies that are 
aimed at the next election, at the expense of Canadians in the 
long term, he would probably respond “Just watch me”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dollar issue is a direct reflection of the high debt levels 
we have in Canada, the 50% tax levels, the intrusive regulatory 
system and things like interprovincial trade barriers which 
reduce the competitiveness of Canadians and Canadian enterprise 
globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically, a Canadian economist, Robert Mundell, just last week 
received the Nobel prize in economics for his studies linking 
currencies to fiscal and monetary policies.  He identified the 
structural impediments of debt, tax levels and the regulatory 
burden.  Again the government has refused to listen to even a 
great Canadian economist in Robert Mundell, who has been 
recognized internationally. 
The government continues to pursue the types of policies and, in 
this speech, has promised to expand on the same types of negative 
policies that have us in the mess we are in right now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 32 pages of spending in the speech, spending tax 
distortions and regulatory spider webs but really very little 
action on the tax side.  It could be said that there may have 
been a thimble of tax reduction in a sea of new spending in the 
government's return to the unfettered, wanton spending of the 
1970s that got us in the mess we are in right now.  That, 
frankly, is where the government is heading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is now focusing on expanding program spending. 
Unfortunately, the expansion of spending is not focused on the 
real needs of Canadians.  I did a survey in the spring of my 
constituents and asked them directly what their priorities were 
and tax reduction was a major priority for my constituents, as 
was health care investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget the federal government made a symbolic 
commitment to health care by reinvesting some, and just some, of 
what it had taken from the health care system since 1993. I think 
it was a reinvestment over the period of six years of $11.5 
billion when the government had in fact taken $18 billion from 
the health care system since 1993.  By the year 2005, the 
government will only have reached, under its plan, 1995 levels of 
health care investment which does not take into account inflation 
or population growth.  The government is big on symbols but has 
really not addressed the health care crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are also concerned about defence spending and 
the government's lack of effectively investing in the defence of 
our country and in our national defence system.  We are 
increasingly being called on to participate in an increasingly 
complicated global scenario, whether it is Kosovo or East Timor, 
with a very fixed or reduced commitment if one looks at it in 
real terms to spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding that means CFB Greenwood is facing significant 
challenges now with the reduced level of government commitment. 
The government is now turning its back on the full functionality 
of CFB Greenwood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is ignoring one of the other concerns that 
Canadians have and that is our national infrastructure system, in 
particular our highway system.  Highway 101 in my riding is one 
of the most dangerous highways not just in Nova Scotia but in 
Canada.  There have been 38 deaths on the untwined parts of 
highway 101 over the past several years.  The government has not 
made the necessary commitment to highway funding.  The government 
only spends 5% of the money it takes in federal gas tax revenues 
on highway taxes.  It is the lowest of any industrialized nation. 
Again the government has not addressed a real concern of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, the government is now talking about pursuing a new 
children's agenda which is ignoring one of the most fundamental 
difficulties that Canadian families and children face. With the 
ever increasing tax burden under the government, Canadian 
families and individuals have faced a personal disposable income 
decline of 8% since 1993.  During the same period, Americans have 
enjoyed approximately a 10% increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is expanding its taxation.  It states that it 
will bring forward $16 billion of tax reductions.  Those are the 
tax reductions that the government has given through the front 
door.  What the government fails to remind Canadians is that 
through the back door, through, for instance, bracket creep, the 
government has actually taken in more than that, about $18 
billion.  The government has actually continued to plunder 
Canadians through the back door while pretending to provide some 
level of tax relief through the front door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern we have is that the government is engaging in almost 
a corporate re-imaging effort aimed at trying to convince the 
international community that somehow it is addressing some of the 
structural deficiencies in the Canadian economy.  However, it is 
doing very little to actually change those structural 
inefficiencies and impediments to actually put Canada on a growth 
track where we could have a strong dollar and a strong economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is trying to devalue its way to prosperity. 
I remember a couple of years ago when the dollar hit about 65 
cents the Prime Minister said that a low dollar was good for the 
Canadian economy and good for tourism.  Now the logical corollary 
of his argument would be that a dollar trading at zero, if we 
reduced it to zero, would be excellent for Canadian exports.  We 
could give away our goods. We would be the greatest exporting 
nation in the world.  However, the Prime Minister's economic 
logic is not really that sound in this area.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have a strong dollar and a sustained economic growth if 
we allowed Canadians to actually enjoy some of the prosperity 
that other countries are enjoying and actually took the 
initiative to provide significant tax reform and tax reduction 
and also address some of these other structural issues, the types 
of issues which were addressed under the previous government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous government had the guts to pursue policies like 
free trade, the GST, deregulation of financial services, 
transportation and energy.  They were not always popular, but 
they were the right decisions then and have proven to be the 
right decisions since then.  We just wish that this government 
would now have the vision, the courage and the guts to pursue 
those types of policies that would allow Canadians to enjoy 
sustained economic growth into the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we go to the 
hon. member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale, I just want a brief 
explanation.  The use of the word guts in that context was again 
a political metaphor.  It was not addressed for or against any 
person specifically. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps you put your finger on the problem of the speech 
from the member for Kings—Hants, whom we all respect for his 
economic perspicacity and his wit and wisdom, but sometimes 
perhaps he allows his wit to run away with his common sense and I 
suggest perhaps in today's intervention as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that the member is so oversimplifying this issue 
of tax.  I am surprised that he has laid every woe of Canadians 
at the door of high taxes.  I remember when there was a brain 
drain from his province to Toronto.  There were no tax 
differences between his province and Toronto, it was a question 
of opportunities.  I suggest to him that it is opportunities. 
Some of the measures in the Speech from the Throne, which address 
opportunities in academic and other areas which will create an 
enriched atmosphere in the country for opportunities, will 
reverse that brain drain because those opportunities will be here 
for Canadians.  That is something he has to look at as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should not say that high taxes is the reason why the 
Canadian dollar is low.  I suggest he look at the Swedish 
currency, which is very strong today.  The Swedish economy is 
booming at the moment.  Sweden has some of the highest tax rates 
in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member, with his extraordinary sophisticated 
knowledge of the working of things, drive down the single lane 
101 highway of tax reduction, which he will end up crashing 
himself and his party with the same problems he has on his 
highway down in Nova Scotia, instead of looking at all the other 
factors which we have to address when we are trying to deal with 
what is a very complex and not a single issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his, as usual, erudite, intelligent and well placed question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is a true Liberal in the traditional 1970s 
sense.  He does point to the fact that Canadians are leaving to 
find greater opportunities elsewhere.  He and I both agree that 
Canadians are leaving Canada to find greater opportunities 
elsewhere.  Where the true Liberal thing comes in is, at this 
point, where we divide.  I go one way and he goes another in 
terms of our pursuit of a solution.  He believes that government, 
through government spending, can create better opportunities in 
Canada to keep Canadians here. I believe that if the government 
reduces taxes we can create better opportunities here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the opportunities for people leaving Canada to seek 
jobs elsewhere is in part pay.  It is not all taxes; part of it 
is pay.  However pay is an instrument closely related to 
corporate tax rates.  Canada has one of the highest corporate tax 
rates in the OECD.  Last year, for instance, our corporate tax 
rates were lower than those of Italy and Japan. This year we now 
have higher corporate tax rates than Italy and Japan because 
Italy and Japan have engaged in tax reform and tax reduction on 
the corporate side.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member is sincere about pursuing greater 
opportunities for Canadians then he should unshackle Canadian 
enterprise and businesses from the burden of his party's failure 
to address corporate tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jack Mintz, one of his constituents, submitted an excellent 
report to the federal government, the Mintz report. It was 
commissioned by the federal Minister of Finance and then ignored 
by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that this hon. member listen to one of his 
constituents in Toronto Centre—Rosedale who has provided a great 
blueprint for tax reform and tax reduction in Canada.  If 
followed, it would ensure that ultimately Canadians would enjoy 
greater opportunities here and not have to seek them elsewhere 
while the government pursues 1970s policies which have been 
discredited around the world and in fact mire Canadians into less 
opportunities in the future and not more. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in the debate on the 
Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by mentioning some things that were not mentioned 
in the Speech from the Throne.  I believe it is worth mentioning 
some of them.  The government is attempting to hide from some of 
the very real concerns, some of which we are living through now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is the Donald Marshall ruling in terms of native rights, 
fishing rights, mineral rights and so on.  I should say treaty 
rights in general.  That is a huge problem in Atlantic Canada but 
obviously it has implications from one end of the country to the 
other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point it is focused on the lobster fishery simply 
because the lobster fishery is one of the most lucrative 
fisheries.  It goes far beyond that but I certainly do not have 
time in 10 minutes to go into the minute detail.  The government 
must address the issue and show some leadership on it. Up to this 
point it has not shown any leadership on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in my home riding in New Brunswick I met with very 
concerned lobster fishers on Grand Manan Island.  We have eighth 
generation fishermen who do not know whether or not they will be 
able to make a living at their fishery.  The fisheries minister 
simply hides under his desk when we talk about it.  He has yet to 
bring the native community and the non-native community together 
to make reasonable progress on this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next shoe to drop in this whole debate will be the word 
compensation.  The fishers accept the fact that the supreme court 
has ruled.  We talked about the government exercising the 
notwithstanding clause to give the fishing community time to 
resolve the issue because it does not appear as if the minister 
or the Prime Minister will resolve it.  We also talked about a 
stay of the decision.  The government obviously dropped the ball 
on that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A day after the decision can we imagine the Prime Minister of 
Canada standing up not knowing whether the government could have 
asked for a stay in the decision or at least get the government 
time to respond?  He could have done that but did not.  This 
created a crisis when a crisis could have been avoided.  That is 
a big issue that was left out of the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one is the merger of Air Canada and Canadian by Onex. It 
appears like we will be looking at an American controlled airline 
with services diminished in many parts of the country. However 
this has never been debated on the floor and was never mentioned 
in the Speech from the Throne.  Neither was the agricultural 
crisis which extends far beyond western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are focused on western Canada and low commodity prices but we 
are obviously not supporting our farmers the way we should to get 
them through this international crisis.  We are showing no sign 
that we are interested in helping them.  I think the government 
has to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing applies to the immigration policy.  We went 
through a crisis on the west coast this year in terms of illegal 
immigrants coming into Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been the response from the various ministries?  On the 
immigration crisis the minister says that winter is coming, so 
there is not a problem out there that mother nature cannot take 
care of.  In the native fishing dispute it is the same.  Winter 
is coming and the winds will blow.  Thank God for mother nature 
because the ministers will not take action when it is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go back a little on some of what I have heard from the 
government side of the House in terms of the throne speech, there 
has not been a member on the government side speaking on the 
debate who does not fall back on their financial success.  That 
just amazes me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What amazes me even more is that we on this side let them stand 
up and get away with it.  They talk about the huge deficit they 
had and the financial mismanagement that was there when they came 
to power.  It is interesting to note every success they have had. 
I do not deny they have had success in terms of balancing the 
books, but the question has to be how they balanced the books. 
That is the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my members said that it was like an old country western 
song, give me 40 acres and I will turn this rig around.  They 
turned the rig around for sure but on policies we brought in when 
we were in government.  One I want to mention is the GST.  Every 
member sitting on that side of the House fought against the GST 
from day one.  In fact most of them over there were elected on 
that.  Anyone over there elected in 1993 was elected on the false 
promise to eliminate the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite interesting that I would mention this point.  It is 
past history but it is very relevant because on the CBC radio 
program <I>Cross Country Checkup</I>, hosted by Rex Murphy, the 
Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions as a 
guest panellist responded to some of the phone calls coming in 
from across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the questions put to him was on the elimination of the 
GST, that old promise from 1993.  The minister in his own words 
said that they could not abolish the GST.  When he was asked why 
he said that it was because it was bringing in $22 billion in 
revenue.  That would simply blow away every inch of financial 
success they have had on that side of the House.  They won the 
election on the big untruth.  I know I am not allowed to use the 
word lie, but they won that election on the big untruth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member is 
not unfamiliar with skating on thin ice.  This time he went a 
little too far so I would ask the hon. member for New Brunswick 
Southwest to withdraw the term lie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly will withdraw 
that term.  In terms of the thin ice I will be like the minister. 
It is something that mother nature will take care of in the next 
few weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the junior minister of finance admits on national radio 
that they cannot get rid of the GST and that the success they had 
is because of it, it reveals exactly how thin the ice is they are 
skating on over there when they are talking about their so-called 
financial success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is probably only one member over there, the member for 
Burin—St. George's, who would agree with every word I am saying. 
He campaigned on this basis in 1997.  Anyway I think the truth 
lies in the numbers and lies in the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to examine three or four big issues.  One is free trade 
which that side railed against.  Another is the GST which that 
side railed against.  Another is tax reform which we initiated as 
the government as well as deregulation.  I am talking about 
financial sector deregulation, transportation deregulation and 
energy deregulation as in the elimination of the national energy 
program to benefit western Canada.

about what they inherited.  It was not the horror show they love 
to talk about.  Every time they get up it is quite interesting 
that the debt goes from $20 billion to $25 billion to $30 billion 
to $40 billion.  This time next year the debt they inherited will 
be up to at least $65 billion or $70 billion.  It just keeps 
growing and growing.  As the story prolongs it gets more 
exaggerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of what we attempted to do and what we will be able 
to do when we take over that side of the House.  I will entertain 
questions from my learned friends on the other side of the House. 
I look forward to it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Sudbury, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
speaking of thin ice, the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest 
was a member in the House.  Actually he sat on this side of the 
House with the Mulroney Tories when I was a member of parliament 
in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty thin ice when he starts criticizing Liberal members 
on what we have been able to do with the mess the Conservatives 
left us when they were over here for nine years.  It gets more 
and more difficult to believe he actually is telling us that we 
did not do a good job in balancing the books.  All the 
Conservatives spoke of for nine years was about what terrible 
financial shape the country was in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am an accountant by trade and there was something I really 
believed.  I really believed the Tories were good accountants. 
Can one imagine my shock when I became a member of the government 
and realized not only did they just talk but they were terrible 
accountants?  There was a huge debt with which we were saddled 
after hearing about how fiscally responsible the Conservatives 
were.  They really were not very fiscally responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then I think we have done a fairly good job considering 
the difficulties we were facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is really fun 
because we sat on the finance committee together many years ago. 
Obviously the hon. member was much younger then and time has 
erased many of those memories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that never once did she or any other member on 
the government's side of the House, including the finance 
minister, vote for or support any initiative that reduced the 
size of government or the cost of government.  In 1988 when the 
member was first elected she railed against free trade.  Free 
trade has been the biggest success story in Canada and one of the 
reasons that Ontario is leading the pack in terms of economic 
development and prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to the GST.  The member was a winner on both 
issues.  She campaigned against free trade and swallowed herself 
whole in 1997.  She campaigned on NAFTA and swallowed herself 
whole.  She did the same on the GST.  She just lucked into office 
as did the government.

was saying how great the previous government was.  Why then were 
the Conservatives reduced from a majority government to two seats 
in 1993?  Why is the member still a member of the fifth party in 
the House and not sitting on this side? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is pretty obvious. 
It is because they campaign on the big <I>l</I>.  We know what

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed the comments by the hon. member for New Brunswick 
Southwest. I cannot disagree with much of what he has said about 
the Liberal Party's campaign promises in 1993. In fact, I suggest 
that there were several big rivals told during that campaign 
which were never lived up to, the GST and free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the member for New Brunswick Southwest to clarify the 
Conservative Party's latest stand on free trade as a result of 
having David Orchard in its party, the anti-free trader. I want 
to know where the party stands on free trade these days. Has it 
taken a left turn? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess I would have to 
ask the member from that party where he stands on the UA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every party is always plagued with a problem or two.  That might 
be an intellectual hurdle over which some people will have 
trouble jumping.  I guess that is the fun of politics. The 
definition of politics is the art of the impossible. Sometimes we 
all have to practise the art of the impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does amaze me is the hypocrisy coming from the Liberals on 
the other side of the House in claiming any kind of financial 
success in terms of managing the economy when they have yet to 
bring in a major initiative to address the future of Canada in 
the life of their governments going back to 1993.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was greatly pleased with the major policy thrusts of the 
Canadian government as set out in the Speech from the Throne by 
her Excellency the Governor General and later in more detail by 
the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focal point of this vision we wish to share with our fellow 
citizens is quality of life; it will be the main thrust of our 
activities as a government and must be constantly at the centre 
of our daily concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of quality of life is a hard one to define clearly. 
The International Society for the Quality of Life Studies 
defines quality of life as the result of interaction between 
social, economic, environmental and health factors affecting 
human and social development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many Canadians, however, it is clear that the concept of 
quality of life cannot be confused with the concept of standard 
of living.  Our fellow citizens see a marked difference between 
the two concepts and do not attach the same value to both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quality of life is not measured solely against our objectives 
and successes on the economic level.  It is, of course, 
important to have a healthy economy.  Without one, we would find 
it impossible to make strategic choices for improving our 
quality of life. 
Equally important, if not more important, however, to Canadians 
is the fact that quality of live involves human investment, that 
is in health, education and skills development and in our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, economic growth and an improved standard of living must 
involve good social programs and good social policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do our fellow citizens want, then?  They want to live in a 
country where quality health care is accessible.  They want to 
live in a country where all children can receive not just a 
basic education but one that will prepare them for the realities 
of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to live in a country where all of us can improve our 
quality of life by improving our skills. 
They want to live in a country which understands that children 
are our greatest asset and which has chosen to invest in their 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to live in safe communities with green spaces, where 
their health will not be threatened by a deteriorating 
environment. Canadians want their government to achieve a 
consistent balance between social and economic objectives.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want their government to understand these needs and to be 
able to meet them in a concrete fashion. Our government 
understands that message. This is why it has chosen to make the 
improvement of Canadians' quality of life the central theme of 
its vision for the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, investing in social programs alone is not enough. Our 
investments must be in strategic areas, they must be targeted. 
They must achieve the objectives that we set for ourselves as a 
society. While it is relatively easy to measure economic 
results, it is more difficult to establish social performance 
indicators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we measure quality of life? A number of factors may give 
some indication, including life expectancy, the quality of one's 
physical environment and the crime and poverty rates, but other 
factors are subjective. For example, how do we measure social 
exclusion? In the coming months, therefore, we must work to 
improve our performance indicators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that, for the first time, the report on 
departmental performance that is to be tabled in a few days will 
include a number of social indicators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is driven by a will to improve the quality of 
life of Canadians and has made a number of commitments regarding 
strategic investments, which include, of course, economic 
investments, but also social ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are investing in our young people and in our children, 
because they are tomorrow's adults. We hope to provide them with 
the best possible start, both from a family and an educational 
perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also investing in families through various tax measures 
that will allow them to better meet the needs of their children. 
It is our hope that parents can have a real opportunity to 
improve their situation. To that end, we want to ensure that the 
development of skills is not only a priority, but also a 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also supports various sectors through research. 
Investing in research and development will allow us to remain 
competitive and to continue to develop state of the art 
technologies. We will also strive to ensure Canadians get the 
best possible care and a healthier environment. We also want to 
provide Canada with modern infrastructures, so that our country 
is ready to meet the challenges of the new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, we will work on modernizing physical infrastructures, 
and it is my firm intention to initiate quickly the dialogue 
that will enable us, by December 2000, to provide clearer 
details of this new program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada is to affirm its prosperity in the context of global 
trade, it will have to have the means to do so, that is, ensure 
transportation safety, protect the environment and encourage 
tourism and telecommunications.  The list could be long and 
will, no doubt, have to be shared with other public or private 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thought must be given to culture as well.  Canada draws much of 
its national identity from the diversity of its people.  Writers 
and artists are recording our heritage in the archives of 
history daily.  We must give them the means to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, new technologies lend themselves to all sorts of 
innovations.  It is up to us to discover how to use them to 
reduce the huge distances between people across the country. 
The Internet must be used to serve Canadians and in both 
official languages.  It must also serve the economic and 
cultural interests of Canada as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The immense possibilities offered by the information highway 
must be mastered and put to use.  It is not only a useful tool, 
but a vital one.  It may be of particular benefit to the 
population of Canada spread between the two oceans and across 
the vast northern territories.  It eliminates distances and thus 
opens to all who dare previously impassable trade borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the government wants to develop in all sectors a new 
infrastructure program in co-operation with our provincial and 
private sector partners.  This, clearly, involves strategic 
investments for the future.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government intends to build on our successes.  The previous 
infrastructure program enabled us to revitalize our economy in 
several key areas.  The next one will enable us to equip Canada 
with all the tools it will need to remain competitive and on the 
leading edge of economic and social development.  With the budget 
surplus we can consider making strategic investments that will 
help us in meeting our objective of improving the quality of life 
for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let there be no misunderstanding.  We are not talking about 
wasting the gains that have been so dearly paid for.  Each 
investment will be carefully assessed in terms of its 
effectiveness, its relation to our needs and our ability to pay 
for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must never lose sight of the fact that we are talking about 
taxpayers' money.  In recent years our government has asked the 
people of Canada to make the necessary and sometimes difficult 
sacrifices so that we could restore the health of our public 
finances.  While the time has come to reap the benefits of our 
collective efforts, it is also clear that the government is 
committed to never returning to the days when we put ourselves 
deep into debt.  Never again will we live beyond our means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going any further, allow me to quote the Prime Minister: 
“Today I have set out a comprehensive strategy, for people, for 
opportunity, for excellence, for success, for a high quality of 
life, for sharing, dignity and mutual respect, for creativity and 
innovation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simple logic holds that this strategy which centres on the 
quality of life applies to everyone without exception, including 
government employees.  As a public sector employer, it is 
incumbent upon us to attend to the development of what is 
undeniably the greatest asset of any government, the public 
service.  It is time to reaffirm our commitment to our employees. 
Everyone, public service employees, carpenters and musicians 
alike, need to feel appreciated for their efforts and in the work 
they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our employees are the representatives of the government, the 
very government that imposed budget cuts, that took away what had 
been gained, that demanded sacrifices, that caused belts to 
tighten.  It was often our employees who dealt with the public 
who had to face the backlash from angry Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A better quality of life for the people of Canada will have a 
twofold impact on our government employees.  They too will 
benefit from the overall improvement in addition to being granted 
greater recognition for their work by a public that has been 
reassured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will of course see to the well-being of our public service 
employees' needs through the Government of Canada's overall 
strategy.  I will also see to it much more directly through the 
implementation of a series of new measures throughout the public 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improving the way in which we deliver our services to the public 
is obviously a commendable objective, but we must have the means 
to do so.  That presupposes that our public service is properly 
equipped and it will be.  We will modernize our public service. 
We will renew it.  We will tailor our management to the needs of 
the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we want to create an exclusive public service, but 
time is of the essence.  In a little over four years, 40% of our 
senior managers will be eligible for retirement and it is not 
clear who will ultimately replace them.  Almost half of our 
public service employees are over the age of 45. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate my personal commitment.  We will start by providing 
stimulating work in a positive environment.  We must recognize 
and acknowledge the importance of front line staff in the 
delivery of services to the public. 
We will recruit the best and most outstanding employees.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will do everything we can to make sure that our public 
service regains the prestige once associated with it.  The Public 
Service of Canada, similar to those countries emerging from major 
transformations taking place throughout the world, will be less 
cumbersome, more technology based and, as a result, more alert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will benefit everyone:  the employers through better 
performance, the public through more efficient services, and the 
employees through acknowledgement of their work and the resulting 
sense of personal satisfaction from a job well done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, the primary responsibility for this transformation 
lies with the federal government, which is well aware of the 
needs of its public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that our union partners may be skeptical of these 
commitments by the government.  I can only reiterate my firm 
desire to undertake the necessary discussions we will need to 
have on the methods to be used to meet our mutual objectives in 
an atmosphere of partnership and dialogue, not confrontation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the end of our mandate, when the application of the measures 
announced has taken shape and when the new quality of life has 
made itself felt in Canadian homes, the federal government will 
regain its place at the top of the list among employers of 
choice.  We will have a modern, efficient and motivated public 
service that will be able and happy to assume responsibility for 
the destiny of the Canada of tomorrow.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
will soon be four months since the House of Commons recessed so 
that the Prime Minister and his Cabinet could put together the 
throne speech.  The President of the Treasury Board must 
certainly be pleased with what her leader had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, she mentioned the quality of life of all 
Canadians.  I have read and reread the throne speech, and was 
even present when the Governor General read it, but I found no 
short-term solutions to serious problems such as the fisheries 
dispute, which is worsening daily in the Atlantic provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing to put an end to the arrival of boatloads of 
immigrants on the west coast.  Nor is there any clarification of 
the government's position with respect to Onex, which would like 
to buy and merge Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, or anything 
to repair the grievous damage this government has done to health 
care, social services and postsecondary education.  There is 
nothing to put right the terrible unfairness in EI, for which 
barely 42% of unemployed workers who pay premiums qualify when 
they lose their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing to narrow the gap between rich and poor, which 
grows wider with each passing year.  I wonder whether the 
minister, the President of the Treasury Board, was one of the 
500 people who marched in Montreal yesterday to try to make 
people, especially rich people, aware of the terrible straits in 
which several hundreds of thousands of Canadians find 
themselves. 
With many, many children coming to school hungry every day, 
donations must now be sought so that they can be provided with 
breakfast and lunch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister talks about the quality of life and the 
environment of Canadians and Quebecers, can the minister tell us 
whether or not she intends to do something about these 
oversights in last week's throne speech?  I await her comments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard:</B> Mr. Speaker, what we are doing today is 
very clear: we are analyzing a throne speech. What is a throne 
speech? It is the outline of the government's vision for the 
future. This does not preclude us from focusing on short term 
problems, on everyday problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a throne speech, we look at where we have been, where we are 
now and where we are going. 
I hope the member for Frontenac—Mégantic will agree with me that, 
if one looks at the progress made over that last five or six 
years, from 1993 to 1999, the situation has improved in several 
areas in Canada. That does not mean that there are no problems 
here, even though we are fortunate enough to live in such a 
great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is far from being a perfect place. There are still some 
major problems. We talk about improving the quality of life and 
not only the standard of living—and we must make a distinction 
here in that the quality of life also implies looking at the 
social aspect of life in our society. This is what matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about improving the quality of life, it means 
improving the welfare of families, children and any person 
living in Canada. 
Poverty levels in this country are clearly unacceptable. That is 
why, for example, the Speech from Throne shows that we have a 
vision for the future with regard to families and children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, we want to focus our attention on early 
childhood, to give our young children a good start in life, to 
help families with children, to reduce their tax burden. Then, 
we will increase the child tax benefit, which is paid to low 
income families to help them meet their children's needs so they 
do not have to rely on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a clear commitment to help children, to give some people 
a chance to break free from poverty. Moreover, the throne speech 
leaves the door open for further improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government's commitment to improve the quality of life of 
Canadians says it all. We recognize the fact that our country is 
great compared to others, but we still have to work together to 
improve the quality of life of Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
brief, but I would like to ask my colleague a few questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She says that the Liberal government has done a good job in the 
past six years. I do not know where she was, because in the 
Atlantic provinces, the Liberals have lost nearly all their 
seats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for students, by the time they get their degree, they have a 
debt load of $30,000.  If two graduates form a couple, they are 
saddled with $60,000 in debt before they even get a home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 800,000 workers who do not qualify for employment 
insurance. Women need to have worked 700 hours to qualify.  So 
what about all these young workers and women workers?  If there 
are 800,000 workers who do not qualify for employment insurance, 
how many hungry children does that create? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of food banks has gone up 10% more in recent years. 
Where do the children fit in here?  Where has the Liberal 
government been these past six years?  It has merely been 
following in the footsteps of the Conservatives, who started the 
employment insurance cuts in 1986, and the Liberals are just 
continuing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister does not believe this, let her leave Ontario and 
Quebec and come to New Brunswick and the rest of the Atlantic 
provinces to see what is going on, to see how people are having 
trouble making ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I went across Canada on my employment insurance fact-finding 
tour, that is what I found.  People are hungry.  It is not the 
tiny change mentioned in the throne speech that is going to make 
any significant change for women.  Women do not quality for 
employment insurance if they have worked less than 700 hours in 
a year.  The change the minister is proposing is a minimal one. 
I would like her comments on this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I also said in my 
presentation today that, if we have come this far in Canada, it 
is because we asked huge sacrifices of Canadians, not just 
workers but all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, when we were faced with an incredible debt, a $42 
billion deficit and a stagnant economy, what did we have to do? 
We had to put in place a very restrictive plan for the use of 
all our resources and we had to make major cuts. The public was 
behind us, it was supportive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, I do not think Canadians would ever again allow a 
government to accumulate such a huge deficit. 
So, Canadians agreed with our initiatives and they are the ones 
who made these sacrifices. There is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of these circumstances, we were able to get the economy 
going again and keep our inflation rate very low while 
maintaining interest rates at an acceptable level. The national 
unemployment rate has gone down and we have managed to preserve 
social programs, although they had to be redefined. Clearly, 
that redefinition of our social programs affected some groups 
more than others. This is why the government, in its throne 
speech, demonstrated its commitment to making investments 
wherever necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impacts of our employment insurance reform were significant, 
because that was a comprehensive reform. We are currently 
looking at these impacts with a view to making improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we find in the throne speech? It deals with the parental 
leave for women, for example. Did I not hear the hon. member for 
Acadie—Bathurst say “Congratulations on extending the parental 
leave from six months to one year and making it more 
accessible”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Yes, three times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard:</B> Now that we have a budget surplus, we 
want all Canadians to benefit from it, first through a tax 
reduction and, second, by making strategic investments to help 
those groups that need it most, whether in eastern Canada, in 
Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula or in western Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure today to address our response to the throne 
speech.  Personally, my response to this has been a bit of a 
defining moment, trying to make up my mind whether to run again 
and maybe take over from this motley crew on the other side or 
whether to forget it and go home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought perhaps I should try to understand what would be in 
the throne speech.  I made a little list for myself to see if 
certain things would be addressed.  I even made a list about 
aboriginal issues for the previous minister on the other side.  I 
am glad she is here because I have a few things to say about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the issues in the throne speech that I wanted to see 
addressed more specifically, along with a lot of people 
throughout the country, were issues like child pornography.  What 
will the government do about that?  It has messed it up and left 
it to the courts.  Let us see it in the throne speech.  That was 
one of my top issues on the list because I think that is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will prison reform be in the throne speech?  Will that long 
overdue issue be addressed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the age of sexual consent be addressed?  Both the Liberals 
and the other crew down there had a lot to do with that a few 
years ago and in fact reduced the age of sexual consent from 16 
to 14.  Will it be changed back to 16? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the growing issue of aboriginal affairs be addressed, in 
particular on the east and west coasts, but in many other parts 
of the country as well?  One member said it was, but I will get 
into that debate in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the real issue of taxes, a real commitment on taxes, with 
timelines, be addressed?  Taxes were mentioned but the timelines 
were not, the legislation was not and the details of the 
legislation were not.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In most cases anything that was even generally addressed in the 
throne speech would have to be turned into legislation.  Most of 
us know that it is probably less than two years before the next 
election.  As House leader I can say that turning these general 
commitments into legislation before the next election is not 
going to happen.  So much for commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the old Young Offenders Act, now called the Youth 
Criminal Justice Act?  The Liberals changed the name but will 
they make commitments on when it will be changed and what will be 
changed in it?  I believe this is now the fourth, count them, 
throne speech in which the government has mentioned those 
changes, yet we see no changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the airline industry issues? I asked myself whether 
that would be included. It is certainly a concern for many 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the problems in the immigration and refugee 
department.  They are long outstanding difficulties.  I have 
spoken many times in the House about what some of the problems 
are with the numerous appeals and on and on it goes.  Will they 
be addressed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the issue of the Senate?  Will we ever see a reformed 
Senate?  The Liberals may have wanted to mention something like 
that in the throne speech. How about things like free votes?  How 
about some substantive details about how we are going to fix the 
unity issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defining moment came for me when I read the document which 
was really a rhetorical PR piece.  We know that essentially it 
will take legislation and the courage of all of us in the House 
to change things.  I can say that legislation will not be 
forthcoming, at least not to the point where it receives royal 
assent.  They may play with it but it is not going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue I want to talk about is drugs.  About seven 
months ago the Liberal government came out with a national drug 
strategy document.  I looked through the document and thought 
here we go again, lots of rhetoric lacking substance.  I did some 
checking. The other guys down there, Joe what's his name and the 
other fellas, the Conservatives, brought out a national drug 
strategy in the eighties.  I compared their national drug 
strategy with the national drug strategy of the Liberals.  Lo and 
behold, I sincerely believe both were written by the same person. 
Hardly anything changed; it was virtually the same document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took the Liberals' document to many places across the country, 
from downtown east side Vancouver to small cities across the 
country, Nova Scotia included.  I asked them to look at this 
national drug strategy and to tell me how it affected them.  They 
told me that it was a waste of their time and mine, that the 
strategy was no good and not effective at the street level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately a few comments were made in the throne speech.  I 
think it was primarily because the Reform Party has been nagging 
the government on this for some time.  I do not believe the 
government has a strategic plan in mind to combat drugs, 
organized crime and all the other things that go with it, nor do 
I think it has the will or the desire to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from an area which has 15,000 addicted people, many who 
are young teens.  I come from an area outside Vancouver where the 
downtown east side has around 6,000 addicts.  This is just one 
area in our country.  Go to Toronto, Ottawa or small towns. Go to 
Sydney or Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. 
All of those places have serious problems with drug addiction, 
yet when I read the throne speech, there are platitudes. There is 
no commitment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to some ministers who said that they gave $5 million to 
British Columbia after the opposition parties nagged them.  They 
threw out $5 million over a period of two years.  This is petty 
cash.  The Liberals do not say that the drug issue is a health 
issue.  They say it is an issue and they will fix it by throwing 
some money at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to work with quite a few people who have family members 
who are addicted to drugs and I can say what their opinion is of 
a government with no plan.  They have long past given up the idea 
of being upset about it.  They have long past given up the idea 
of thinking this is the place to resolve problems.  They are now 
hunkered down waiting for someone to help them, not a government, 
some one or two people in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at a blueprint, a model, a plan called a throne speech 
and I can see that we have a government with status quo in mind. 
Don't worry, be happy, things are working right.  We will get 
into the spotlight.  We will tell all that it is working great. 
Patch it a bit, fix it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These things I mentioned are not working.  There is no 
commitment from the government. Where there is no commitment from 
a government, the government should remove itself or the people 
looking for the commitment will do the removing for it. I expect 
a lot of people will be running in the next election, not because 
they want to get into politics but because there is no plan in 
the nation, no commitment, no strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want something done about drugs.  We want something done 
about child pornography, prisons, the age of sexual consent, 
aboriginal problems, taxes, crime, young offenders, the airline 
industry, the immigration and refugee system, the Senate, free 
votes.  If we get around to trying to fix that, we will find that 
perhaps unity will be somewhat resolved.  But that takes courage 
and I am not sure the government has it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's comments particularly 
with regard to the lack of substance in the throne speech. I 
could not help but agree with what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned child pornography, immigration, a whole bunch of 
justice issues. I have been in this House since 1993 and I have 
come to the conclusion that the government does not have the will 
to do what it was duly elected to do.  By that I mean the 
government wants to be politically correct.  Any of these issues 
that are of any moral or justice substance the government wants 
to pass on to the courts and I strongly disagree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member think we were sent down here to help draft 
the laws and address the wrongs of our laws instead of the 
lawyers and the judges who are not an elected body? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this concept is very near 
and dear to the hearts of most Canadians.   Who actually makes 
laws in this country, the elected people, the representatives 
from all over the country in this place, or the judges appointed 
by the government of the day?  That is a valid question. There 
was never any question in my mind about who it should be.  It 
should be the elected officials.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty I have is this delegation of authority.  If it 
were only the judiciary, I think we could find a way around that 
perhaps by appointing judges for seven years instead of for life, 
or electing judges, we could find answers to make them 
accountable for their decisions, but it is not.  The government 
appoints bodies, refugee boards, immigration boards, parole 
boards, that tend to have autonomy within our system. When 
questions are asked in the House of Commons, ministers say “I do 
not know.  It is not my fault, it is their fault”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is the government of the day has delegated too much 
responsibility.  At the same time it has not issued 
accountability within those areas it has delegated to. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with some intent to the hon. member opposite. 
I want to ask him two questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question is I wonder what he thought there was to gain 
by bashing the judiciary?  These judges are people of integrity 
and great stature, people whose job it is to interpret the laws 
as made by parliament.  I wonder exactly what his game plan is in 
terms of trying to bash these honourable people, people who do 
the right thing most of the time in terms of what they do and 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question I have is that the hon. member spoke about 
running for parliament and being around to do the right thing in 
terms of caring for the country.  Is he planning on doing that 
the next time, or is he going to jump ship and seek provincial 
politics? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be really interested in answers to both of those 
questions, the honour of the judiciary and where his commitment 
lies in terms of parliament vis-à-vis the provincial political 
arena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know what this 
jumping ship is.  Rumour has it that I am running for the 
Liberals in B.C.  Give your head a shake. It is interesting to 
see how the Liberals here are much enamoured with the Liberals in 
British Columbia.  We will remember to bring that message back 
home to those who say they do not have any association with these 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the more serious question of the two, it is 
interesting with those fellows over there. If a person speaks out 
about and issue and thinks he is right about it, for instance, a 
judge says that the possession of child pornography is legal and 
a person speaks out about that, or a judge like Howard Weston in 
Manitoba who says that all federal penitentiary prisoners— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry, but some 
months ago we had already agreed that we were not going to 
mention specific judges.  We can refer to the judiciary, but not 
to judges specifically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if an individual, in 
particular people in this House, disagree with that, the Liberals 
call it bashing instead of articulating what one believes in. If 
an individual dislikes what is going on in any portion of the 
immigration proceedings, and I have had lots of experience trying 
to get criminals deported from this country, they call it racism. 
The problem is that those individuals over there have no argument 
to articulate other than “You are bashing, you are bashing, you 
are bashing”.  That is sad.  Perhaps they should learn a little 
more about what they are supposed to be talking about before they 
put legislation in place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to begin my intervention in this debate by 
welcoming the new human resources development minister.  This is 
a huge area.  I have been the critic in this area for quite some 
time.  I know this minister is committed to doing a good job.  I 
will certainly commit to helping her with the best advice I can 
give on how to carry out her responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second session of the 36th Parliament and the throne speech 
which opened it were the subject of more hype and convenient 
leaks than in any previous session in my time in this place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1330

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent weeks we had media carrying many interviews with 
cabinet ministers and all sorts of insider leaks promoting the 
expectation that the government had an imaginative plan of vision 
for the future of Canada as we enter the next century and the 
next millennium.  With the opening of parliament delayed by three 
whole weeks for the government to get this just right, we all 
waited with bated breath for this wonderful vision to come 
forward.  What happened?  The throne speech contained the usual 
Liberal feel good rhetoric and much less actual content than was 
expected even on the big centrepiece, the children's agenda. 
There is no clear vision as we enter the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme of the Prime Minister's speech when he followed up in 
the House was emotive jargon:  hope, confidence, optimism, 
working together, boldness of vision, courage to act, best 
country in the world, et cetera.  He reiterated all of the usual 
bromides:  society of excellence, strong, united, dynamic, 
innovative, diverse, cohesive, sharing, every child gets the 
right start in life, young people with a chance to grow, access 
to skills, quality health care; all of the things that nobody in 
the House, let alone the whole country, would disagree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was missing was one single, solitary, cohesive plan with 
specifics on how to achieve these wonderful things that we all 
want for our country.  This is the lack of leadership that we 
suffer from in this country:  a Prime Minister without specifics, 
simply falling back on platitudes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case people listening think that of course we are going to 
say this in the opposition, let me quote from some commentators. 
Andrew Coyne called it “a compendium of bland truisms and vague 
declarations of intent”.  Another commentator said the speech 
shows the government as being “bereft of vision”.  Even the 
normally Liberal-friendly Toronto <I>Star</I> noted that the 
speech was full of platitudes and short on specifics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a sound vision in this country.  We need some specifics. 
Where are we going?  What is it going to cost?  Where is the 
money coming from?  What will be the benefits to people?  There 
was none of that, just some nice emotional words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To top it all off, the Prime Minister had the nerve to call all 
of this the Canadian way.  It is the Liberal way.  It is the 
Liberal way of muddiness and fuzziness and murkiness and feel 
good rhetoric, without delivering the sensible, sound, specific 
plan this country needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Liberal way?  It is bureaucratic meddling; intrusive 
government; Ottawa knows best, especially how to spend our money; 
no hope for workers to keep more of what they earn, but instead 
they can expect to keep half of what they earn; no liberation 
from excessive taxes; more and more of the nanny state, a model 
that has failed over and over across the world; and no vision for 
the future that would appeal to our best and brightest young 
minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Liberal agenda?  After all of the words, after all 
of the speeches, we do not really know for sure.  All we can do 
is examine their past behaviour, their past record of missing the 
obvious.  Remember, it was these Liberals who were opposed to 
free trade, the only thing practically that is carrying our 
economy today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the other important issues that are burning in 
Canadians' minds?  What about agriculture?  Our farmers have lost 
virtually all of their income.  Their income has fallen to 2% of 
what they earned last year.  Would anybody in this House like to 
have his or her income cut by 98%?  Would there not be a hue and 
cry for something to be done?  There was not a mention by the 
government on how to deal with these people in crisis across our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about immigration?  We have solid people from across the 
world lining up to be in this country.  What happens?  We have 
people smuggling and illegal entrants taking up those spaces that 
could be taken by people who have a commitment to doing things 
the way the law says they should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about defence?  We have a military that is literally 
falling apart and falling out of the sky.  There was not a word 
about how to restore the pride that we used to have in our 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the fishery?  There is violence in a country like 
Canada:  people against people, citizens against citizens, 
community against community.  Yet, this visionary government did 
not even mention that, never mind come out with a plan to address 
it.  It is a shame.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are totally out of touch with Canadians.  Canadians 
want less government, not more.  They want to keep the money they 
earn.  They do not want to have to turn it over to government, 
which then says “Have we got a program for you”.  These 
programs simply do not cut it for the majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One commentator spoke about the only specific in the Prime 
Minister's speech, which was to extend maternity leave.  The 
commentator said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadians were taxed less, they could have a whole range of 
choices.  Taxes are the business of government.  Parenting is 
not. If this government truly wants to help Canadian kids, it 
should ease the tax burden on parents. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need flexibility and choices as parents and as citizens of 
this country, but no, the government wants to take our money, put 
us into its little box, its little program and it will decide 
what we can choose.  It decides where we can go.  It decides what 
kinds of choices are available to us.  That is not the way to run 
a good country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Liberal record that my colleagues have talked about 
so many times over the last few days; a government that says it 
will give tax relief when in fact it is taking $2 billion more in 
taxes next year than it did last year.  That is not tax relief, 
except to a Liberal who wants to say one thing but do the total 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about health care?  Health care transfers have been cut. 
Cash transfers are still over $4 billion a year below what they 
were when the government took office.  That is $4 billion that 
should be going into health care services in the country which 
the Liberals have taken out and not returned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about wanting to help our children.  Look 
at its track record on that.  Ask aboriginal children how well 
the government has looked after them.  Many of them are living in 
poverty and squalor, and they lack services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about military families who are getting by on subsistence 
wages with substandard housing?  The government is totally 
responsible for the wages and housing of our military and their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about farm families, children who are losing their entire 
heritage while the government stands by without a word? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the children whose parents have hepatitis C from the 
ineptness of government?  The government says “Sorry, your 
parents cannot get insurance.  They cannot get mortgage 
insurance.  They cannot do a lot of the things they need to 
provide for you and your future.  Too bad, you lose”.   That is 
how the government looks after children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already mentioned health cuts.  How do they impact 
parents and children?  Yet, the government has the nerve to say 
it cares about children and families when everything it has done 
in the past shows completely the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a plan that will really carry us into the future, with 
something solid that we can count on and something that really 
gives us choice, flexibility and a bright future.  That plan was 
enunciated in the House by the Leader of the Opposition in a 
speech that had the substance that this tired, sad, incompetent 
government failed to deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend to all Canadians the plan we have put forward, which 
would give real choice, flexibility, freedom and the protection 
of family resources and the resources for which we all work so 
that we could build the future we want together.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my colleague for Calgary—Nose Hill.  I 
thought she gave a very thoughtful analysis of the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see some commentators have taken to calling this the drone 
speech rather than the throne speech in that it lacks a vision 
for our country entering a new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought my colleague said it pretty well, but I am really 
interested in her analysis of the government's 50:50 proposal for 
spending our so-called surplus. 
I would like to find out where my colleague stands on the whole 
issue of 50:50.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my mind it sounds good.  However, I think the Canadian public 
are being fooled into thinking that 50% will go toward new 
spending and 50% will go toward the reduction of the debt and the 
massive tax burden in this country.  In fact, we are finding out 
that basically there is no surplus to split 50:50.  I would like 
to have her analysis of that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the real issue is, is 
government spending enough of our money or not?  That is the real 
question that Canadians will be asking themselves.  Most 
Canadians are saying that the government spends enough of their 
money and that it spends a whole lot more of their money than it 
should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our money is burning a hole in the pocket of the government.  It 
thinks of wonderful new ways to spend it, like sending young 
people across the country who are trying to get an education, 
some skills training and looking forward to a stable job with a 
decent income.  It thinks of feel good programs instead of the 
substance that our country needs.  Then the government says “We 
are going to spend half of your money for you because we know 
better”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question for Canadians is, do they want government 
spending more and more of their money?  Or, do they want to say 
to the government that it is spending enough, that it needs to 
put some of the money it has been spending on wasteful, frivolous 
things back into key programs like health care, solid education 
for our children, proper salaries for our military and addressing 
the real problems of this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let Canadians spend their own money.  They will do it better 
than the government.

people across the nation and it is a very broad and serious 
problem.  We always look for explanations, and I am sure that she 
does not have any.  I know I do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like her to comment on why in the world a government 
that has been in power for the length of time that this 
government has would continually ignore the auditor general's 
statements which blasted the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development for its lack of accountability in looking 
after these matters.  Why does the government continually ignore 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, I commend my 
colleague from Wild Rose who has spent more time talking to real 
aboriginals about their real life problems than, I would dare 
say, either the minister or anyone in the minister's department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the government cares more about its image, its 
legacy, about politicking and feel good words than it really does 
about doing something serious, practical and specific for the 
people of this country.

Saint-Lambert, which gives my riding its name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is the case with many urban ridings in Canada, contrasts 
abound between and within these four municipalities.  They are 
essentially suburbs of Montreal—what are often referred to as

globalization and technological innovation increasingly 
transforming not just relations between countries but also the 
daily lives of all citizens, I feel we must pay special 
attention to the life of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I believe that one of the vital roles of the 
governments of today, as well as of each and every member of 
this House, must be to work toward the economic and social 
integration of all those who are at risk of being pushed aside 
in a competition-, innovation- and knowledge-based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, the situation of the homeless is a particular 
concern.  It is true that this is a problem that is hard to get 
a proper handle on.  There is no typical homeless person, 
although we are too often tempted to lump them all in together 
without thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, all homeless people have their own stories, their 
own experiences, their own lives. 
They may be children abandoned by their parents, ruined 
businessmen, battered women, aboriginal people who have not 
managed to integrate into big city life, refugee claimants, or 
people who have been released from correctional or psychiatric 
institutions and are having difficulties fitting back into 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People end up on the street for all kinds of reasons.  Among the 
main causes of homelessness are:  mental illness, family 
violence, addiction, poverty, loss of income, less affordable 
housing, and migration to major urban centres. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ottawa, our nation's capital, an estimated 4,500 people 
including 375 families with children are homeless.  As a matter 
of fact, the fastest growing group of homeless is families with 
children, and 18% of the homeless population of Ottawa are 
children under the care of single parents. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the street, all suffer in the same way, young and old, 
university graduates and the functionally illiterate, members of 
our first nations and recent immigrants; all are discriminated 
against in the same way.  What almost all of them have in common 
is the fact that they did not choose this lifestyle and cannot 
change it unaided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take great pride in being part of a government that has set 
itself the priority of improving the quality of life for all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, we set up several programs specifically for the 
homeless. However, these measures could lose their effectiveness 
and end up being too scattered if they were not all co-ordinated 
by a single minister. Fortunately, the Minister of Labour and 
federal co-ordinator for activities related to the homeless 
displays remarkable energy and sensitiveness in dealing with 
this delicate and complex task. The Canada-wide tour that she did 
this summer to consult stakeholders shows that she is taking 
that responsibility very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the governor general read the throne speech last week, I 
was very pleased to hear her say that “the Government will 
continue working with its partners in all sectors to address the 
root causes of homelessness”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, even a government with the best of intentions, or all 
levels of government working together, can never solve the 
problem of homelessness without the support of the whole 
population. Homelessness is a societal problem that must 
absolutely be dealt with by society as a whole. It is imperative 
that we develop common approaches and initiatives with all 
public administrations, community groups, educational 
institutions, the private sector and everyone who wants to 
contribute to the betterment of their community. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadian citizens we are justly proud of our first place 
ranking in the United Nations human development index, but such 
classifications are meaningless for the individuals who struggle 
every day to find something to eat and do not know where they 
will be sleeping at night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years successive Canadian and provincial governments 
have achieved much, more than most countries in fact, to provide 
Canadians with an effective and affordable social safety net, but 
we still have a very long way to go before coming to grips with 
the problem of homelessness.  Homelessness is growing in number 
and diversity at an accelerated pace. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians are about to celebrate, in their own way, the 
arrival of a new century and a new millennium. This is an 
opportunity for us to proudly celebrate a remarkable past and to 
look confidently to a promising future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the occasion of my first speech in this house, I am making 
the wish that, during these celebrations, we never forget that 
thousands of our fellow citizens need us in an urgent and 
critical way. We must listen to them. We must speak to them from 
the heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are of course no homeless people in this house. However, 
each and everyone of us here represents some of these people in

to a brighter future.

continue working with its partners in all sectors to address the 
root causes of homelessness and to help communities respond to 
the needs of their members for shelter and other support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too listened 
to our colleague's speech.  The problem with the government is 
that it talks a lot but does nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there was the appointment of the minister for the 
homeless, an appointment without portfolio.  Then employment 
insurance. This I will repeat until the next election: How will 
people manage, especially the women, many of whom work part time 
and cannot obtain employment insurance because of the number of 
hours required? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like our colleague to tell us what this government, 
which she so strongly believes in, intends to do or should do if 
it really wants to help the homeless in the country, not only in 
words but in deeds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Yolande Thibeault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for his remarks.  The Prime Minister has already taken a big 
step by asking a minister to take on the problem of the 
homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a relatively recent problem.  It is new in the scope it 
has assumed in recent years.  I remember watching American 
television programming on street people and reading reports in 
American papers about them, like many of you. We thought the 
Americans had a problem and one that we would not want here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, however, it has arrived here now, and I am sure, 
with all the work the Minister of Labour is doing at the moment, 
we will have results very soon.  In any case, I hope so and I 
hope we will have the co-operation of all the members of this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this past 
weekend hundreds of non-native fishers and their families 
converged in Yarmouth to express their anger over the federal 
government's handling of the fishing crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the minister's claim of having a solution in hand on 
Friday, we discovered there was no such solution, which was why 
he had to appoint an independent negotiator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>West Nova fishers have very little faith in the government's 
ability to find a solution to this crisis.  Why should they? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of Indian affairs said that we were overemphasizing 
the crisis.  After all, winter was setting in, not many people 
would be fishing and nobody's livelihoods are at stake.  For his 
part, the fisheries minister said that he wants a long term 
solution before the next fishing season in the spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously these gentlemen do not realize that the most lucrative 
lobster fishery is set to begin in West Nova at the end of 
November.  Our fisher's livelihoods are at stake and I think they 
have a right to be concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the government not take the crisis seriously and 
immediately implement short term solutions that would at least 
see all fishers respect pre-established fishing seasons in the 
name of conservation?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>TAXATION 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government's first act of the new millennium will be 
to raise taxes.  On January 1, Canada pension plan premiums will 
rise by $2.3 billion and bracket creep will pull hundreds of 
thousands of Canadians into higher tax brackets, which is not 
exactly a cheery way to enter the new year.  We now have poverty 
groups, family groups, small business associations and even the 
banks calling for a substantive tax cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government to start the new century with a tax hike 
instead of a tax cut? 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the preamble to the hon. member's question is totally 
false.  We will be starting the new millennium with tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However let us deal with the issue of the Canada pension plan. 
It is under the joint stewardship of the provinces and the 
federal government.  The provinces and the federal government 
came together and decided to preserve the Canada pension plan for 
countless generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue before the Canadian people is what the Reform Party 
has against the Canada pension plan.  Why does it want to see it 
disappear and why did it vote against it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister is avoiding the issue.  The statements in 
the Speech from the Throne about tax relief are half-truths. Over 
the same period that the government promises $16 billion in tax 
relief it increases taxes by $18 billion for a net increase in 
taxes of $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government again why it is starting the new millennium 
not with genuine tax relief but with a tax hike. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, once again the hon. member simply does not know the 
facts.  With the tax cuts of the government over the course of 
the next three years we have more than covered inflation or 
bracket creep.  Those are real tax cuts on top of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue before the Canadian people is not the bogus 
arithmetic of the Reform Party.  It is why does it not come up 
with a plan Canadians can believe in, one that does not hide an 
agenda and is not opposite to the basic values of Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the finance minister has notes in his margin that say 
“argument weak, yell like hell”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are these.  When workers look at their paycheques the 
taxes are increased, not decreased.  When a mother looks at her 
family budget at the end of the month she has less money to spend 
because of the minister's taxes and not more.  Businesses are 
going to the United States and not staying here because of the 
tax policies of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why after six years of broken promises should Canadians believe 
the minister when he says that now he will decrease taxes? 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I guess Canadians should believe the government because 
we know the facts and the hon. member obviously does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Real disposable incomes in Canada have not only stabilized but 
now for the first time in over a decade they are beginning to 
rise.  The hon. member is wrong.  Unemployment in the country is 
now at its lowest level in over 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member would like to see a perspective on the 
Canadian economy and the net result of what the government has 
done, I would simply ask him to look at the Royal Bank report 
which came out today.  It basically says that the country is 
cooking on all cylinders. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do 
not know if the country is cooking on all cylinders but I do know 
that taxpayers are getting roasted thanks to this finance 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 1, bracket creep will raise taxes by a billion 
dollars.  That is according to the finance department's own 
books.  He should listen to his own finance department.  He 
always talks about reducing taxes but all of his actions are to 
increase taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the finance minister really has the courage of his 
convictions, why will he not eliminate bracket creep on January 
1?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member simply ought to take a look at reality. 
The reality is that our tax cuts have taken care of bracket creep 
and much more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he does not have to believe me.  Let me simply quote 
that “the taxation arrow is now pointing in the right direction, 
down.  It behoves us then to offer a polite nod of thanks in the 
direction of the federal finance minister”.  I hate to say it, 
but that is what he said.  He goes on to say, for all the 
lecturing Ralph Klein did in the mid-1990s about how Ottawa needs 
to get its budgetary books in order like we did at the time, 
Klein and Day have been left in the dust by Ottawa.  That is the 
Calgary bunch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I remind hon. members not to use any props 
in questions or answers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
will be noted how the finance minister always runs away from the 
question.  For someone who is pursuing the leadership of the 
Liberal Party that is not a great quality.  I suggest maybe he 
wants to focus on the question this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is again for the finance minister.  He knows this is 
the case.  On January 1 taxes will take another $1 billion out of 
the pockets of Canadians; 85,000 Canadians will join the tax 
rolls for the first time.  If he really believes in tax relief, 
why does he not begin with a tax cut on January 1?  Why will he 
not eliminate bracket creep? 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the fact is that on January 1 taxes are going down. 
Taxes went down on July 1.  Next year they are going down $3.9 
billion.  Since we have taken office EI premiums have gone down 
$4 billion.  That is what they are going down.  A substantial 
increase of $1.8 billion in the child tax benefit, that is money 
that will be found in the pockets of middle and low income 
Canadians with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that taxes have gone down every year 
since we have balanced the budget and they will keep on going 
down.

is the investigation that Telefilm should be doing.  It should 
give me a file so I can lay criminal charges”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  In view 
of the links that appear to exist between the chairman of the 
board of Telefilm and one of names used by CINAR, is it the

<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>

the agriculture, environment, natural resources, and fisheries

all along, which is to apply for a stay of judgment in the

everyone involved and second, to give time to determine the 
future role of non-aboriginals in the fisheries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and

is very clear. We very much respect the supreme court ruling that 
there is a treaty right.  We said that we would live within the 
spirit of that judgment. In fact, there was a meeting this 
morning with chiefs from Atlantic Canada to look at how we can 
move on the process.  My colleague the Minister of Indian Affairs

how we can look at the broader implications and continue that

hundreds of boats in the harbour and potential for violence 
hanging over everybody's head.

reasons.  First of all, it was the first time that all

increasing the organ donation rate a national priority. Second, 
we formed a national council to help make that happen. The 
provinces very importantly have agreed to invest the kind of

in hospitals to counsel those who are the relatives of the dying

If he is put in a maximum institution and there is some 
improvement, he goes to a medium institution.  Before he is

today that the panel on ecological integrity in Canada's national

serious trouble, that the ecological integrity principle that the

consistently, and that scientific talent is thin in the parks.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the government actually launched the ecological

are at risk ecologically when they spend too much time on

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we receive the final results of the ecological integrity

say unequivocally that when this panel report comes down and 
Canadians see clearly that it is not just Banff but many other 
parks that are at risk, that for the first time ecological 
integrity will become number one, with us no longer being enticed 
by the thrill of turning our national parks more and more into an 
opportunity for making money instead of enjoying what little is 
left of nature that has not been exploited by commercialism?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, when we struck the panel the reason I personally

the former deputy minister and is known and respected by people 
concerned with ecology around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that we need an ecological template for all of 
Canada's national parks.  The Banff-Bow Valley study was a

that ecological integrity is the number one clarion call for 
every park in Canada.

Indian Affairs intimated last week that the Marshall decision 
went beyond the issue of fishing rights for native peoples and 
included all natural resources, namely forestry, the gathering 
of wild fruits and the extraction of natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My very simple question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  Is

and Northern Development is meeting with the aboriginal 
communities from Atlantic Canada right now.  We are doing what we 
said we would do, which is to have a dialogue and make sure that 
we talk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court ruling clearly said that there is a treaty 
right for fishing, for gathering and for hunting.  We respect 
that right.  Now we need to make sure that we get around the 
table and start working with the parties that are affected, 
including the provincial governments, to come to a long term 
solution.

was to co-ordinate the issue of homelessness because of all the

“Fighting organized crime is the number one law enforcement

recently referred to organized crime in Canada as an epidemic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If fighting organized crime is the number one priority of the

CPIC $115 million to make sure it was brought up to date.  We put 
$18 million into a DNA databank.  I am very pleased the

earthquake in Taiwan, many countries, including the United 
States, Germany, Japan and Russia immediately sent search and 
rescue teams.  Why did the Liberal government refuse to send 
Vancouver's respected urban search and rescue team both to help 
in the rescue and to get badly needed experience?  And, why did 
the Government of Canada not strongly refuse China's outrageous 
interference with the delivery of humanitarian aid at this time

well as to the Red Cross.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would strengthen property rights in federal law. 
Unfortunately, property rights were intentionally left out of the 
charter of rights and freedoms, leaving Canadians highly 
vulnerable to the arbitrary taking of property by government; 
legally owned property like legally acquired satellite dishes and 
firearms.  My bill would fix this by making it more difficult for 
the government to override the property rights of its citizens by 
requiring a two-thirds majority vote of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill also strengthen the property rights provisions of the 
Canadian Bill of Rights by providing protection of our right to 
have compensation fixed impartially, protection of our right to

violates their property rights.

couriers, the people who deliver our mail in the country.  Our 
point is these are not independent contractors as such, they are 
wholly dependent on Canada post for all they do. Therefore, the 
relationship is more that of an employer and an employee and not 
an independent contractor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Canada Post Corporation Act specifically bars them 
from bargaining collectively.  They are not allowed to organize 
into a union or take part in free collective bargaining.  We 
think this is wrong. They are the only group of workers in the 
country who are specifically barred from organizing a union.

or whatever.  We want workers to feel comfortable and free to 
blow the whistle on these illegal, immoral or unethical things 
without worrying about losing their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the bill, the whistle blower would go to the auditor 
general who would then investigate and find out if it was made in 
good faith.  If it was, he would go to the minister in charge and 
cause an investigation to take place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.)</B>  moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-243, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
(dangerous offender). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward this 
private member's bill which will amend the Criminal Code 
regarding dangerous offenders where an inmate may be declared a 
dangerous offender at any time during his incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past 10 years a report has been sent out by the solicitor 
general's office indicating that there has been a total of 2,292 
new victims of violent crime at the hands of violent offenders 
who were released from prison either mandatorily or on probation. 
This enactment would prevent the release of such people as Mr. 
Auger who managed to murder Melanie Carpenter a few years ago. 
It would prevent what is going on this very day in Edmonton where 
an effort is being made to warn society of another dangerous sex 
perpetrator who is being released in that city. 
Releasing these kinds of individuals does not protect Canadian 
society.  This bill would prevent further problems in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.)</B>  moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-244, an act to provide for the taking of samples 
of blood for the benefit of persons administering and enforcing 
the law and good Samaritans and to amend the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, last year there was a very unfortunate 
incident in my riding.  A young man apprehended a thief who was 
shoplifting from a store and unfortunately quite a bit of the 
perpetrator's blood spilled on him. There is no legal way to 
force that thief to give a blood sample for disease testing.  For 
several months afterward the young man and his family went 
through the emotional anguish of extensive drug prevention 
therapy just in case there was HIV present.  It was also a very 
expensive and a very trying time for the entire family and 
especially for the young man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will eliminate the terrible emotional anguish for good 
Samaritans who find themselves in similar circumstances in the 
future. The rights of police officers, health professionals and 
good Samaritans who try to protect life and stop crime must take 
precedence over the rights of the perpetrators of any wrongdoing.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>HEPATITIS C 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I have received a request from the 
hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve for an emergency debate, 
pursuant to Standing Order 52. 
<P><A NAME="LINK275"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 52 of the House of Commons, I am 
asking this house to hold an emergency debate on government 
compensation for victims of hepatitis C who were infected by 
blood transfusion in Canada before 1986 and after 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has always refused to allow parliamentarians to 
discuss this issue. Worse still, the Minister of Health has 
refused to meet representatives of hepatitis C victims, in spite 
of repeated requests to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the Krever commission clearly established that it is in the 
interest of all Canadians and Quebecers that the blood supply 
and distribution systems be as transparent as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will agree that this need for transparency requires the 
federal parliament, which is responsible for regulating blood 
and its constituents, to deal with all relevant issues. In that 
regard, there can be no doubt that responsibility for 
compensating hepatitis C victims who were infected before 1986 
and after 1990 rests squarely with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Krever commission also asked the government to set up a no 
fault compensation plan. I attach a copy of that recommendation 
to the letter I sent to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, I believe it is imperative that we 
parliamentarians be allowed to debate this critical public 
health issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK276"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Notwithstanding the case made by the 
hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, I feel that, at this point 
in time, his request does not meet the criteria governing 
emergency debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without questioning your decision, I would just like you to tell 
me something. I believe that if we were to consult Beauchesne's, 
we would find cases quite similar to this one, in which the 
government rejected a decision made by a royal commision of 
inquiry.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there are precedents where parliamentarians were 
allowed to discuss such issues. I would appreciate an 
explanation. Why, given the case I made, does the chair feel 
that my request must be turned down? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know the basis of your ruling, with which I will 
fully comply, but which seems ill-founded at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry the member does not agree with 
the Chair's ruling, but it is not customary to explain why a 
request for an emergency debate is being denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to remind the member that today we are having the debate 
on the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne, which 
will continue later this week. It is a general debate. We will 
also have, as the member well knows, seven allotted days between 
now and December, and his party will be free to raise this issue 
during one of those opposition days. I am sure the member can 
convince his colleagues to have such a debate on one of those 
days.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion for an address to 
Her Excellency the Governor General in reply to her speech at the 
opening of the session, of the amendment and of the amendment to 
the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK280"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I certainly appreciate the opportunity to speak to the 
throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we stand before a new century there is a growing sense of 
optimism, confidence and pride in the country.  Canada is one of 
the greatest success stories of the 20th century.  We began as a 
small colony with little industry and no real place in global 
affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the place to be in the 21st century.  We look with 
pride on the achievements as an independent and prosperous nation 
with a dynamic economy, a strong and democratic society, and a 
sense of community, a nation with unrivalled quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is starting the next century or the new millennium with 
the honour of being the first ranked country of the United States 
for the sixth year in a row.  The Liberal government intends to 
ensure that Canada remains the best country in the world in which 
to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we took office six years ago we put forward a comprehensive 
and balanced plan.  We have stuck to that plan and it has worked. 
Canada is on the right track.  The nation's finances have been 
restored.  Key programs have been modernized.  We are enjoying 
the longest economic expansion since the 1960s, and the 
unemployment rate has dropped from 11.4% to 7.5%.  It is almost 
4% lower than when we took office a short time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With our balanced approach we will continue to strengthen Canada 
by recommitting ourselves to economic policies that will allow us 
to keep the national debt on a permanent downward track, reduce 
taxes for Canadians and make strategic investments in the top 
priorities of Canadians.  A strong and dynamic economy is a 
cornerstone of our quality of life, providing the means to build 
a more equitable society, a healthier population and stronger 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax relief and improved tax fairness are essential to improving 
the standard of living and quality of life of Canadians.  Reduced 
taxes mean that Canadians have more money available to spend, 
which helps create a great number of new jobs and economic growth 
which benefit us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two budgets taxes have been cut by $16.5 billion 
over three years, cuts that will benefit every Canadian and take 
600,000 low income Canadians off the tax rolls.

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will further reduce taxes to increase the after tax incomes 
of Canadians.  Canadians will be pleased to know that the 
government is committed to laying out a multi-year plan for tax 
reductions in the next budget.  However, the government remains 
committed to never letting the nation's finances get out of 
control again.  We have brought down back to back balanced 
budgets for the first time since 1951-52 and we have put the debt 
to GDP ratio on a permanent downward track.  Our administration 
will keep the debt to GDP ratio down as it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to statistics every billion dollars in exports 
supports as many as 11,000 Canadian new jobs.  Our growth in 
exports goes a long way to explain why 1.7 million new jobs have 
been created in Canada since October 1993.  As an outward looking 
country with a trade oriented economy we intend to step up trade 
promotion in key sectors and to launch an investment team Canada 
strategy to promote investment in Canada.  We will continue to 
create opportunities for Canadians to access foreign markets and 
to promote Canada as the ideal place in which to invest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will increase our support for life-long learning to continue 
building the most highly skilled workforce in the world that is 
part of the Canadian advantage in a knowledge based economy.  The 
government has committed itself to put in place the knowledge 
information, cultural and physical infrastructure needed for the 
21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major focus of our government has been the seven million 
children in Canada.  The strength of our society will depend on 
the investments we make today as a nation for the families and 
children of tomorrow.  The federal government will continue to 
work with provinces, territories and other partners to provide 
the necessary support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centrepiece of our progress to date is the national child 
benefit, the most innovative new national social program in a 
generation.  Thanks to the NCB an additional $1.7 billion 
annually is going to low income families with children.  The 
federal contribution will increase to $2 billion annually by July 
2000, bringing the total federal assistance for families with 
children to almost $7 billion a year.  The federal government 
will make a third significant investment in a national child 
benefit by the year 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also proud of the new national children's agenda.  We are 
developing with the provinces and territories a comprehensive 
strategy to improve the well-being of Canada's children with a 
special focus on the problems of low income families.  As part of 
this agenda we will work with the provinces and territories to 
reach an agreement by December 2000 on further joint initiatives 
to support early childhood development.  The federal government 
will also put more dollars into the hands of families with 
children through further tax relief.  Families will also benefit 
from initiatives that include lengthening and making more 
flexible the employment insurance benefit for maternity and 
parental leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of Canada's youth our goal is to give the youth 
generation of Canada, no matter where they live, a shot at 
personal success in the knowledge economy, a job with the future 
that pays well and an opportunity at becoming the best and the 
brightest there are.  We are committed to helping young Canadians 
get the skills and opportunities they need to succeed in the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we have announced the Canadian opportunities 
strategy, the Canada millennium scholarship fund, the Canada 
educational savings grant, the youth employment strategy, tax 
relief on interest payments on student loans, and have helped to 
connect every public school and library in Canada to the 
Internet.  We plan to draw on the expertise as well as the 
talents of young Canadians to create new Internet access sites in 
communities across Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, we intend to provide thousands of Canadians with 
the opportunity to participate in Canadian exchange and 
international internship programs and to volunteer in community 
and national environmental projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our sense of community and commitment to working together has 
helped Canadians seize opportunities and rise to challenges. 
Strong communities depend upon the participation of all members. 
The government will strengthen its partnerships with communities 
and volunteer organizations that serve and sustain them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will work with all partners to help communities meet the 
needs of their members.  In particular we will work to eliminate 
barriers to the mobility of citizens within Canada so Canadians 
are not denied government services or access to work or education 
because of the province of their origin.  We will enter into the 
new national accord with the voluntary sector that will lay the 
key foundation for an active partnership with voluntary 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will work to ensure persons with disabilities are fully 
included and we will help new Canadians adapt to life in Canada. 
We will also work to ensure that our communities remain safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Feeling safe and secure in our homes and communities is 
essential to out quality of life and contributes to Canada's 
comparative advantage.  Our government has taken important 
strides to support this Canadian priority.  While the national 
crime rate fell to a 20 year low in 1998, every crime committed 
is one too many.  That is why the Liberal government will remain 
vigilant, taking further community based crime prevention 
measures, to ensure that our communities are safe and healthy 
places in which to live. 
<P><A NAME="LINK281"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member who just spoke about the commitment 
that he has, or that his government has, toward young people, or 
is the commitment primarily to the banks of Canada?  It is 
particularly with reference to his last comments when he talked 
about student loans and the privilege that young people have 
subsidized interest rates on their student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that while they are attending university or a 
post-secondary institution of some kind the government pays the 
interest on these loans to the banks so the student is free from 
paying them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the student graduates he or she is then obligated to repay 
the loan at an interest rate exceeding the prime rate in the bank 
system.  Is the government's primary concern about young people, 
or is the government's primary concern to absolve the banks from 
incurring any risk for these, our most educationally elite 
people?  These people will lead industry in their areas.  What is 
the real purpose behind this whole operation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased with 
the question of my colleague across the way.  It gives me an 
opportunity to reinforce some of the points that I just mentioned 
about youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we stop and think about it, the Canadian opportunities 
strategy is about helping young people get experience, helping 
young people work in the environment and helping develop a record 
of work experience by putting programs in place that allow them 
to be out in the communities working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the educational grants given to students, we 
certainly are doing the very best we can to make sure there are 
grants for young people to develop youth environment strategies. 
Any type of opportunity where young people get an opportunity to 
work in programs is very good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we stop and look at the reduction of interest rates on 
student loans, the member is not suggesting that was not a 
tremendously great idea.  I think he is suggesting go further, go 
further, go further.  That has been the policy of the Reform 
Party.  The sad part is that its members say to cut taxes but 
spend, spend, spend.  I have heard them today alone suggest 10 
policies which in fact—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member has deliberately misconstrued what I said 
a moment ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid that deliberate 
misconstruction may happen from time to time.  Sometimes it is 
not deliberate and sometimes there is no misconstruction. 
However, it is not a point of order, it is a question of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I clearly remember the 
hon. member's comments.  He asked “What are you doing for 
youth?”  That is exactly what I am commenting on now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that members of the Reform Party have said time 
after time, interestingly, “Spend money here; spend money 
there”.  I could cite specifics, but the fact is that they have 
asked for tax reductions on one side and they say “spend, spend, 
spend” in every program.  The problem is, we cannot do both. 
That is why Canadians have put them where they put them, across 
the way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK282"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
colleague for Chatham—Kent Essex made the point that we can look 
forward to the future with optimism and pride.  Can he explain to 
the farmers of the Annapolis Valley, especially those who in the 
last three years have been faced with drought and those who have 
just in the last three or four years come into business, who 
cannot take benefit from the AIDA program, how they can have 
pride and optimism for the future?  Not supporting these farmers 
is deplorable and it cannot and should not be tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I accept the question 
from my hon. colleague in the spirit in which it was given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that we must ensure that industry in 
Canada, be it farming or any other type of industry, gets the 
proper support mechanisms required.  As a Liberal government we 
have tried to negotiate with industries across the board on the 
best types of programs that could be put in place for those 
industries and we have been working hard as well with the 
provinces. It is not just the federal government that gets 
involved in this; it is the industries themselves and the 
producers in those industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of difficulty with the situation in 
Atlantic Canada, as well as the situation in western Canada.  We 
all feel that we must do as much as we can.  That is why the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food stood today in the House to 
say that the government had put $900 million into trying to bring 
supports in place for the agricultural industry.  One has to 
admit that we are trying our best to handle things in a way that 
is reasonable and sustainable for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that our system is perfect.  I would never say 
that our system is perfect.  However, we have to realize that we 
are trying to make strides and to do the best we can.  Many of 
these situations were unanticipated.  Given the opportunity we 
will develop programs and safety nets that will make certain 
agriculture is safe in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it 
interesting to rise in reply to this throne speech, as this 
allows us to tell those who are listening to us that, to us, 
this speech seems drab and empty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members on the other side of the House may try hard 
to make us see the positive side of this throne speech, but 
every newspaper article we read the day after the throne speech 
agreed with what all four opposition parties were saying. This 
speech has no clear policy and no vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather, this speech is an election platform; most commitments 
will take effect between 2001 and 2004, and probably during the 
next election campaign, which leads us to believe that the Prime 
Minister will still be there for the next campaign.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider one example: parental leave.  Overall, this 
seems to us to be good news, except that the parental leave 
proposed as a new program is not going to start until 2001. 
Everyone wonders why it is not now.  The money is already there, 
it is not a problem, so why not start the program up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members are aware, the funding for this program comes 
from the employment insurance fund.  Only 40% of people qualify 
for this fund, and women and young workers are the ones most 
affected.  If access to employment insurance benefits is not 
changed, one may well wonder who will lucky enough to benefit 
from parental leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost,  October 12th's throne speech is a long 
shopping list. That list includes the government's commitment to 
a slight, long term and conditional tax reduction, to reducing 
the debt still further, to investing in capital projects, and to 
creating a broad range of programs ranging from improving the 
national child tax credit, to home care, to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are familiar with the Liberals' promises. The numerous 
promises in the throne speech appear to be just window-dressing. 
We have never been given the real cost of these commitments. 
There is talk of compassion for families and the poor, but the 
only emphasis is on the homeless.  Yet the government does not 
give us its vision of what programs and measures it will 
implement to help the homeless. 
It is fine to support the homeless in the throne speech, but 
since 1993, this government is no longer involved in social 
housing programs and has not invested anything in them.  So 
much, then, for compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent years have shown us that government commitments were 
anything but solid. Many still wonder about the ability and real 
desire of the government to honour its commitments.  Other 
examples come to mind: the GST, pay equity and international 
aid, for which the government promised to provide .7% of GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, responsible for daycare, tells me that the 150,000 
places in daycare that were promised in recent budgets have yet 
to be provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the fact that the government says it wants to do 
everything at once is a very clear indication of the fiscal 
leeway it has this year and of the surpluses that will be 
distributed in the next budget.  As they say, they got the 
bucks.  However, since they want high visibility as they move 
into the next millennium, they are offering a sprinkling of new 
programs instead of going after the real problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even more distressing is that these surpluses have been 
accumulated on the backs of the unemployed. There is the $25 
billion from the employment insurance fund, because $5 billion a 
year accumulates in this fund. There is the $30 billion in the 
public service pension fund—if this were private enterprise, 
such scheming would be considered outright theft—and there are 
the cuts to transfers to the provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts in provincial transfer payments have hit the public 
very hard.  For the benefit of those listening, I am talking 
about a $33 billion cut.  Then the government wonders why there 
are health and education problems.  It makes cuts and crows 
about the money it is saving, but the provinces are stuck with 
the unenviable task of running programs on nothing.  They do not 
have the money and are having trouble maintaining services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disgraceful to slough one's problems off onto the backs of 
others.  In Quebec alone, an additional 200,000 people had to 
turn to welfare in 1998. They no longer qualified for employment 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health systems throughout Canada are in terrible shape and the 
provinces must work hard to avoid the appearance of a two-tier 
health system, one tier for the rich and one for the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just Quebec that is facing problems in its health care 
system, but all the provinces.  The government would have people 
think that the problems are limited to Quebec, because of its 
sovereignist government, but that is not true.  We must broaden 
our horizons and look at the other Canadian provinces, which are 
forced to turn to the United States to provide health care for 
their inhabitants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, let us remember what Jean Charest said  “Forget 
Lucien Bouchard.  He is not the problem.  The problem is the 
cuts made by the federal Liberal government to the Canada social 
transfer”.  This from Mr. Charest in May 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the budget is balanced, it is obvious that the ruthless 
cuts and overtaxing to which the federal government keeps 
resorting in spite of the public's pleas are giving it more 
money than it needs, but the government is still avoiding its 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government prefers to spend that money on new programs, 
instead of fulfilling its responsibilities, which include 
alleviating the plight of the unemployed by putting money back 
into the employment insurance fund which the government 
pilfered, helping the sick by giving back to the provinces the 
money it took from them, and giving a break to the middle class 
by lightening its tax burden—let us not forget that it is the 
middle class that pays for our social programs. Instead of 
helping all these people, the government prefers to spend and to 
interfere in provincial jurisdictions. In Quebec, we already 
have homecare and pharmacare programs. 
Therefore, why not give the money to Quebec, to improve what is 
already in place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that instead of using common sense, 
the Liberals are beginning again to spend money on all sorts of 
new programs whose only sure impact is to empty taxpayers' 
pockets. Why? This is all in the name of visibility and 
propaganda, coast to coast.

the member talked about, what she coined, our two-tier health

with health through the Canada Health Act, which has the five 
principles of our health system:  universality, accessibility, 
portability, publicly funded and comprehensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am aware, and I am very sure of my facts, Canada has 
a health system which serves all Canadians and it has nothing to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not say that we had a 
two tier system, I said that we were heading that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When transfer payments to provinces are cut by $33 billion, 
including $10 billion for Quebec alone, it is obvious that 
health care is in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec does all it can to maintain the five major principles of 
medicare. We believe in universality and accessibility and when 
we are a sovereign country these five principles will be 
maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in those principles, but what can a province do when 
its funds are being cut off and hospital costs are skyrocketing? 
I remind the House that our population is ageing and needs more 
health care. Furthermore, new technologies, like laser 
treatments and other medical equipment, arre increasingly 
expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Quebec needs more money to buy new equipment and to give 
health care to an ageing population but its transfer payments 
are cut by $10 billion, how do members think it will be able 
maintain the five great principles of medicare? 
<P><A NAME="LINK285"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
new session opened with a Speech from the Throne, in which the 
government was supposed to highlight its new policy thrusts 
during the second half of its mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As justice critic for the Bloc Quebecois, I carefully examined 
the throne speech and I was sorry to see that it only confirmed 
that the government wants a Reform style justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it paves the way for the next election, the throne speech, 
inevitable, was greatly influenced by the right and the 
intolerance movement with which both the Liberals and the 
Reformers seem to be so cozy. Under these circumstances, 
political expediency is the rule: public perception prevails 
over public interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party, which has been actively promoting law and 
order ever since its election to this House, as we have seen 
many times, took advantage of the shift to the right and, in the 
last two federal elections, campaigned on a platform that called 
for a harsher youth justice system. Reformers decided to fight 
tooth and nail against what they saw as the excessive clemency 
of Liberal policies toward young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the situation, it is unlikely that the government will 
reconsider its plan to reform the Young Offenders Act. This is 
unfortunate, because the government will be missing an 
opportunity to show how effective the current legislation is and 
to distance itself from the demagogic policies of the Reform 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68, the Young Offenders Act, as it was called when it was 
introduced, died on the Order Paper, since we started a new 
session. However, statistics on young offenders tell us it was a 
pointless piece of legislation anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics clearly show how effective a young offenders act can 
be if it is properly enforced. Many experts in Quebec have 
condemned the justice minister's eagerness to sacrifice several 
decades of expertise. Nevertheless she is standing her ground, 
claiming that a so-called flexibility will allow provinces, 
especially Quebec, to continue enforcing the model of their 
choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such flexibility, a kind of opting out, which is as virtual as a 
stroll on the bow of <I>Titanic</I>, is not tangible and the minister 
knows it full well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system the minister has been proposing so far is based on 
the nature and seriousness of the offence, thereby ignoring the 
young offenders' needs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the bill—and this is important—did not 
even mention the special needs of teenagers. However, it is 
precisely because the Young Offenders Act allows for individual 
treatment based on each teenager's own characteristics that 
Quebec has the lowest juvenile crime rate in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During her summer vacation in Alberta, the Minister of Justice 
must have had the time to review the request from the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Quebec government to withdraw Bill C-68 or, at 
the very least, to amend it in order to allow the province to 
continue enforcing the Young Offenders Act its own way, the 
Quebec way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By granting this reasonable request, the minister would make it 
possible to keep intact an approach that has already proven 
itself.  On the other hand, an outright rejection might lead to 
improper handling of young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Speech from the Throne, “the Government will 
reintroduce legislation to reform the youth justice system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hoped that the term “reintroduce” would not mean 
reintroduction of all the provisions of Bill C-68 on young 
offenders, a bill no one in Quebec wanted. However, based on the 
rumours going around the Hill, I fear that the minister will be 
introducing Bill C-68 in its entirety within days. 
Should this be the case, I trust that members will remind the 
Minister of Justice that it is not in the interests of either 
Quebecers or Canadians to back such a reform, since it is not 
warranted by the present situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics the minister is quoting in support of the Young 
Offenders Act demonstrate that she does not need to do anything 
to change that act, only to require that those provinces that do 
not enforce it do so, in order to achieve the same results as we 
have had in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those involved in this area in Quebec have worked tirelessly to 
prevent juvenile delinquency from leading to “chronic 
delinquency”; it would be unfortunate to impose upon them an 
instrument unsuited to youth rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of my summer reading, I came across a quote from 
Honoré de Balzac “Once the convicts were marked, once they were 
given their numbers, they took on an unalterable character”.  It 
is my belief that, with the young offenders legislation, or the 
amendments the Minister of Justice wants to make to the Young 
Offenders Act, these young people will be marked forever, 
branded, considering all the publicity that surrounds this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time is right, and when the minister reintroduces—as 
rumours on the Hill would have it—the bill to amend the Young 
Offenders Act, we shall see what transpires, but the fear is 
that the minister will go back on the prior commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too much effort has been invested in Quebec to date for us to be 
forced in future to regretfully apply the Balzac citation to 
ourselves.  For our collective security, the Minister of Justice 
must abandon her plans once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the experience with young offenders legislation 
reform is not the only one of its kind. 
By way of example, the debate on the reinstatement of life 
sentences for persons driving while impaired is another 
illustration of the need for sensationalism of the federal 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of reminder, the government initially agreed with the 
Bloc Quebecois and amended Bill-82 to retain the 14 year maximum 
sentence for persons driving while impaired and causing death. 
During the negotiations preceding the adjournment for the summer 
recess, the Bloc Quebecois contended that a life sentence was 
unreasonable, despite the seriousness of such an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a mistake to think that the government would stop there. 
Everything indicates, once again, according to the rumours on 
the Hill, that the government will introduce another bill to 
obtain a life sentence for impaired driving causing death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see that, on the subject of justice, the Liberals, the 
Reformers and, to some extent, the Progressive Conservatives, 
are all on the far right.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At page 23, the throne speech provides: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will focus attention on new and emerging threats 
to Canadians and their neighbours around the world. It will work 
to combat criminal activity that is becoming increasingly global 
in scope, including money laundering, terrorism, and the 
smuggling of people, drugs and guns.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will strengthen the capacity of the RCMP and 
other agencies to address threats to public security in Canada— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the government realizes that there is a world 
of difference between what it says in its speech and what it 
does in reality. Since the Liberals took office in 1993, funding 
for the war against drug trafficking and organized crime has 
been reduced by $11 million. The throne speech talks about 
strengthening our capacity in that area when, in fact, there has 
been a decrease in funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As strange as it may seem, even though the federal government is 
aware of a 12% annual increase in drug related crimes, as 
reported in one of its own documents, it has reduced the number 
of police officers investigating these kinds of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe reality has caught up with the Liberals but they do not 
know exactly what to do. They should listen more carefully to 
certain proposals made by the Bloc Quebecois, including the bill 
introduced by the member for Charlesbourg to withdraw $1,000 
notes from circulation to help in the fight against money 
laundering. We presented all kinds of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying that, at some point, the Bloc Quebecois 
will reach out to the federal government to conduct a serious 
study on the whole issue of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the Minister of International Trade. 
I think that, as a member from Quebec, it would be interesting 
if he could co-operate with the Bloc Quebecois to set sound

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise 
today in the House to offer comments on the Speech from the 
Throne, which was so ably delivered to us by Her Excellency the 
Governor General last week.  I also want to thank her for her 
excellent and moving installation speech.  I am sure that all of 
my colleagues in the House join me in offering best wishes to Her 
Excellency as she begins her term of office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her appointment is of special significance to the residents of 
my riding of Papineau—Saint-Denis.  Indeed, many of my 
constituents are immigrants to Canada.  Many arrived quite 
recently.  I am proud that Her Excellency inspires us all and 
demonstrates that in this country, Canada, all citizens, old and 
new, have access to all offices, even to the highest office in 
the land. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The residents of my riding of Papineau«Saint-Denis are also 
delighted that Her Excellency the Governor General will be 
joined at Rideau Hall by her husband, John Ralston Saul, one of 
the great thinkers of our time, a philosopher whose reputation 
and credibility extend well beyond our borders.  I know he is 
particularly well thought of in France.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech, the government stressed the need for 
Canadians to open up to the world, and to be aware of our role 
and our responsibilities in this respect and also of the great 
opportunities and challenges that this entails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not the least of these opportunities are those that come about 
through international trade and capital movement.  As all 
members are well aware, Canada has founded its economy on 
external trade.  Our present and future prosperity and growth 
are largely dependent on international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, one job in three is directly linked to international 
trade, and 40% of the GDP depends on it.  This is the highest 
percentage of all industrialized countries in the G-8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A mere five years ago, we exported 25% of our GDP.  We have 
therefore gone from 25% to 40% in just under five years.  The 
vast majority of the 1,700,000 new jobs created since 1993 are 
the result of the increase in exports. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned in the Speech from the Throne, Canada's economy is 
more open than any of the other leading industrialized countries. 
We have a population that comes from countries all over the 
world. In many instances Canadian businesses, because they have 
such a culturally diverse and rich workforce, have the great 
advantage of not only being aware of the customs and practices of 
other nations but of being able to do business in many different 
languages.  Our investment in diversity over the years is turning 
into a major asset for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that we continue to enhance that very real advantage, 
we intend to increase our trade promotion efforts in those 
sectors that have high export potential.  Some of these exports 
did not exist even a few years ago, but thanks to some very 
dedicated, innovative and very clever people, whole new economic 
sectors are now growing up where nothing existed before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our biotechnology industry for example is pursuing some of the 
most leading edge innovations in the world.  Our environmental 
industries are growing at an incredible rate.  Our information 
technology sector is large and getting larger with investments in 
high tech all over the world. The same is true in many other 
sectors of our economy such as agriculture, agri-food and natural 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we are an important player in the global 
economy. As a government, we want to help our industries to 
develop the linkages with the world that will help bring growth 
and jobs here to Canada. We also want to take more direct action 
to encourage companies to locate in this country.  Therefore we 
will be presenting legislative changes that will make it easier 
for global corporations to bring their headquarters to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the throne speech stated, we also intend to create investment 
in Canada, a co-ordinated effort by all governments and the 
private sector to promote the unique opportunities that are 
available here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we will continue to support innovation and the 
development of new technologies.  Doing so is good for Canada and 
it is also good for our trading partners. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, one thing that is very favourable for Canada and its 
trading partners is the introduction of a rules-based 
international trade system.  In fact, we are one of the most 
active advocates and promoters of this system.  It is important 
that we be active in this area because our country, Canada, is 
neither the biggest nor the most powerful country in the world. 
We must continue to co-operate with like-minded countries in order 
to ensure that the rules are accepted by all and not dictated by 
the largest players. This requires skill and perseverance in all 
circumstances.  Soon, the WTO's ninth round of multilateral 
trade negotiations will begin in Seattle.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope to be able to build on the successes of the previous 
rounds. During these negotiations, Canada will continue to 
promote the strengthening of the international trade system. We 
will continue to ask for the rules to become more transparent, 
predictable and enforceable. We will continue to urge the World 
Trade Organization to keep pace with technological and social 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want a system that would guarantee a level playing field, 
give Canadian businesses in all sectors easier access to the 
world markets and respect the needs, values and culture of 
Canadians as well as the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues are brought to the attention of the World Trade 
Organization on a daily basis. The recent interim decision on 
the Auto Pact is just one example. Unfortunately, I am clearly 
not at liberty to comment on this issue today because the 
decision must remain confidential until it is made public. I 
just want to say that we are actively consulting business people 
and other governments on this issue, and more specifically on 
its impact on NAFTA, and we will have another announcement to 
make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people are also concerned about the United States putting 
health and education on the table. I want to clearly reiterate 
in this House that our health system is not being threatened and 
will never be questioned during these negotiations. Our 
universal health care system is not negotiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, if we can find ways to export our health and 
education services, we will undoubtedly go ahead and do it. 
But, as the Prime Minister said many times, our universal health 
care system is central to our way of living. We will not let it 
be weakened in any way. We will promote and protect the 
economic, social and cultural interests of Canadians. In 
Seattle, I will raise as well the issue of the World Trade 
Organization as a body, including its structure and its 
procedures. I hope to be able to put forward specific proposals 
to improve it. Many think the WTO is no longer of any use since 
we have NAFTA with the United States, which accounts for 85% of 
our exports. I want to remind the members that the World Trade 
Organization is still very useful and needed, including to fight 
protectionist pressure from the United States. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another long term goal mentioned in the Speech from the Throne 
is our intention to work with our partners in the hemisphere 
toward the establishment of the free trade area of the Americas 
by 2005. I will be very pleased to host the 34 democratic 
countries of the hemisphere in Toronto in November, to continue 
to work toward the establishment of that zone of free trade of 
the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we have the great advantage to be the neighbour of the 
very strong and dynamic American market.  This however should not 
stop us from looking all around the world to develop other 
markets.  That is what we are doing with the free trade area of 
the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the world trading system opens up as never before, as we 
enter the age of globalization, an age of new knowledge 
economies, we have to be aware that this new phenomenon is 
shaping the choices we make as a society.  In Canada we believe 
very much that it is important to humanize globalization.  It is 
important to remind ourselves that there is a human purpose to 
the economy and we want everyone to be able to buy in. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The humanization of globalization is one of our gouvernment's 
objectives. I would like to share with the House some of my 
thinking,  for example, on the issue of culture, on the role of 
artists in society and thus on the importance of cultural 
diversity for a country like Canada. I find that the role of 
artists in society is not only to express emotions felt by 
society but also to shape these emotions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT68"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT68"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when we have to undergo changes as radical as those 
brought about by the globalization of the economy, I find it 
extremely important for every country tocontinue to make room 
for artists and allow artists with this responsibility to shape 
the emotions felt by people. It is extremely important to allow 
them to work to enlighten us, as a society, on what it is we are 
going through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the deep emotions, the excitement as well as the 
insecurity felt by people dealing with globalization. 
We realize that the insecurity and the excitement can both be 
captured by artists, who can give form to them and help us 
understand how societies live with this phenomenon. Hence the 
importance of cultural diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our own society, the society I come from in our country, 
Quebec society, I look at the role of the artists and the 
automatistes in the global rejection movement in 1948.  I look 
at Gratien Gélinas' theatre in 1948 as well, his <I>Ti'Coq</I>.  These 
artists were the harbingers in 1948 of the quiet revolution that 
took place in Quebec in the 1960s.  Twelve years ahead of time, 
these artists showed the extent to which Quebec was stifled and 
had to be liberated from many of its past experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left> So, the artists are the ones to see what is coming first.  I 
therefore think it extremely important to give this matter 
careful attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to tell the House how much the phenomenon of 
globalization changes the nature of exclusion as well.  For 200 
years, we have fought exploitation.  With industrial capitalism 
came exploitation.  In other words, people were exploited in 
this industrial capitalism, however, even exploited, the 
individual exists in a social context.  Individuals can 
organize, form unions.  They can negotiate and obtain better 
laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exploitation we have fought for the past 200 years is now 
over, because, unlike industrial capitalism, financial 
capitalism means the exclusion of more individuals. 
Exclusion is much more radical than exploitation, because 
exclusion means a total loss of bargaining power.  In the case 
of exclusion, there is nothing to negotiate and no one to 
negotiate with, hence the importance of humanizing 
globalization, of remembering that the economy has human 
finality and that it exists to serve the whole population to 
grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the concerns we will bring to the major rounds of 
negotiations in November.  These extremely important phenomena 
are fundamental. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important to me that people understand that 
there is a balance with which the Liberal government has been 
approaching things, a balance that has to be concerned with this 
because markets cannot solve every problem.  Of course our 
commitment should be to make markets work better, but at the same 
time governments need to pursue policies that reflect the 
democratic values and inclusiveness that ultimately make economic 
activity more sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Speech from the Throne made clear, we intend to do more 
in the coming months to ensure that Canada continues to be an 
inclusive society, a society that values the contributions of all 
its people, a society in which everyone is given a fair chance to 
participate by helping people to learn new skills and to take new 
opportunities, a society in which children are given the best 
start in life and are given the support they need to grow up 
healthy and safe, and a society that supports and practises the 
concept of sustainable development for our environment so that 
future generations will also be able to build their own dreams.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canada is in a better position than most countries to 
succeed in the new context of globalization, in large part 
because of our history and in part because of our geography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the throne speech indicates, Canada was born at a time when 
countries were formed in the crucible of war or revolution.  In 
the 19th century, the norm in the traditional nation states, as 
they emerged throughout the world at the time, was for majority 
to assimilate minority and majority to eliminate differences. 
The traditional nation-state was based on a single language, a 
single culture, a single religion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in Canada, on the contrary, we have chosen another path. 
We have chosen to build a country that would not become a 
traditional nation-state.  We chose a Canadian approach to 
reconciling differences.  We chose to place tolerance, 
acceptance and respect of others at the core of our country's 
identity.  We therefore chose to develop a political citizenship 
rather than an ethnic, linguistic or religious one.  That 
political citizenship allowed diversity to become, not a threat 
to our identity or our existence—as some try to make it out to 
be—but instead a strength, an asset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a bilingual and multicultural society, one used to the 
reconciliation of differences and mutual respect.  Today we are 
faced with globalization, which imposes the phenomenon of 
diversity throughout the world.  We in Canada have 150 years 
experience with diversity, which means that, faced with the 
phenomenon of diversity imposed on us now by globalization, our 
country will know better than any other in the world how to deal 
with it and how to use it to the benefit of all of its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, I believe that people everywhere in the world are 
interested in our experience.  The most radical and the most 
fundamental question that will be raised in the new century with 
the phenomenon of globalization will be: is it possible to live 
together, equal and different?  That is the most radical and the 
most fundamental question. 
With this throne speech, we want Canada to represent the 
optimistic response to that fundamental question.  Yes, we can 
live together, in equality and difference.  That is the human 
and optimistic answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there 
are a couple of things I would like the minister to address.  I 
thank him for being here today to address the Speech from the 
Throne but there are some things that are missing in the speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the plan and where is the high level attack that we 
need as a country to put against the unfair foreign subsidies 
that are killing our agriculture community?  We did not see it in 
the speech and we did not hear it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing the minister touched on, which is more to the point, 
is U.S. protectionism.  We have an industry in Canada that 
exports $2.2 billion worth of beef and cattle a year to the 
United States and an unjust, baseless tariff that has been placed 
on cattle going across the border.  When the tariff was adjusted 
the other day from 5.57% to 5.63%, the government considered it a 
victory.  That victory is taking millions of dollars out of the 
cattle industry in this country every day.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister to comment on what he is going to do. 
The northwest beef producers have been in touch with the 
government.  They have suggested changes that could be made to 
the health regulations for cattle coming from the United States 
that would help to solve this problem and that would send a 
message to the ITC that Canada is willing to work at solving 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the minister comment on exactly what his plans are and 
when this issue will be solved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
opposition member for giving me the opportunity to add more 
comments to my speech.  There are a number of things I did not 
raise in my 20-minute speech because obviously one cannot touch 
on every issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the European export subsidies, my colleague, the 
minister of agriculture, has been very clear.  At the end of 
August, we presented the government's position showing our plan 
and our objective of working very hard at the next round of 
negotiations to eliminate the European export subsidies.  We find 
these subsidies absolutely detrimental and are working very hard 
toward eliminating them.  The government has stated this position 
time and again and we will continue to work on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for cattle, we recognized last week that in part of the 
decisions we were favoured.  For instance, 
on the countervail subsidy side, we won that part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will be pleased, as will the House, that on the 
countervail subsidies we are very pleased that the U.S. upheld 
its initial decision and found that Canadian exports of live 
cattle do not benefit from countervail subsidies, so it is a good 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of whether Canadian cattle were being dumped, 
that is to say being sold at prices less than the cost of 
production, the department of commerce reconfirmed an earlier 
ruling that Canadian cattle were indeed being dumped into the 
U.S. market.  As a result, most Canadian producers will now have 
to pay a 5.6% duty on their cattle exports to the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However this duty will not be made permanent until the U.S 
international trade commission decides whether Canadian cattle 
exports threaten or injure the domestic U.S. industry.  We expect 
the decision on November 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remain hopeful that they will determine that Canadian exports 
are not injuring the U.S. domestic industry.  We will continue to 
work closely with the Canadian cattle industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I wonder, with the minister's consent and the consent of 
the House, if we could extend the minister's time for questions 
by about 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to extend 
the time for questions and comments by about 10 minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK288"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
would like the minister to give us more time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with interest to the address in reply to the throne 
speech given by the member for Papineau—Saint-Denis. On this side 
of the House we are getting tired of hearing that it feels good 
to know that Canada is the best country of the world, the 
government is letting it go to its head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say that Canada is not a traditional nation state as the 
minister said again today and as he wrote in a book well worth 
reading, is a contradiction of the throne speech itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I asked in my own speech last week, how many times is the 
word national used in the throne speech? The throne speech 
mentions that Canada has a national government and yet the 
minister claims it is not a nation state. This is a 
contradiction the minister might want to explain. Could it be 
that he disagrees with people who say Canada has a national 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed that regarding negotiations at the WTO, under the 
heading “international trade”, the throne speech does not say 
anything about the provinces taking part in such negotiations. I 
would like to know whether the minister intends to involve the 
provinces in these negotiations and make sure they are asked to 
approve any future treaty dealing with issues coming under 
provincial jurisdiction in the Constitution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he intend to involve parliament in the negotiations? Is he 
willing to have the outcome of such discussions and negotiations 
reviewed by parliament, not only by the foreign affairs 
committee, but also by the House of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry is criticizing the Canadian government for 
constantly saying that Canada is the best country in the world. 
I would like to tell him that his problem is not with the 
Canadian government, but with the United Nations. Indeed, it is 
the United Nations Development Program that, each year for the 
past six years, has noted that respect for others and the 
quality of life in Canada were absolutely remarkable. Therefore, 
the member may have more of a problem with the United Nations 
than with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went back to what I said about Canada not being a traditional 
country, a traditional nation state, and wondered if there was a 
contradiction between the throne speech and my way of thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Beauharnois—Salaberry must look at 150 years of 
history and at the country we have built to see that it is 
indeed a country, contrary to any nation state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is a traditional nation state? It is a political power that 
has formed an alliance with a nation, generally the majority 
nation. That is what happened in France, in Great Britain, in 
Germany and in Italy. The state formed an alliance with the 
majority nation and systematically assimilated minorities and 
tried to eliminate any differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, in Canada, the country we have built is not a traditional 
nation state because, contrary to what happened in other 
countries, we have built our country on the reconciliation of 
different peoples and different nations. That is Canada's 
strength today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are a country that did not try to eliminate diversity 
but, rather, made it central to its identity, I say that in this 
era of globalization, which imposes diversity everywhere, we 
have a great advantage in that we have been experiencing such 
diversity for 150 years, including here in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you are tolerant toward me, so I will continue to 
provide replies to the questions that were put to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry that last 
week we had an excellent work session with the provincial 
ministers of trade. We had very wide consultations and very 
productive discussions. We are determined to work closely 
together to ensure that the next round of negotiations at the 
World Trade Organization will prove as satisfactory to Canadian 
businesses as did the first eight rounds. I can assure you that 
we will work very hard to achieve that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for getting the house involved, we will do all that is 
necessary with our excellent Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade. I will of course be very 
pleased to work with the committee and with the house. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I think you can see the amount of interest in the House 
today as we have the Minister for International Trade here. There 
was a motion asking for a 10-minute extension of questions which 
was denied.  I think those people have ducked out.  I wonder if 
we might try that again.  There are different people in the House 
at the moment and there is an interest.  I would ask that the 
minister be allowed to be questioned for another 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I will ask on your 
behalf for the unanimous consent of the House to extend the 
period by 10 minutes.  Is there unanimous consent for this 
request? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK289"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, if members have been paying attention to the news out 
west they will know that Alberta was troubled over the summer by 
the antics of an environmental radical bent on destroying the oil 
industry.  For clarification, I am referring to Wiebo Ludwig and 
not the new environment minister, although I understand the hon.

heated leather seats.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am anxious to respond to the Speech from the Throne because 
once again Canadians were forced to endure the platitudes of a 
political party committed to an unworkable big government agenda. 
As the newly appointed opposition critic for the environment, I 
would like to address this important aspect of the Liberal 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank my colleague, the hon. member for 
Lethbridge, for his hard work on this portfolio. My colleague has 
consistently defended the interests of average Canadians against 
environmental policies that ignore the essential component, 
people.  He is a voice for common sense and we can be sure he 
will bring the same talent and dedication to his new 
responsibilities in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address two broad policy concerns which were 
addressed in the throne speech, first, the concern regarding 
global warming and second, the concern regarding endangered 
species legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to global warming, I have three questions for which 
I seek clear answers.  Is the planet really warming?  What is the 
cause of this warming?  What is the potential consequence for 
average Canadians of this warming? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientists and environmentalists are not in agreement as to the 
validity of global warming.  While climate models produced by 
computers predict that there should have been some warming over 
the past 18 years, satellite data collected monitoring global 
temperature since 1979 actually indicate a slight global cooling. 
Therefore these data refute the claim that there is a long term 
warming trend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, even if we are to assume that the planet is 
warming, and I must stress that the evidence is inconclusive, we 
must next consider what the root causes of this warming are. Have 
100 years of industrial activity upset the balance of the 
ecosystem, or are we witnessing a natural warming trend beyond 
our control?  According to ground level temperature records, most 
of the increase in the world's temperature over the past 100 
years occurred before 1940, before the main input of human 
induced CO2 emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally we must also consider the actual impact of global 
warming and the fact that this phenomenon exists. 
Environmentalists have long concluded that while there may not be 
a clear warming trend or a clear cooling trend, we are seeing 
instability in our global ecosystem that is causing erratic 
weather patterns.  If the planet cools, do deserts turn into 
tropics?  If the planet warms, do growing seasons last longer? 
What is the likely outcome of global warming? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to stress again that before we pursue a national 
energy program style of politics, we must have conclusive 
evidence that global warming trends are real.  We must be certain 
that these trends are the result of industrial CO2 emissions. 
Finally, we must be certain that the effects of this warming 
trend will be negative for average people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have conclusive evidence that shows all these three 
conditions, the Reform Party will be the first to demand action. 
However we will not embark on a reckless and irresponsible 
campaign that will cripple our economy and send hardworking 
people to the unemployment lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of endangered species, in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
this morning I read that the government has failed to achieve 
adequate habitat preservation in the national parks.  Government 
stewardship has not achieved the objective it intended to 
achieve.  This conclusion comes from an independent task force 
led by Jacques Gérin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This record of failure is interesting when we compare it to the 
very recent results achieved by a private sector company. 
TransAlta has just completed a massive strip mine reclamation 
project in Alberta.  Because the company owns the land and 
because it has an incentive to ensure that the property remains 
valuable, care was taken to restore the property to its original 
condition. Today where the strip mine once provided vital energy 
to our nation, a wildlife habitat now exists that is recognized 
the world over as an example of successful private stewardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those at TransAlta did not do this because the Minister of the 
Environment threatened to put them in prison if they did not. 
This company had the reclamation plans in place one full year 
before any provincial or federal statutes were passed regulating 
the impact of resource industries.  They did it because it made 
good business sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote a former chairman of TransAlta who worked 
on this project.  Marshall Williams said “it made business sense 
that land on a major tourism route into Jasper be reclaimed and 
perhaps sold at a future date for a reasonable return”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A wildlife habitat was created because it made good business 
sense.  This is a powerful demonstration of the success of 
private property rights in ensuring the preservation of the 
environment in harmony with sustainable development.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When property rights are respected, there is little conflict 
between sustainable development and both habitat and resource 
management.  Where conflicts do exist, a policy of co-operation 
and partnership will ensure that wild areas are preserved for all 
Canadians with the costs borne equally by all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's idea of an environmental partnership is a 
prison cell and a pair of handcuffs.  In past attempts at 
creating endangered species legislation, the Liberals were 
prepared to levy fines up to $250,000 or five years in jail as 
punishment against otherwise honest, law-abiding people.  The 
government's idea of environmental education is fearmongering and 
misinformation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of challenging the critics of global warming or ozone 
depletion, the Liberal government has disgracefully politicized 
environmental science.  When the leader of the Reform Party 
challenged the junk science of the Kyoto agreement, the 
government responded with personal attacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's idea of a common sense environmental policy is 
more taxes:  tax cars and tax gas and force low income Canadians 
to give up the pleasure and freedom of mobility; after that, tax 
industries and emissions and send hardworking people to the 
unemployment lines.  That is the Liberal plan for the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve better than that from their government and 
they deserve better from the Minister of the Environment.  If 
problems such as climate change and dangerous levels of 
persistent toxins can be resolved, it will very likely 
necessitate a ban on all speeches given by the government 
benches.  Their hot air is what is really causing global warming. 
<P><A NAME="LINK290"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's speech. I have to concur 
in regard to global warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember 35 or 38 years ago we were ranching up in Dead man 
country out of Savannah, British Columbia.  I was also trapping at 
that time.  It was some cold, 55 below. One of the big news 
articles of the day was to prepare for a new ice age. That was 
the government's selling point, prepare for the new ice age.  It 
was cold enough we could almost believe it. It became a big topic 
with all the other ranchers and that maybe everybody should get 
ready. The government had us frightened about what was going to 
happen.  I was fairly young then.  We wondered whether we had 
enough winter feed in for the cattle and everything else.  Lo and 
behold, the next winter it was a fair bit milder and it was 
really nice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After falling into that trap back then and getting worried and 
upset about different things, I came to the conclusion that this 
is a big money scheme.  These issues become big dollars, big 
business for many different groups.  Today it is the ozone and 
global warming; next year it is just as likely to be prepare for 
the new ice age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Okanagan—Shuswap for his very pertinent intervention. From my 
hon. colleague's intervention, there is no doubt that whatever 
certain groups tend to say or wherever the politically correct 
argument of the day lies is where the present government and 
obviously past governments tend to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that when working hard in minus 55 degree 
weather, as many farmers do, they are asking where this global 
warming is, if it actually exists.  They are hoping for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to make clear in my speech that the government has to 
step back and take a critical look at what sort of policies it is 
implementing today.  They are going to affect future generations. 
It must look at what sort of effects they are going to have on 
industry as well. People who are working hard to make ends meet 
are being put on the welfare lines simply because of poor 
management decisions by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was trying to encourage this government to think about it. As 
a younger Canadian in the House looking forward, in trying to 
create sustainable development in this country, let us take a 
step back.  Let us make sure that when we make decisions that are 
going to be implemented today that they are going to be 
compatible with the future of the developing economies and of the 
environment.  Let us not make rash decisions that are going to 
end up backfiring on future generations.

appreciate the comments of the Reform Party member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not think that the expression global warming 
really tells the public what is at stake here. It would be more 
appropriate to talk about climate destabilization. This is what 
causes the flooding, ice storms and tornadoes that destroy crops 
and towns, and that kill people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not met the challenge—in fact there is not 
even any mention of that challenge in the throne speech—of 
dealing with the climate destabilization we are currently 
witnessing. How can we ensure that people will be able to face 
the various problems that this destabilization will generate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the comments of the Reform Party member on

For example, it should be telling us about the effects on the

Alberta to stay with us for a month. Her reaction to the things 
we do here has been enlightening to me.  Her almost childlike 
enthusiasm, seeing the things that she has seen, reminds me that 
this is a very special place and a very special opportunity.  It 
reminds me as well of what a privilege it is to serve my 
constituents and express their ideas and constructive thoughts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had a recent responsibility change in parliament. I 
served as health critic for the official opposition for quite 
some time and have moved to another responsibility, 
intergovernmental affairs, which hardly anyone knows what it 
means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity as well to express my 
thanks to those individuals who made my job as health critic so 
enjoyable.  I had an opportunity to associate with and have 
interchange with associations across the country, medical, 
nursing, dental and chiropractic associations and many 
individuals who had strong positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the public who fought for freedom in health foods 
and in alternative therapies were very powerful individuals. They 
made their positions so strongly known that the government 
changed some of its direction in those areas. I met some victims 
who contracted hepatitis C from tainted blood.  Their powerful 
position, especially that of a young man, made the government 
look shaky in some instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus on little Joey Haché, a young man with an 
illness that should have made him weak, should have sapped his 
strength, but instead has made him strong. 
I want all Canadians to know how proud I am to have known him and 
to have had a little opportunity to interchange with him.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, to this new job in intergovernmental affairs, I looked 
through the throne speech to see all the things that related to 
unity in our country, which is the main responsibility that 
particular job entails.  I want to be very careful that the 
wording I use is exact because Reformers believe that Canada can 
be united by reforming the federation on the principle of 
equality and through a rebalancing of power.  Knowing what that 
means and what, from my party's perspective, we mean in terms of 
unity, I looked carefully at the throne speech to see what it 
said on the issue of unity. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the government's response: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best way to achieve the promise of Canada for every citizen 
is to work together to build the highest quality of life for all 
Canadians. [—]The Government of Canada therefore reaffirms the 
commitment it has made to Quebeckers and all other Canadians 
that the principle of clarity, as set out by the Supreme Court 
of Canada, will be respected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the Government of Canada's response on this very 
important matter: the clarity of the question, the majority 
acceptable, and the negotiation process. These are not the best 
way to ensure Canada's unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Reform Party sees it, the way to ensure our country's 
unity is to make changes in the federation.  For instance, we 
would like to strengthen or improve the exercise of federal 
legislative and administrative authority in the following areas: 
defence, foreign affairs, monetary policy, regulation of 
financial institutions, criminal law, definition of national 
standards, equalization payments, international trade and 
interprovincial trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are important matters that come under federal 
jurisdiction. 
must try to strengthen or improve the exercise of provincial 
legislative and administrative authority in the following areas: 
natural resources, manpower training, social services, 
education, language and culture, municipal affairs, sports, 
housing, and tourism. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are to diminish federal intrusion into exclusive areas of 
provincial responsibility.  What does that mean to my home 
constituency in Alberta?  That means that many of the things that 
Albertans are disappointed with and unhappy with in the way our 
federation works would be answered.  What would that mean for 
those disaffected in Quebec?  In my view, and in the view of my 
party, it would mean exactly the same thing, a rebalancing of the 
powers of confederation based on the principle of equality.  That 
is quite different than just simply saying there is one way, the 
status quo.  That has been the complaint I have heard over and 
over again from my Quebec colleagues, many of whom feel there is 
no other option but to split from this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues across the way seem to think that the option is to 
stay rigid.  We believe that there is a troisième voie, a third 
way, another mechanism to reach the same goal:  a stronger 
federation, not for those in these halls but for our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some other things that we think would go a long way toward 
improving our country would be changes in the way things work in 
this House. 
We believe that we could involve members of parliament better to 
make backbench MPs feel that they have a powerful place here by 
freeing up votes on issues that should not be a vote of 
confidence.  If a vote causes a bill of the government to fail, 
there could simply be a vote of confidence in the government so 
that the government itself would not fail.  That is done in other 
jurisdictions.  It is mind numbing to my constituents at home why 
we have the convention that the failure of a bill would cause the 
government to fail.  There are very few bills that should cause 
the government to fail.

liar, and that is to recall a politician who has made a promise 
and then lied.  And I do not mean just to have a politician 
resign and then run again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe that we could involve the public better in terms 
of being able to initiate by citizens' initiative information or 
laws that are not coming from the government and binding national 
referenda on major important issues, especially moral issues. 
Three hundred and one individuals in the country should not 
decide an issue of such importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These things, in terms of direct democracy, we are convinced 
would make a huge difference to the way this place works and also 
to the way politicians are looked at and thought of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time is always short.  The government had very little to say 
about unity, maybe hoping that the unity problem would gradually 
diminish.  I have looked at the unity debate over the last 30 
years and have found that the interest in sovereignty goes up and 
down, and it is usually from combative things that are done in 
this place that sovereignty gets its strength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House on 
this issue and I look forward as well to an interchange with 
Canadians who will guide me and help me to be at least a proper 
debater in this area. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK293"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first I would like to congratulate my Reform colleague for his 
appointment as his party's intergovernmental affairs critic. I 
am sure he will be as keen and dedicated in his new role as he 
was as health critic. I am looking forward to debates with him 
and the intergovernmental affairs minister, as undoubtedly they 
will be worthwhile debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to him that indeed very little was 
said in the throne speech about unity. 
The word unity can only be found once in the throne speech; the 
government might think it will keep the country together if 
decisions—I mean the important decisions—are made in Ottawa and 
carried out by the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously this is the way we feel the federal government thinks 
federalism should be. Actually, not so much the federal 
government because the words federal and federalism hardly occur 
in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know whether the Reform intergovernmental 
affairs critic has noticed, as we have, that the government 
wants to centralize, and whether his party is not discouraged by 
this government's attitude when it comes to changing the way we 
look at the future and federalism in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B> I thank the hon. member for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us Reformers, the problem is partly the centralization of 
the federal government's business. It is not the only problem. 
There are other issues and a balance is necessary in this 
debate. We would like the question to be clear, we would like to 
know what constitutes a clear majority and we would like to know 
about negotiations, should a referendum end with a victory for 
the yes side. We would also like to know about changes to the 
federation, positive changes for Quebecers and other Canadians. 
This is very important.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I also congratulate my colleague on his new portfolio. I 
think he will do an excellent job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to rebalancing powers, many people often confuse 
the position of the official opposition.  Could he add some 
clarity, that we are not just talking about independent states 
far away from the government but a better working relationship? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often when we talk about rebalancing people look to see if we are 
trying to advocate independent provinces that have no regard for 
the federal government.  We are looking at the opposite.  We want 
the federal government to show more respect for the provinces and 
to let them take on more decision making and work in a much 
better fashion than is happening now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my hon. colleague comment on that particular relationship? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is a very helpful 
question.  There are things that the original constitution laid 
out as exclusive responsibilities of both the federal government 
and the provincial governments.  There is no question that there 
has been an intrusion into those areas of provincial 
responsibility. My colleagues from the Bloc will point that out 
every time it happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look for a strengthening of the federal role in certain areas 
and a strengthening and improvement of the provincial role in 
other areas.  Most importantly, we look for a co-operative 
approach, if there is to be money spent on specific things that 
the provinces have exclusive jurisdiction over, and not simply an 
edict from on high.  That helps in other parts of the country 
and, in my view, it certainly helps in Quebec. 
<P><A NAME="LINK295"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
too wish to offer my congratulations to the governor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a pretty interesting summer.  For a Liberal MP it was 
actually a pretty easy summer because people in my constituency 
appreciate the efforts of the government, the way it has managed 
the finances of the nation and the way in which there is a great 
deal of employment, particularly in my area of the country. 
There were times when I referred to it as a love-in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we ended the congratulatory exchanges between member and 
constituent, one of the issues that kept coming up was the 
behaviour and performance of parliamentarians.  Canadians do not 
really understand what it is we do here.  I spent a lot of time 
trying to explain what it is that we do.  What they see is 
question period.  That is what they believe parliament is all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had some difficulties in explaining to them that parliament is 
something more than us making silly fools out of ourselves in 
question period.  I tried to explain that question period was 
something having nothing to do with questions or answers.  It is 
probably best described as lousy political theatre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are bored and indifferent to the process of 
parliament.  It is my view that our behaviour brings parliament 
into disrepute.  I do not see any point in assigning the blame 
for that, but it is a shame.  Not only does parliament end up in 
disrepute, it means that parliament is not seen as a forum for 
debating the larger issues of the day.  It is an anachronistic 
irrelevancy and more, and Canadians just switch channels rather 
than engage in political debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons we do not involve ourselves in the big issues 
of the day is that we end up in partisan slinging matches which 
do us no credit at the end of the day. 
I am as guilty as any other person in the House.  I anticipate 
that notwithstanding this speech and to the contrary I will not 
greatly improve my behaviour. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in an effort to be non-partisan I want to compliment 
the Leader of the Opposition on his remarks and to pick up on 
some of the comments he made in his speech even though I do not 
have 100 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thrust of his remarks was that the serious issues of the day 
were being dealt with by the courts rather than by parliament 
because parliament seemed to be quite prepared to duck the issues 
and to let the courts decide.  He also stated that transferring 
the charter of rights from a system of checks and balances, as is 
found in the United States where there is a clear legislative 
function, a clear administrative function and a clear judicial 
function, has not translated well in a parliamentary democracy 
such as ours where the legislative function and the 
administrative function are clearly fused, which in some respects 
leaves the judicial function out on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to cite a number of decisions that leave a great deal 
to be desired in their interpretation and application.  He made 
reference to the Singh decision which has imposed upon our nation 
a refugee determination system that is both costly and 
cumbersome.  The government is stuck with a costly and 
problematic refugee system which shows its flaws when migrants 
show up on our shores with absolutely no intention of making any 
claim for status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He cited the Shaw decision on child pornography as being 
offensive to many Canadians.  He made reference to the M and H 
decision on same sex and the application that the same sex 
decision solves one problem and creates two more.  He made 
reference as well to the Marshall treaty about which we have 
heard a great deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These decisions in isolation are quite sound.  Legal reasoning 
within the confines of a courtroom have a certain purity and 
logic but leave a great deal to be desired in application.  I am 
not here to blame judicial activism.  I believe the courts would 
only be too happy to return to what we used to call in law school 
black letter law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, on the issue of spousal definition, Mr. Justice 
Cory said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of how the term spouse should be defined is a 
fundamental social policy issue and Parliament should decide it 
and Parliament should listen to and balance the competing social 
issues, the philosophical issues, the legal, moral, theological 
issues that go into this definitional process.  The courts 
shouldn't be deciding it.  Parliament should be deciding it and 
the courts should defer to Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the foregoing issues have not been addressed 
by parliament in any meaningful way notwithstanding that they are 
well within the competence of parliament.  There is no party or 
government that runs on a pro-pornography platform.  As a 
practising politician, there are a lot of these issues I would be 
just as happy to duck.  These issues are largely the result of 
parliamentary neglect rather than judicial activism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is little enthusiasm on the part of the court to assume a 
jurisdictional competence that is properly the preserve of 
parliament.  Rather than simply complaining about judicial 
activism and the inactivity of parliament on some of the larger 
issues I would like to make a specific suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Picking up on the comments about family by the Leader of the 
Opposition I would suggest that the legal environment as set out 
in M and H is as follows.  First, discrimination between 
unmarried heterosexual couples living in a conjugal relationship 
is contrary to the guarantee section in section 15 of the 
charter.  Second, discrimination between married and unmarried 
common law spouses is contrary to section 15 of the charter. 
Third, discrimination between married and unmarried couples is 
not contrary to section 15 if is intended to promote family, 
children and marriage and has a socioeconomic basis that 
parliament can articulate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard several suggestions.  One of the easiest 
suggestions is to do nothing.  Others suggest we should use 
section 33 to do an override.  Might I suggest a more nuanced 
approach to this major social issue.  For want of a better term 
may I suggest that it be called the three silos concept.  The 
first silo is that of marriage.  The second silo is that of a 
registered domestic partnership.  The third silo is that of an 
unregistered domestic partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage is a unique institution of great significance to many 
Canadians particularly of religious and cultural communities.  I 
recommend that the government make a strong and positive 
statement rather than simply use double negatives so that any 
legislative ambiguities may be cleared up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second silo is that of registered domestic partnerships.  An 
operating principle of this second silo would be that it 
deconjugalize the relationship so the state stays out of the 
bedrooms of the nation. 
It is, after all, a former prime minister's 80th birthday today. 
He was the one who coined the great phrase that the state has no 
business in the bedrooms of the nation.  Surely that should be an 
operative principle in anything we discuss.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point in the domestic registered partnership is that 
legislative entitlement and responsibility are based on 
dependency rather than conjugality.  I do not quite see why that 
is so problematic for people.  I do not really know why the state 
should again be pursuing what happens in the bedrooms of the 
nation.  It should be a test of dependency rather than of 
conjugality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point of the operating principle of domestic 
partnerships is that they be treated the same as marriage unless 
parliament can demonstrate some compelling socioeconomic reason 
otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, it should recognize that the family has many forms in 
the late 20th and early 21st centuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, the government should open a register for domestic 
partnerships for same sex conjugal, same sex non-conjugal, 
opposite sex conjugal and opposite sex non-conjugal, with the 
only proviso that there be one relationship at a time and that 
any rights or benefits not be greater than anything that would be 
acquired by marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, we should expunge the concept of spouse from the lexicon, 
save and except for those people who are married, and replace 
that language with that of partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh, we would eliminate other forms of discrimination 
between conjugal and non-conjugal couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighth is the principle that registered domestic partnership is 
severed on death.  It may be dissolved in the same manner as any 
partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third silo is that of what is called a non-registered 
domestic partnership, which would essentially be the same as a 
second silo although in this particular instance the individual 
couples claiming this benefit would have to prove on the balance 
of probabilities that in fact they did live in a relationship 
with some dependency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the foregoing represents to the courts a measured 
and fair response to the court decision.  It reflects a variety 
of views and a divergence of opinions and accommodates the 
essential elements of the court decisions.  If in fact parliament 
were to adopt this kind of reasoning, the government would be 
able to draft an omnibus bill.  It is my belief that there would 
be virtually no one in the House who could vote against the 
positioning because of the wide range of views that are 
accommodated.  I would argue that parliament properly should 
reflect that wide range of views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To return to the theme as I have outlined it, I would prefer to 
see parliament dealing with the big issues of the day rather than 
exercises in partisan foolishness.  I would prefer when I visit a 
public school or a high school that I could point to colleagues 
who have made thoughtful contributions to the big issues on both 
sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to present those views and I look 
forward to questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to the remarks of my hon. 
colleague opposite.  He made a very thoughtful and thought 
provoking speech.  I know that as an active and able member of 
the justice committee he holds very sincerely to the ideals he 
has put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with particular interest when he spoke of 
parliamentary neglect as opposed to judicial activism.  I guess 
it goes without saying that as a member on the government side he 
is in a very unique position in his ability now to move the 
government to being more active in some of the social areas that 
he touched upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus my question to him specifically on an issue that 
I know he holds dear to his heart.  It involves the job that is 
currently before our police forces, the RCMP and municipal forces 
across the country.  He would know that today the Canadian Police 
Association held a press conference where it spoke on some of the 
issues it feels are priority issues for it and consequently is 
hoping to awaken the government with respect to some similar 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, I would like to get the member's comments arising 
out of the throne speech where some of the policing issues I feel 
were not given a great deal of attention or a great deal of 
emphasis.  We know that there were announcements, or perhaps more 
appropriately I would call them reannouncements, of the general 
commitment that the government has to policing services.  However 
there was never really any detail put forward as to what it 
intends to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member would know that the RCMP in particular is facing 
a near crisis with respect to the increase in drug trafficking, 
illegal immigration, organized crime and crime stemming from the 
increase in Mafia, and I am talking about Mafia from outside 
Canada obviously.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would address specifically what he feels 
the government can do and if his support is there with respect to 
increased resources that would assist the police in their efforts 
to fortify themselves for the storm of increasing criminal 
activity that is resulting in increased crime and the public 
pressures with which they are contending.  At the same time 
resources have been cut and they are not in a position to respond 
adequately.  I would suggest that the same situation exists in 
our armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically with respect to the police I am wondering what it 
is he suggests we should be doing and what the government intends 
to do about this increasing problem in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for his comments.  I thought 
my speech was about three silos, registered domestic partnerships 
and so on.  However I was asked a question about policing which I 
do not think I mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, in some respects the response of the 
government to many of these issues should be to refer a number of 
them to the justice committee in particular or to other 
committees as the case may be.  I do not know that policing 
issues take any greater priority than any other issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, I just completed an interview with the CBC on 
homelessness where some people are advocating a 1% solution, that 
1% of all budgetary revenues on the part of the federal 
government be devoted to homelessness.  On the face of it that 
has a superficial attractiveness to it.  In my area of Toronto 
and the GTA we have a particular problem with homelessness which 
is frankly nation-wide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How that ranks in priority to any resources that the police may 
need I do not know.  I know when the police come before the 
justice committee they do make excellent presentations and what 
they say is frequently heard.  For instance, on the issue of 
child pornography in the Shaw decision I really do not know why 
that should stick to the government or to any particular party 
because no one is in favour of that kind of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of thing that should be coming before the 
justice committee, with the competing values to be analysed, the 
competing requests for priority, whether they are police 
priorities or other kinds of criminal justice priorities, and 
then a reasoned decision is reached.

with the turn of the millennium, it is invigorating to see that 
our government has the knowledge and foresight to engage itself 
in the long term betterment of its population.  Canada's quality 
of life is second to none.  Yet without proper management it is 
difficult to sustain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the government's untiring work not only to support our 
nation but to encourage Canadians to grow beyond the envelope. 
Our children and our children's children will ultimately benefit 
from the new direction our government is now taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand full well the benefits and consequences of our 
social system.  In a recent era of cutbacks and slowdowns many 
Canadians have seen the fabric of our social safety net fray, but 
that era is finally behind us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outlined in the throne speech Canadian needs are being addressed 
to ensure that their lives are significantly improved.  With 
better services being provided for early childhood education, 
health, the environment, families and our infrastructure, 
Canadians can face the challenges of the 21st century with 
confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task at hand is in no way simple.  It will require 
perseverance and grit for every Canadian to see benefit from this 
new direction.  The throne speech states that “the strength of 
Canada is reflected in its rich diversity”.  This simple phrase 
speaks volumes about Canada's ethnic makeup and the bounty all 
Canadians reap from it.  It is amazing to think in a world torn 
asunder by wars of ethnic and religious hatred that Canada stands 
apart like a beacon of tolerance. 
This pluralistic cohabitation has led to an immense wealth of 
culture, plucked from the very communities that make up Canada's 
geography.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A people are made up of their past and their future.  The 
synergy of these two creates Canada's national identity.  It is 
this identity that culture seeks to preserve, to bottle it in 
words or movement, to embellish it in works of art or in 
monuments that grace our parks.  With new technologies come new 
possibilities for enhancing our cultural heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 21st century will allow us to bring the world into the 
classrooms and homes of every Canadian.  No longer are Canadians 
hindered by the vast distances that separate them.  The digital 
age is upon us.  By plugging in, people will be able to explore 
the world around them without leaving the comfort of their chair. 
Our government must embrace this medium by linking our cultural 
resources and ensuring access to all Canadians.  The benefits 
gained by such quality exposure are immeasurable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we speak of cultural heritage then it must also hold true for 
the military.  Canada just recently celebrated the 100th 
anniversary of the Boer War, yet I wonder how many Canadians 
really know much about it.  Canadians owe it to our veterans to 
ensure that the memory of their deeds remain in our collective 
psyche. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every regiment's imprint runs deep in their respective 
communities.  Each has its own story to tell and they often do it 
with fervour.  Regiments like the Royal Canadian Regiment, the 
Hasty Pees, the Loyal Eddies, the Rileys and the Prince Edward 
Island Regiment.  The list goes on and on.  As veterans pass and 
memories fade, there is a generation of children and 
grandchildren now making themselves aware of Canada's proud war 
history and affirming their important role in educating 
generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As such, we are standing on the forward edge of a new era where 
digital technology will move beyond anything we can imagine and 
will provide government with the tools to marry the past and 
future into a seamless venue to attract and amaze viewers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine ourselves participating in a World War I dogfight in the 
skies over northern Europe or experiencing the emotions as we 
crash ashore in Normandy on June 6, 1944.  Using leading edge 
technology to improve our cultural attractions, this type of 
viewer interaction is a real possibility.  Renewed emphasis on 
our National War Museum will not only enhance the prestige of our 
historical past but will also the government to focus new 
technologies into bringing the past alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's youth seem to lack the knowledge of the great deeds our 
forefathers performed in acts of utter selflessness and courage. 
I wonder how many people today really and truly understand the 
meaning of Passchendaele, Vimy Ridge, the Scheldt or Hill 355. The 
government has a duty to pay homage to that past, to elevate and 
preserve their memory for time immemorial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian War Museum will not only honour those who served in 
war and peacekeeping but will also ensure that their legacy of 
heroism and sacrifice is not forgotten by generations that have 
never experienced war.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened quite intently to the hon. member's very eloquent 
speech.  I commend him on pointing out the importance of the rich 
diversity of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was somewhat disappointed with the throne speech.  While it 
speaks about Canada as being a bilingual country in which both 
men and women of many different cultures, races and religions 
participate in economic, social and political life and our 
diversity is a source of strength and creativity making us modern 
and forward-looking, that seems to be where it stops.  The words 
are good but I think most of us would agree that words without 
action do not really mean a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It saddened me during the last session when I had to approach 
the government to explain to the House why the appointment of a 
black female judge to a unified court in Nova Scotia did not take 
place.  To this day I have not yet received a response to 
satisfactorily explain what took place in that situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What we really say to people in our society comes through by our 
actions more so than the words that are written in a speech. If 
this speech is to be meaningful as we move forward into the 21st 
century, if we are to give more substance to these words, then 
the actions have to prove and bear out that we really mean what 
we are talking about in terms of the diversity of our country 
making us strong and people having equal opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member mentioned the military, I thought about our 
veteran merchant mariners who are still fighting for justice, 
still seeking some form of compensation to make up for the 
injustice that was done to them following the war.  Those kinds 
of actions or lack of action by the government say more to people 
than words in a throne speech talking about being supportive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have any comments to make on those 
particular instances?  Could he also perhaps indicate how he sees 
his government moving forward in a real positive way to give some 
substance to the words that are in the throne speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would really like to 
respond to the first part of the member's question but I do not 
have the background on the issue at hand.  As I do not know the 
situation thoroughly, I feel I would be overstepping the 
knowledge I have in order to give an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We both see eye to eye and we will continue to work on behalf of 
our veterans who crewed the ships during the war and were lost in 
heavy numbers or were taken prisoner well in advance of many 
members of the Canadian forces.  It is certainly my wish to see a 
wrong righted in that area as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think I can say much more other than to say that we do 
see eye to eye.  As we are both on the same committee, we will 
both continue to work for the betterment of our naval seamen who 
worked, some of whom lost their lives and now have very little 
compensation for their efforts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK299"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in standing 
to speak to the throne speech, I must say that there were no big 
surprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I hold the critic responsibility for the Reform Party in 
the area of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, I eagerly 
scanned the throne speech to see what was in there that related 
to aboriginal people and the challenges that aboriginal people 
and government face in Canada today. I was not surprised but I 
was disappointed to see that there was no change in direction on 
the part of the government and that it is steady as she goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government feels that it is charting the right course. It 
obviously continues to use words like partnership, gathering 
strength and all kinds of nice words and phrases that would leave 
the average person listening to the throne speech with the 
impression that progress has been made, is actually being made 
and that things are continuing to improve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the House that nothing could be further from the 
truth.  In fact, for aboriginal people in Canada things continue 
to go downhill.  The social problems on reserves continue to 
worsen.  The economic circumstances for aboriginal people living 
on reserves continue to worsen.  The programs that have been put 
in place by successive governments over a long period of time in 
the country have actually, if anything, been counterproductive to 
the health and welfare of aboriginal people in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, the Government of Canada decided to invest in 
aboriginal economic development back in the early 1990s.  It 
spent $1 billion on aboriginal economic development over a period 
of four years.  These facts are all contained in the Auditor 
General's Report to parliament.  Over the same period of time 
that the $1 billion was expended, the economic conditions on 
reserves worsened, the unemployment rate continued to increase 
and the overall picture continue to worsen, to darken, rather 
than to improve.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question one naturally asks is why would the government 
continue to go down the same road when there have been no 
positive results and there continue to be negative results?  Do 
we not learn as human beings from experience?  Do we not look to 
the past to gather and analyse information to assist us in making 
decisions about what we are going to do in the future?  That is 
really what learning and human history is all about.  The 
government has refused to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, one asks why we would go through the trouble of 
having all of these government departments that can track the 
impacts and effects of various government programs and 
expenditures if we are not going to pay attention to the results. 
I have come to the conclusion that the government by choice 
automatically insulates itself from the realities of its own 
policies.  It does not want that feedback.  It does not want to 
know that its policies are failures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not want to know because it does not want to 
admit that it has failed. The government lacks the vision and the 
courage to think outside the box, to think in some new way that 
could perhaps be of great benefit not only to aboriginal people 
but to the country as a whole.  Obviously, the country has a 
challenge in front of it which badly needs to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals do not have the courage to face that challenge. 
They do not have the courage to admit that the way things have 
been done in the past, the policies that have been implemented 
and the taxpayers' money that has been expended has not been of 
any benefit to native people in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government not willing at least to analyse the results of 
its policies?  We would think that at least a majority of native 
leaders would be interested in going through that analysis and 
going back to government and saying that what the government has 
been doing has not been working and they need a change.  Why are 
the chiefs and councils across Canada not engaged in a process of 
examination and analysis?  Why are they not advocating for 
change? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the reason becomes clear when more time is spent looking 
at what the department of Indian affairs does and how it has a 
relationship with native leaders across Canada and native leaders 
at the national level. There is a symbiotic relationship. Both 
parties are unwilling to admit failure because they fundamentally 
do not want to change the status quo.  The reason most native 
leaders do not want to change the status quo is that they are 
caught up in the system. Some direct personal benefit accumulates 
to them as a result of being part of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that strikes me as I travel from place to 
place and talk with grassroots aboriginal people is that they 
feel as fundamentally disconnected from their leaders in many 
cases as do ordinary Canadians from their political leaders. 
There is a sense of frustration that the programs are supposed to 
be benefiting them as individuals but they are not hitting the 
mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to do a critical analysis to determine why that is the 
case.  The greatest mistake the federal government has made and 
continues to make and shows no sign of changing when it comes to 
native people is it continues to treat native people as 
collectivities rather than as individuals.  It wants to deal in 
programs and policies that are related directly to 
collectivities. That is why we see certain things in modern 
treaties that are being negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is mentioned in the throne speech.  We are 
going to have a lot more to say about it in the coming weeks when 
the government actually introduces the legislation. Fundamentally 
it sees the Nisga'a as a collectivity of some 5,000 people.  It 
does not see the individuals. 
It looks at the Nisga'a people, and aboriginal people in general, 
as being some kind of homogeneous group that thinks the same way, 
that wants the same things and that fundamentally has a culture 
that is different from the rest of Canada and therefore must be 
treated differently.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, what gets lost in the shuffle when that happens is 
the individual.  Individual rights are put on the back burner in 
favour of collective rights, and individual aboriginal people are 
coming to that realization in a major way in the country. 
Individual native people are coming to understand that their 
rights as Canadians are fundamentally sidelined in favour of 
these collective rights that are somehow supposed to benefit 
them, but they see very clearly that those benefits are not 
accruing.
