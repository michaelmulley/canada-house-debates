<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVILEGE 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK2"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MEMBER FOR QUÉBEC EAST—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> On Monday, November 1, 1999, the hon. member 
for Québec East raised a question of privilege concerning the 
breach of his privileges in relation to a civil suit launched 
against him by a senator who accused him of distributing 
defamatory material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the hon. member 
for raising the matter. 
I also want to acknowledge and thank the Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, the opposition House leader, 
the Progressive Conservative House leader, the Bloc Quebecois 
House leader and whip of the Bloc Quebecois for their 
contributions on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member indicated that a lawsuit was launched against 
him by a senator following the distribution to his constituents 
of a bulk mailing of 16 pages on the subject of the Senate.  His 
question of privilege concerned the involvement of the Senate in 
the lawsuit and the belief that this involvement was an 
aggressive act against the House of Commons and a breach of his 
privilege of freedom of speech as an elected member of this 
House.  He alleged that there had been direct or indirect 
involvement of the Senate in the lawsuit and that this 
constituted an attack on the authority and dignity of the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of things that I wish to deal with at this 
time. 
First, I want to underline that I will make no comment on the 
civil case that is now before the courts since this would be 
inappropriate and not in keeping with our longstanding 
practices.  Second, I do not believe that the Speaker should 
comment on decisions the Board of Internal Economy may or may 
not have taken.  I am sure that all members will appreciate and 
understand that the House is certainly not a court of appeal for 
decisions taken by that body.  Indeed, while questions can be 
addressed to the Board of Internal Economy representatives 
during question period, the House through the Parliament of 
Canada Act, has mandated the Board of Internal Economy as the 
final authority in these matters. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will however comment on the contention that the hon. member's 
parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech has been breached. 
Erskine May suggests on page 143 of the 20th edition that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be vain to attempt an enumeration of every act which 
might be construed into a contempt, the power to punish for 
contempt being in its nature discretionary...It may be stated 
generally that any act or omission which obstructs or impedes 
either House of Parliament in the performance of its functions, 
or which obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House 
in the discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly 
or indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as a 
contempt, even though there is no precedent of the offence. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any attempt to intimidate a member with a view to influencing 
his or her parliamentary conduct is a breach of privilege.  Let 
me reiterate for all members that privilege is a fundamental 
principle of parliamentary law. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 22nd edition of Erskine May, page 65, parliamentary 
privilege is defined as: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed by each House 
collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of 
Parliament, and by Members of each House individually, without 
which they could not discharge their functions, and which exceed 
those possessed by other bodies or individuals. 
</UL></UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position put forward by the hon. member for Québec East 
suggests that the senator has made an explicit effort to 
intimidate him by limiting his freedom of speech.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all hon. members know, the privilege of freedom of speech is 
so fundamental that this House could not discharge its 
constitutional duties without it.  May goes on to state in the 
19th edition that, “Freedom of Speech is a privilege essential 
to every free council or legislature”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members must realize, however, that there are very real 
limits to parliamentary privilege.  Speaker Jerome, when 
speaking on the limits of parliamentary privilege in his ruling 
of February 20, 1975 added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences of extending that definition of privilege to 
innumerable areas outside this chamber into which the work of an 
MP might carry him, and particularly to the great number of 
grievances he might encounter in the course of that work, would 
run contrary to the basic concept of privilege. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me stress that, in order to have a breach of the hon. 
member's privileges, the matter complained of must be directly 
related to a proceeding in parliament.  If a member is indeed 
subjected to threats and intimidation, he or she is clearly 
hindered in the fulfilment of the parliamentary responsibilities 
for which he or she was elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crucial question that must be determined is “What 
constitutes proceedings in parliament?” 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Erskine May in the 19th edition, at page 87, characterizes 
“proceedings of parliament” in the following manner: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual Member takes part in a proceeding usually by 
speech, but also by various recognized kinds of formal action, 
such as voting, giving notice of a motion, etc., or presenting a 
petition or a report from a Committee, most of such actions being 
time-saving substitutes for speaking. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joseph Maingot clearly states on page 315 of his book 
<I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be pointed out that in regard to this privilege, a 
Member's privilege of freedom of speech concerns speaking in the 
House or Assembly or in a committee.  In addition, the Member is 
also protected when carrying out those duties, as a Member of 
the House, that have a nexus with a parliamentary proceeding. 
However, when the Member performs such duties to his 
constituents and his party the fulfilment of which do not 
involve a parliamentary proceeding, the Member is not so 
protected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that my predecessor, Speaker Fraser, stated matters 
succinctly on June 10, 1993: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a Member says outside the House about anyone is subject to 
the laws of the land relating to libel or slander as it would be 
for any other Canadian—if indeed the comments are actionable. 
What Members say in the Chamber, however, is protected by 
privilege. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I view the types of charges raised by the hon. member 
with great importance, my role as Speaker is limited to dealing 
strictly with breaches of privilege that occur during 
proceedings in parliament.  In the words of Joseph Maingot on 
page 105 in his book <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is necessary for something to be said or done in the 
transaction of a “proceeding in Parliament” before the Member 
has Parliamentary immunity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the incident referred to concerns information contained in 
a document distributed by the hon. member to his constituents, 
it is quite clear that this did not take place during 
proceedings in parliament and is therefore not protected by 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, with respect to the complaint the hon. member for 
Quebec East has against the senator, I must underline that the 
House has no authority over the Senate.  In the 22nd 
edition of May, on page 149 it is stated and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the two Houses are wholly independent of each other, 
neither House can claim, much less exercise, any authority over 
a Member or officer of the other, and thus cannot punish any 
breach of privilege or contempt offered to it by such Member or 
officer.  If a complaint is made against a Member or officer of 
the other House, the appropriate course of action is to examine 
the facts and then lay a statement of the evidence before the 
House of which the person complained of is a Member or officer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the reasons stated above, I must rule that the matter does 
not constitute a prima facie case of privilege, nor a contempt 
of parliament.

1994 declaring a series of firearms as prohibited weapons 
effective January 1, 1995, what has the government determined to 
be: (<I>a</I>) the total number and type of firearms confiscated under 
OIC No. 11; (<I>b</I>) the total number and type of firearms confiscated 
for which compensation was given to the owner; (<I>c</I>) the rationale

Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> It should first 
be noted that the firearms which were declared prohibited weapons 
under Order No. 11, SOR/94-744 were not all appropriated but some 
were in fact voluntarily handed over by their owners. Owners who 
did not voluntarily turn over their firearms were not eligible 
for any payment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) A letter was sent to firearms owners by the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police to notify them that their firearms had been 
declared prohibited weapons under Order No. 11, SOR/94-744. The 
letter advised them to voluntarily hand over their weapons to the 
authorities and that they would be eligible for compensation for 
firearms returned voluntarily. In order to receive compensation 
owners were also required to do the following: sign a notice of 
waiver; provide their surname, given name, date of birth, address 
and telephone number; provide the make, model and serial number 
of the returned firearm; and indicate the month and year in which 
the firearm was acquired.

these firearms were seized and there was a destruction order from 
the court; 8 of these firearms were not listed in Order No. 11,

evidence from veterans deployed to Somalia detailing medical 
problems relating to mefloquine use amongs soldiers; (<I>b</I>) 
declined to recognize that a veteran had suffered a disability 
related to mefloquine use in either Somalia or Rwanda because it 
had no evidence from the Canadian Forces showing that the veteran 
had complained of mefloquine side effects while in Somalia; (<I>c</I>)

veterans who had been deployed to Somalia; (<I>g</I>) dismissed a 
claim from a veteran deployed to Somalia on the basis that 
emotional problems resulting from mefloquine only occur in 
situations where it is being used in the treatment of malaria and 
not for the prevention of malaria; (<I>h</I>) found it had no evidence

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), 
Lib.):</B> The Veterans Review and Appeal Board advises that it 
adjudicated over 49,000 cases in the past five years and does not 
track the nature of the evidence presented in support of claims. 
As such, the board cannot respond with certainty about what 
evidence may or may not have been given to the board in the 
course of a specific appeal. Recently a case where there was some 
evidence concerning the drug mefloquine on file was the subject 
of a federal court judicial review. The federal court referred 
the case back to the board to be redecided in accordance with 
the instruction of the court on how the board must interpret the 
pension Act. The only issue before the board was an issue of 
statutory interpretation. No additional evidence was necessary in 
order to render a fully favourable decision. The appellant's 
representative was advised of this and a decision was issued.

<A NAME="LINK44">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House regrets the failure of the government to 
recognize the importance of Canada's food industries: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) by failing to provide leadership, a long-term vision and 
workable solutions for Canada's fishery and agriculture sectors; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) by not adequately preparing for the decision of the Supreme 
Court of Canada in R. v Marshall which acknowledged fishing, 
hunting and gathering rights for Canada's aboriginal Peoples; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) by failing to address the serious problems of Canada's 
agricultural producers, who are suffering from increasing 
subsidized competition, rising input costs, natural and economic 
disasters, and an inadequate long-term national safety net, the 
result of which has contributed greatly to increased financial 
and mental stresses on family farms and in fishing communities; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>and, therefore, this House urges the government to give 
consideration to the immediate and long-term needs of Canada's 
agriculture and fishing industries. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, at the outset I would ask the Chair to 
recognize that I will be splitting my time with my colleague from 
West Nova, who will be speaking to the issue of fisheries.  I 
will be speaking to the issue of agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to stand today and present the motion on 
behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party.  The motion points 
to the failure of the federal government over the past six years 
to properly manage Canada's resource based industries, fisheries 
and agriculture, and to give them the priority they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is about more than simply agriculture and fisheries, 
although we will use those as the examples, and certainly bad 
examples as demonstrated by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion speaks to the lack of the ability of the government 
to manage.  It speaks to the lack of leadership and vision, not 
only for agriculture and fisheries, but also the quality of life 
for Canadians who reside in rural communities throughout this 
great country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It speaks to the inability of the government to put forward the 
understanding that these areas of our economy are vital and 
important to Canadians.  Our natural resources, particularly 
agriculture and fisheries, but also forestry and mining, have 
been the backbone of the country over the last century.  They 
have been dropped down on the priority list to where it has 
almost been negligence on behalf of the government not to 
identify these areas as having a higher priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has failed to recognize the importance of 
our food industries.  It has failed to provide clear direction, 
leadership, long term vision and workable solutions for our 
fishery and agriculture sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has an opportunity today in debate in the House 
to finally show that it will be committed to the immediate and 
long term needs of Canada's agriculture and fishing industries. 
The government has been noticeably absent in its commitment over 
the past six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak with some authority on the agriculture industry.  I 
will begin today's debate speaking to that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a simple reality.  Farm families and rural communities 
across Canada are paying a very high price for having a Liberal 
government unchallenged and uncaring in Ottawa.  There is a long 
pattern of neglect, but the past few years have shown just how 
dramatically issues of importance to rural Canada have fallen off 
the government's agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family farm is a way of life.  Food production is a source 
of life.  The two are interconnected and the survival of both is 
fundamental to the well-being of every Canadian.  The federal 
government must act now to maintain the viability of Canadian 
farms and Canadian fishing industries in villages throughout the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the Liberal government realized that agriculture is 
important to this country as a supplier of the best food in the 
world.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States and the European Union have identified 
agriculture as being a priority in the support systems that have 
been set up to make sure that farms are retained within their 
societies. Our government has not done so. I would like to hear 
what it believes the future of these two vital industries will be 
having been neglected for the past six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture is one of the most efficient industries in Canada. 
Our reputation in the world is strong.  We have 10% of the 
world's farmland.  The growing globe will always need more to eat 
and will always find new ways to use agricultural products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian producers are in the best position to take advantage of 
this bright future.  But if we fail to support our producers, if 
we fail to invest in agriculture and ensure its long term 
stability, that advantage will disappear.  We will have to import 
foodstuffs in order to feed our population as opposed to 
depending on a reliable domestic food supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize and emphasize the natural strength of this 
region.  Canada has a rich future in value added industries if we 
develop the natural resources to which that value is added. One 
of the differences between the Liberal Party and the Progressive 
Conservative Party is we understand that agriculture and natural 
resources are still the fundamental building blocks of our 
Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment now on the Liberal government's lack of 
leadership in addressing this very important issue.  The throne 
speech is one example of how void the government is when it comes 
to any long term vision for Canadian resource based industries. 
There was no reference to what the current government proposes to 
do to maintain a viable agriculture and agri-food sector while 
that sector continues to suffer through one of the worst 
financial crunches since the 1930s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech was devoid of any recognition of the 
agricultural situation that we as Canadians now find ourselves 
in. That is an absolute shame. I do not know if that speaks to 
the government's philosophy or lack thereof or to the inability 
of the minister to get that priority to the cabinet table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the advent of our current government's sudden focus on 
technology as the wave of the future, it has unfortunately 
disregarded the fact that agriculture's sustainability remains 
one of the basic needs of any country in the world, particularly 
Canada. The agricultural sector in Canada is facing increasing 
subsidized competition, rising input costs, natural and economic 
disasters and an inadequate national safety net program while the 
government stands idle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, for every $1 farmers in Canada receive on a per 
capita basis, their competitors in the United States and in 
Europe receive more than $2.50 in support from their governments. 
This does not include the $8.6 billion farm aid package recently 
approved by the United States, a move that will double direct 
payments to farmers in that country this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1993 the minister of agriculture stated when he was 
in opposition: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>GRIP and NISA, which are long term safety net programs, are being 
tried and are being worked with.  So far in many areas they have 
been insufficient.  They have been a disappointment to the 
farmers and the industry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a quote from <I>Hansard</I> in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is safe to say that most farmers today would take GRIP and 
NISA over AIDA, the disastrous program that has been put forward 
by the Liberal government. GRIP and NISA had vision, had long 
term understanding as to the safety net project.  The GRIP 
program was taken away by the government and not replaced by any 
long term safety net program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also sad to see the minister of agriculture using 
desperate attempts to gain sympathy from the agriculture 
community for his dismal record.  He talks of taking a tough love 
approach.  Perhaps the minister would like to expand on the 
definition of a tough love approach.  Does it mean that 
agriculture, farmers and producers in our country are to stand 
alone or fall together?  Is that the tough love approach the 
minister wishes to take? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also sad to see the minister pit farmer against farmer.  I 
will not quote what was reported in a newspaper recently, but the 
issue was that there were others in the farm community who did 
not want to bail out any of their counterparts in the industry. 
That is not true.  From what I have seen and heard having talked 
with my producers on a regular basis, there is a collegiality 
among producers.  They want to have a long term vision, a long 
term program, a long term viability and understanding of this 
industry.  We have none of that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if we are going to end up with 1,000 producers 
producing all that is necessary for domestic production.  Is that 
where the government wishes to go?  If it is, there is more than 
just farm production at risk. There is a quality of life and a 
way of life in rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to say that I come from a rural community, as 
does my colleague from West Nova who deals with the fishery.  I 
deal with agriculture.  It is a way of life.  It is the way that 
we live, a quality of life that we wish to retain.  That vision, 
that understanding, that philosophy and that ideology has to be 
put forward in programs and must be accepted by the government of 
the day.  If the government of the day cannot develop those 
programs, be assured that the next government under the 
Progressive Conservative Party will understand that, as did the 
previous Conservative government in 1993.  The next government 
will put forward those programs, that vision, that philosophy and 
the ideology that will support rural Canada as opposed to 
destroying it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now acquiesce to my colleague from West Nova to deal with 
the issue of aquaculture and fisheries. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great regret and a deep sense of frustration that I rise before 
the House to denounce the government's failure to adequately 
respond to the growing crisis that exists within our rural areas 
which depend almost exclusively on Canada's food industries to 
earn their livelihoods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party has consistently called upon the government to act 
in the best interests of our farmers and fishers, yet our calls 
for assistance have basically fallen upon deaf ears.  Our party 
is using our supply day motion to once again draw the attention 
of the government to the economic hardships that exist within our 
farming and fishing communities.  The farm crisis in our western 
provinces and the recent crisis in the Atlantic fishery are prime 
examples of the government's failure to address the growing 
crisis in these two primary industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his remarks, my hon. colleague from Brandon—Souris 
effectively identified the serious problems facing our western 
farmers.  Without an adequate long term federal aid program, many 
of our western farmers will be facing economic ruin.  Despite 
numerous pleas for help from my hon. colleague along with those 
coming from the premiers of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the 
federal government, in particular its minister of agriculture, 
has simply introduced a band-aid solution that will do little to 
ensure the long term survival of our prairie farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps overshadowed during the whole debate has been the 
equally serious crisis facing our Nova Scotia farmers.  After 
three consecutive seasons of drought conditions, they find 
themselves wondering whether they will have a future for 
themselves and their families in this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AIDA program looked at the last three years to determine if 
there would be a benefit.  The farmers who live in my 
constituency have been experiencing drought conditions for the 
last three years, but they have been unable to get any benefits 
from the AIDA program.  That is only one of the issues and one of 
the examples of what is facing our farmers in southwestern Nova 
Scotia.  That is not acceptable.  What is being produced by these 
farmers is valuable not just from a food point of view but as an 
economic benefit as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians are alarmed by the constant brain drain that is 
occurring in this country.  There has been a continuous exodus of 
some of Canada's finest young minds who see a better future for 
themselves in the U.S.  This situation is having a profound 
effect on our farming community.  Our youth must see a future for 
themselves within the farming industry, yet this will only happen 
if the government starts to take the problem facing our farming 
industry seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think anything could epitomize more the government's 
lack of leadership than its recent handling of the supreme court 
decision in the Donald Marshall Jr. case.  Despite having years 
to prepare for any consequences the supreme court decision would 
have, we sadly witnessed a total lack of understanding of this 
situation by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans who was 
undoubtedly misguided and ill prepared to respond to the fear and 
anger that accompanied the court decision.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans was not prepared to 
immediately respond to the Donald Marshall decision continues to 
baffle everyone involved in the industry.  It is beyond all 
comprehension why the minister failed to have a plan in place 
that would have responded to the decision.  Now the minister 
would argue that he was prepared and that he did have a solution 
in hand, but the facts would tend to show otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada released its decision on September 
17 yet the minister only released a statement on September 20, 
which in effect says he did not know he had to study it.  For 
three days there were no comments.  Obviously native fishers were 
more prepared for the decision than the minister as they began 
setting lobster traps almost immediately following the decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While tensions in Atlantic Canada continued to rise as a result 
of the supreme court decision, the minister of fisheries 
continued to reassure us that a solution was in hand.  On October 
1 he announced that he would seek a short term deal with the 
native community for a moratorium that would not rule out acting 
unilaterally if a decision was not reached.  The chiefs acted on 
their own without the minister's assistance and introduced their 
own moratorium, which in most instances was maintained throughout 
the crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Native chiefs, like our fisheries representatives, recognized 
the inability of the minister to show any kind of leadership in 
the dispute.  Even the Prime Minister recognized the seriousness 
of the situation when he suggested that the government could ask 
the supreme court to suspend its decision.  Obviously he realized 
that his minister of fisheries had fumbled the ball on this very 
serious issue and was looking for a way out of a very tense 
situation that was threatening to erupt into violence in the 
Atlantic provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and his Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
openly disagreed regarding the solution to the Atlantic fishery 
crisis.  If native and non-native fishers were looking for any 
type of leadership following the supreme court decision, they 
quickly realized that they were not going to find it within the 
ranks of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 15 the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announced the 
appointment of Mr. James MacKenzie to negotiate an agreement that 
would allow native and non-native fishers to share the resource. 
Almost a full month after the decision we discovered that the 
only solution that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans had in 
response to the crisis was to appoint an independent negotiator. 
If this was the best the minister could offer, why did he not 
appoint this individual immediately following the ruling?  Why 
did he only act following unfortunate acts of violence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Native and non-native leaders within my constituency deserve 
much credit for coming to a temporary agreement over the fishery 
in lobster fishing area 34.  They recognized that the government 
was either ill prepared, or even worse, did not care what 
happened to the fishery.  They agreed to solve the problems 
themselves and they deserve much credit for reducing the tensions 
that exist in our area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that the minister of fisheries has no idea how to 
resolve the fisheries crisis and now he appoints Mr. MacKenzie to 
try to defuse the growing tension among native and non-native 
groups.  Unfortunately he failed to provide Mr. MacKenzie with 
any terms of reference.  It was almost seven weeks before Mr. 
MacKenzie's terms of reference were made public.  That again 
shows the total lack of preparedness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should the industry respect anything that comes out of the 
minister's mouth when he continues to show his total ineptitude 
in handling the situation?  The minister of fisheries continues 
to say that this situation can only be resolved through 
consultation.  I agree, but what is consultation worth if the 
minister refuses to listen to any of it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, over the last few years the minister has been 
threatening to increase the size of lobster to protect stocks. 
Our fishery representatives have agreed to do V-notching instead 
until such time and further scientific evidence can show that 
this system is not effective.  The minister has yet to agree to 
this request but instead appears willing to put further hardship 
on our fishers by unilaterally imposing an increased lobster 
size.  Now our fishers are faced with an increase in the number 
of fishers plus an increase in the size of lobsters which could 
result in a serious decline in revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lobster fishery is vital to our local economy as is our 
farming industry.  It is time that our government began 
recognizing the importance of the food industry to the overall 
economy before it is too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude my remarks by moving an amendment to 
the opposition motion. I move: 
<A NAME="LINK46">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by adding after the word

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The question is on the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for my colleague for West Nova who has been and will 
continue to be very involved in the fisheries issue, particularly 
as it now unfolds with the Marshall decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need to look too far in the distant future to know 
that perhaps at some point in time the minister of fisheries will 
have a position of power.  Knowing full well what was going on in 
the supreme court with respect to Marshall, would my colleague 
have tried to put into place some planning, some strategy for 
best case and worst case scenarios?  Or, would he simply have 
done what the government has done and wait until all this 
unfolded with no strategy and no plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If so, how would he have seen this play out as opposed to having 
the violence that we have seen and the inability of government to 
negotiate after the fact?  What would he have seen as a better 
resolution to the issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That speaks directly to the motion: the lack of management, the 
inability to be able to put forward plans and to mitigate issues 
and situations which have happened in the past with respect to 
fisheries, agriculture, port disputes, lumber disputes, pork 
disputes and beef disputes.  We have had them all.  How would my 
hon. colleague have tried to come up with something better as a 
strategy or plan than what happened? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very happy my hon. 
colleague asked that question.  I do not know if it is my 
involvement some years ago with the Boy Scout movement or if it 
is my personal way of doing things from my business background, 
but I like knowing or at least being prepared for what is coming, 
be it good or bad.  I always try to prepare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this reason that I just cannot fathom why the minister 
of fisheries was not prepared.  He said that it could have gone 
many ways.  There were two obvious ways that it could have gone: 
either the decision was in favour of Donald Marshall or it was 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were in favour of Donald Marshall there were things that 
could have been done.  He could have been prepared.  He could 
have come down to the affected areas and said that they had a 
plan, that they were working with both sides, that they would 
work with them and iron out some kind of solution at least in the 
long term so they could work toward a longer term solution to the 
problem.  Had it gone the other side, the native community would 
have had some concerns.  Obviously negotiations would have been 
needed there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there was none of that.  There was no preparedness.  It 
took seven weeks to show the terms of reference for the 
negotiator, almost a month to appoint a negotiator, and three 
days to make an initial announcement on the decision.  That is 
total unpreparedness.  It is not acceptable and this is ongoing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was speaking with a friend shortly after the decision came 
down.  I said it blew me away that the government did not have a 
solution in place.  He said that was how it was, that there was 
never a solution, only band-aids one after another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not a solution.  There has to be one.  We need a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I point out to my colleague on the opposite side that 
the supreme court decision with respect to Marshall was a divided 
decision.  There was a minority of the judges that ruled in 
entirely the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him that had the Marshall issue been an 
issue before parliament instead of before the supreme court, how 
would he have come down.  Would he have come down on the side of 
the majority decision of the judges, that is to extend the rights 
to the aboriginals over the lobster fishery, or would he have 
come down on the side of the minority which said that this was 
not appropriate?  How would he have voted had this been an issue 
before parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very good 
question.  I respect the spirit in which it was asked, but I 
think there is a clear difference between what the government did 
and what this party would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not have had this decision go to the supreme court but 
would have dealt with the issue in parliament so that it could 
have been debated.  Then we would have gone back to the parties 
involved and negotiated a settlement.  We would not have put it 
in the hands of the supreme court. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to participate 
in the debate today and to provide some of the details of the 
government's response to the serious financial situation facing 
many Canadian farmers today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to diminish or underestimate the level of the 
crisis for a number of producers in Canada today, but I do want 
to say as well that overall our agriculture and agrifood sector 
is strong.  It is and will continue to make a major contribution 
to the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past year, however, has not been easy for many producers. 
We understand that very fully.  They have been struggling against 
a number of things.  They have been struggling against low 
commodity prices that are in effect around the world.  They have 
been struggling because of the fallout of the Asian economy and 
some of the markets that have been lost there.  They have been 
struggling because of those reduced markets.  They have been 
struggling because of excessive moisture in some cases and in 
others lack of moisture in certain parts of the country.  All 
these issues have combined to have a serious impact on the 
economies of many producers, particularly those in the grain, 
oilseed and hog industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However under the government's leadership, and with the 
co-operation of the provincial governments and farm 
organizations, we have come together to respond to the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House and Canadians again that about a year ago the 
hon. member for Brandon—Souris and his party were recommending 
that the government should come to the assistance of Canadian 
farmers to the extent of $276 million, I believe it was.  I 
remind the House that the government has come to the assistance 
of producers in a number of ways, one of which has been $1.07 
billion or close to $1.1 billion to assist producers, which is 
just about four times what the hon. member's party said it would 
give.  Thank goodness it is not in power, but I think we 
understand why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members can say all they want, but I remind everybody of 
the situation in 1993 when their party ended its reign of terror 
and left Canada taking in $120 billion a year and spending $162 
billion a year, the largest single deficit in the history of 
Canada. 
We were for all technical purposes bankrupt because of nine years 
in which they were in power, adding to a situation they took over 
but a situation they promised Canadians they would fix but only 
made considerably worse.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for West Nova made reference to the fact that farmers 
in Nova Scotia had been suffering from drought for two or three 
years.  Shortly after I became minister I reminded the producers 
and the government there that a crop insurance program needed to 
be in place to assist in the forage industry, for example.  They 
did not do that when they had the first drought.  They did not do 
that when they had the second drought.  Now they are working on 
it and I praise them for it.  They have now had three years of 
experience in that regard.  It shows a lack of understanding by 
hon. members in that some of these matters are under the control 
of the provinces, and I assume the hon. member is encouraging the 
provincial government in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Brandon—Souris also made comments with reference 
to GRIP.  GRIP was not all bad and was not all good, but I ask 
him to ask some of the provinces like the province of 
Saskatchewan why they cancelled GRIP.  This is one of the 
reasons, and not the only one, that a number of farmers in 
Saskatchewan are in very grave difficulty.  Other provinces kept 
a portion or a GRIP-type program which has been working very well 
for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February of this year our government moved to aid Canadian 
farmers by putting in place the agriculture income disaster 
program.  That program is funded 60% by the federal government 
and 40% by the provincial government.  The first announcement on 
the program will support Canadian farmers with contributions to 
the extent of $1.5 billion in addition to the $1 billion per year 
in safety net programs already in place.  That took place after 
extensive consultations with the National Safety Nets Advisory 
Committee made up of representatives of all major farm 
commodities.  That announcement was made last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In early November of this year we made an additional 
announcement of another $170 million from the 60% federal 
portion.  We made some further changes to assist, to deepen and 
to broaden the coverage of the program, bringing the total 
federal support close to $1.1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are encouraging the provinces to join in the standard 60:40 
support to the program.  That has taken place over the years and 
has become accepted by everyone.  We are telling the provinces 
that if they do not wish to put it forward to support the aid 
program they can do it with equivalent measures.  We presume and 
expect that relationship will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit the AIDA program may not be perfect but it has proven to 
help many Canadian farmers withstand the crisis they are facing. 
Over 51,000 applications have been received.  More than $370 
million have been paid out so far for 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the House and Canadian farmers that the total money 
will be paid out.  We have made changes to ensure that.  If 
necessary, we will continue to make changes to the program to 
ensure that.  I do know and admit that the money did not flow as 
quickly as we all would like it to.  There are applications which 
have to take place so that we can direct the money to those who 
need it.  I also assure members that in the very near future the 
remainder of the money for 1998 will be paid out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in Saskatchewan to date over 8,000 farmers have 
received over $80 million.  I should add that if the province 
agrees to participate in covering the changes that we made 
recently to negative margins, over the two years of the program 
our estimates are that it will move to about $585 million to 
assist producers in the province of Saskatchewan alone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also mention other changes we have made in response to 
the comments of the safety nets advisory committee. They include 
changes to the reference period, to how we treat family labour, 
to the choice of accounting system and I could go on.  We have 
also made changes to the advance payments so that farmers can, at 
this time, apply for 60% of their anticipated requirement for 
1999 so that we can get them more cash to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past summer we made access easier and faster to crop 
insurance.  We made changes to the NISA program so that 
withdrawals from and deposits to are improved.  As a result, over 
41,000 more Canadian farmers have access to that fund, and I 
could go on.  That made available another $117 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind everyone that there are still, for example, in the 
province of Saskatchewan, over 26,000 farmers who have triggered 
withdrawals from the NISA program as a result of their 1998 
business year, and there is over $280 million still available.  I 
encourage them to participate in that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on but I will sum up by saying that we have continued 
and we will continue to support our farmers with effective and 
flexible safety nets.  We will continue to work with them and for 
them to find additional ways to support and strengthen rural 
agricultural Canada and rural Canada in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue the dialogue with the provinces and the farm 
groups.  We will be working with them to put in place a longer 
term agricultural disaster assistance program, one that will work 
effectively and invaluably with the NISA program, crop insurance 
program and all other programs at the present time. I am 
confident that we can work with the sector to strengthen and 
improve the agriculture in rural Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
great opportunity to be able to question a government minister on 
any issue, and especially one of the importance that our farmers 
have been experiencing throughout the country, whether it was a 
commodity issue that took place last year or the farm income 
crisis which they have currently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. minister is quite simple.  When it comes 
to hog farmers in the province of New Brunswick, and I am 
speaking primarily about the ones in my riding, they are very 
clear in terms of having a long range program for disaster relief 
and in terms of what AIDA is filling as a stop gap to complement 
NISA.  Would the minister now say that the abolition of the GRIP 
program was a clear and utter mistake? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there were a number of 
programs in the past that were discussed by all sectors of the 
industry.  At one time the pork industry was involved in a 
national tripartite stabilization program.  Over the years it was 
discussed that some changes could be made to that.  As the hon. 
member said, a GRIP program was put in.  It was basically a whole 
farm program that was there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that for a number of reasons, some because of 
the industry itself, some because of the way in which the 
provinces felt about the program, and yes, some because of 
discussions with the federal government, some of these programs 
have been changed.  That is why we are looking at a full analysis 
and a review of the safety net programs that are there and a long 
term program to put in place to assist producers over a long term 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be very well be benefits carried forward from some of 
the thoughts and ideas in the GRIP program.  It too was not 
perfect.  If it had been perfect it would still be there. The 
bottom line is that because it was not what everybody wanted, 
there have been some changes as we see today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in my 
riding there are a number of farmers who have applied for AIDA. 
Very few, if any, that I know of have received any funding.  Most 
of them have been denied.  Many have come to my office with the 
forms and I can honestly say that I have never seen such 
complicated, ridiculous types of forms that farmers are expected 
to fill in to accomplish this task of making an application. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an accounting degree and I can understand why accountants 
are having such severe problem with it.  Why is the government 
making this so complicated for the average farmer?  Why is it 
using, according to Stats Canada, 1997 stats in order to make 
decisions regarding AIDA?  This is 1999.  Why are we using dated 
stats to deny farmers this support? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the requests from the 
provincial governments and the industry beginning about a year 
ago was that there needed to be some support to recognize the 
precipitous drops in incomes, particularly those in the grains 
and hog industries, relative to the three previous years 1997, 
1996 and 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have reminded the House before that the forms that the hon. 
member is referring to are, yes, seven pages long.  I will not go 
into them, but they ask farmers to give beginning inventory, 
ending inventory, expenses, income, accounts receivable, et 
cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government, we have a responsibility.  The hon. member and 
his party often remind us of the responsibility we have in the 
way in which we expend taxpayers' money.  We said, the industry 
said and the provinces said that they wanted the resources 
available targeted to those who were in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program that was put in place supported and supports someone 
if their gross margin drops below 70% of what their gross margin 
had averaged for the three previous years.  I can only assume 
that the individuals who came in to see the hon. member did not 
trigger the criteria of gross margins being below 70% of what 
they had averaged for the three previous reference years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have one clarification.  The minister continually suggests that 
the proposed program that we came forward with and the $276 
million is in fact true.  That was a federal contribution not 
inclusive of the provincial contributions. It was also six months 
prior to when this minister even realized that there was a 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also tell the House that it was tied into a long term 
program, which I am sure the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food would like to be able to say that he has it well in 
hand, but would he admit that it is not well in hand? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it shows how up to date 
our party and our government is compared to the hon. member's 
party.  He may have come forward with those figures but we came 
forward in the end with $1.1 billion four times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He knows full well that there are discussions going on in 
co-operation with the provinces, the safety nets advisory 
committee and the industry to put in place the long term safety 
net program.  Yes, we do have it in hand.  Yes, we are consulting 
with the industry.  Yes, we will be taking direction and 
consultation with them as it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  It is a pleasure to have the minister present today for 
the debate.  Being the fine gentleman that he is, I am certain he 
would be pleased to stick around for another five minutes for an 
extension on questions.  I would ask for the unanimous consent of 
the House for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to extend

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the motion by the 
Progressive Conservative Party on the Liberal government's 
failure to recognize the importance of Canada's food industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the three issues that will be put before the House today, I 
want to stress the second one, namely, that the government was 
not properly prepared for the “decision of the Supreme Court of 
Canada in R. v Marshall, which acknowledged fishing, hunting 
and gathering rights for Canada's aboriginal peoples”.  The 
peoples referred to are, specifically, the Malecite and the 
Mi'kmaq.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the events, it is true the Liberal government over 
there was not prepared to face the music.  The proof is that the 
decision was brought down around the middle of September and the 
incidents with the native fishermen began only toward the end of 
September or the beginning of October. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the hearings the Standing Committee on Fisheries started 
holding as soon as the House resumed in mid-October, we realized, 
when we heard what the aboriginal witnesses were saying, that 
they had approached the Canadian government many times. They had 
done so as early as last spring in order to be ready with a Plan 
B, if ever the Canadian government were to lose in court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also know that they did so during the summer, in order to 
still have the possibility of preparing a Plan B. 
The Canadian government rejected this each time, preferring to 
believe that only its version of the story would hold any 
weight. Now it has to be acknowledged that the Canadian 
government and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans have been 
left high and dry, one might say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During last week's recess, there was another event that proved 
that the Canadian government is totally off track.  Mr. 
Thériault was hired to assist Mr. MacKenzie in the negotiations, 
in order to provide the maritimes fishermen with representation 
in these negotiations, because the so-called traditional fishing 
communities did not feel that the chief negotiator was listening 
to and understanding them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that we only learned of the few lines defining the 
mandate of Mr. MacKenzie at the time of the announcement of his 
assistant's appointment. 
This indicates, once again, the extent of the government's lack 
of preparedness for the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More serious in this situation is the fact that the minister is 
splitting the mandate to negotiate.  The government is talking 
about trying to reach short term agreements with the aboriginal 
peoples on fishing starting this winter and early spring to 
enable aboriginal fisher to get along with traditional fishers. 
This is a praiseworthy goal, but the short and the long term are 
being totally separated, and this fact is causing concern among 
the fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to clarify something here.  The government wants to 
introduce new players into the lobster fishing industry, which 
is already quite full.  There is no more room, and all the 
industry players agree that, if new fishers are to be brought 
in, others must be withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder, therefore, what meaning the short term agreements with 
the native bands have.  Fishers deciding to pull out give their 
most valuable possession, their fishing site, to someone else. 
It is a vital part of them.  Who would give away a vital part of 
one's self just like that, when told it is just for the short 
term?  The example is perhaps a bit strong, but, when one gives 
part of one's self away, it can never be replaced.  It is a bit 
like trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An essentially irreversible process is under way.  It is going 
to be very difficult for those fishers who voluntarily decide to 
return their licenses to Fisheries and Oceans to change their 
mind.  On that basis, how will it be possible to reconcile the 
long term process the minister has initiated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I understand is that the Government of Canada is giving the 
Indian affairs minister the so called long term process, 
because, the Marshall decision, the decision by the supreme 
court that allows aboriginal peoples to exercise their fishing 
rights, provides that the fishing must be for a moderate 
livelihood, that fishing will enable the native bands to enjoy a 
moderate livelihood.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court does not define this expression.  The report 
of the Erasmus-Dussault commission suggests some possible 
directions for the self-government so sought after by the first 
nations.  Seeing the Canadian government's failure to govern 
when it comes to native affairs, the supreme court is giving it 
a little push from behind, so to speak, saying “You must ensure 
that native peoples have a decent livelihood, as seen through 
modern lenses”.  This is a new management expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has been 
tasked with forming a committee to look into the matter. 
The committee's long-term mandate contains no clues as to the 
nature of the short-term agreements to be worked out right now 
for the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, concerning the three things mentioned in the 
treaty, hunting, fishing and gathering, are we to understand 
that a decent livelihood, which remains to be defined by the 
committee led by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, will represent about 30%?  Will it be 25%? What 
will it be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, will the Canadian government attempt to resolve native 
concerns as much as possible insofar as the fishery is 
concerned?  Since we have no information on the progress that 
has been made by the other committee, it is likely that the 
fishing community will be asked to do a bit more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I refer to being asked to do more, the aboriginal people 
started with what are called riparian fisheries, which require 
less equipment.  I am referring to lobster fishing, although 
that is not the only catch in Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that other fisheries will also be invited 
to help by suggesting a quantity of fish or a financial value to 
determine what is a moderate livelihood? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these questions leave me highly perplexed.  Does a 
moderate livelihood refer to the financial aspect or to the 
work? It must be very difficult to not have anything to occupy 
one's time, to have 24 hours a day, 7 days a week free.  If it 
is only the financial aspect, what could be done within the 
existing management agreements with the fishermen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, I am sceptical. 
Is it up to one category of individuals, the fishers, to make 
reparation for all the historical mistakes made by Canada?  The 
only way to do so would be through taxes, so that if ever 
licences were to be withdrawn on a voluntary basis, the Canadian 
taxpayers would know that they had to pay for part of the 
mistake, because Canadian and Quebec fishers will have to be 
compensated for having to withdraw in favour of the new players, 
the aboriginal fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that we have so little time this morning to 
address this subject.  These few questions I have raised suggest 
to us a lack of preparedness on the part of the Canadian 
government.  In my opinion, it is moving at a snail's pace in 
resolving this problem, when the aboriginal people have been 
knocking at the door for 240 years now.  Since my time has run 
out, I will now accept any questions from the other side.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise to speak to the Conservative supply day 
motion.  It is an interesting motion which begins as follows: 
“That this House regrets the failure of the government to 
recognize the importance of Canada's food industries”.  There 
are several parts to it, all of which bear commenting upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the motion states that the government has failed to 
provide leadership, a long term vision and workable solutions for 
Canada's fishery and agricultural sectors.  Second, it states 
that the government did not adequately prepare for the decision 
of the supreme court in the Marshall case which acknowledged the 
fishing, hunting and gathering rights of Canada's aboriginal 
people.  Third, it states what is perhaps most all encompassing 
and to which I will direct most of my comments, that the 
government has failed to address the serious problem of Canada's 
agricultural producers who are suffering from increased 
subsidized competition, rising input costs, natural and economic 
disasters and an inadequate long term national safety net, the 
result of which has contributed greatly to increased financial 
and mental stresses on family farms and fishing communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a welcome motion and I compliment my colleagues in the 
Conservative Party.  Although sometimes we have our differences, 
on this motion it is interesting to see that there is some 
commonality and concern for the farming and fishing communities. 
The motion goes beyond that because the mover of the motion spoke 
about the natural resources industries.  He talked about the 
mining industry, the forestry industry and rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are things about which all of us are concerned, in 
particular those of us who come from rural communities.  Because 
of the crisis in the agricultural industry, my colleague from 
Palliser attempted to introduce on October 12 an emergency debate 
in the House to deal with the family farm and the crisis it was 
facing.  He wrote to the Speaker requesting permission to have an 
emergency debate on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a crisis in the farming industry.  There is a crisis in 
the fishing industry and there is a crisis in our rural 
communities that is simply not being addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ended my comments yesterday in the debate on the Cape Breton 
Development Corporation Act by talking about the four carved 
figures in the lobby of the House of Commons, the four faces 
which represent the people who built this nation, one of which is 
a farmer.  Today in the prairies farmers are facing the worst 
crisis since the 1930s.  We have said it over and over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are they facing the crisis?  Some of it is beyond our 
control, such as the natural weather conditions.  It is certainly 
not because of a lack of industry.  My grandfather was a farmer 
in Cape Breton.  He used to say that even if a farmer intended to 
loaf the day away, he would get up in time to have an early start 
because that is the way farmers are.  They get up early, they 
work hard and they plan their day because they have respect for 
their work.  The carved face of the farmer in the lobby of the 
House of Commons is a testament to the importance that government 
once attributed to those who farmed in this country, in 
particular in the prairie provinces, but also in my part of the 
country, Cape Breton.  There was a thriving farming community 
there not very long ago.  My grandfather was a farmer a 
generation and a half ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today farmers are suffering because of a lack of vision. The 
Conservative Party is right.  For every dollar of wheat sold, the 
Canadian farmer now receives just 9 cents in subsidies, while 
American farmers receive 38 cents in subsidies and European 
farmers receive even more.  They collect 56 cents in subsidies. 
Given that absolutely unlevel playing field, is it any wonder 
that the family farm is in crisis in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of that crisis the premiers of Saskatchewan and Manitoba 
came to Ottawa to seek help.  Part of what this country is all 
about is an understanding that as one region in the country faces 
hard times the other regions of the country assist. 
It is a community.  There is a sense that there is an 
interdependence, sometimes from the east to the west, sometimes 
from the west to the east.  We give to each other when we can and 
how we can, like a family.  Sadly, the two premiers from the 
western provinces returned to their provinces saying that they 
had gone to Ottawa, to the national government, their partner, to 
seek help and they were told to go home.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Romanow said “We are the voice of moderation.  We are 
the people who come to the government with an understanding of 
what it is like to have to make tough decisions”.  He talked 
about national unity.  Sometimes the government forgets that 
national unity is tied to many factors.  When people in one 
region or community in the country feel that the national 
government really does not give a hoot about their problem, it 
does not bode well for participation in a civil society, which is 
what we need if we are to enhance and move forward on the issue 
of national unity.  That is why Premier Romanow made those 
remarks and that is why I echo them today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the debate we had yesterday, the federal government, 
centred in Ottawa, has turned its back on the mining communities 
in Cape Breton.  That will not bode well when the federal 
government comes looking for support for national unity on the 
east coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the farmers in the west and the east, who once had vibrant, 
thriving industries, look to the federal government for support 
and the support is not there, they have to question, when the 
federal government comes looking for support, whether that 
support will be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In moving his motion the Conservative member from Manitoba 
talked about life in rural communities.  I touched on that a bit 
yesterday when I spoke about who we are as Cape Bretoners.  I do 
not think there is anything particularly unique about our 
communities in the sense that we understand and help each other. 
I believe that is shared by the farmers on the prairies.  Those 
of us who have had to struggle against the forces of nature 
understand that there is a greater force, and the only way 
communities survive is to link together and work together 
shoulder to shoulder.  Farmers understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that when natural disasters and forces that are 
overwhelming are compounded by a lack of vision on the part of 
government, it leaves us in an even worse situation.  As much as 
the communities try to come together, policies that divide them 
will do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the decision making is centred in urban centres, in 
Toronto or Ottawa, where the importance and the contributions of 
the rural communities are forgotten.  I spent last week, when we 
were in our ridings during constituency week, travelling the 
rural parts of my riding.  I spent time with farmers.  Sadly, I 
spent a lot of time driving by abandoned farms that were once 
thriving farms in Cape Breton.  I was fortunate enough to have 
supper in the home of the Peters who have a farm in Margaree. 
They talked about the kind of farming they were doing and how 
their neighbour was struggling and looking for help because of 
the dry weather, but there was no help coming from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also spent time in the fishing communities.  Fishing is 
addressed in this motion.  I congratulate the native leaders and 
the non-native leaders in my part of the country who have 
managed, despite the bungling of the federal government, to come 
to some kind of agreement, or at least a moratorium, where they 
can work things out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June of last year my colleagues from the NDP caucus who 
represent ridings in Nova Scotia held a press conference.  We 
warned the government at that point that there was going to be a 
crisis in the fishing industry if the government did not begin to 
react.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the government in court with the native community, which 
had, prior to that, reached out and said “Let's negotiate”.  It 
is not as if it did not know there was going to be a decision. I 
used to practise law.  One thing I always did when I went to 
court was I prepared for a win and prepared for a loss.  In this 
case, we see that the government did not prepare adequately at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member who introduced the motion. I also 
thank the Speaker for being indulgent in giving me a little extra 
time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will ask the 
member for Sydney—Victoria a question with regard to the 
government not being prepared for the situation in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just had an agriculture standing committee meeting this 
morning where we had representatives from the Royal Bank, which 
is the largest lender in the agricultural field in Canada, and 
the Farm Credit Corporation as witnesses in our attempt to find 
out what the underlying causes are of the current crisis, 
especially in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their testimony was very surprising in a number of areas.  The 
witness from the Royal Bank said that he had just come back from 
a North American banking conference in Colorado where at least 
six American banks held up the NISA program as an example of 
where the Americans should be going as far as farm safety nets 
were concerned. Their views on AIDA were described as a program 
for the times that addressed the situation as it exists today. 
The Royal Bank representatives said that they have approximately 
15,000 farmers dealing with their bank and that there are 350 
farmers in arrears, and many of those they are not worried about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to NISA and AIDA, the people who are lending money 
to farmers are not experiencing the crisis. They debunk the idea 
that this is a crisis that could be comparable to the 1930s, the 
dust bowl and the depression. The people who are lending the 
money do have concerns but they are not in the crisis mode that a 
lot of people in the opposition are who are around the prairie 
provinces holding community meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many farmers who will go bankrupt, but as was stated, 
there are always people in businesses, whether it is farming, the 
corner garage or whatever, who get into business and go out of 
business.  However, the people who are lending farmers the 
dollars and who expect the dollars to be repaid are not in the 
crisis mode that the motion is portraying.  How would the member 
respond to that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know that when the 
Royal Bank speaks the government listens.  I do hope that it 
listens equally to the Farm Credit Corporation.  I noticed that 
there was a great deal of quoting in the question from the Royal 
Bank of Canada.  As I have said, I know that the shareholders in 
the Royal Bank of Canada carry a fair amount of sway with the 
Liberal government and that if the Royal Bank is happy with the 
program, then of course the Liberal government will continue with 
the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that perhaps the government might want to listen 
to some of the elected representatives of the farmers, and 
instead of listening to the people who are lending the money it 
listen perhaps to the people who are borrowing the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to read what the premier of Saskatchewan had to say 
about the last federal government announcement.  Premier Roy 
Romanow said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—federal response to the farm income crisis in Saskatchewan 
completely misses the mark. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's announcement amounts to some technical changes and a 
very small top-up to AIDA.  Our farmers have told us— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not the Royal Bank. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—clearly that AIDA does not work.  AIDA didn't work before this 
announcement and won't work after it. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret to say I can come to no other conclusion.  Ottawa has 
completely missed the mark. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it comes to a choice for me of deciding whether I am going to 
listen to the Royal Bank or the premier of Saskatchewan, I will 
choose the elected representative any time.

thank the hon. member from the NDP for the comments about the 
Royal Bank and the Liberal government.  The Liberals do seem to 
listen to the opinions of the Royal Bank when it serves their 
purpose, but when the bank had opinions with respect to mergers I 
do not believe they listened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talked about provincial-federal co-operation. 
Would the member agree that in this particular circumstance, with 
respect to AIDA being foisted on the provincial governments, that 
there was a lack of interest by the federal government when 
Premier Romanow and Premier Doer came here to speak about the 
crisis?  Does the hon. member see a growing sense of 
federal-provincial co-operation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, no, there does not appear 
to be any sense of federal-provincial co-operation when two 
sitting premiers go back and are critical.  These two premiers 
arrived with all good intentions and were prepared to negotiate 
knowing the ins and outs of negotiation.  They are two 
experienced representatives of the people who went back to their 
provinces discounting the federal government.  No, I do not think 
it says much for federal-provincial co-operation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me pleasure to be able to address the issues brought 
forward by my colleague from the Conservative Party regarding the 
agrifood industry and agriculture in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only problem with the wording of the supply motion “That 
this House regrets the failure of the government—”, is that it 
should be replaced with that this House is downright angry with 
this government for its absolute failure to recognize the 
importance of agriculture and the food industries in the 
country.  It has failed desperately to show any leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was demonstrated just recently when two premiers from the 
provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba met with the government in 
all sincerity doing their utmost to try to help the situations in 
their provinces and were literally snubbed by the Liberal 
government and our Prime Minister.  I think that is totally 
disgraceful and it should make us all very angry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not have any long term vision whatsoever. 
It is bouncing around all over the place with different little 
programs that never seem to quite work and never seem to fill 
the bill of what needs to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing that needs to happen more than anything else is 
that the government, for heaven's sake, must start to realize 
the importance and significance of the food and agricultural 
industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really tired of sitting in the House of Commons and voting 
on agricultural issues that would be of benefit to our farmers 
and fishermen and listening to courts making decisions, such as 
the Marshall decision.  The House sits here and votes on what 
should happen, while 70 or 80 highfalutin Bay Street lawyers, who 
probably do not realize that milk does come from a cow and not 
from a carton, or that cereal is made from grain and does not 
come out of a box, simply sit on that side of the House and vote 
according to the wishes of their leader.  They do not even know 
what the issue really is.  They do not realize how serious the 
problem is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Reformers aren't the only ones who are 
farmers, you know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Maybe the hon. member who is mouthing 
off on that side of the House would like to talk about the 18 or 
20 suicides that have occurred in the last few weeks in those 
western provinces.  Maybe he would like to mouth off about that 
and talk about how insignificant what I am saying is or how we 
are trying to support our agricultural industry and our farmers 
in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing the Liberal government is very good at is sitting in 
the House of Commons and criticizing this side of the House 
anytime we may wish to oppose its methods or its ways of handling 
any kind of a crisis.

and they are wondering what in the world they are to do with 
them.  The farmers have made an effort.  Some of them have spent 
$1,600 to $1,700 to hire an accountant to fill in the form and 
mail it off, only to be rejected.  I should not say they were all 
rejected, because in the brilliance of the Liberal government, I 
know of two farmers who received aid under the AIDA program.  One 
farmer received $9.05 and another received $3.60.  Nobody really 
understands what this program is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fail to understand why year after year we have to contend with 
our products on the west coast not moving.  I wonder if the 
Liberal government is aware that many of the people who we do our 
marketing with, in particular Japan, do a great deal of business 
with farmers in my riding.  Farmers ship various types of goods 
in containers to Japan but Japan does not buy goods to store and 
save for a rainy day.  It does not have a storage system. It buys 
on a continual basis.  In other words, the flow of these products 
must happen regularly and without a stoppage of any kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Japanese people sent a document to my office indicating that 
they were getting very tired of our country constantly stopping 
the necessary flow of billions of dollars worth of goods that we 
market.  We are not satisfying our people on the other end 
because we do not have a government that recognizes the 
importance of keeping agricultural produce flowing to other parts 
of the world and keeping the markets alive and well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, we go through motions year after year in the House to 
try to put an end to work stoppages, lockouts or whatever the 
case might be in order to get the ships loaded and the produce 
out.  Instead of addressing the issue as we should have done year 
after year, for at least 20 years that I know of, we have to deal 
with it on an as-it-happens basis.  It continually hurts us.  We 
are now at the point where ships flag into the country before 
ever arriving at port wanting to know exactly what the situation 
is because they do not want to arrive if there is going to be any 
kind of stoppage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not protecting the industry at all.  We do not have their 
best interests at heart when we allow this to continually happen 
year after year.  It is on record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, Lynn Hardy, one of my constituents from Carstairs, 
contacted my office with some very interesting information. 
During a conversation with a Statistics Canada employee, her 
husband asked the individual about statistics being touted by 
both the Prime Minister and the agricultural minister as proof 
that there is not a farm crisis.  Mr. Hardy hoped to learn the 
origin of these stats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it turned out, the employee said that they were very 
disappointed in the Prime Minister and the agricultural minister 
for using these stats since they dated back to 1997 and obviously 
had nothing to do with today's crisis.  For those who do not 
remember, 1997 was a little better than average year, not to 
mention that it was three years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the Liberal government wake up and realize that first, 
it is 1999 almost 2000, and second, there is a farm crisis? 
These bogus excuses and these dated stats can no longer be used 
to deny our farmers the much needed help that they need at this 
time of crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very first thing the Liberal government must do is recognize 
that the agricultural and food industries are the most important 
industries in the land.  That would really be a good start.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many farmers in my riding would like to know if some people are 
turning down some of the things they voted on.  I think of Bill 
C-4 of a year or so ago when the government was adamant it was 
doing the right thing and the farmers cried out that it was not 
doing the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are they being ignored?  They would like to know why their 
voices are being ignored by the government.  My only answer was 
that 70 or 80 highfalutin Bay Street lawyers do not know what 
they are doing and vote according to the wishes of their leader 
instead of the wishes of the farming industry.  That is the only 
solution I could come up with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why have they not sent the Prime Minister, the agriculture 
minister and the strongest contingent of cabinet ministers to the 
WTO talks?  They should go their with a firm hand demanding a 
level playing field in the agricultural market.  Why do we send 
all the chief bureaucrats and all the do-little nothings in these 
departments to handle the major task of getting a message out 
that we care and are concerned about our farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They sent a committee to the west to find out why Liberals are 
not getting much support there.  They did not listen very well. 
We gave about a billions reasons when it came to wasteful 
spending.  We gave another billion reasons on overtaxation.  The 
final reason we gave them, in the words of farmers, was that 
obviously we had a government that just did not care.  I would 
like to see that attitude changed.

Speaker, as my fellow colleague from Sydney—Victoria mentioned, 
both of us represent ridings that mirror each other in terms of 
urban and rural. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk with farmers in my constituency they talk about the 
lack of commitment and leadership.  Unfortunately for us in Cape 
Breton we have been affected by the government's so-called 
commitment to fishermen and its so-called commitment to farmers. 
What we are told is that maybe we should broaden our tourism 
base.  I can see it now.  We will have a tourist attraction where 
rich Americans can drive by and look at our abandoned farms and 
the way things used to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would say that there is and has been for a very long time a 
serious attack on rural communities by starving them to death. 
Does the member believe that the recent results of the byelection 
in Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar is a clear message to the Liberal 
government from rural communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Liberal Party 
certainly did not do very well in that byelection.  That should 
be a message of some sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment on the fact the government would like to make a 
tourist industry out of a lot of these areas.  In order to get a 
good chunk of money in my riding for the agricultural industry we 
only need to get a group of people together to haul in a bunch of 
old machinery, old thrashing machines and equipment that is 
outdated and maybe horse drawn.  We would need a bunch of money 
to refurbish them, paint them and put them in some kind of a 
museum, and we would have dollars flowing like we would not 
believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To prevent a disaster such as the suicides that are taking place 
in the west because of the lack of concern and lack of care by 
the government, there seems to be a real struggle to get any 
recognition at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us paint our old thrashing machines, do all this fancy-dancy 
stuff, put up a nice little museum in the name of the Government 
of Canada, the Liberal Party—we might even put the Prime 
Minister's name on it—and the dollars will flow, especially if 
we send the heritage minister out there.  We will get the dollars 
going then.  She is a good spender.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was the one who made the remark from this side on the 
member's speech, but only because he was suggesting that some of 
us on this side do not have farmers in our ridings that are in 
trouble, and we do.  I appreciate the passion with which he spoke 
to this issue, but I want him to know that on this side of the 
House we feel the same passion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take issue with another point in the hon. member's 
speech.  That is the suggestion that the fault of the problems 
with the farmers is entirely that of the federal government.  I 
point out to him that the Saskatchewan auditor general recently 
released a report that showed that the province of Saskatchewan 
is claiming to be spending over $300 million on farm aid when in 
fact half of that money is actually coming from the federal 
government and from the producers.  The auditor general pointed 
out that many of the Saskatchewan government's claims of aid to 
farmers is more than half in contributions coming from the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not possible that part of the problem, part of the 
difficulty in which the farmers find themselves in Saskatchewan, 
is due to their own government in Saskatchewan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I suppose anything is 
possible.  One thing that is not possible, it seems, is that it 
is very difficult to get the actual amount of dollars brought to 
the federal government through some form of taxation or another 
of our farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is Ottawa.  This is the federal government.  We have a very 
strong purpose in the food industry in protecting our farmers as 
best we can and in providing for level playing fields.  We are 
not doing a very good job.  We are not taking the leadership in 
WTO with the firmness that we ought to be taking.  We are not 
negotiating for our people with the strength that we should be 
able to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not prepared a vision.  It does not show 
leadership and has failed to do so.  Even the Government of 
Saskatchewan has outshone the federal Liberal government.  The 
provincial governments have outshone it on a number of occasions. 
I can guarantee the hon. member that this is true in Alberta.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my colleague from 
Fundy—Royal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to rise today to speak to my party's motion 
urging the government to give urgent consideration to the 
immediate and long term needs of Canada's agriculture and fishing 
industries.  The livelihood of many families in my riding depends 
a lot on our natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has ignored the rural communities far too 
long.  Members on the other side of the House have waited for 
crises to go on and on before trying inadequately to resolve 
them.  Rural Canadians have had enough.  It is time for the 
government to provide leadership, a long term vision and workable 
solutions for Canada's fishery and agriculture sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not prepare for the Marshall decision of the 
Supreme Court of Canada which acknowledged fishing, hunting and 
gathering rights for Canada's aboriginal people.  The government 
should have prepared a plan for this decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all knew the supreme court was to make a decision on this 
case.  This decision has effectively pitted native and non-native 
fishers against each other as their leaders try to determine how 
the lucrative lobster fishery should be regulated in light of the 
recent supreme court ruling.  Actually it has gone beyond native 
and non-native fishers to communities fighting each other.  That 
is the sad situation we are seeing in Atlantic Canada right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conservation is an important issue.  We should not forget the 
auditor general's warning last spring that the shellfish fishery 
is in danger.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 4 of the auditor general's report tabled on April 20 
voiced some serious concerns about the way Fisheries and Oceans 
Canada has been managing the lobster, scallop, snow crab and 
shrimp fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the auditor general: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The absence of a formal fisheries policy that fully reflects 
sustainability concepts means that decisions on resource use are 
made on an ad hoc and inconsistent basis rather than as part of 
an overall framework for achieving a sustainable fishery. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are doing here today, the auditor general decries the 
government's lack of vision in the fisheries industry.  In 1997 
he expressed similar concerns about groundfish stocks.  The 
government did not learn a lesson from this, and now the 
shellfish and crustacean fisheries are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for the government to realize that everything is 
interrelated and that whole communities suffer when the crops or 
the catches are poor.  The fishermen, farmers and other workers 
in these industries are seasonal workers and are therefore 
victims of discrimination by our employment insurance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As if it were not enough to place these industries in a 
precarious position, the government then refuses to give the 
workers in them any proper assistance. 
These workers, who pay into the program, often live in regions 
where the economy is not active enough to allow them to find 
work in the off season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, there are a number of cases where people have no 
income from January on.  They have worked long and hard during 
the season but do not have any money coming in for long periods 
of time and cannot support their families because of the 
discrimination this government practices toward them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently visited the food banks in my riding of 
Beauséjour-Petitcodiac.  Everyone involved blamed the cuts to 
employment insurance for the increase in users.  This is a 
serious situation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am urging the government to have a vision for rural Canada. I 
realize it cannot have a vision for rural Canada until it 
understands what rural Canada means, and it does not care enough 
to try to learn.  It does not have a vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the government had a vision for rural Canada right now I 
would be afraid of what that vision would be because until it 
goes out to see what is happening in rural Canada it cannot have 
a vision.  We cannot treat with something that is not working. We 
cannot treat sick people with medication if we do not know what 
we are treating them for.  We have to find out what is the 
problem. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we see going on in our regions and in our rural 
communities.  This is why the employment insurance program was 
destroyed, was run in a way that no longer takes the needs of 
our people into account.  These people include fishers and 
workers in factories, tourism and construction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is refusing to understand what is going on.  My 
colleague from the Reform Party spoke of suicide among farmers. 
It is sad to see that happening, and I can understand how sad it 
is in the west at the moment with the suicide rate.  I have seen 
that happening in the Atlantic region since the start of the 
employment insurance reforms.  I know of people no longer with 
us today, who killed themselves or whose heart gave out because 
they no longer had an income and no longer met the requirements 
to qualify for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are now two major problems, and I wonder just when the 
Liberal government is going to realize that we do not all live 
in major urban centres.  There is a Canada outside these 
centres, rural Canada.  The government has to accept and 
recognize that and work with these communities.  It is time this 
government showed some leadership.  This is what we need, and 
the fact that we do not have it is sad.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to point out to the member opposite that 
the two lower courts ruled the other way in the Marshall 
decision.  They ruled in the same direction as the minority 
decision which decreed that aboriginals did not have a treaty 
right to fish and hunt regardless of the laws of the Government 
of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That aside, I would like to ask the member opposite, just as I 
asked the member for West Nova, were this an issue that had come 
before this parliament for debate rather than before the supreme 
court, how would she have voted?  Would she have voted that the 
aboriginals had unlimited rights to fish and hunt regardless of 
the laws of the land, or would she have voted with the minority 
judge of the supreme court and said that they did not have that 
right?  How would she have voted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that what we 
should have been doing is negotiating it here.  We should not let 
the courts decide everything for us.  What are we here for?  We 
have to listen to both sides.  I do not think that only the 
politicians sitting in here trying to decide for the rest of the 
country is the way to go either.  We have to negotiate outside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had a chance to do that in February and again in 
June.  When the representative, Mr. Christmas, was here to 
negotiate with the government, it refused to negotiate.  The 
government put all its eggs in the same basket and said the 
supreme court will rule the other way.  It did not happen that 
way and the government did not have a plan <I>B</I>.  That is why 
we are in this situation today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear there could have been a very peaceful solution to 
this but the government refused to look that way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
privileged to have the opportunity to listen to the comments of 
my colleague from Beauséjour—Petitcodiac.  She pointed out how 
ill prepared the federal government has been on just about 
everything it has done in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, does the hon. member believe that it was complete 
shortsightedness, if not blindness, for the federal government 
not to have had in place interim regulations just in case the 
Marshall decision went the other way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member think that the government should have had 
interim measures in place? Does the hon. member think that the 
present Minister of the Environment, the then minister of 
fisheries, should have given a political heads up to the now 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans by saying that the Marshall case 
might be a problem?  The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans said 
that he had never heard of the Marshall decision until the day 
that it was announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it shows again a lack of 
understanding.  Let us face it, the government has been ruling 
with an iron fist.  The Liberals are doing it their way or no way 
at all and they do not really care what is happening across the 
country.  We have seen it with other portfolios.  We have seen 
how they have abandoned rural Canada, and let us face it, fishing 
is in rural Canada.  Did they care enough to have a plan <I>B</I>? 
No, they did not and that is what we saw again.  They could have 
had something in place, but there was nothing.  There was no plan 
<I>A</I>, there was no plan <I>B</I>, there was no plan at all 
because they just did not care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To think that a minister was able to say “I did not know that 
this was actually coming down”.  When ministers change 
ministries do they just leave and there is no adjustment period 
with the work, especially with something as important as the 
whole livelihood of our fishing industry and communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering what the government is doing now that we know 
that the aboriginal peoples have on the table that they are going 
after 30% to 50% of the Atlantic fishery.  Is the government 
aware of this?  Is the government actually at the table? We have 
been made aware by the representative for the aboriginal peoples 
that they are going after 30% to 50% of the Atlantic fishery. 
That is a very scary thought. I wonder what the government is 
doing about it.

pleasure to participate in today's debate.  Every time I have the 
opportunity to participate in debate and represent those 
constituents who live in Fundy—Royal I am pleased to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the debate we are engaging in today is 
essentially the abdication of government.  It is a lack of 
planning by the Liberal government particularly in two sectors, 
fisheries and agriculture, and with respect to all the difficult 
decisions which governments have to undertake.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin my speech by quoting Jeffrey Simpson of 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I> on October 28, 1998. The Liberals have 
no compass, no direction and no idea of where to take the 
country.  This intellectually lifeless government believes all 
politics is administration, whereas it should be about policies, 
ideas and values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the debate we are engaging in today.  The government 
uses a 911 style of management, “We have a crisis, now we have 
to deal with it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father Murray Herron is a fine man. My father said the best 
way to deal with a crisis was to avoid it in the first place by 
having a plan to address it. I want to talk about the systematic 
abdication and lack of planning of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost two years ago to the day there were debates in the House 
with respect to the Kyoto climate change conference.  Two years 
ago to the day this House admitted that we were not prepared with 
a pan-Canadian position on targets, timelines and an 
implementation strategy to address the serious issue of climate 
change and how Canada would make its contribution. We went to 
Kyoto with no plan. We came back with no plan.  Two years later 
in 1999, we still have not seen any sort of implementation 
strategy from the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alberta government of Ralph Klein is one government that has 
actually shown some leadership in getting the process to address 
the issue of climate change going.  It has taken some 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not see some aggressive tax incentives to address 
climate change? Why do we not see research and development 
dollars for renewable sources of energy, or tax incentives for 
energy efficiency initiatives? Those are things we could be doing 
today so that industry could start delivering some early action 
on that issue.  The government has done nothing for two years in 
that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also saw a systematic abdication of leadership in planning 
with respect to the Marshall decision.  We saw this two times, 
first in February and later on in June when first nations from 
Atlantic Canada approached officials in Ottawa to negotiate a 
systematic and peaceful integration into the fishery as opposed 
to going to the supreme court.  The government loves to govern by 
courts, not by parliament and not by letting elected officials 
make the decisions.  It would rather abdicate its role and let 
the courts decide.  Sometimes the courts decide things that make 
it very difficult for us to manage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On first nations issues in particular, there are three ways some 
individuals might consider when dealing with treaty rights and 
the rightful role first nations have in our society.  First, some 
individuals on the very extreme edge would advocate violence on 
both sides.  I am proud to say our society has advanced beyond 
that stage.  The second method is to let the courts decide 
things.  Sometimes we do not like the way the courts solve 
things.  The third way and the best way is to do it by peaceful 
negotiation.  The government had an opportunity to do this twice, 
in February and in June when Mr. Christmas came to Ottawa for a 
peaceful integration into the fishery, but again the Liberals 
ducked it. They always duck hard issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Long gone are the days when we actually took on the hard and 
difficult issues in order to build this nation. 
Long gone are the days of leadership that brought forth 
initiatives like free trade which took our trade ratio with the 
Americans from $90 billion in 1988 to well over $260 billion 
today.  That was the result of leadership. Long gone are the days 
when we had initiatives in terms of privatization, deregulation 
and free trade.  Now we have abdication and government by the 
courts.

terms of the federal government not having a plan on serious 
issues.  I am sure everyone remembers October 30, 1995, the date 
of the referendum in the province of Quebec.  Leading up to that 
referendum the Prime Minister said “We have no problem. 
Everything is under control.  Don't worry, be happy”.  We almost 
lost our country.  If it had not been for the positive initiative 
of our former leader, the Hon. Jean J. Charest and his 
contribution in that debate, we might have had a more serious 
result.

culture and civil code of the six million francophones who live 
in the province of Quebec.  That promise was made that night on 
television. Since then the Liberals' plan for unifying our 
country has been to take this issue to court, to make it a legal 
issue as opposed to a political issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our founding fathers built this country, they built it 
because they knew we would be stronger together.  A country is 
built through common will and not through a legal decision about 
whether or not we should exist.  Do we have the right to break 
up? The best thing the government could have done would be to 
have had some very direct leadership in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw it in the currency crisis last year.  When the commodity 
crash took place primarily along the Pacific Rim, there were 
negative implications for our country.  The reaction of the Prime 
Minister and the finance minister in terms of the currency crisis 
was that it was not their fault, that things happen in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my friends in the Reform Party, especially the member for 
Lethbridge, very much agree with me that we could have sent some 
very positive signals.  Instead of saying that we would have a 
surplus and put 50% on new spending and 50% on tax and debt 
reduction, we could have made a very serious and deliberate plan 
to reduce our debt to GDP ratio.  We could have paid down the 
debt in a very serious way which would have added ongoing value 
to our currency and we could have been far more competitive in 
that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a trend happening. The Liberals were not ready for the 
climate change initiative.  They almost lost our country with 
respect to the referendum.  They were not prepared for the 
Marshall decision.  There was the currency crisis. Recently it 
has been 911 management.  We are heading into an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends on the Liberal side who are primarily from Atlantic 
Canada came out with a report entitled “Catching the Wave:  How 
to Build a Better Atlantic Canada”.  After they have been 
defeated on an issue with respect to abandoning the tolls on a 
toll highway which this federal government collaborated on, they 
are saying that maybe tolls are not such a good idea. Again, they 
make it up as they go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a government of leadership, a government that actually 
plans.  We do not need initiatives that deal with issues as they 
come up as crises.  We need to deal with the very hard issues 
that face this country.  Let us pay down the debt.  Let us lower 
taxes. Let us grow this economy so we can compete in the next 
millennium.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was just 
wondering when I was listening to the speeches by the member for 
Fundy—Royal and the member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac what 
would have been their reaction if last February the government 
had reacted to Mr. Christmas' request to open up the fishery to 
the first nations of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we imagine the howls of derision from members on that side 
of the House, or from that member when she was on the other side 
the House, if the government unilaterally gave away the fishing 
rights to the aboriginals?  Can we imagine the howls and 
screaming that would be coming from the opposite benches that we 
should be able to read the minds of the supreme court justices 
the same as they were able to read the minds of the lower court 
justices in Nova Scotia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are standing up holier than thou to say that we should have 
been prepared, that we should have been able to read the minds of 
the supreme court justices and that we should have shared 
earlier, and maybe we should have, with the aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we imagine what would have happened if DFO had called a 
meeting to bring all sides together and said they would be 
sharing the Atlantic fishery because Donald Marshall has a case 
going to the courts and may lose it?  Can we imagine what would 
have happened if DFO pre-empted that decision by negotiating 
something before the courts had a chance to see it? Can we 
imagine what the reaction would have been from over there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the issue before us right 
now is to be able to say that it was okay not to be prepared, 
that it was all right not to have a plan, that it was okay not to 
have regulations in place just in case the Marshall decision went 
in a direction the federal government was not happy with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confused and a little worried about what the hon. member is 
actually advocating.  He is saying that the best way to deal with 
the crisis is to let the courts decide and not have a plan. There 
are bags of lawyers running around Ottawa all the time.  I want 
to say as well that it is an admirable profession, but the 
government should not even ask any of them whether it should 
actually have some regulations in place in case it goes sour. The 
parliamentary secretary is advocating right now that not having a 
plan is really the Liberal plan. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing time with the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington.  I will address only the second paragraph 
of the motion by the member for Brandon—Souris, that is to say 
the issues concerning the supreme court, the Marshall decision on 
fishing and other rights of aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Brandon—Souris has distinguished himself in the 
House as a member who has a whimsical sense of humour.  It is 
much appreciated.  I wonder if perhaps some of his polemics in 
the motion should not be interpreted in that light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the hon. member concerned, however, that his 
party was in office during the crucial period of nine years 
almost immediately after the adoption of the charter of rights, 
which included the saving of aboriginal rights still to be 
defined by virtue of sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act, 
1982.  There was a wonderful opportunity in a period of 
historical transition to set in place sophisticated processes for 
the elaboration and definition of those rights and of dispute 
settlement and other machinery.  It was an opportunity missed. 
Somebody was asleep. It was the Rip Van Winkle philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process has been engaged upon and for better or worse we 
have to deal with it as it now arises.  The motion, however, and 
I accept it in this spirit, is directed toward trying to 
establish policies, policy constructs, for the future in relation 
to aboriginal and other rights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a debate on this issue.  The last great venture was the 
white paper of 1969 which had many brilliant and imaginative 
ideas but for a number of reasons in the political climate at the 
time it was judged unadoptable.  It just did not command the 
community support necessary to get it through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the intervening time a too pre-emptive concern with special 
constitutional issues thought to relate to Quebec tended to kill 
off discussion of other issues.  I do not believe there is any 
incompatibility between the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although his purpose was directed toward Quebec provincial 
politics, I signal in this regard the announcement yesterday by 
the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve of a new plan for Quebec 
constitutionalism.  He recognized, for the first time explicitly 
by a member of his party, that Quebec issues cannot be divorced 
from issues of the aboriginal communities within Quebec.  They 
are part of the general society and must be part of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My basic comment on this general issue is that it is illusory to 
believe that any one federal institution, whether the courts, the 
legislature, the executive, the administration and the civil 
service separate from that, can have a monopoly of problem 
solving powers or can even function usefully operating in 
isolation from other institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are reminded of Jeremy Bentham's basic point, to which I have 
had occasion to refer in other debates in the House, that there 
is a constitutional company and that judges, cabinet ministers, 
parliamentarians and administrators all function together.  The 
federal government has given an emphasis to consensual solutions 
of the definition, extension and concretization of aboriginal 
rights, and that means an emphasis on interpartes negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize the practical limits to powers of 
negotiation which go to issues of expertise, time and continuity. 
There has always been a place for courts in the finding and 
limiting the constitutional parameters in which any decisions 
must be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some issues, on examination, require very specific and detailed 
research and weighing of complicated economic evidence.  This 
normally transcends the possibilities of parliamentarians, even 
operating in standing committees.  I would note the difficulties 
of both the aboriginal affairs committee and the fisheries 
committee in handling these technical issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are issues that can be well addressed and may best be 
addressed in courts, provided the lawyers are up to the task.  We 
need a better standard of performance by the lawyers presenting 
cases before the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see the sophistication in presentation of briefs.  The 
Brandeis Brief, named after the great Mr. Justice Brandeis, 
details social and economic evidence of the implications of court 
decisions including the practical consequences of those 
decisions.  If that is missing in judicial decisions, one of the 
points to recognize is that it is missing because it is not 
properly presented by the parties.  The Brandeis Brief starts 
first of all with the lawyers before the court and the judges 
have to respond to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an opportunity for a more confident judicial role in 
these matters.  It is to be noted that the judges were not called 
upon for advice when the adoption of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms was first considered.  They were not asked 
about their new role.  It was inevitable a species of judicial 
legislation would emerge, but they were not consulted.  It is a 
learning process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among changes for the future that I would like my colleagues in 
the party opposite to address would be whether a contribution 
could be made by creating specialized tribunals of first 
instance. There is some unhappiness with the federal court in its 
various divisions because it is viewed as an Ottawa body composed 
of ex-civil servants and often ex-politicians but with an eastern 
Canadian orientation.

have internationally?  Would it be better to endow provincial 
supreme courts, which represent and reflect and understand local 
opinion and issues, with the primary authority, subject to 
appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada?  This is where in a 
larger policy context we could invite and receive contributions 
in the debate as it continues before us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am going to address all my remarks in this debate to 
the proposition in the motion that the government should have 
known that this decision with respect to the Marshall case would 
be coming down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Marshall case, as members will recall, was the decision of 
the supremem court, a majority decision whereby aboriginals were 
given the right to fish commercially, rights that transcend the 
laws that may apply to non-aboriginals, the laws of the land.  Of 
course we know the upshot. There was conflict and strife on the 
east coast.  I suggest that as a result of this decision of the 
supreme court there will continue to be conflict and strife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in this debate I asked the member for West Nova, who is 
a member of the party that introduced this motion, how he would 
have voted had this issue been debated in this House, in 
parliament, rather than being dealt with and decided upon by the 
supreme court.  He dodged the question, I have to say.  He did 
not reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that if the Marshall issue had come before this 
parliament instead of before the supreme court, this parliament 
would have decided against the decision that the supreme court 
eventually came down with.  I submit that this parliament 
assembled, indeed I would suggest even the majority of members on 
this side, would not have countenanced the decision that we have 
from the supreme court which gives one group of people special 
rights over the general population based, at the very best, on a 
very facile and simplified reading of the historical accounts. 
The very historian who came before the supreme court on which the 
supreme court based its decision has said that his remarks were 
taken entirely out of context by the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have here?  We have a situation where five 
individuals have come to a decision that has a profound impact on 
the rest of Canadians.  Indeed we have the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development saying that he thinks this 
decision will extend to all resources, to mines, to hunting, to 
anything imaginable.  Of course that is going to lead to a lot of 
problems, but we are led to understand that when the supreme 
court rules it is a decision that we must abide by.  I submit to 
you, Madam Speaker, that it is not quite like that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have done a bit of research over the last few weeks.  What I 
have discovered is that Canada as a constitutional parliamentary 
democracy does not have the supreme court in its constitution. 
Unlike the United States, unlike India or Australia or New 
Zealand or even Germany, for that matter, the supreme court is 
not in the constitution.  There is a passing reference to the 
supreme court only in the charter of rights which says basically 
that if the composition of the supreme court is to be changed 
there has to be agreement by the two houses of this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power of the supreme court, which we are led to believe we 
as parliament cannot change, comes from an act of parliament, the 
Supreme Court of Canada act.  This act was passed in 1875.  At 
the time the constitution was being re-examined in 1982 this 
parliament chose not to put the supreme court in the constitution 
as it is in the United States, as it is in India, as it is in 
just about every other democracy that has a constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that means, Madam Speaker, is the fathers of confederation, 
circa 1982, were uncomfortable with the fact that if you put the 
supreme court in the constitution then it becomes equally 
powerful to parliament. 
That is always the debate when it comes to democracies that have 
constitutions and democracies that have parliamentary rule, as in 
the case of Britain, the idea being that if there is not a 
constitution, then parliament is supreme; if there is a 
constitution, that divides the power, as happens under the 
constitution of the United States where power is shared equally 
by the legislature, the executive branch—that is, the 
president—and the supreme court of the United States.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we have no such thing because the supreme court is in 
an act of the Parliament of Canada.  It is not in the 
constitution.  Its powers are spelled out by an act of this 
legislature, this House of Commons.  That means that no matter 
what, when the supreme court comes down with a decision it is a 
decision in the context of this parliament.  I would submit that 
that decision at any time can be overruled by this parliament 
because this parliament is supreme.  It is above the supreme 
court because the supreme court is a creature of this parliament 
and not a creature of the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have with this decision by the supreme court?  We 
have a decision in which only seven out of nine judges sat 
because the court has the privilege to set its quorum.  That is 
in the legislation, the Supreme Court of Canada act.  What we have is a 
decision based on five members of the court ruling one way and 
two members of the court ruling the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are led to believe that this is a binding judgment of the 
court, that we have to obey it, that this parliament is required 
to obey that decision.  But, Madam Speaker, would it surprise you 
if I told you that in the Supreme Court of Canada act there is no mention 
of a binding judgment?  There is no mention of what constitutes a 
binding judgment.  There is no mention of whether a judgment 
should be by majority, by minority, or whatever.  We can assume 
that if all judges agree, that would be a binding judgement. 
But, when there is division, when they do not all agree, 
particularly on a constitutional matter, then surely it should be 
a subject for debate in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely, when it is a constitutional issue affecting all 
Canadians we cannot leave it.  We cannot passively sit by and let 
the supreme court judges rule, who control whom they hear, who 
control the hours they sit, who control their quorum, who do not 
have to consult parliament and, indeed, under the rules of 
parliamentary privilege, do not even have to pay any attention to 
anything that I say in the House.  Because according to the rules 
of parliamentary privilege, as interpreted by the supreme court, 
an MP's opinion of the law does not affect the court's judgement 
and the court does not have to take that opinion into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus we have a situation where we have a body of five—seven 
individuals in this case—making a profound decision with respect 
to all Canadians, a decision that is supposed to be binding on 
this parliament, but in fact cannot be binding on parliament 
because the Supreme Court of Canada act is legislation which was 
created by parliament.  While I would not want to overturn the 
Marshall decision as it stands now with respect to the particular 
incident, I submit that this parliament always has the power to 
interpret the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make one other point.  Madam Speaker, if you look at the 
Supreme Court of Canada act, just to make sure you see where I am 
coming from, you will see that the only mention in the Supreme 
Court Act, as revised in 1983, to the supreme court judges 
considering the constitution is when there are references by the 
government to the court on constitutional matters.  Those 
references ask simply for an opinion.  In the drafting of the 
revised Supreme Court of Canada act this parliament was not 
prepared to say that the Supreme Court of Canada, when it was 
considering a reference from the government, would be a binding 
judgment, and that, Madam Speaker, is the only section 53 of the 
Supreme Court of Canada act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that the reason is, that particular section also allows 
the Supreme Court of Canada to make judgments or express opinions 
with respect to parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you have a situation where the fathers of 
confederation, circa 1982, obviously perceived that this 
parliament could not be subject to the Supreme Court of Canada, 
it could not be below the Supreme Court of Canada, so they 
ensured that when the Supreme Court of Canada made decisions with 
respect to parliament or the constitution they were only 
expressions of opinion.  I suggest that parliament should take 
the message from its predecessors, those who framed the Supreme 
Court of Canada act as it exists now, and consider the supreme 
court decisions when they are only majority decisions as being 
for guidance only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, it is this parliament, this parliament, that has to 
decide on constitutional issues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
thank the member for the lesson on the history of the Supreme 
Court of Canada.  However, the last time I read this motion it 
dealt with two principal issues concerning the importance of 
Canada's food industry, namely the family farm and fishers who 
earn their living fishing along our coasts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the speech just given is that the government 
would rather talk about bureaucracy and how court decisions are 
made as opposed to providing leadership in terms of long term 
safety nets and dealing with the farm income crisis.  The 
government should have been prepared for the Marshall decision in 
the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member say the words farm and fishers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, as the member should 
know, I began my remarks by saying that I would confine them to 
the Marshall decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to him that paragraph (b) of the motion states that 
the government did not adequately prepare for the decision of the 
Supreme Court of Canada v Marshall which acknowledged fishing, 
hunting and gathering rights for Canada's aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely what I spoke about.  I wish the member would 
have at least had the decency to listen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member for Fundy—Royal has it all wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speech made by the member for Wentworth—Burlington is 
probably one of the finest speeches I have heard in the House in 
a long time.  He has gone right to the nub of the issue.  It is a 
matter which is of great consequence to fishermen, not only on 
the east coast but also on the west coast, and that is the impact 
of the Marshall decision which was brought down by the Supreme 
Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That decision has the ability to replace the existing fishermen, 
especially in the lobster fishery on the east coast, with members 
of the Mi'kmaq community.  I do not think that was the intention 
of the court necessarily, but certainly that has been the 
interpretation of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member is contributing to the debate is very valuable 
and worthwhile because he is addressing the key issue of how this 
place can address that critical decision of the court and whether 
there is room for the government to manoeuvre on this issue, and 
manoeuvre it should for two very good reasons.  One is to promote 
or ensure that goodwill remains between the communities affected 
by the decision, and the other of course is the well-being of the 
resource if the government does not maintain its control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind, how does the member think the government 
should respond to the Marshall decision, given its impact on the 
fishery? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think the government 
should regard the decision in Marshall as an appellate decision 
and respect the decision, but not regard it as being instructive 
on the broader constitutional issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do believe that the supreme court and the judges have 
no right to dictate to this parliament.  The evidence I put 
forward is the very fact that the supreme court is not a 
constitutional entity, it is a creature of this parliament, and 
this parliament must make the final decisions when it comes to 
constitutional interpretation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will 
be sharing my time with my colleague from Prince Albert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today to debate a motion presented by the 
Conservative Party.  The motion is quite wordy, as we might 
expect.  The first part of the motion states that this government 
has failed to provide leadership, a long term vision and workable 
solutions for Canada's fishery and agriculture sectors.  The 
motion could have stopped at “Canada” because the government 
has failed to provide the leadership and long term vision for all 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address my remarks to the crisis facing our agriculture 
producers.  The mismanagement we have seen on both coasts in the 
fishery industry, the terrible turmoil that has been created by 
the Marshall decision and by some of the policies put in place by 
the government have certainly spilled over.  Its lack of 
determination and will to go on to the world stage to fight the 
subsidies of the European Union and the protectionism of the 
Americans has created a huge problem in our agriculture sector 
right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a genuine lack of understanding on the part of 
the government concerning this situation.  It took us a long 
time, as the official opposition pounded away at the government, 
to get it to realize there was a problem and to bring that issue 
to the House.  We did that through the form of a debate a year 
ago and it continues to be a huge problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers of Saskatchewan and Manitoba came to Ottawa a week 
or so ago.  They do not do that very often.  They came to explain 
to the government that there is a huge crisis on the prairies in 
agriculture.  When they got here they were presented with some 
new facts from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada saying that its 
new numbers indicate there is no crisis.  Numbers are numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we use these numbers, the projections for the year 2000 
for total net income have declined from the 1994-98 average, 
which was a $760 million return in Saskatchewan, to a projected 
number of $267 million for July 2000.  That is taking the total 
net income of a province and chopping it to a third.  How can we 
possibly exist in the agricultural industry, in agricultural 
provinces such as Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alberta and others, 
when our net incomes are being cut to a third of what they were? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting past numbers, we are talking about the ability of our 
family farms to sustain their livelihood, to feed their families 
and to feed Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an article printed in the <I>Minnedosa Tribune</I> in 
September that gives an idea of what has happened to the business 
aspect of our family farms.  There were comparisons made between 
1974 and 1998 which relate everything back to bushels of grain. 
In 1974 10 bushels of grain would buy 200 gallons of gas.  In 
1998 155 bushels of grain would buy 200 gallons of gas.  To buy a 
grain truck in 1974 cost 1,400 bushels.  In 1998 16,000 bushels 
of grain bought the same truck.  To buy a combine in 1974 cost 
6,500 bushels of grain.  In 1998 it cost 96,000 bushels.  How are 
we supposed to maintain an agriculture industry with those kinds 
of figures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsidies in Europe and protectionism in the United States have 
increased production so that the value of the crops produced is 
lower.  Had we not had bumper crops for many areas in the farm 
sector this year things would be compounded severely.  Thank 
goodness we had bumper crops for many areas because they will 
help us get through this terrible dip.  However, it will not be a 
long term solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of this, brought to my attention by one of my 
constituents a while ago, is the amount of money that is 
generated by selling beer. 
This goes on quite a bit but I just want to get this on the 
record.  One bushel of malt barley sells for $2.15.  That is what 
I sold my barley for this year.  I sold it for feed, but it was 
$2.15 a bushel.  That bushel of malt barley makes 333 bottles.  A 
dozen beers sell for $17.50 a case, so 333 bottles would be 27 
cases. That means a $485 return from one bushel of barley.  At 50 
bushels per acre, $24,000 per acre is being returned.  On a 
quarter section of land, that is almost $4 million that has been 
created from the barley that the farmers get $2.15 a bushel for.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at taxes.  The NDP member for Kamloops, Thompson and 
Highland Valleys has put forward a motion that the GST collected 
on the sale of beer should be donated or directed toward National 
Hockey League clubs.  The GST generated on the beer produced from 
one bushel is a little over $20 and he suggested that this money 
should go to National Hockey League teams and to multimillionaire 
players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be nice if some of that money could be directed 
back to the farmer? Would it not be nice if we could take the 
$2.15 a bushel return to the farmer, take some of the GST and 
give it back to the farmer and tell him he will now get $5 a 
bushel? Instead, the hon. member suggested that it go to NHL 
hockey players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has put in place the AIDA program. I have more 
figures.  It is really interesting because some of the AIDA 
programs are being administered by the provinces and some are 
being administered by the federal government. The programs that 
are being administered by the provinces have processed and paid 
on 58% of the claims, whereas the ones administered by the 
federal government have only paid on 37% of the claims put in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is almost a joke that the programs being administered by the 
provinces are doing a better job of getting the money out to the 
farmers than the federal government is.  Why that should be is 
beyond me, but I believe it is because of the bureaucracy.  The 
federal government has trouble handling these situations, whereas 
the provinces are closer to the people and better able to 
administer and are doing a far better job at getting the money 
out to where it belongs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue I would like to put into this equation is the fuel 
tax that comes out of the prairies every year and goes into the 
federal treasury and does not come back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fiscal year 1998-99 the federal government collected 
approximately $4.4 billion in transportation fuel taxes. Federal 
expenditures on road infrastructure in the same year are 
estimated at $198 million.  That is a nickel back for every 
dollar it collects in fuel tax to put into the roads.  There is 
another area where the government could do something to improve 
the roads.  Maybe it should not take that money if it will not 
put it into roads.  It should leave it in the pockets of the 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of things need to be done to address the problems in 
the agriculture sector.  The first thing we need to do is to use 
the federal safety net programs to support Canadian food 
producers who are struggling and cannot make ends meet on a short 
term basis as a result of natural hazards or whatever.  We need 
to have a program in place to get people through those times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have an AIDA program that works, that gets the money 
out to the people and gets it to where the hurt is.  The 
government has failed to fulfil its promise to get those funds 
delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at the root causes of the income crisis.  We 
need to look at safety net programs that work and are in place to 
take care of these crises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at reducing the European and U.S. subsidies.  We 
need to go to the next round of WTO and NAFTA talks, which is 
happening this month, to fight for our farmers.  We need to beat 
those subsidies down so that we are in a position to help our 
producers. We cannot as a country support the level of subsidy 
that these other countries do, so our method of fighting that has 
to get tougher at the negotiating table.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
note from the supply day motion that the Progressive 
Conservatives have attempted to cover all of the hot button 
issues they think are facing Canada today.  They have certainly 
hit a couple of them.  They start by excoriating the government 
for failing to provide leadership, a long term vision and 
workable solutions for Canada's fishery and agricultural sectors. 
Then they move on to the recent supreme court decision on the 
Marshall case which threw the Atlantic fishing community into 
turmoil. Then they go back to Canada's agricultural producers and 
urge the government to give urgent consideration to the immediate 
and long term needs of Canada's agricultural and fishing 
industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While they are busy bringing together a stew of a motion, Reform 
members are out in western Canada visiting about 60 communities. 
They are talking to farmers, municipal leaders, provincial 
politicians, anyone who has been hurt by the agricultural crisis, 
anyone who has a proposed solution to the agricultural crisis or 
who has information that would be useful in developing policy. 
It is not necessarily to address it so much as to answer how we 
are going to get the Liberals to even listen, how are we going to 
get them to know.  The Liberals threw their high profile 
candidate in Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar to the wolves.  They 
made no effort whatsoever to help him out.  I think he got his 
deposit back, but that was it.  The Reform Party is out there 
working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party treated our agricultural and political leaders 
very poorly during their last visit to the national capital. They 
presented their case.  They were basically shown some figures and 
then shown the door.  Thanks for coming, don't call us, we'll 
call you is the attitude toward western Canadian leaders, and the 
Liberals wonder why they are unpopular out there.  My stars, they 
have no idea at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are improvising on agriculture.  They are also 
improvising on Indian affairs, for instance on the Marshall 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it ironic that the Progressive Conservatives would 
express concern over the Marshall decision.  They bandy about 
terms in the House such as “first nation”, “nation to 
nation”, “government to government”, “inherent right” and 
“sovereignty”, while they do not have a clue what they mean. 
They do not even try to find out what they mean.  They just roll 
on talking with no concern that the words they use actually have 
legal meanings, that they create expectations and environments in 
which we end up with these types of Marshall decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ended up in a situation where fisheries managers have to 
allow the Mi'kmaq in eastern Canada to fully satisfy their right 
to fish for a moderate livelihood before anyone else can.  They 
have priority over all other claims on the fishery no matter how 
long they were established, notwithstanding the ownership of a 
valid licence whether commercial or sport and no matter which 
level of government issues the licence. These priority rights 
mean that someone standing there fishing could well be moved 
along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this supposed to create an environment where we get along 
with one another, where we care for one another, where there is 
equality? Not likely.  That is not the way I see it.  That is not 
the way most people see it.  That is only the way those blinkered 
people who create such policies see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the decision talked about a moderate livelihood.  What 
is a moderate livelihood?  Does anyone in this House presume to 
know what a moderate livelihood is?  I do not.  Before I became a 
member of parliament I had one idea of a moderate livelihood; now 
I have another.  I presume people who own large and successful 
corporations have another.  What would Bill Gates call a moderate 
livelihood?  What would a person on welfare call a moderate 
livelihood? 
Is this to be decided in the House?  Is it to be decided in 
Atlantic Canada?  Is it to be decided back in the supreme court 
with another case which will really solve nothing?  It will be 
sent back saying to go negotiate it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moderate livelihood, what does it do?  Will it exclude the 
accumulation of wealth and buy only the basics such as food, 
clothing and housing, as they say?  I heard it said the other day 
in New Brunswick that $80,000 is a moderate livelihood.  The 
average income in my riding of Prince Albert is around $36,000. 
That means just about everyone in the riding is not making a 
moderate livelihood.  If those are the numbers, what are we 
supposed to make of any kind of decisions that arise? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is only a moderate livelihood, day to day, a small house 
and enough food to get through today and not tomorrow, why would 
anyone make significant investments in fishing gear if they are 
only going to make what is called a day to day living and not 
accumulate wealth?  After all, people want to lead a prosperous 
lifestyle.  They want to look after their children, pass 
something along.  That is accumulation of wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a leaders who appeared before the standing committee 
stated that they wanted their children to live in dignity, 
respect and prosperity.  They did not want a hand to mouth 
existence.  They wanted prosperity. I do not agree that what is 
in the Nisga'a treaty is going to deliver it but that is their 
dream and their hope.  I wish them well in pursuing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That definition of moderate livelihood is far too broad and 
vague to permit any definitive application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it mean in the context of a native attempting to 
broaden the definition to cover other resource industries such as 
lumber which they are trying to do?  For instance, if an Indian 
were making the so-called basic necessities or even prospering by 
being a member of a band government or a band administrator or a 
businessman, or whatever he is doing, could he then take his 
priority right to make a moderate livelihood out fishing for 
lobster, cod or whatever other species happens to be part of that 
priority right?  Could he go into the New Brunswick forest and 
pick up a saw and go cutting after he was already making more 
than a moderate livelihood?  Who figures these things out anyway? 
Would he be denied the right to participate in other resource 
industries as an Indian because that would move him beyond the 
basic necessities threshold? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is that non-Indian fishermen do not and will not 
enjoy constitutional remedies for any loss of livelihood. The 
government therefore must compensate them fully for their loss of 
livelihood.  But they are fishermen.  Their families were 
fishermen for generations, going back as far as 13 generations. 
Most of us cannot trace our ancestry back that far. What did they 
do?  They fished. Fishing became part of their tradition, part of 
their history, and they are denied it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are these people supposed to bother getting up in the 
morning for?  To go down and check the bank account to see how it 
is doing when there is nothing in it?  That is ridiculous.  If 
they are given reasonable compensation, that is still a poor 
excuse for equality which would be a far better way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to fish or gather has been defined as a communal 
right.  An obvious question arises from that.  It has always 
plagued socialist communal societies.  If the right is communal, 
what does that mean?  Does it mean that all can participate and 
must do so to benefit from the exercise of that right, or does it 
mean that those who do participate must share the wealth with 
those who do not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need answers to all of these questions.  We cannot even begin 
to understand the implications of what has come down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless the federal government can find a way, other than simply 
excluding non-Indians from participating in fisheries and other 
resource based industries, there will be ethnic conflict in this 
country now and in the future.  Buy-outs are not an acceptable 
long term solution.  It is a stop-gap measure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to be able to speak to the motion today as it includes 
both agriculture and fisheries, two of the main industries in my 
province of Prince Edward Island.  I have probably spent as much 
time on the fisheries committee as I have on the agricultural 
committee, so I have been asked today to address the part of the 
motion dealing with the amount of agricultural subsidies and 
subsidization that is going on in the world today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know about the root causes of the financial problems facing 
some of our farmers today, namely adverse weather and worldwide 
low prices for some commodities.  These low prices are primarily 
a result of oversupply which has led to reduced demand in key 
markets such as Asia and Latin America.  The oversupply has come 
about not just because of unfair trade practices but also because 
of some incredibly good harvests worldwide over the past few 
years which have put a great deal of high quality product on the 
market.  Those inventories are still quite high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation has been aggravated by the persistent use of 
trade distorting support by some of our major training partners, 
especially the United States and the European Community.  Farmers 
are not encouraged to grow crops in response to the realities of 
the marketplace in those countries and our farmers, as well as 
producers in other countries, are feeling the effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us suggests that the government has not been 
doing anything to address the serious issue of subsidies being 
provided to our competitors in the agricultural sector.  I have 
to take issue with that for the government and the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, in particular, have put much of their 
energy and resources over the past two years into developing a 
strong initial negotiating position to take to the world trade 
talks that are about to begin in Seattle.  Those talks are 
absolutely crucial to our ability to bring about a fair and level 
playing field in which our producers can compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no doubt that Canadian producers are some of 
the most efficient, productive and innovative in the world.  They 
have the business savvy to compete with the best and they can 
compete and win when the trading environment is fair.  If we can 
rid the agricultural world of trade distorting subsidies, 
particularly export subsidies, Canadian farmers would be able to 
produce and invest with greater confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has been working 
to address the economic and weather related problems of Canadian 
farmers, he has also devoted a great deal of time and energy to 
working with our trading partners, with the objective of bringing 
some order and stability into the world marketplace.  He has 
taken every opportunity to remind his counterparts from major 
trading nations, particularly the European Community and the 
United States, that their actions can only prolong the serious 
problems faced by farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not clear that the subsidies being provided by our 
competitors such as the United States are even helping those 
farmers all that much in the short term.  There seem to be just 
as many concerns expressed by American producers about low prices 
and low incomes as we are hearing in Canada.  As a matter of fact 
a witness this morning in the agriculture standing committee 
verified those facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need to get rid of trade distorting subsidies is a 
critically important message for our trading partners to hear as 
we head into the WTO negotiations which start in Seattle in a 
couple of weeks.  It is the message that we have been delivering 
every chance we get.  I know the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food raised it, for example, when he hosted ministers from 
Japan, Australia, the European Union and the United States at a 
meeting in Montreal in September. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going into the WTO talks Canada has been a world leader in 
setting out its goals for what needs to be accomplished in 
agriculture.  That position includes the complete elimination of 
export subsidies, a substantial reduction of trade and production 
distorting domestic support including an overall limit and 
domestic support of all types, and real and substantial market 
access improvements for all agriculture and food products.  As 
well we are defending Canada's right to maintain domestic orderly 
marketing systems such as the Canadian Wheat Board and supply and 
management for dairy and poultry products.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This position was arrived at after two years of extensive 
consultations with a broad cross-section of representatives from 
the agricultural and food industries and the provinces.  This 
position reflects the trade interests of the Canadian agriculture 
and food sector as a whole across all commodities and all 
regions.  It is a solid, unified initial position which I am 
confident will help to garner a better deal at the international 
trade table.  By the way, I am sharing my time with the hon. 
member for Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this position Canada will play a strong and active role in 
influencing the direction and eventual outcome of the WTO 
negotiations.  In fact we already have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after announcing the Canadian position the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food met with the 15 agricultural exporting 
countries which make up the Cairns group.  This group also 
included countries like Australia, South Africa, Brazil and 
Argentina.  Coming out of that meeting the minister indicated 
that Cairns members had agreed to a common WTO negotiating front, 
namely, freer, fairer and more market oriented trade conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, both APEC and the Free Trade Area of the Americas, 
and Canada is a member of both those groups, have come out with 
resolutions calling for the elimination of export subsidies. This 
is what Canada and its allies will be pushing for when the 
negotiations get started in Seattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in Seattle that Canada will be cranking up the heat even 
more to convince all our trading partners of the need to let 
farmers make their decisions based on market signals rather than 
on government support levels.  In this way we have been laying 
the groundwork for meaningful negotiations, negotiations that 
start smoothly and allow our negotiators to work with clear 
direction and steadfast commitment to the needs of our producers 
and that achieve good results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not deny that we are getting into a long process.  The WTO 
talks will not deliver changes overnight, but they are crucial to 
building a strong and competitive Canadian agricultural sector. 
The government is committed to reforming trade in the 
agricultural sector.  It is something we have been building 
toward over the past several years and our efforts will only 
intensify from here on in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the WTO negotiations proceed the federal government will 
continue the partnership approach that led to the development of 
a unified national negotiation position by ensuring that industry 
and the provinces are consulted closely throughout the process. 
We are in this together, the federal government, the provincial 
governments and industry, in seeking solutions to the income 
problems of farmers over the long term. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the comments of the hon. parliamentary secretary.  I 
have to agree the best resolution would be an open marketplace, a 
level playing field and no subsidies.  I also have to tell the 
parliamentary secretary to wake up and smell the coffee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that the minister had been talking at great lengths to 
other trading partners about getting rid of subsidies.  The 
opposite is happening.  In the European Union subsidies are being 
paid at an accelerated rate.  In the United States there has been 
an announcement every week of another farm aid package, more 
moneys going into the farm economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary talked about how our position at the 
WTO will be accepted and will be achieved.  That is five years at 
the very least of negotiations with the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do in the meantime?  Do we simply allow the farm 
crisis to continue?  Do we allow the world market to be changed 
constantly by subsidies being paid by the European Union and the 
Americans?  Is it simply that farmers in Canada should go by the 
wayside while we wait and let the minister talk about trade 
changes in the WTO? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire:</B>  Madam Speaker, as the member well knows, 
Canada has and is putting in place various mechanisms whereby our 
farmers will be subsidized through the NISA program, through crop 
insurance, through companion programs, and recently through AIDA 
dollars.  Overall $1.78 billion is being put into the program 
over the next two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Brandon—Souris is a member of the agricultural 
standing committee.  This morning's witnesses said that NISA is 
an example of a program which is envied by our neighbours to the 
south.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans are looking to our program as the path for the 
future.  They are looking to us to show the way to properly 
subsidize and properly assist our farmers when there is a 
precipitous drop in commodity prices.  They are following our 
example.  Their farmers are no better off with their ad hoc 
programs.  In fact, a lot of them are a lot worse off with their 
ad hoc programs than we are with the negotiated cost share 
programs that are in place today.

carefully listened to the words of my colleague, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, and to his responses to questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech he said that commodity prices are low because 
there has been over-production, and that the farmers are not 
growing crops that reflect the realities of the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not following the realities of the marketplace 
either with its subsidies.  What are we to do when American or 
European competitors receive $2.50 to Canadian farmers' $1.00? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we to do when total agricultural support policies are 
$140 per capita in Canada, as compared to $360 in the United 
States and $381 in Europe? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That too is reality. I also wonder, if there is an 
overproduction of agricultural products, what options besides 
diversification might be proposed to farmers to help them 
operate according to supply and demand. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows well 
what we are doing.  She also is a member of the agriculture 
standing committee.  She knows that we have the crop insurance 
program.  She knows that we have the NISA program, which is 
working very well.  There are still $122 million that could be 
triggered just in the province of Saskatchewan alone.  That money 
is there waiting for this particular situation, a downturn in the 
incomes of the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She knows that the government together with farm groups, farm 
leaders and the provinces developed the agriculture disaster 
program.  The same players and partners in agriculture will be 
putting in place a long term disaster program which will click in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to join in this debate.  I find the motion 
interesting.  I am sure there must have been a lot of discussion 
in the Tory party caucus in trying to write this resolution. 
Sprinkled throughout it there are references to the fishing 
industry.  It talks about Canada's food industry, but it 
primarily focuses on agriculture, as would be seen in some of the 
responses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because of the very few number of seats the Tories have 
in the maritimes, I am sure there was a battle suggesting that 
they had better not just talk about agriculture and focus on 
western Canada.  I believe yesterday the results in Saskatchewan 
would show that the Conservative Party is hardly on what any one 
might call a comeback.  I believe it came in fourth.  The 
Liberals did well in three other ridings, one in Ontario and two 
in Quebec, so we know that the people are generally satisfied 
with the programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to discuss from the point of view of the fisheries 
a bit of the nonsense about the failure to provide leadership and 
the failure of the Conservative Party to seize this opportunity 
to actually say something important about what has happened to 
our fishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recommend to all members a book they should read called 
<I>Lament for an Ocean</I>.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Far be it for me to quote too much from a book written by a 
journalist, one who is not necessarily supportive of Liberals or 
the government, and the name Mike Harris comes to mind.  He is 
not the premier of Ontario but rather the journalist who wrote 
the book.  I must give him credit because when one reads the book 
and the research that was done one can see a pattern that was 
developed.  Frankly, it was developed under the leadership of 
Conservative governments and a minister.  It is unfortunate to 
have to criticize someone who is not in this place any more to 
defend himself, but I am sure he is quite capable of defending 
himself, as we have seen, and that minister was John Crosbie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The programs in place in the maritimes were such that they 
totally had blinkers on and allowed foreign freezer vessels to 
come in, rape the ocean, particularly off the coast of 
Newfoundland, and destroy the fishery.  Why not take this 
opportunity with this small gathering of Conservatives from the 
maritimes to ask the government to do something that would 
actually help restore the cod fisheries?  I do not see any 
mention of that.  The motion mentions solutions for Canada's 
fishery, but it focuses fundamentally on agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the agricultural side of it, we know that there have been 
what I would have to carefully call some flip-flops by some hon. 
members.  The sponsor of the motion, the hon. member for 
Brandon—Souris, actually said in <I>Hansard</I> “The U.S. 
government provided $8.7 billion” in farm aid.  He went on to 
ask “When will the minister use his influence to put forward 
similar resources?”  Just seven days later, he was quoted as 
saying that he had never asked for more money to be added to the 
pot.  I guess we misunderstood that.  That was in reference to 
the money in the AIDA program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the government has responded by increasing the 
funding for AIDA.  It is never enough to satisfy members opposite 
but it is a response.  The minister of agriculture, in a 
responsible way, has topped up that program.  Notwithstanding the 
complaints I have heard about the bureaucracy and red tape, that 
money is flowing into the hands of Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because this is about food in the country, let me go back to the 
fishery.  Our new minister has just announced a $600,000 program 
to fund new aquaculture programs.  That is not a lot of money but 
it is recognition of the importance of aquaculture, particularly 
given the damage caused to our natural fisheries throughout the 
east coast.  There is a commitment there.  I would like to see 
more of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the hon. member for Sudbury, has a program where 
they want to raise Arctic char in an abandoned mine pit. 
Apparently all the science and research shows that the Arctic 
char that comes out of this technology is absolutely spectacular. 
A small investment at the local community level is needed to make 
that kind of thing work.  Why would members opposite not call for 
the government to invest in something like that?  It seems to me 
that is a productive thing, something that we could look at and 
something that should be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also surprised that the member opposite did not take the 
opportunity to address something that I think is one of the great 
sins of our time, the reduction in the quotas and at one time the 
banning of the seal hunt.  It is really bizarre if we look at why 
the cod is down.  As my hon. friend from the east coast, the 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, would say “seals eat fish”.  It 
is amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not look at the fact that there was a recent report to the 
committee on the situation with the seals?  Let me just read 
about how seals are predators.  The report states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most controversial aspects of the debate on seals is 
whether predation by harp seals is impeding the recovery of cod 
stocks. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine anyone asking that question.  If we want to create more 
food and more fish in the country, why do we not look at the fact 
that there are over five million seals in the population? 
I believe that figure is three or four years old.  The population 
is probably over six or seven million.  They are destroying not 
only a fishery and a species but a way of life.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee went on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of the witnesses who appeared before the committee claimed 
that seals were the cause of the collapse of cod stocks, which 
they clearly attributed to both foreign and domestic overfishing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee puts on blinders and says that even though it has 
restricted the catch by foreign fishing companies, by freezer 
trawlers, and even though it has taken the steps to correct the 
mistakes of former Tory governments in that area, it continues to 
refuse to believe that the seals are in fact predators that are 
destroying the cod fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee goes on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it was noted by the Fisheries Resource Conservation 
Council in their April 1999 report “that the single cod stock in 
the Northwest Atlantic considered recovered, namely, the southern 
Newfoundland/St-Pierre Bank stock, is the only stock that does 
not have a large number of seals occurring within its stock 
range”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is pretty clear evidence to me.  It basically states that 
the cod in that part of the world has recovered in terms of its 
population and size—and the size of the cod is a key 
factor—because they are not facing the predators in terms of the 
seals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some other statistics.  Do we want to find a way to 
support Canada's food industry, Canada's fishery?  This says that 
grey seals are consuming between 5,400 and 22,000 tonnes annually 
of eastern Scotian shelf cod; harp seals may be consuming as much 
as 140,000 tonnes annually of northern cod; seals in the northern 
Gulf of St. Lawrence may have consumed as much as 68,000 tonnes 
of cod in 1996 alone; and, seals in the southern Gulf of St. 
Lawrence may be consuming over 10,000 tonnes annually of cod. 
That is a lot of fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that we somehow feel the need to protect the seals to 
the tune where they are literally crawling across highways in 
Newfoundland, for goodness sake, coming right out of the water? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, the NAFO science community reported clearly that the 
seals consumed 108,000 tonnes of juvenile northern cod, those 
less than 40 centimetres, which represents 300 million fish.  If 
we want to do something to help the fishery we should support the 
report of this council which says that the seal hunt should be 
increased by 50%?  That may be drastic, but in reality that is a 
step that will allow the cod to recover, that will allow the 
fishery on the east coast to recover and that will allow the 
families in that part of the world to get back on the water to 
make a living so that they generate food for the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have thought that would be the kind of policy that the 
Conservative Party would be interested in seeing so it could 
resolve the mess that it caused in its time in office.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is always nice to hear the ineffectual backbencher from 
Mississauga get up and obviously have all of the answers. 
Actually, I thank him for speaking so eloquently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Which am I, ineffective or eloquent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  No, no.  The member spoke eloquently 
about his ineffectiveness.  However, he delivered a message that 
spoke to the deficiencies of his own government.  He railed on 
about the policy that should be put into place to help rejuvenate 
the cod fishery and he looks to us to set that policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the ineffective backbencher when he is needed to speak 
to the minister of fisheries who in fact should be putting in 
those policies?  That is what this resolution speaks to, the 
mismanagement and the inability of the government to put in those 
policies to help not only rejuvenate and save the fishery but 
also to rejuvenate and save agriculture. 
I thank him for speaking on our behalf.  I would like to ask him 
where his minister and his government are in implementing those 
very policies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is quite obvious that 
someone has to speak on behalf of the Conservative members.  They 
seem to be incapable of doing it.  This is their opposition day. 
As a result—if the member would just take a Valium for a 
moment—all I am suggesting is that they should have taken an 
opportunity to put some constructive ideas on the table.  They 
did not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they want to do is try to pretend that they are friends of 
the western farming community when they know they are not their 
friends, and the results of last night's byelection proved that. 
They try to do that but, at the same time, they do not want to 
upset the east coast fishery because they have a number of 
members from that part of the country, the only part, I believe, 
where they actually have any members except for one member in 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just suggesting to the member that I am not afraid to stand 
up in my caucus and in this place and say that I think what that 
government did to the east coast fishery was a travesty. I think 
this government should take some steps, such as increasing the 
quota of the seal hunt, to see if we cannot help improve the 
fishing stock on the east coast. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to commend the speaker.  This is the first time since 
I have known him that he made a whole speech in the House and 
never mentioned my name.  I feel a little hurt this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member would agree that the European Union, which 
is subsidizing its farmers a great deal, went through a period of 
time a few years back when there just was not any food on the 
shelves.  It suffered a great deal in that regard.  It is also 
pretty strong in the fact that it will never let that happen 
again.  I can understand that, as I am sure he can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will go to the WTO negotiations to try to level the playing 
field.  In order to do that, we are going to ask the EU to reduce 
its subsidies, to bring down its method of supporting its 
farmers.  To do that, Canada may be asked to give something up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question I have is does he have any idea what the 
European Union might expect Canada to give up in order to 
negotiate a deal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question is with regard to the seal hunt, which I 
agree would be a good idea and a good solution.  Would he be 
prepared to stand up to the interest groups that would want the 
seals protected and would come right on the heels of bringing in 
such legislation, or would he cave in like they usually do to 
small interest groups in their requests? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, indirectly I did mention 
the member, although I did not mention him by name.  I said that 
he was complaining earlier about some of the bureaucracy and the 
red tape by the farmers.  I did sort of touch on it but I also 
had confidence that he would rise in his place to compliment me 
in some fashion.  I am getting used to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did stand up to IFAW, the International Fund for Animal 
Welfare.  It threatened to sue me over remarks that I made where 
I accused its members of not being totally honest with the lobby 
that they were leading.  Many members in this place received 
computerized phone calls to our offices lobbying us, passing out 
information that was totally false and telling members and senior 
citizens contributing $10 that baby seals were being slaughtered 
on the banks off of Newfoundland when we know that is not true. 
In fact, it is against the law.  The government made it against 
the law and levied over 100 charges.  Of course there will be 
people who will break the law in that regard but we have to be 
tough on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have certainly stood up to those interest groups and will 
continue to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in the House this afternoon to speak on the motion put 
forward by the Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion comprises a number of elements, the main ones being 
the financial difficulties currently being experienced by 
Canadian farmers, Ottawa's incompetence in dealing with this 
issue, the failure of the federal government to assume 
responsibility and leadership with respect to the Supreme Court 
of Canada decision in R. v Marshall, and the federal 
government's failed fisheries policies and its lack of vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share my time with my colleague from Lotbinière. 
This morning, my colleague from 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok spoke about fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are sharing our time, I would like to spend time on the 
fourth point of the Progressive Conservatives' motion, that is, 
the lack of vision on the part of the government, something that 
very often results in a lack of leadership.  I will relate this 
to a matter particularly dear to my heart, one I have spoken of 
quite frequently of late, and that is the matter of genetically 
modified foods. This is an issue in which the government has 
been very short on vision, and one that illustrates my thoughts 
very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it starts with inertia.  For five years, our shopping 
baskets have contained genetically modified products, and up to 
now the government has not brought this to the attention of 
consumers. 
The delay is rather hard to explain and may be likened to a lack 
of transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fall of 1997, when we were working on the matter,  the 
agriculture committee recommended to the government unanimously 
that there be mandatory labelling so consumers buying the 
products would know what they had in their baskets and what they 
were eating.  Knowing what one is eating is a basic right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not acted since 1998, except to say that 
labelling is optional in Canada and that we should wait until 
the issue comes up for debate. 
But it did not, with the result that events have now overtaken 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore find ourselves in another kind of debate with 
scientists, Health Canada employees, and all sorts of people on 
one side or the other, while the consumer, who is at the heart 
of the debate, cannot get a straight answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the short, medium and long term effects on health?  We 
do not have all the answers to this question.  Furthermore, what 
are the effects on the environment and soil degradation?  What 
are the socioeconomic and legal impacts?  There has been no 
follow-up and, in this final and very progressive century of the 
millennium, I do not think that an entire population can be left 
in the dark.  I do not know how the government sees this, but I 
see it as a complete lack of vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all sorts of underlying issues. 
There is a lot of talk about consumers because, as users of all 
these products, they are on the front line, but agricultural 
producers should also be mentioned.  They are also becoming 
increasingly concerned, and their concerns are twofold.  Those 
producing genetically engineered food have questions about 
biological diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen if we continue to take this increasingly 
specialized approach? The diversity of seed available to farmers 
or producers is becoming extremely limited and is being 
controlled by a certain group of individuals, or companies, 
monopolizing the sale of agricultural products.  This will 
inevitably lead to monoculture.  In an agricultural context, it 
is a short leap from monoculture to the risk of a disease that 
can wipe out an entire crop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even those who are proactive on this issue and those who are now 
using genetically modified seed grain have questions, not all of 
which have been answered, although they should have been.  This 
is the situation in which those farming with genetically 
modified organisms find themselves.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are those involved in biological or traditional 
agriculture.  They are ending up in a dangerous situation, 
because of their smaller fields, which will turn into veritable 
minefields, for pollen can be carried a very long way.  In the 
spring, they were talking of one kilometre.  Then a little later 
it was five, then twenty.  This week I heard a figure of fifty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How, then, is it possible to have the crops one desires in 
traditional agriculture, as in the case of Mr. Schmeiser, if one 
is in an area where there is airborne contamination?  There is 
also a race for patents going on at the present time.  All 
living things are on the verge of being patented. 
I do not know if this House is aware of the case of a mildly 
hallucinogenic plant that is used in the Amazon traditionally 
for medical and religious purposes.  One day an American arrived 
on the scene and announced “This is a rather extraordinary 
plant, with major characteristics, so we are patenting it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Amazon natives can no longer obtain the plant—which is about 
as common as dandelions are here in Canada—because it is 
patented.  All these matters relate to ethics.  If there are no 
standards for labelling transgenic food, there is no code of 
ethics when it comes to discoveries in a rapidly expanding field 
which affects us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows a lack of vision, a lack of leadership, and I would 
venture to say as well a lack of commitment by the government. 
Let us look at the situation.  Since 1993, the budgets have not 
changed, they have been shrinking continually, and we have 
reached the threshold we were at in 1993 for research and 
development budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is no funding, no basic research, there is a void, but 
a void is always filled.  So it was filled with a transfer of 
responsibility that the companies supported, because there was 
no government expertise, no government funding or independent 
scientists to do this sort of research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is strange, because the government is going to negotiate at 
the WTO, where they will be talking of export subsidies and 
domestic support, but they should be talking about international 
trade barriers too.  Such major countries as Japan, the European 
Community, Korea, Australia, Brazil and in fact a whole series 
of countries are currently requiring labelling of products 
containing genetically engineered food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we going to do in this market if there has been no 
leadership?  We will again see a lack of vision resulting in us 
losing ground it will be hard to make up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another comment arising from the situation is that there is some 
confusion in federal infrastructures leading to a lack of 
accountability.  The entire field of biotechnology is the 
responsibility of the Department of Industry, product approval 
is the responsibility of the Department of Health, the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency reports to the Department of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food. Yet no one deals with all the environmental 
problems, since in terms of accountability and responsibility, 
no one looks after this area at Environment Canada.  This matter 
is the responsibility of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bouncing the ball back and forth leads to a problem of 
accountability, and this is what I contend today. 
The motion by my colleague from the Progressive Conservative 
Party contained a lot of elements, including the lack of vision. 
I think we have a responsibility as parliamentarians, and we 
must bear this in mind.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member elucidate for us how she would implement a policy 
of mandatory labelling?  Other countries in Europe have this on

would the member go about implementing such a policy in this 
country? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would love to have the 
government's powers, because I would have introduced obligatory 
labeling long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very simple.  Two systems are necessary.  Quebec, for 
example, has already instituted a system of food traceability. 
This requires being able to track food from the farm to the 
table.  It is tracked in terms of whether it is transgenic, 
traditional or biological.  This is how other countries operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member speaks about the safety of food in this 
country, everything is fine, thank goodness, there are no 
problems, but we are still living in a world of risk management. 
I do not wish to be an alarmist, but we are not safe from 
everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, research and inspections are adequate.  But if the 
government continues to pull back and leave all the 
responsibilities in the hands of companies, slaughterhouses or 
whatever, I have a serious concern.

would like to congratulate the member for Louis-Hébert for all 
the work she is now doing on GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has really led the way on this issue, which we all know is a 
very important one.  There is talk about it in my riding of 
Lotbinière, which is a very agricultural riding.  It is also 
considered an important issue because agriculture and health are 
intimately linked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often complained that this government gives a lot of 
attention to trade agreements and finance, but completely 
overlooks the consumer.  It overlooks what we are putting into 
our mouths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Louis-Hébert has set out on a crusade to bring 
this issue to the attention of the public, and I am proud of 
her. 
It is already having an impact all over Quebec.  I hope it will 
reach as far as Ontario, for people are having trouble truly 
understanding the reality of Canadian and Quebec farm 
production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to spend a moment on the motion by my colleague for 
Brandon—Souris, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House regrets the failure of the government to 
recognize the important of Canada's food industries— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to express my thoughts on this situation.  I wonder 
if the government is even aware that there is such a thing as a 
food industry in Canada, judging by its behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind this government once again that we all worked 
together between September and December 1998. 
We brought in representatives of agriculture from the west and 
from the east; we heard representatives of the Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture; we heard representatives of the UPA. 
We heard from everyone involved and we found a marvellous title 
for the report—maybe marvellous is a bit of an exaggeration, but 
a good title, one that I thought would really get things moving. 
I will give it again, because the people over there have poor 
memories “The Farm Income Crisis in Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken in committee or in the House on a number of 
occasions about this crisis, a term people have great difficulty 
understanding.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In preparing my speech, I looked up crisis in the <I>Petit Larousse</I> 
for three definitions.  This is a fairly major entry, a whole 
long paragraph. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From it I selected three definitions.  The first refers to a 
decisive or perilous period in a person's existence.  A crisis 
is also defined as a difficult phase being experienced by a 
group.  Third, when used with the adjective economic, it is 
defined as an imbalance between economic powers, in particular 
between production and consumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I said to myself that even if the Liberals hear the 
definition of the word “crisis”, I will give them a bit of a 
break.  I will relate it to the current situation and will go 
over each of the definitions to show them what a crisis really 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A “decisive or perilous period” and we will add “in 
agriculture” in Canada and Quebec.  In the case of “difficult phase being 
experienced by a group”, the group is Quebec or western farmers. 
In the case of the “economic crisis”, I think we are in a full 
blown crisis.  I will reread the definition “an imbalance 
between economic powers, in particular between production and 
consumption”.  This is the reason for today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not understand what a crisis is. 
In December 1998, they were made aware of the situation.  Nearly 
a year later, nothing has been done.  Even with the links I have 
made, I am sure the government will remain silent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government lacks leadership.  It lacks the courage of its 
convictions and it abdicates its responsibilities in the face of 
the current crisis.  A crisis means there is an emergency.  A 
crisis means there is a need for action. A crisis means it is 
time to put an end to inertia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, however, has just found another argument for 
waiting rather than acting and taking decisions.  It is saying 
“We have to be careful in the programs we will establish, 
because we are going to be negotiating on November 30 at the 
WTO, the world trade organization”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I read the morning papers, one headline read “WTO: minister 
creates confusion”.  I was somewhat concerned.  This means once 
again that this government is really inconsistent and without 
vision.  Its vision is to collect tens of billions of dollars 
and spend them in areas of provincial jurisdiction.  That is the 
vision of this government: to have billions of dollars in its 
pocket and to let a situation such as currently exists in the 
west worsen.  That is vision too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, however, the vision stops at the financial and 
economic levels.  The government never talks of farm producers 
or consumers.  How can we expect this government to have vision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the motion introduced by my colleague from the 
Progressive Conservative Party, it provides, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—by failing to address the serious problems of Canada's 
agricultural producers, who are suffering from increasing 
subsidized competition— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, where is Canada's leadership on the three important 
criteria that will guide the WTO negotiations?  As for the 
decrease in funding, we have done our part.  Our commitment 
under the GATT in 1995 was 15%.  This has now climbed to 50%. 
But, in the meantime, the United States and the European 
community are refusing to assume their responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for reducing domestic measures, the question is where.  We 
must not turn around and make our agricultural production 
vulnerable.  We must reaffirm it, defend ourselves, and stand 
firm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, with respect to market access, we must know our 
products and defend our market.  Not only must we defend 
economic principles, but we must understand agriculture.  Once 
again, the members opposite are having trouble doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to the Progressive Conservative member's motion: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—by failing to address the serious problems of Canada's 
agricultural producers, who are suffering from increasing 
subsidized competition, rising input costs— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the member for Louis-Hébert reminded us that financial 
assistance has been declining since 1993.  Yet, costs are rising 
and we know that the industry is becoming increasingly 
specialized. 
There is a need for research and money, but the members opposite 
are living in a dream world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, let us look at natural disasters.  There is a disaster; it 
is noted; the affected farmers are asked to be patient and told 
that, when they file their income tax return, the government 
will look into it. Then the government gets busy juggling 
figures while the farmers have time to go belly up, as they have 
no way out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is trying to convince us it can handle crises. 
This is ridiculous, because we are already close to one. 
Members can imagine what things would be like if there were 
really a crisis.  The entire country would be in a real mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore calling upon this government once again to show 
some leadership, courage and vision, to show some sign of being 
a government capable of understanding the situation.  The year 
is not 1949 or 1959; it is 1999, with the third millennium just 
around the corner.  Yet this government continues to maintain 
rigid policies, policies that lack any flexibility and continue 
to heavily penalize agricultural producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I maintain that this government has chalked up a total failure 
in its vision, in its approach to the reality of Canada's and 
Quebec's farmers, and in its strategy.  I say to my Liberal 
friends, wake up before it is too late.

this year for the first time in 12 years there was an increase in

careful reinvestments by our government in Canada's military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when Canada is more committed than ever to our vital 
role as a peacekeeper, it is essential that our forces be trained

have.  However, they are stretched to the limit and we must

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Liberal 
government thinks that Canadians' paycheques are not really their 
own.  Liberals believe that one-half of every paycheque should be 
confiscated from the person who earned it.  The Liberals are 
ripping off Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my wife and I were first married, many years ago, we 
decided that she would be a full time mom and I would earn the 
family income.  At that time we were able to meet our needs on my 
modest salary, including purchasing our first home.  That is 
because my pay stub tax bite was only about 15%.  Now Canadian 
taxpayers are losing nearly half of their income to the taxman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 30 years Canadians have paid an increasing 
proportion of their earnings in taxes to heavy-handed, uncaring, 
uncompassionate Liberal and Tory governments.  Canadians want to 
keep more of the money they work so hard to earn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals keep saying that they have lowered taxes, but the 
pay stub evidence shows that is not factually correct.  It is 
time for the Liberals to either lower taxes or get out.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Matthew Baranovski and his friends appear to have been minding

no apparent reason and the community is in shock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the experts and the media are wringing their hands in 
horror, asking what is happening to our youth.  I have news for 
them.  This is nothing new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven years ago my son Jesse suffered a similar fate under very, 
very similar circumstances.  The entire country was shocked with 
the murder of Reena Virk in 1997.  On Halloween last year Clayton 
McGloan was swarmed, beaten and stabbed to death in Calgary. 
Last June Jonathon Wamback was viciously beaten in Newmarket and 
left in a coma.  Fortunately he survived and will hopefully 
recover.  I could go on and on but my time is limited.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
November is diabetes month in Canada.  Diabetes is a chronic 
disease that has no cure and is a leading cause of death by 
disease in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People develop diabetes when their body no longer makes any or 
enough insulin or is unable to properly use the insulin it 
produces.  There is also a possibility for women to get diabetes 
temporarily during pregnancy which greatly increases the chances 
that they will develop it permanently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas which breaks up the 
sugar we eat so it can get into our cells and provide our body 
with energy.  For those with diabetes this process does not occur 
naturally and they are forced to get insulin injections to 
maintain the proper balance of sugar in their blood and in their 
cells. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, diabetes is a horrible disease and there is much 
research and work to be done in this area.  National diabetes 
month gives all Canadians the opportunity to learn more about 
this disease.  We must continue to put money toward research to 
find a cure for diabetes and at least until we find that cure, to 
find methods to improve the life of those battling this disease.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
20 years ago last Wednesday, during the evening of November 10, 
1979, an event took place that is now known as the Miracle of 
Mississauga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 106-car freight train carrying explosives and poisonous 
chemicals was derailed at the Mavis Road rail crossing.  Over the 
next few days 218,000 people were evacuated from private homes, 
nursing homes and hospitals.  Our city became a virtual ghost 
town. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amazingly after seven days, through the diligent hard work and 
untiring efforts of Mississauga's emergency service crews, 
combined with the assistance of several outside personnel, no 
lives were lost and our citizens returned.

hockey game.  Canada's secret service is secret in name only.

from higher up.

leaking confidential information, committee reports in 
particular.  However, when it comes to compliance with the 
Access to Information Act, this same government gets obsessed 
with secrecy.  Secret material falls into the hands of the 
public, while material that is public becomes secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is understandable that Canada's secret agents do not know 
which way is up.  After all, if everything that ought to be 
public were to become secret, most public servants would have to 
be replaced by secret agents.  And then the Liberal government, 
mightily relieved at last, would no longer have to answer any

<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

supporting the provincial Liberals in British Columbia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is of such wide-ranging importance to 
aboriginals and non-aboriginals that it should be submitted to a 
province wide referendum in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty establishes a new level of government.  It 
establishes two tier citizenship.  It abandons the principle of 
equality before the law.  It creates taxation without 
representation and fails to protect the rights of aboriginal 
women and entrepreneurs.  If these are not sufficient reasons to 
hold a referendum in B.C. on the Nisga'a treaty, what would be?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and

interesting that the Reform Party, for example, continues to say 
that women somehow are not represented or are not protected in 
the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the leader of the Reform Party ever read the treaty itself, 
he would know that provincial legislation applies to the Nisga'a 
women as it does to all women in British Columbia.  That leader 
would know, if he read the treaty, that the charter applies 
equally to the Nisga'a people as it does to all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister knows because of the treaty that people cannot own 
private property.  I think that would affect women as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government assures us that it is no problem absolutely that 
women's rights will not be protected in the treaty.  It says we 
should not worry about the fact that non-Nisga'a people living on 
this new land will be taxed by a government they cannot even vote 
for.  It says that the fact the constitution will be changed 
probably should not bother anyone either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rubbish.  If the government is so comfortable with Nisga'a

not up to Canada to decide that certain other countries will not 
speak about certain services if, in their own interest, they 
wish to conduct international trade in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that, since membership is voluntary, we do

Canada accepts those rules.  We did not accept them in the 
Uruguay round and we will not accept them in the next round.

to us in a certain field without us having to volunteer a 
concession in the same field.  That is what international trade

its concessions.  Canada will not make concessions on health and

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are over 4,000 municipal governments in Canada, from the 
largest city to the most remote rural and northern community. 
Municipal governments in Canada have a pervasive influence on the 
economy, culture and quality of life.  Municipal governments are 
major players in the Canadian economy, influencing technology and 
innovation diffusion and productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada defines productivity as the technical 
efficiency of production.  Municipal governments through 
investment in public services like transportation have a vital 
impact on productivity.  In other words it costs money to provide 
services, and federal governments that have infrastructure in 
municipal jurisdictions certainly should be expected to pay for 
those services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 municipal governments spent $39.2 billion providing 
community services and employed over 400,000 Canadians. Municipal 
government expenditures constitute about 5% of Canada's gross 
domestic product.  In addition to the sizeable share of public 
sector spending on goods and services, municipal government 
capital spending totals about $9 billion a year, equal to a third 
of all public advancement and about 6.5% of all capital 
investment in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipal government asset portfolios include roads, water 
supply and distribution systems, sewage treatment facilities, 
street lighting, some public housing, recreation facilities, 
parks, community centres, and a wide variety of vehicles, 
buildings, machinery and equipment.  Members can see that the 
needs and the services provided by the municipal governments are 
much like those of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is how the municipalities pay for them.  As I 
indicated earlier, it is by collecting taxes, specifically 
collecting property taxes.  Federal buildings require as I 
indicated the same services as other property owners so, in 
essence, why should federal buildings not pay the full rate? 
Canadian municipalities do not have the luxury of either 
receiving the majority of their funds from the federal government 
or the option of collecting income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read a short excerpt from a background paper prepared by 
the Parliament of Canada on local municipal government 
jurisdictions in Europe just to illustrate that there are other 
ways of dealing with the tax collection side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general there are at least two striking differences between 
the administration of local and regional municipalities in Europe 
and in Canada.  First, almost all European states and local 
levels of government are formally recognized often 
constitutionally, and that is not the case in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bulk of the financing for local governments is 
provided by the national level of government in most states 
primarily through grants and other transfers.  By contrast the 
concept of property tax, the mainstay of Canadian municipal 
finances, is less significant and less well accepted.  These two 
phenomena are common in both federal and unitary states in Europe 
although there are naturally a number of significant differences 
among them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to financing, the German case is particularly 
revealing.  As political scientists Don Stevenson and Richard 
Gilbert have outlined in some detail, municipalities in the 
country of Germany receive a negotiated share of national taxes. 
This income represents more than 50% of the total revenues of 
most municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain major cities such as Frankfurt receive a lesser share, 
but only because of their ability to raise significant sums 
through their own means.  However, as the case of Frankfurt 
demonstrates, this independent revenue capacity is due to its 
legal ability to levy business taxes, especially on banks. 
Property taxes on the other hand constitute only 5% of 
Frankfurt's revenue, unlike in this country where property taxes 
make up the majority of the funds raised.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitution of Germany, a federal state, is equally 
instructive.  It specifically recognizes municipalities and their 
responsibilities for local affairs.  In addition, it anticipates 
their input in decision making at the national level, which is 
missing in this country, largely through negotiation. Local 
governments are miniature legislatures with council members 
elected on the basis of party lists and forming government and 
opposition parties or coalitions of parties in each local 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A similar situation exists in The Netherlands, a unitary state 
with 12 administrative regions or provinces, but it is a more 
radical case.  Not only are municipalities recognized in the 
constitution, unlike Canada, but there is a ministry of urban 
affairs.  Its 1986 municipal act actually gave municipalities 
more independence, lessened the supervision of provincial 
authorities, and deregulated the processes of municipal councils 
which operate along partisan lines as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With more than half of the entire population located in the 
adjoining urban areas of Rotterdam, Amsterdam and The Hague, it 
is perhaps not surprising that some 90% of municipal revenues 
come from the central government, roughly two-thirds of which are 
in the form of conditional grants.  Like Frankfurt, Rotterdam is 
an exception to this rule as it raises nearly half of its 
revenues through business taxes. Once again, property taxes are 
insignificant, as in Canada, accounting for only 2.5% of the 
city's total revenues. We can certainly take a lesson from some 
of these European countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sweden is perhaps the most extreme example of municipal 
importance and autonomy in Europe.  This is all the more 
significant as it too is a unitary state.  Swedish local 
governments, in addition to the standard Canadian 
responsibilities of the municipal level, are in charge of 
education, regional planning and the administration of most 
health and social services.  They receive only one-quarter of 
their funding from central government grants but unlike most 
other European examples, they are able to levy their own income 
tax. That is really different from this country.  Roughly half of 
their total revenues come from this income tax with almost all of 
the remainder of their funding being provided by fees and 
charges, not by property tax as we see it in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the other end of the spectrum are two unusual European cases, 
those of France and Great Britain.  The former is long known for 
its massive centralization of government programs and a seemingly 
infinite number of government layers. It is currently in the 
midst of a considerable decentralization exercise.  The outcome 
is still far from certain with various factions urging the 
elimination of layers known as departments and prefectures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One apparently inevitable result of the reform exercise will be 
the continued existence of the local or commune level to which 
citizens are fiercely attached and which is viewed as the 
essential building block of French democracy.  At the end of the 
day its decentralization may well come to resemble the situation 
already prevalent in most other European states.  Certainly the 
direction of its reform is the same as it is elsewhere, if not 
the pace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that this country lags far behind in the reform of 
European governments.  We can see how we differ in terms of 
taxation.  That is why our position is basically that this 
federal government should not ask for special treatment when it 
comes to paying its fair share of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that has been illustrated is that European 
jurisdictions tend to recognize municipalities as legitimate 
entities, something that is totally missing in this country. 
There have been many occasions where the federal government has 
been asked by the municipalities for this recognition.  The usual 
answer is that they are the creation of the provinces but I 
believe it goes further than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember clearly in 1996 at a Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities convention in Calgary, the Prime Minister 
acknowledged the importance of municipal governments as the first 
level of government, that which is closest to the people, yet at 
the same time our own Prime Minister will not recognize the 
municipalities in a legitimate fashion in this very House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time I have stood in the House on several occasions 
to ask the Prime Minister to acknowledge the legitimacy of the 
first level of government in Canada.  Unfortunately we are still 
waiting.  That has not happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the November recess I indicated that it was unfortunate 
the government had not informed Canadian municipalities about the 
tabling of Bill C-10 for debate at second reading.  My 
understanding is that it has taken many years of negotiation with 
the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and the federal 
government to make these amendments. I am informed that the FCM 
was very disappointed not to have been informed that the bill had 
been tabled for debate at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is that all laws pertaining to both the individual 
and private sector should apply equally to the Government of 
Canada, its personnel, its agencies and parliament.  We believe 
in the principle of equality and fair treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 is not supportable.  It gives the Liberal government 
too much discretionary power.  The remuneration of the dispute 
advisory panel is non-binding.  It merely maintains the status 
quo and entrenches into legislation common practices that were 
put into place 16 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see what is happening in other countries, we need major 
changes in Canada.  We need to repeal the Municipal Grants Act. 
It is really unnecessary.  Repealing the Municipal Grants Act 
will certainly force the federal government to pay all of its 
taxes responsibly like all Canadian citizens. We need to 
recognize the legitimacy of the municipalities and invite them to 
the table on issues that affect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we took a new approach to governance for the people 
of our country. As we head toward the new millennium we need to 
find new ways for all three levels of government to work together 
in a co-operative manner.  Co-operative federalism means having 
all three levels of government at the table at the same time and 
treating each other with respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order to ask the Chair to seek unanimous consent that we return 
to the supply day motion that was originally before the House. 
There was an attempt made by the government House leader to do so 
at the close of question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that the Chair consider putting that motion again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have the permission of the House to put the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened to my colleague's comments knowing that his background 
in municipal government is similar to mine.  I was involved in 
municipal government for 18 years on council in the town I live 
in of Picture Butte. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recognition of municipal government and the importance it 
has in the running of the country has not been recognized fully 
by the federal government. It is certainly not recognized fully 
in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The payment in lieu of tax system that was put in place leaves a 
lot of authority and discretion to the minister.  That sometimes 
places municipalities in a very untenable position when it comes 
to budgeting and working out taxes for their own people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What more importance does he see municipal governments being 
given by the federal government?  Municipal governments are a 
creation of the provinces, but in order to bring them into the 
equation and the discussion, the federal government has to 
recognize the importance of municipal governments at some time. 
I would like my colleague to comment further on that aspect of 
his delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Madam Speaker, as we head into the new 
millennium, as a country we need to find ways to work together 
rather than to work apart. We have seen over the last decade, if 
not longer, that there tends to be a greater division between all 
three levels of government.  Unfortunately, the municipal level 
of government tends to be neglected even more today than it was 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to redefine what the federal government has always 
called co-operative federalism.  We need to exercise and put into 
practice the real definition of what co-operative federalism 
means.  It means co-operation.  There cannot be co-operative 
federalism unless all the stakeholders are at the table.  There 
cannot be co-operative federalism if it is a top down approach, 
that the guy with all the money makes all the decisions.  That 
seems to be the problem we encounter almost daily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be a new vision and a new way of doing business. 
We cannot do business unless everyone is involved. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, for the 
past six years I have made it a practice to visit as many of the 
municipal councils within my riding as possible. After six years 
I have discovered that the most fiscally responsible and 
accountable politicians elected in this country are at that 
level.  Most of those municipalities run their governments in the 
black and if they do have debts they are very manageable debts. 
They have assets to deal with the debts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some parts of the country such as Toronto, Montreal and 
Vancouver we have what amounts to city states.  They have vast 
responsibilities with huge populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the resources that the provincial and federal 
governments obtain come from these municipalities.  They tax the 
wealth that is created in these municipalities.  They take huge 
sums, billions of dollars, out of the municipalities and then 
design programs to which those living within the municipalities 
have to adhere in order to get some of that money back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I visit the municipal councils, I always leave them with 
the question, would they support a constitutional amendment that 
would recognize municipal governments?  I ask my hon. colleague 
that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that 
those who work hard for the people closest to them and who are 
responsible and accountable and then are not recognized beyond 
the level that they work, whether it is provincial or federal 
government, they certainly would welcome being legitimate.  Up to 
this time they are in a way an illegitimate entity or body. They 
really do not have legitimacy outside of the provincial 
boundaries as established by the provincial legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that the governments that are the closest and the 
most accountable are the ones which are the furthest removed from 
the public purse.  As many of us know from our experience here 
and also from past municipal experience, the irony is that the 
legislation in this House sometimes creates a lot of hardship for 
the municipal organizations, certainly when it comes to the 
environment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They just do not have the resources to put in place all the 
recommendations that need to be put in place.  At the same time 
they are shipping all the dollars to both federal and provincial 
governments.  They need funds to look after their own budget. 
Basically they go to the two upper levels of government begging 
for dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately they are not at the table and they really need to 
be at the table.  It would make a huge difference in the 
governance of the country just to have municipal governments at 
the negotiation table, or even a simpler beginning would be to 
keep them informed of everything that happens in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have found travelling throughout the country that a lot of the 
information we have here they just do not have.  As I indicated 
in my speech, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities was 
surprised to find that the bill was being debated on the floor 
here.  They were not aware that was happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Madam Speaker, seeing 
as how my colleague is a former mayor of a municipal government, 
I would like to ask him a question.  Are there programs that are 
presently administered by the provinces as well as by the federal 
government which could best and most effectively be administered 
by the government closest to the people, the municipal 
governments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there programs being administered far from the people by 
either the provincial governments or the federal government that 
could be better and more cost effectively administered by the 
government closest to the people, the municipal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for Crowfoot for his question.  If we reverse the whole system 
from a bottom up one rather than top down one, there is no doubt 
that we would have better government and more accountable 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest problem I have found as a fairly recent member of 
parliament is that Ottawa is too far removed from municipalities, 
from small town Canada, unless they are around this region. Other 
than through the newspaper and television most Canadians do not 
really understand what is happening here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that we have had top down government for too 
long.  We need to reverse that trend.  I point my finger at the 
provincial governments as well.  Even though they sing a good 
song at times, they play the same game as the federal system.  I 
have witnessed that as a former mayor at the municipal level. 
When it comes to doing the right thing, walking the talk, it is a 
different matter.  They sing the song “Yes, guys are doing a 
good job and we need to support you”, but when it comes to real 
bucks and real support it is a different matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They put in place regulations and rules that download.  We have 
all heard the expression downloading to municipal governments. 
That happens federally and provincially.  We need to reverse the 
trend.  I reiterate that the municipalities need to be at the 
table to deal with matters that affect them and their purses 
directly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to enter the debate on Bill C-10.  This 
was an unexpected event for us this afternoon.  We were earlier 
debating a Conservative Party supply day motion.  Unfortunately 
that collapsed due to the fact that there were not enough members 
of that party in the House, so we are moving on with government 
Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  You guys would not agree to having it

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 is an act to amend the Municipal Grants Act.  Its 
purpose is to provide for the fair and equitable administration 
of payments in lieu of taxes.  It addresses the issues of 
compensation for untimely payments, defaults on tax obligations 
by certain tenants of the crown and by others in the legal 
system.  It establishes an advisory panel to advise the minister 
on disputes concerning payment amounts.  It also amends the title 
of the act to the payments in lieu of taxes act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Dauphin—Swan River was a municipal politician 
and mayor for a number of years as were other members of the 
House who got their political start at the civic level. There is 
at that level a degree of accountability that perhaps others 
emulate to a certain degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who seem to be closest to the people at the municipal 
level also seem to be the ones who are the most accountable in 
terms of fiscal responsibility and in terms of delivering 
services to their constituents and people in surrounding areas. 
There are those at the local level who are calling on us, 
particularly the current Liberal government, to emulate our 
municipal counterparts in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a note yesterday from a constituent making that very 
point.  When highlighting some of the wasteful spending going on 
by the government my constituent made reference to <I>Bubbles 
Galore</I>, a film produced not long ago and supported by some 
hard earned Canadian tax dollars.  I share my constituent's 
concern in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked why the federal government engaged in these kinds of 
spending activities without giving it a second thought when his 
municipal government is accountable for expenditures of this type 
and knows that if it made these types of expenditures the 
constituents would be down at city hall knocking on council 
doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that question of the government.  Why is it that the 
government does not take the same accountable approach in terms 
of spending as do municipal governments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill talks about several changes in the current act, one of 
them being interest payments made after agreed upon dates.  It 
also talks about third party leases and property exclusions.  The 
bill proposes to include some structures and improvements which 
used to be excluded from payment.  However the bill does not 
drastically change the status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that over and over again with the Liberal government.  It 
seems to be willing to accept the status quo.  The government 
wants to keep the status quo and use it as a model for 
approaching other topics and other situations, one of them being 
the Nisga'a treaty in British Columbia.  Many people are 
concerned about the implications of that bill just as individuals 
are concerned about Bill C-10 and the application of municipal 
grants.  The status quo is being presented in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of British Columbia are concerned that the Liberal 
government is promoting the same status quo in the Nisga'a 
treaty.  It is making the same fundamental mistake, the same 
flaw, it made with the Indian Act, which it brought forward and 
has had in place for a number of years.  It sets up inequalities 
and enshrines them in law, which is exactly what the Nisga'a 
treaty does in British Columbia as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  You are obsessed with aboriginal issues 
over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  The member for Peterborough seems to 
have awakened from his deep sleep on the other side.  I am not 
sure if he will utter scurrilous remarks today as he has in the 
past.  Perhaps he could listen to the people of British Columbia. 
They would like to have the opportunity to have a referendum on 
such an important issue as the Nisga'a treaty which will have 
great impact, not only throughout British Columbia but throughout 
the rest of the country.  It will enshrine in law the treatment 
of people based on their racial background. 
That is clearly within the Nisga'a agreement.  It is promoting 
the same status quo that Bill C-10 promotes.  Bill C-10 which has 
to do with municipal grants perpetuates the same status quo 
attitude in this particular area.  It does not address the 
discretionary power of the minister and the crown in several 
different areas.

non-binding.  Bill C-10 merely maintains the status quo and 
entrenches into legislation common practices that were put in 
place 16 years ago.  It keeps that particular problem with the 
old legislation going forward into the new legislation.  That 
seems to be the approach of the Liberal government.  It has to 
examine things as they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the government and cabinet can stand in this place 
and tell us one thing.  They can say whatever they would like in 
this place.  What is more important is to measure the actions 
that go along with those words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When individuals say something we tend to take their word for it 
right off the bat because we are willing to give them the benefit 
of the doubt.  However, when we see over and over again people 
saying one thing and doing another, over time the credibility of 
the message deteriorates.  We see that time and time again with 
the Liberal government.  It says one thing but it does another. 
We see that happening with this legislation.  We see it, as I 
mentioned earlier, with the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can draw a lot of parallels between a municipal government 
and a government at least saying that the Nisga'a treaty sets up 
a municipal form of government when in fact it does not.  It sets 
up a different order of government that attributes powers and 
rights to the Nisga'a government which used to be within 
provincial and federal jurisdiction.  We think that is wrong 
headed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that whole process has been skewed.  It has not 
received proper treatment from the government.  We saw how it 
dealt with that bill in the House.  It limited debate through 
time allocation and closure.  We see it in question period.  When 
opposition members rise to ask important questions about that 
particular piece of legislation the government is happy with the 
status quo attitude.  It says everything is fine and that we 
should trust it, that it will take care of this legislation.  It 
is the same with that piece of legislation and this one over 
here.  What has happened is that the actions that back up those 
words are simply not there.  The credo of the Liberal government 
is to keep everything going the way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is not even supported by the leader of the 
official opposition in British Columbia who happens to be a 
Liberal, Gordon Campbell.  He put out a news release and wrote a 
letter to the Prime Minister on the treatment of this legislation 
and said that the way it was handled was not appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others have said that Bill C-10 is a piece of legislation that 
needs further scrutiny.  My colleague from Dauphin—Swan River 
talked about how the Federation of Canadian Municipalities was 
not aware that it was to be the topic of debate.  However, here 
it is.  We would think there would have been more consultation on 
it before bringing it to the House because it will have such a 
big impact on local governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues at the local municipal government level 
will ask me when I am back in the riding if the federal 
government has any understanding of the fact that they are 
neighbours with other individuals and other municipalities.  Does 
it want to establish another order of government?  This is with 
specific reference to the Nisga'a treaty and how it sets up 
another form of government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The mayors of some of my communities have told me that they have 
to, by law, consult with one another when there is an impact 
along one of their borders with another community so that what is 
done in one community does not negatively affect another 
municipality.  They may also work out an arrangement for the 
sharing of services, whether it is snow removal or whatever the 
particulars are of the local area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A question that has been asked by some of the mayors in my 
community about the Nisga'a treaty is why this other form of 
government has been put in place with no structure in terms of 
consulting with the other local jurisdictions.  They wonder how 
the sharing of services will work.  They have concerns about when 
that template being used in the Nisga'a treaty will be applied to 
other jurisdictions, particularly around the lower mainland area 
of Vancouver and the surrounding areas where there is not a lot 
of land to be divvied up to different groups, that there will 
have to be some kind of an arrangement made.  They are asking why 
it is that the government has not considered those factors in 
relation to the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would say that perhaps it is a notion that again falls into 
that status quo, the status quo approach the government has to 
governing.  Whether it is Bill C-10, the Municipal Grants Act, or 
any other piece of legislation in this place, the government 
seems to simply be on autopilot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to some of the information that Gordon 
Campbell has directed toward the Nisga'a treaty.  He is a member 
of the British Columbia legislature who got his start in 
municipal politics and who was the mayor of Vancouver.  In 
referring to the motion the government made, he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion this morning...to invoke closure on the Nisga'a treaty 
debate is a reprehensible abuse of democratic processes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the B.C. Liberal leader, Gordon Campbell, who said 
that.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an egregious abuse of democratic process, and shows 
flagrant contempt for all British Columbians.  It's an 
unacceptable slap in the face to our province, and to all 
Canadians who deserve a full and open debate on this landmark 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a matter of this critical importance to our country, to our 
province and to our constitution, every Member of Parliament 
deserves the right to speak.  Every Canadian should demand the 
right of their MP to speak.  To put this in context, we wouldn't 
for a moment dream of shutting off debate on a change to the 
constitution affecting Quebec, but that's exactly what the 
government's doing to B.C. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a Liberal leader who made that claim.  He goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In just a few short hours, debate on this treaty will be slammed 
shut forever, and there isn't a chance in the world that anywhere 
near a majority of opposition MPs will be able to speak to it in 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was appalling when the NDP government shut down debate on 
this treaty, and denied British Columbians' elected 
representatives the chance to even ask questions on 11 of its 22 
chapters.  But the federal government's conduct defies 
description.  Once this treaty is passed, it will be set in 
constitutional concrete forever and cannot be changed.  We only 
had one chance left to speak to this treaty on behalf of British 
Columbians, and now the federal government is denying even that. 
The surest way to shatter public trust and confidence in the 
treaty process is to limit debate on what these treaties actually 
say and do.  The federal government should be doing all it can to 
open up the treaty process.  This is a dangerous step on the part 
of the federal government that will only further undermine public 
trust. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the remarks of the leader of the opposition, the man 
who would seek to be premier of the province of British Columbia 
and who is a Liberal himself, and his opposition to the Nisga'a 
treaty.  As I stated, he is a man who got his start in politics 
at the municipal level.  Of course we are talking about Bill C-10 
and municipal government and here is a man who has that notion of 
accountability, as many in this place do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know members of the Liberal Party who got their starts in 
civic politics.  Some of them are here today.  They did an 
admirable job at the municipal level.  I think they are here 
because they have the purest of motives to make positive changes 
in this place.  Yet the process is skewed against those who would 
want to make the positive kinds of changes they know are 
effective and work at the local level.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Liberal government, there is a process in place that 
limits the role of members of parliament in terms of those who 
are on the backbenches. There is a limited role in committee and 
a limited role in other areas.  They do provide an opportunity 
for some input and some debate on topics, but certainly not to 
the degree that most of them hoped they would have had as members 
of the government:  to enact, direct and help their own 
government make the necessary changes within its own ranks to 
become more accountable and more democratic.  I think some of 
them are truly disappointed.  Those who have been here since 1997 
are seeing that after two years that impact is not being made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many members of the opposition who feel the same way. 
The accountability they sought, to work hard at the local level, 
is simply not a concept that seems to be getting through here to 
the Liberal government.  Whether it is Bill C-10, the Nisga'a 
treaty or other legislation, the government has a status quo 
approach that everything is okay.  We are to trust it, throw it 
the keys to the car and it will drive it.  We can see that the 
car is going off the road.  It is going to crash unless there is 
a change of heart by the government but we do not think there 
will be.  That is why we will continue, as members of the 
official opposition, to put forward other ideas and another 
vision for the country.  We will work to take the place of the 
government because that is our ultimate goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can work from the opposition benches to make positive changes 
to impact on the government, but it is now at the point where 
after six years of governing the country, it is starting to show 
some of that same arrogance the government before it showed after 
being in office for a long period of time.  It is time for a 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a group does not back up its words with actions, its 
credibility suffers.  That was alluded to in the letter I read of 
the leader of the Liberal Party in British Columbia.  That is 
what people are seeing at the local level as well.  If federal 
politicians are not going to do what they say they are going to 
do, how is it that we can trust them to govern the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of British Columbia and right across the country are 
getting to that point.  It is unfortunate because cynicism works 
into the hands of the government.  To those individuals who say, 
“What is the use?  I cannot change the system.  My voice cannot 
be heard”, we encourage them to stay engaged and involved in the 
process.  As they do get engaged in the process, change can be 
made.  There are other groups out there that do get involved in 
the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Liberal government is disengaging itself from 
the process.  It has decided what its approach is going to be. 
When government members go out to consult, we really believe it 
is simply an exercise in public relations, an opportunity to go 
out and give their message to other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke with an individual over the last break who sat in on one 
of these Liberal western alienation task force teams.  I like to 
call it the western alienation rescue team, or WART.  They came 
to western Canada.  This individual said that at the public 
meeting there was a committee of Liberal senators and members of 
parliament and that there were three people in the room.  The 
panel of MPs and senators were quite surprised that this 
individual was able to find the meeting.  It had not been 
publicly advertised. It was a meeting they had set up so they 
could say they had a meeting.  This individual had to go to great 
lengths to find out when and where the meeting was going to be. 
That is the kind of consultation the government has put in place 
when it visits western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals wonder why they are so lacking in members in 
western Canada.  It is because they have simply stopped 
listening.  The Nisga'a treaty and Bill C-10 are perfect examples 
of that.  We wonder what kind of consultation process has been 
undertaken with the municipalities on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it is time for the government to either wake up or get 
out of the way and let another group govern that is going to 
listen to people, be accountable and make the changes necessary 
to put the country on the right track.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
had the pleasure the other week to speak on Bill C-10.  I first 
want to say, as a former president of the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities, that when the member opposite asks about saying 
one thing and doing another, Bill C-10 is an excellent example of 
doing something in consultation.  In fact, when the original 
freeze on payments-in-lieu-of-taxes was brought in in December 
1992 by the previous Conservative government there was no 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, this government has worked tirelessly with the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities establishing, for example, 
the technical committee which reviewed the whole issue of making 
payments on time, making sure that they pay interest if they are 
late and making sure that if they want to appeal they go through 
the normal process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues on the other side, including my friend for 
Brandon—Souris, was on the national board of the FCM at that 
time.  He, among others, spoke very loudly about what the 
Conservative government had done at the time in not putting 
private companies on a level playing field with public companies 
like the CBC given the fact that it was getting a 10% discount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out to the hon. member, when he talks about 
actions, that it was this government in 1993 that embraced the 
national infrastructure program.  Unfortunately, none of the 
parties on the other side embraced it in 1993.  It has created 
over 125,000 direct and indirect jobs.  It has been announced 
again in the Speech from the Throne that by the December 2000, 
with the co-operation of municipal and provincial governments, we 
will have a new national infrastructure program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the environment, the 20% club.  This government 
initiated with municipal governments across Canada to reduce CO2 
emissions by 20% over 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about urban crime and safety issues.  In 1997, I had the 
pleasure to be on the team Canada mission with the Prime Minister 
to Asia.  I had mayors, some from communities across the way, who 
were on that mission.  It was the first time in the history of 
federal-provincial-municipal relations that we were able to have 
a meeting.  As president, I had a meeting with the Prime Minister 
and the premiers in Manila in 1997 to talk about infrastructure. 
The Prime Minister listened to those issues and in the end the 
program was extended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about community energy programs where we are trying to 
reduce CO2 emissions to improve the energy in the country.  It is 
this government which embraced with the FCM that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about actions.  I would point out that in November 1996 
I had the pleasure of addressing the first ever 
federal-provincial environment and natural resources ministers 
conference on these issues dealing with the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about co-operation and talk about listening, the 
government needs no lessons from the Reform Party.  The 
government needs no lessons when it comes to working in concert 
with municipal governments.  Maybe we could eliminate the 
middlemen, which would be the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out to the member that he is in error.  Two weeks 
before this bill was introduced in the House, the FCM was given a 
full briefing on Bill C-10.  It was introduced at first reading 
in the House on October 27.  I believe that after second reading 
it goes to committee, and I know the FCM will be there.  The FCM 
has supported all along the fact that we want to have ground 
rules that we can all agree to.  We have that.  This legislation 
has been drafted to deal with those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my hon. colleague across the way like to comment on any of 
those things given the fact that when we talk about actions and 
co-operation I have tried to outline those very briefly for him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a longer opportunity the other week to talk about some of 
the real issues that the federal and municipal governments have 
been able to deal with.  My good friend from Dauphin—Swan River, 
who was a municipal mayor, was certainly involved in terms of 
dealing with issues and looking at the response of a national 
government when it dealt with these kinds of very important 
issues for the community, again remembering that there is only 
one taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member would like the make any comments on those 
observations, I would be delighted to hear them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would certainly love 
to respond to some of the comments made by my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He first said that the Federation of Canadian Municipalities was 
given a full briefing.  I do not dispute that fact.  It was not 
aware that it was coming back for second reading in the House 
even just before the break week. 
There is also the idea of the infrastructure program, which he 
mentioned as being a good program.  That was proposed by the 
municipalities, not by the Liberal federal government.  Once 
again, that is what the government does.  It takes somebody 
else's idea and passes it off as its own.  That is what it did 
with the infrastructure program.  That is exactly what it does. 
It is no different with this program.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the municipal infrastructure program.  Guess 
what?  The timing of those big signs that went up across the 
country just happened to coincide with the federal election.  I 
am sure it was a coincidence— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No, they came after the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Shortly after, as a thank you to those 
areas, and now we hear that there is another infrastructure 
program coming up.  That is fine, but is it going to be 
coinciding with another federal election?  I wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about CO2 emissions and energy.  There are a 
lot of CO2 emissions that need to be taken care of on that side 
of the House, right here in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member could comment on the slash and burn 
approach to health care and education spending that this 
government has taken since 1993.  That is what municipal 
councillors are talking to me about:  When is the federal 
government going to restore the money it gutted from health care 
and education?  The slash and burn Minister of Health likes to 
talk about the money reinvested in health care, and it is great 
that he has reinvested it, but he is hardly even at half of what 
he cut from health care and education spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how it is that this member and other members of 
the government can stand in their places and defend that kind of 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about trade missions with the Prime Minister.  I am 
glad he had an opportunity to visit with the Prime Minister. 
Maybe the Prime Minister could take a trade mission out to 
British Columbia.  Perhaps he could visit some of the communities 
that are talking about the Nisga'a treaty and maybe talk to 
individuals about concerns they have with that, or about the high 
rate of taxes he is imposing on people in British Columbia and 
across the country.  Perhaps he could take a little fact finding 
mission on those areas of concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked me to comment on those.  He made wide ranging 
generalizations and I am going to respond to every one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  The member gave his speech.  We are now into questions 
and comments and there might be other members on this side who 
wish to make them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The period is called 
questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Madam Speaker, I was not 
quite finished with my answer, but I will wrap it up.  If the 
member wants to ask me another question, I would be more than 
happy to respond to her question too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, this Liberal government has slashed and burned 
health care and education spending.  It has done that.  Those are 
the actions.  The member for Oak Ridges talked about actions. 
Those are the actions his government is responsible for.  People 
within the local ridings and communities are asking when the 
federal government is going to restore the funding.  It has taken 
the approach of slashing and burning health care and education 
spending since 1993.  When is it going to restore those dollars 
to the people who need them most, the people at the local level, 
within the municipalities and the provinces, rather than taking 
this hide and seek approach in Ottawa? 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I did notice that the member for Dewdney—Alouette 
managed to try to get in another speech rather than simply 
responding to a question and comment from this side of the House. 
However, I want to pick up on his comments about this party 
stealing ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a member of the board of directors of the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities when the infrastructure program was 
developed, as was the current Minister of National Defence, the 
man who was the first minister for infrastructure in this 
government.  As such, I would like to tell the member that this 
government brings good ideas to government.  It does not steal 
them from anywhere.  There are a number of us who contributed, 
and contributed very strongly, to making sure the infrastructure 
program we supported as municipal politicians was implemented by 
the government we chose to become part of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament for the national capital region I 
would like to tell him that I am one of many who worked with our 
minister to bring forward very progressive legislation on 
municipal grants.  We understand fully well the importance of 
this grant system, grants in lieu of taxes, to our 
municipalities. 
This is not a flash in the pan.  This is not a stolen idea.  It 
is an idea that many members on this side of the House worked 
very hard on with our ministers and with our Prime Minister.  The 
member should be saying thanks instead of being critical.

an actual question in those comments.  I think what the hon.

everything that the Liberal government—

Kootenay—Columbia. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I stand to speak to Bill C-10, an act to amend the Municipal 
Grants Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put on the record the purpose of this act, which 
is to provide for the fair and equitable administration of 
payments in lieu of taxes.  It addresses the issues of 
compensation for untimely payment, defaults on tax obligations by 
certain tenants of the crown and the bijural nature of the 
Canadian legal system.  Additionally, it establishes an advisory 
panel to advise the minister on disputes concerning payment 
amounts.  It also amends the title of the act to the payments in 
lieu of taxes act.  That is the purpose of the act.  That is the 
purpose of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tend to differ in the description, but that is the 
description provided to us by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the relationship of the municipal 
government to the provincial government and then to the federal 
government.  About 15 years ago, long before I ever thought I 
would be crazy enough to get involved in politics, I vividly 
recall sitting in front of my television set watching Allan 
MacEachen, the then Liberal finance minister, waxing eloquently 
from his place in the House.  He was going on about the fact that 
the Liberal government of the day, of which the Liberal 
government today is simply a carbon copy, was going to balance 
its books.  In a typical Liberal sleight of hand, what it was 
basically doing was offloading expenses from itself to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Living in the province of British Columbia at that particular 
time, as I recall, things were at a rather tight juncture.  It 
was in the early eighties.  We had been slapped with the grossly 
ill-conceived concept of the national energy plan of the 
Liberals, the centrist plan that pulled about $80 billion 
permanently out of western Canada into central Canada.  I recall 
thinking to myself at the time that the downloading to the 
provinces which Mr. MacEachen was talking about and the fact that 
the province of British Columbia was in no position to actually 
do anything about it, undoubtedly would end up appearing on my 
taxes, and would undoubtedly come out of my pocket, one way or the 
other, particularly as a homeowner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not take long.  The reality was that although the federal 
tax take out of my wallet and the wallets of my neighbours was 
not diminished, and the tax take out of my wallet and the wallets 
of my neighbours by the province was not diminished, the 
government ended up downloading it to the regional district in 
which I lived, which was the equivalent of a municipality.  By 
downloading it what basically happened was that my property taxes 
went up by $200 that year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal finance minister stood here about 15 years ago and 
waxed eloquently about how he was going to get federal taxes 
under control and how he was coming closer to balancing the 
books, but of course the government never did.  It just kept on 
adding and adding to what is now the massive national debt.  The 
government talked about how it was going to get things under 
control, but I knew, because it was being announced by a Liberal, 
that there was going to be more money coming out of my pocket.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would take the Liberal member for Oak Ridges at his word if 
the municipalities were looking at this, were involved in it and 
had some input into it, but unfortunately they are faced with the 
reality that they are at the bottom of the food chain as far as 
being able to look after themselves and being able to take care 
of their own fiscal requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should add that one of the great things about municipal 
finances is that on a year to year basis municipalities may not 
go into a debt or deficit situation.  The government could 
certainly take lessons from that.  It is something for which the 
municipal politicians deserve great credit.  The fact is, they 
have to come up constantly with the delivery of services for 
people at the municipal and regional district levels.  The 
municipalities manage to deliver services, be they to people, be 
they for reasons of property, or just the services of cleaning 
roads and streets, in spite of all the offloading of the Liberals 
in Ottawa.  Let us be clear, it was the Liberals who downloaded 
all of the expense that has sifted down through to the provinces 
and on down through to the municipalities.  Once again the 
taxpayer is being double whammied by the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say that I understand what the member for Oak Ridges 
was saying, particularly with his involvement and the involvement 
of other members of this House in municipal governments?  Why do 
I say that I understand where they are coming from in terms of 
the municipal governments being let in on some of the ideas that 
the federal government has, at the same time knowing that they 
have a gigantic club over their heads?  They do the best they 
can.  They make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, to use the old 
saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also add that I was rather interested in this prominent 
Liberal member's musings that perhaps the middleman should be 
eliminated, namely the provinces; that somehow the municipalities 
and regional districts would be better off if they were dealing 
directly with the federal government.  Heaven help them.  When we 
shake hands with these people we wonder if we will still have our 
wedding rings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipal governments are creatures of provincial governments. 
They are not recognized under Canada's constitution.  They are 
completely under the direction, the control and the legislative 
authority of the provinces.  The member suggested that we 
eliminate the middleman.  That is to say, maybe we should remove 
the direct control of the municipalities which are delivering the 
services closest to the people, closest to their homes.  This is 
the garbage collection. This is the social services cheque.  This 
is the street cleaning.  This is making sure that the gutters are 
clean and the leaves are removed.  These are the details of 
everybody's life.  Should we take the current authority for that, 
the provincial government, which heaven only knows is far enough 
away in most situations, and give it to Ottawa?  That would mean 
that the municipalities and regional districts would answer to, 
be responsible to and be under the legislative authority of the 
federal government.  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks frequently about the infrastructure 
program.  Let us take a look at how this act, Bill C-10, an act 
to amend the Municipal Grants Act, relates to the income of the 
municipalities.  Looking at the past infrastructure program—and 
I understand that there is a proposed program coming, just in 
time for the next election no doubt—wondering why the 
municipalities express being in favour of it is not rocket 
science.  It is very simple and straightforward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far I have described the problems which municipalities face 
because of the offloading of expenses from the federal level to 
the provincial level and ultimately to the municipal level, the 
municipal level having to work on a deficit free budget year in 
and year out. 
The municipalities are faced with a cash crunch.  There are so 
many hands in their pockets from the authorities higher up, there 
are so many strings attached to any money that is available to 
them, that they will take any money they can get for needed 
capital projects.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are they not carrying on with capital projects without an 
infrastructure program?  Because this government has attacked 
their very tax base.  They do not have a tax base from which they 
can get the funds to do the things on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me think of the government's attitude toward the 
family.  The government will take $6 billion from people earning 
under $20,000 a year this year.  It will take $6 billion in 
taxes, give them peanuts back and say, “Here is a little grant 
and another little grant.  Are we not wonderful people?”  The 
government will continue to have its hands in the pockets of 
individual Canadians, businesses and municipalities.  It will 
continue to act like a gigantic vacuum cleaner.  It will bring 
all the cash here to the bureaucracy in Ottawa, then turn around 
and give a pittance back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipalities in light of that look at an infrastructure 
program and say, “Now we are getting something a little bigger 
than the pittance we normally receive. Now we are supposedly 
getting two-thirds free money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the way the infrastructure programs basically work.  Let 
us say a municipality wanted an intersection upgrade.  That is 
very easy. For different traffic islands, curbing, traffic lights 
and signals, it is easy to invest $1 million in infrastructure 
like that.  Let us simplify it and say it will cost $900,000. 
The municipality has to raise $300,000.  The province has to 
match that with another $300,000. The federal government can 
match it with another $300,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that for just under $1 million for an 
infrastructure program, the federal government only invests 
$300,000 and gets all the credit for it. It is an absolutely 
wonderful, masterful way of moving around a pea under shells. The 
government manages to baffle people who are not necessarily 
prepared to take the time to understand just how far the 
government has its hands in the pockets of individuals, 
businesses and municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a creature of the provincial government, one of the 
difficulties municipalities have is when they do their budgeting. 
This varies from province to province, but as a blanket statement 
it seems to me that in doing their budgeting, the municipalities 
are never really sure of what the actual grants will be from the 
provincial government.  In turn, one of the concerns I have about 
this or any other legislation, is rather than being tied into 
something concrete, hard and normal, Bill C-10, an act to amend 
the Municipal Grants Act, does not resolve the problem of where 
the money is going to come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Bill C-10, the minister is given the authority to 
pay interest on the payments in lieu of taxes if, in his opinion, 
that payment in whole or in part has been unreasonably delayed. 
That is just about as soft and mushy a bunch of words as I have 
ever seen in any act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the minister's opinion.  Who is to say what the minister's 
opinion is going to be? Unreasonably delayed.  Who is going to 
set the yardstick for what is reasonable or unreasonable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On third party leases, the government leases some of its 
properties to non-departmental third parties.  In the past, 
municipalities have experienced difficulty in collecting property 
taxes from these third parties with payment sometimes never being 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To correct this situation, Bill C-10 proposes that if, as of the 
day following the last day of the taxation year, all or part of 
the taxes remain unpaid and if, and here we go again, “the 
minister is of the opinion”—that is the qualifier—“that the 
taxing authority has made all reasonable efforts to collect the 
tax and there is no likelihood that the authority will ever be 
able to collect it”, then the property will be deemed to be a 
federal property and the federal government will pay the payment 
in lieu of taxes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, as with all the legislation, without exception, that is 
ever brought forward by this government, there is all of this 
continuing latitude for the minister, “in the opinion of”, “if 
it is unreasonably delayed” and things that are simply not clear 
and not made definite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely paramount that the municipal authorities are 
able to do their budgeting.  They already have a serious problem. 
In various provincial jurisdictions the province may be treating 
them fairly and in a timely manner, and in other provincial 
jurisdictions they may not.  It can vary in treatment from place 
to place even within a given province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10, an act to amend the Municipal Grants Act, continues 
with all this latitude for the minister, “in the opinion of” 
and “if it is unreasonably delayed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the municipalities having difficulty in providing the 
level of service that people want, expect and deserve?  This will 
vary from municipality to municipality.  While it is mandated 
under their current spending that they may not go into deficit, 
they may nonetheless become involved in capital spending through 
borrowing. Some municipalities have gone into debt quite 
seriously.  They go ahead with heavy municipal borrowing so they 
can go ahead with infrastructure programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason many municipalities respond very positively 
to the infrastructure program.  It simply gives them back money 
that has already been extracted from them, from their 
constituency and from their province, but they nonetheless 
respond positively to it.  Other municipalities will have decided 
that they are going to use a pay as you go basis with respect to 
the majority of their capital expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the municipality of Cranbrook, where my constituency office 
is, there is a very serious challenge in terms of the streets. 
The city proper of about 15,000 is actually built on an old 
glacial gravel bed.  Down under the topsoil, which is only a 
couple of inches, there is a deep gravel bed.  This has created a 
serious problem for the main streets and side streets.  As the 
city has grown, and as the amount of truck traffic in particular 
has increased on the feeder streets, the side streets simply have 
not stood up.  As a consequence there is a constant battle of the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not own property in Cranbrook. Therefore I am not offering 
an opinion, but an observation.  The challenge is to say that a 
street is in such a state of disrepair that it requires temporary 
remedial action or that a very large volume of money is going to 
be spent to go down as far as 8 feet or 10 feet into the gravel 
so that the street can be built back up again and it will be 
permanently changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of challenges that municipalities are faced 
with on a month to month basis, particularly in Canada. With the 
exception of the lower mainland of British Columbia, we have a 
very harsh climate that drives the frost well down into the 
ground and into the services that are underneath the roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to drive at is that municipalities need 
more than anything the assurance of funding, where the money is 
going to come from. 
The province of British Columbia because of the NDP government of 
the last term and a half has a terrible situation. The government 
is having to extract more and more from the municipalities which 
is putting them at a real disadvantage.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, my concern about Bill C-10 is simply this.  What 
we need in our province, and I believe for that matter in all 
provinces for all municipalities, is more surety of funding. 
Unfortunately in my judgment, Bill C-10, an act to amend the 
Municipal Grants Act, does not provide that surety.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am becoming concerned about members of the Reform Party and their 
ability to develop myths.  I choose that word so that I can be 
parliamentary. The bigger the myth the better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, they are paranoid about first nations people and 
they build the myth that one of the more disadvantaged minorities 
in Canada is somehow taking over the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another big myth which they develop has to do with crime. They 
are obsessed with crime, with petty crime. They deliberately 
build up a fearmongering approach, ignoring the fact that 
statistics show that crime has been decreasing in Canada. They 
build a myth instead of presenting the real facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this debate we have heard members of the Reform Party build 
another myth. It is the myth of top down big government.  Among 
other things, that myth demeans the other levels of government 
including the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when the members opposite could have been 
members of parliament here, they could have been MLAs and they 
could have been local councillors all at the same time.  That was 
the way it was in Canada.  At that time power was held by a 
clique.  That clique of people, almost all of them men, held all 
of those positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time what has happened is that we have not developed 
a top down government.  That is what it was in those days.  A 
small group of people held every level of government in their 
hands.  Since then we have developed a truly strong, 
decentralized democracy, arguably the most effective 
decentralized democracy in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of there being a pyramid with the federal government at 
the top and the municipalities at the bottom, the reality is that 
we have three levels of government which are something like three 
Olympic rings.  Each of them is fully democratic, fully elected, 
with great powers of raising taxes, with great powers of spending 
taxes and making decisions in their sphere of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those three areas of government overlap, just like the Olympic 
rings. I am not allowed to use props, but if I could, I could 
show how the overlapping works. They have large areas of their 
own responsibility and there is a small area in the middle where 
there is responsibility which is federal, provincial and 
municipal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those rings are in my mind.  I do not know how those members 
work and they may work in a top down fashion, but in my riding I 
work out of my ring with the other three rings. We work very 
effectively.  Where there is overlap, we work together to deal 
with the issues concerned. I would suggest that those rings are 
the main checks and balances in Canada. That is how our people 
are represented at various levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that in the discussion the members of the Reform Party 
have been demeaning the municipalities and the goodwill and the 
judgment of people at the local level.  If they are so cynical, 
so biased, so uninformed about the role of the particular ring 
which is the federal government, why do they not simply run at 
the municipal level? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have heard some 
interventions in my day but that one certainly took the cake. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, if he takes a look at the blues from my speech the member 
might find that I made absolutely no comment whatsoever about 
first nations.  I have many things that I would like to say about 
first nations, not the least of which is that the government has 
an undemocratic approach to anything to do with first nations. 
However, that is a topic he raised that was not contained in my 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I did not say anything whatsoever about crime, petty 
crime, and I categorically reject the concept he has proposed 
that we are fearmongering.  It is this government that is turning 
around and is buying an aircraft for Correction Services Canada 
to be able to transport a growing number of violent criminals. It 
is this government that is doing it, not the opposition, but that 
is another topic I did not talk to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did talk about top down big government.  There is the golden 
rule.  The golden rule is very simple.  He who has the gold 
rules.  The government manages to attract such a sufficient 
amount of gold that it gets to rule.  That is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the parliamentary system has evolved over a 
period of time both under the Progressive Conservatives and under 
the Liberals.  We now have what is the equivalent of a four year 
dictatorship where the Prime Minister is elected and then he 
chooses to turn his back on the responses he is receiving from 
the people of Canada.  He simply directs the people in his 
backbenches as to when they will stand up and when they will sit 
down, like a bunch of sheep.  This is the reality in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the decentralized democracy again that is a myth. 
The decentralized democracy we are talking about here, the three 
levels of government the member was talking about and the overlap 
he was talking about are there in theory.  The fact of the matter 
is that the major power of raising taxes is in the hands of the 
Prime Minister and the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that were not the case, why were the finance ministers of the 
provinces coalescing yesterday to try and come up with a joint 
program to bring to the finance minister?  They did it in all 
good faith.  They asked how they could bring this about, what is 
the common position and how they could co-operate because they 
have to gang up as best they can against the town bully, namely 
the Liberal Party which is in power in Ottawa at this particular 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest that I am demeaning municipalities is a gross 
misunderstanding and I suggest an intentional misunderstanding on 
the part of the member for Peterborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not demeaning municipalities.  I was standing here in 
defence of municipalities, saying that municipalities require a 
break.  Municipalities, if anything, require legislation that 
would put them on to a proper and equal footing with other levels 
of government.  As I say, right at this moment they happen to be 
a creature of the provincial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, what can I say?  With that kind of an 
intervention I can only assume that the member was not listening 
or is choosing to interpret in his own way my comments, which is 
unfortunate because I am standing here in support of bringing 
strength to municipalities and their financing, and this bill 
will not do it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will keep my comments very simple.  My colleague 
talked about broad Olympic circles.  I will talk about prunes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of those bills where we think we are delivering 
strawberries to the municipalities.  In fact they are getting 
predictability.  They are getting fair payment.  We are no longer 
calling them that glorious regal term, grants, but we are calling 
them payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is predictability involved, but as usual the Reform Party 
happens to take the strawberries and turn them into prunes. They 
are very concerned that the minister at his discretion will pay 
arrears, at his discretion with pay for tenants who have it 
pegged, at his discretion will pay in a timely, fair fashion.  As 
usual, the Reform Party has managed to turn an exciting 
consultative bill into a bowl of prunes.

not from strawberries, so I am having a little difficulty with 
the mixed metaphor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather instructive that the member has pointed out that 
now this payment will be called a payment and not a grant. 
Whoopee.  The title of the thing has been changed.  So what? 
Unemployment insurance is still unemployment insurance.  Just 
because we call it employment insurance does not mean people are 
any more employed.  The wordsmithing that we are into is typical 
of the kind of window dressing we expect from the Liberal 
government.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have 
listened to this very interesting debate.  It certainly touches 
on the grassroots of our country and the first level of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about governments we talk about their powers. 
Governments must have resources to function.  We elect 
governments basically to protect our rights.  The three 
fundamental human rights of the individual are the right to life, 
the right to own property, and the right to liberties and 
freedoms.  We elect governments to protect those rights and not 
to deny us those rights or to take those rights from us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the power of taxation, the whole principle of taxation 
is to take a certain amount of the wealth created by the people 
to provide services that individuals cannot provide for 
themselves and which a specific level of government can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the powers of taxation at the three levels we 
find there is no limit on the power of governments to tax away 
the wealth created by the people.  When we look at the municipal 
level we find the greatest husbanding of resources and the wisest 
use of those resources at any level of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out to the House earlier in a question to my 
colleague from Dauphin—Swan River, for the past six years I have 
made it a practice to visit with my municipal councils as often 
as I can.  I report to them, hear their feedback and offer any 
assistance I can so that they might understand the programs of 
government and what the priorities are at the federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have found that the most fiscally responsible and accountable 
politicians elected in our country today are at the municipal 
level.  I asked at one council meeting:  “How is it that you 
folks can resist the temptation to find the loopholes, to go into 
debt and build your empires as they have done at the two senior 
levels of government?”  We see a huge debt at the federal level 
and in the case of most provinces they carry very significant 
debt.  One councillor said that when they pass a spending 
resolution they have to meet their people on the street and in 
the coffee shop the very next day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was talking about accountability.  Let us look at the lack of 
accountability at the federal and provincial levels.  Those who 
are responsible for increasing the taxation are taking more 
wealth from the people who created it for the purpose of 
providing funding for a program that is supposed to benefit the 
people.  When we look at their enormous and unlimited powers we 
realize they could simply tax away any amount of wealth from us 
as they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest threat to the economic viability and stability of 
the family, of the business and of the individual is the 
unlimited power of governments to take away their wealth through 
the force of law, and that is what is happening.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all support the whole concept of an educational system, a 
health care system and all other priority systems which provide 
those things that people cannot provide for themselves such as a 
transportation system, a highway system and so on.  We are 
prepared to have our wealth taxed in order to provide for those 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when we see governments through the force of law taking 
that wealth from families and individuals to the point where they 
become impoverished, where they cannot make ends meet and their 
children are denied the necessities of life and have to live in 
poverty or without adequate housing, there is something wrong 
with the administration of power of those governments in taking 
the wealth away from the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the track record of who has done that to the most 
exorbitant and extreme degree.  If we want to look at extremism, 
we need go no further than to look at the manner in which our 
federal, provincial and municipal politicians have handled that 
power in terms of taking reasonable resources and rates of wealth 
from the people who create the wealth each year to fund programs 
the people want them to fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments have absolutely no right to tax money from people 
for programs which they think are in the best interest of the 
people without the judgment and the support of the people.  They 
have no right to simply take money and give it to individuals to 
hang dead rabbits from trees.  Although this is probably a rare 
example and fortunately does not happen too often, it does 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong when we get to the point where the 
government is taxing 50 cents of every dollar or 50% of the 
wealth of anyone making over $35,000 a year for the purpose of 
giving it back to people through programs.  There is no question 
why the poverty rate is rising.  That money is not being 
dispensed back to individuals according to the priorities of 
individual families, their children, the heads of the household 
and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the three levels of government.  If I had a 
choice as to who should be administering a government program I 
would pick the government with the best financial track record. 
That is the challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at Bill C-10 I ask myself if it alters my authority 
as a citizen of Canada to determine who is best at administering 
a social program or any other program and who can do it most cost 
effectively.  I look for the track record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a federal government with a $585 billion debt and with 
the highest levels of taxation in the history of the country.  We 
have provincial governments that have debts as well.  What does 
that mean?  It means that for years the politicians in charge, 
those who form the government, have overspent year after year 
after year.  They have had to borrow on top of the high rates of 
taxation and on top of all the wealth they have taken from the 
people each year.  They have overspent to the point where they 
have had to borrow again and again and again.  Finally this level 
of government got to the point where it was getting so great that 
almost 35 cents of every dollar went to pay the interest on the 
debt.

created the new wealth each year, in order to pay for the 
terrible mismanagement of our fiscal and monetary affairs over 
the past 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at that, some of us ought to hang our heads in 
shame.  Some of those who have gone before us in this House ought 
to hang their heads in shame that they have saddled our children 
and grandchildren with a debt so enormous that it may be a 
milestone around our neck when it comes to ever getting our taxes 
to a level where they ought to be, where not only can we afford 
priority programs such as health care, education, proper housing 
and so on, but where we could reduce taxes so that families do 
have the means to provide for their children and where we do not 
have one child in every five reported to be living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the track record to see who has used the power of 
taxation in the most reasonable and moderate way, there is no 
question who comes out first.  It is municipal governments.  Yes, 
they have legislation which states that they cannot go into debt 
and cannot deficit finance to the same extent that the provinces 
and the federal government can, but they can borrow money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked a councillor how they had resisted the temptation to 
find the loopholes, to go into debt and to build their empires 
like the two senior levels of government have done. In 
municipalities with larger cities that type of accountability is 
lost.  We do not meet people on the street the very next day 
after moving a spending resolution.  We do not find that in the 
larger cities like Toronto, Montreal, Calgary or Edmonton. One of 
the reasons these cities are in debt is that the degree of 
accountability is not there as it is in the lower levels of 
government.  What we have been seeking to introduce is a greater 
degree of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague who spoke before me referred to the election of a 
majority government as a four or five year dictatorship with no 
accountability.  That is what we have been facing.  That is why 
we have outrageous government programs that are not supported by 
the people.  Rather than praising the interests of the people, we 
have them holding their heads wondering why the governments are 
expending money in this way.  There is no accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accountability contained in a federal election every four or 
five years or a provincial election every four or five years is 
insufficient to keep governments from going into debt, from 
raising taxes, from overspending and from spending money in a 
manner that will not carry the judgment of the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see anything in the bill other than the maintenance of 
a lack of accountability.  In the minister's opinion, a payment 
can be made in whole or in part if it is his opinion to do so. If 
we have to rely on and have faith in the opinion of the minister 
what does that say about accountability?  What if he decides 
against the will of the people?  What if he chooses to say no to 
a municipality because in his opinion the payment is not due or 
it must be altered in terms of the amount or the size?  What do 
we do?  We cannot do anything.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have found that the most important issue pressing on the minds 
of the people is that our three levels of governments, through 
the force of law, have taken away so much wealth on a yearly and 
daily basis that it is placing our families and individuals in 
economic jeopardy.  We have cries from all parties when we see 
that happening.  We see farmers going bankrupt, families who are 
destitute, children who are homeless and a lack of housing.  Why? 
It is because they are not left sufficient resources to look 
after themselves, their children, their housing and the needs of 
their family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see is the opposite.  We see an unrestrained power to 
tax away the wealth of the people. If we do not stop it and roll 
it back then we will see the continuation of statistics 
reflecting child poverty.  When we talk about child poverty, we 
cannot talk about it without talking about family poverty. 
Children are not isolated.  They have their moms and dads, and 
their homes, whatever they might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we talking about child poverty?   We should be talking 
about poverty, period, in the country.  When children are in 
poverty their moms and dads are in poverty as well.  We have to 
strengthen the economic stability of those families.  I see 
nothing in the bill that will do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am always energized after meeting with municipal councillors 
and municipal governments in my constituency because they are 
hard-working, conscientious people who are in touch with their 
people.  They know their concerns.  They know who they have to 
get to when it comes to snow clearing and what areas will be 
blocked when a snow storm arrives.  They have hands-on 
information and they struggle with meagre means in order to 
provide some of the most essential services that their citizens 
need on a day to day basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the track record of our three levels of 
government, I am always enthused and given hope that if they can 
keep their spending under control at the municipal level and 
continue to do the good job they are doing, why can we not do it 
at the two senior levels of government.  The answer to that is 
that we can do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are spending about $106 billion on programs at the federal 
level.  If we could just maintain that level and use the money 
wisely, we could begin to leave more wealth in the 
municipalities.  The thing that disturbs me the most is that the 
federal and provincial tax money comes from the municipalities. 
It comes from the people who live in the towns, cities and rural 
areas.  They are the ones who create the wealth, the new wealth 
that is taxed each year.  That is where I believe the most 
complex programs of government should be administered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most complex services required by an individual, a child, 
are those that are provided within the home.  As one moves beyond 
the home, the first level of government should be the one that 
administers the most complex programs.  However, what we see in 
the country today is that it is turned upside down.  The most 
complex programs of government are administered at the provincial 
and federal levels by people hundreds if not thousands of miles 
away who really do not know those people and, in lots of cases 
because of that, really do not care.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see in the bill any relief from the concerns that I 
have seen in my riding in the level of government closest to the 
people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to compliment my colleague on his excellent speech.  As 
usual, he has made some very interesting points.  He and I have 
had many discussions on various issues.  I always welcome his 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker has been in the House longer than I have so 
I will ask him for his comments on this.  One of the things I 
noticed after I was elected was that municipal councillors wanted 
to meet with me regardless of their political affiliation.  One 
of the things that I have always respected about politics at the 
municipal level, at least where I come from, is that although 
there may be a political affiliation in terms of working for the 
greater good of the community, those tend to be put aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked with Conservative members of the city council, 
Liberal members of the city council and New Democrat members of 
the city council.  There are no Reform members on city council in 
my part of the world yet.  I know Reformers may work on that. I 
have been impressed with the ability to put aside partisan 
politics in the interest of particular projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that perhaps we in the House might do well at times to 
emulate what municipal councillors are able to do.  That was my 
experience with municipal councils.  I do not know if that was 
echoed by the previous speaker, but I would be interested in 
hearing his thoughts on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I often get asked that 
question when I visit my municipal councils.  I might add that we 
have lots of Reformers in my riding on those municipal councils 
and they are hard-working, down to earth people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be wonderful if the House could work like a 
municipal council where a problem could be identified and all 
parties brought to the table to determine the course of action 
and then allow a vote on that course of action and let the 
majority determine the course of action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could set aside in many cases the political partisanship 
that occupies the House much too often at times and simply work 
for the best interest of the people of the country, I think we 
could reduce the cost and stop many of the games that occur in 
the House.  I think we could begin to serve the people in a way 
that they would appreciate, which is not the way they are being 
served now in all too many areas where there is an identifiable 
need.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my hon. colleague for his great speech, but I have another 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government passes regulations and laws that affect 
municipalities without any regard for what they do to their 
bottom line.  It has recently come up with an idea for regulation 
to reduce the response time at airports.  In particular, in the 
city of Prince Albert it is going to make a couple of minutes 
difference in the time the fire department can get to the 
airport.  No one in Prince Albert, the council, the mayor, the 
people who run the airport and the people who use the airport, 
are concerned about it but the federal government makes this law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government have any plan in place to ensure that the 
city can afford the extra cost?  No.  It is to be passed on to 
consumers, the users, the airport shuts down, has limited use or 
something like that.  Does the federal government give a hoot? 
It does not seem to as yet, despite the fact that we have made 
some interventions.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out something else.  When there is a 
disagreement in the private sector about property values, how is 
it handled?  It is handled through a formal process with appeals. 
Once the appeals have been heard they are binding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it that way with the federal government?  Not at all.  The 
federal government operates strictly on its own.  It sets the 
rules.  It sets the rules for appeals and all the rest of it. 
Even when it finally decides on something through the municipal 
grants review committee the minister is not obliged to accept the 
recommendations given, so the municipalities feel that the 
process does not work in their favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn to the so-called Nisga'a final agreement 
and read from paragraph 7 on taxation and fiscal relations: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parties will negotiate and attempt to reach agreements in 
respect of grants, between them, in lieu of property taxes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we read all the way through the agreement we do not find 
that the federal government will simply enforce something on the 
Nisga'a people.  However, we do not see an appeal process. We do 
not see anything.  We see that it will sit down and attempt to 
reach an agreement.  Who will determine when an agreement has 
been reached?  It says in here that we will go through this every 
five years.  Paragraph 3 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every five years, or at other intervals if the Parties agree, the 
Parties will negotiate and attempt to reach agreement on a fiscal 
financing agreement by which funding will be provided— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We presume that will also include transfers and payments in lieu 
of taxes.  This agreement is very open ended.  In the case of the 
bill before us it is not even open ended.  It is closed.  The 
federal governments sets the limits, and that is as far as it 
goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is like my colleague 
said earlier, the golden rule is that he who has the gold sets 
the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Nisga'a follow the agreement and the federal government 
says that it disagrees with regard to the cost or the moneys they 
feel should be expended in these areas, what then do the Nisga'a 
do?  The government will have complied with the requirements of 
the agreement, but if all the power is left on the side of the 
government, for which the agreement allows, then what do the 
Nisga'a do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to what the government is doing in the 
municipalities with the airports and fire services provided, 
again the government is deciding what is best for the people 
without any negotiation.  It is imposing its will upon these 
people without consideration for the costs whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also receiving concerns in this regard from my 
municipality.  This is what is wrong with the federal level of 
government.  When it sets rules or passes bills, it does not 
consult sufficiently with the people upon whom they will impact, 
both in terms of effect and who will pay for them.  That is wrong 
and that is what is wrong with this level of government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am rising on behalf of the big bad government. Sitting 
here listening, I feel so mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about the way the government consults on how it 
sets the tax levels.  The policy initiatives in the bill say that 
we will develop the best practises for the valuation of special 
purpose federal properties.  We will seek stakeholder advice 
regarding appointments to and management of the dispute advisory 
panel.  We will commit to consulting assessment and taxation 
authorities wherever possible and whenever possible regarding the 
valuation of federal property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have consulted across the country.  As a former municipal 
politician I feel thoroughly consulted with.  I feel that the set 
up in the bill gives many recourses for expert advice on the 
setting of property tax.  This is not a great mystery.  Property 
tax is pretty fundamental from province to province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the initiatives are there.  I think we have addressed 
the hon. member's concerns.  Again, I am very sorry the Reform 
Party seems to be sour on everything.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when you put a piece of 
fruit in your mouth and it is sour, it is sour.  If we could all 
be reasonable people and negotiate on terms that are fair, it 
would be wonderful and it would work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who has the final say?  It is not the municipalities.  It is the 
federal government that has the final say.  We can negotiate and 
negotiate and negotiate but who has the final say?  It is not a 
level playing field.  It would be wonderful if the negotiations 
could occur with people who are fair minded.  Often that is not 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who makes the final decision?  The person who has the final say. 
In this case it is the federal government.  It has always been 
the federal government.  If that were not the case, why is it 
imposing regulations upon our municipal airports without 
consultation and leaving them with the cost?  That is exactly the 
same kind of scenario we see here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is supposed to negotiate but what if it does not? 
What if it simply imposes as it is imposing fire regulations at 
airports?  Municipalities are struggling with limited budgets. 
Because the federal and provincial governments are taking so much 
of the wealth out of the municipalities, there is very little 
left for them to tax and they have to pick up the cost.  That is 
why it is not working and that is why— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry but the 
hon. member's time expired some time ago. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am not too sure I can rise to the occasion as my good 
friend just did, but I too would like to raise some problems and 
to advise the government of some difficulties I see with the bill 
in some areas where I think it is somewhat negligent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told that the purpose of this act is to provide for a fair 
and equitable administration of payments in lieu of taxes.  That 
tells me that the government is under some obligation, whether 
through its own actions, in doing business or in providing for an 
authority with the ability to business such as an airport 
authority or a port corporation, to make payments in lieu of 
taxes or to provide to the municipality or to provincial 
government for expenses that may occur as a result of a 
particular business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the issue that has to do with the port 
authorities, in particular Vancouver port and Fraser port.  Both 
those ports are great contributors not only to the local economy 
of the Delta area in which part of the Vancouver port is located 
or of the Surrey area where the Surrey-Fraser docks are. They 
also have some properties in the municipality of Richmond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only that they have an impact on those municipalities, 
but they certainly impact on the province and the transportation 
routes maintained by the provincial government.  Their impact 
extends across the country.  They allow Canadian transportation 
facilitators, whether the Canadian National Railway, the Canadian 
Pacific Railway or trucking companies within Canada, to move 
goods from Vancouver port across the continent right down to the 
east coast and elsewhere into the heartland of the continent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That movement does not come without cost.  Unfortunately much of 
the cost of that accrues not to the federal government but to the 
province because it is responsible for providing highway 
transportation certainly to the municipalities adjacent to these 
ports.  The cost there can be huge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address the cost associated with providing a connecting 
route between Fraser port, whose main focus of operation is on 
the Fraser River in Surrey across from New Westminster and on 
Annasis Island, which is again in the same neighbourhood, and the 
port of Vancouver at Roberts Bank where a large container 
facility now exists. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That container facility was completed a little over two years 
ago when it came into operation.  The result is that truck 
traffic to the Vancouver port has increased tremendously.  It has 
gone from basically zero, as far as containers went, to where 
there are probably hundreds of truck movements a day in and out 
of the port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also rail car activity, moving containers on to the 
port property and away from it.  The result is a huge increase in 
traffic in the municipality of Delta.  As well, the connection to 
CN rail yards at the port of Mann and the CP rail yards at the 
port of Coquitlam are originating points for some of the train 
and container traffic that moves into the port of Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The burden in providing for the road link between these two port 
facilities falls directly on the municipality of Delta.  The 
roads that are in place were roads that were not designed for 
that purpose.  If we look at River Road in Delta, it is a local 
road.  It was designed as a local road to provide access for the 
local community to move along the south shore of the Fraser 
River.  It was not intended in any way as an interprovincial 
artery or an artery that would join two of the busiest ports in 
Canada.  I believe Vancouver port is the busiest in Canada, or 
close to it.  The Fraser port in its own right is a very busy 
port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we now have is day and night a continual line of heavy 
trucks moving through the area of North Delta where I live.  They 
are moving these large containers from the Fraser port and other 
truck facilities throughout the lower mainland and across Canada, 
through North Delta to Vancouver port at Roberts Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be difficult to imagine but I am talking about a road 
which is the normal width of a residential street.  Day in and 
day out large trucks move along that street.  The street is 
located at a height above the river.  If we look at the 
topography of the land in North Delta, as we approach the Alex 
Fraser Bridge the road goes up from a point at almost sea level 
on the dike to about 150 feet above sea level.  It is at the top 
of that hill that the road runs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the land is not exactly stable.  If we talk 
to residents who live along that road they tell us that over the 
last little while since this container activity has begun at 
Roberts Bank they are seeing cracks in the foundations of their 
houses.  All day long they can feel the pounding of the trucks 
going by.  They can actually feel that in their homes.  The 
homes, Mr. Speaker, are no farther away from the truck traffic 
than you are away from me, which is about 100 feet.  That is how 
close these large trucks are travelling to the homes in that 
residential area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is who is responsible for upgrading this arterial 
route through a residential neighbourhood.  Should it be the 
municipality?  The cost will be horrendous for whoever does it. 
To upgrade the road would require the purchase of many of the 
homes that line it to provide for additional width to the road 
bed.  In several areas the ground on which the road stands is not 
stable enough to allow for continued use without serious 
upgrading.  There would be a huge cost to do that.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The underlying question is would it be ethical and morally 
correct to upgrade the arterial traffic through this 
neighbourhood or would we simply ignore the residents and tell 
them their neighbourhood is going to have a four lane highway 
through it, an artery which is primarily dedicated to truck 
traffic plus a bit of local traffic?  Do we do that?  The answer 
many have reached is no, the current route through a residential 
neighbourhood is not the one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the alternatives that has been proposed is to go up 
through a gully which is a salmon bearing stream for coho salmon 
and whatnot and connect with the North Delta connector, the 
Nordel Way.  That road is an arterial road.  It is a busy road 
already without the addition of the truck traffic. Many would 
suggest it is not the chosen route either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chosen route by many would be to construct a new road along 
the river bank at the base of the hill.  At times the road would 
be mounted on pilings in the river.  It would be an elevated road 
in the river.  The question then is who will pay for it.  Should 
the municipality accept the burden of paying for the roadway, or 
should it be the province, or should it be the federal 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all boils down to whose facility the road is accommodating. 
It is not accommodating the interests of the local people.  Their 
interests are already well taken care of by the existing road 
network.  It services that residential area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should it be the province?  Is the province the only beneficiary 
of Vancouver port and Fraser port?  It is not.  The country as a 
whole benefits from the existence of these two ports.  Prairie 
grain is shipped through there.  Coal from the interior of 
British Columbia and elsewhere is shipped through the port at 
Roberts Bank.  Containers travel from across Canada and 
containers travel into the ports and then move across Canada. 
They are the goods that move through the municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefit accrues not only to the local people.  Our 
involvement is probably less than most.  The involvement here is 
one that benefits everybody, the local people insofar as jobs are 
provided, the province because of the taxes that accrue from the 
port, and the country as a whole because Vancouver port provides 
a gateway to the world for goods both exiting Canada or entering 
from afar.  From coast to coast, we all benefit from Vancouver 
port. It would seem to me that if we all benefit then to a 
certain extent we all should pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill talks about payments in lieu of taxes.  Somehow the 
government itself is the final arbitrator on the level of benefit 
that should accrue to a municipality.  I think we are 
shortchanged.  The local people are not being given the kind of 
access to federal money that they should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An outside arbiter or a neutral arbiter should look at the 
impact of these registered federal facilities.  The arbiter 
should say what their impact is on local communities and what 
type of tax revenue should accrue to local municipalities and to 
provincial governments, given the impact the federal facilities 
have on the local people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see that happening. I think it is a weakness in the 
bill.  I have written to the federal Minister of Transport on the 
issue of a connecting route between these two ports and a 
connecting route really between Vancouver port and the rest of 
North America.  That traffic should not in any way shape or form 
be traversing a residential neighbourhood.  It is dangerous and 
destructive to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a danger in moving many of these goods.  Certainly, 
local emergency officials have no idea what types of goods are 
being transported through that residential neighbourhood and 
accidents do happen.  As that traffic increases, the chances of a 
serious accident are even more possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at this bill, I would certainly like to see the 
government address the issue of giving municipal and provincial 
governments a better hearing, a hearing that would be more 
independent than the kind that has been proposed by the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often we think of government services as benign or merely 
helpful to the local community.  People may think of a post 
office in a downtown core.  They may think of other government 
offices that do not really have an impact on the environment and 
may be a benefit in that they draw people to a commercial 
district.  When I look at the bill, I think of government 
entities which have a huge impact on the environment and which 
affect the quality of life many of us enjoy.  I do not see that 
being protected in the bill. That is a serious shortcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other issues in this bill that are worth 
mentioning.  I will briefly mention three items which I think are 
worthy of note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is that the minister and crown agencies maintain too 
much discretionary power.  I addressed that issue.  I underline 
that we certainly believe that is the case.  A neutral arbitrator 
should be addressing these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is that recommendations of the dispute advisory 
panel are non-binding.  It merely maintains the status quo and 
entrenches into legislation common practices that were put in 
place 16 years ago.  The bill is not an improvement in this area. 
It merely confirms the status quo and does not do anything to 
address the problems I have mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third item we are concerned about is that the Royal Canadian 
Mint, Canada Post Corporation and Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation should be added to schedule IV in order that they may 
be eligible to make business occupancy payments in lieu of taxes. 
That is fairly self-explanatory.  These corporations are 
currently excluded from coverage in schedule IV.  We think they 
should be brought into the fold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On those issues, we hope that the government would see fit to 
amend the bill to address these shortcomings.  We think it is 
only reasonable.  I know my constituents who are living along 
that artery or river road would appreciate it if the government 
would see fit to accept some responsibility for the increased 
traffic through a residential neighbourhood that has resulted as 
a consequence of the development, if I may say a very positive 
development, of the Vancouver Port Corporation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am not being facetious when I say I found the rather lengthy 
discussion of the road quite interesting.  I come from an area 
where a huge facility previously owned by the federal government 
and now managed locally, the Pearson airport, causes the same 
concerns among the residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a taxation bill.  The hon. member talked about 
environmental concerns and the impact on property values.  I 
would very seriously like to hear what recommendations the hon. 
member would make strictly in the area of taxation to address his 
concern about that road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate that 
question.  I think the hon. member recognizes that we share a 
problem, one which many of us share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have an immediate solution. We have to look at when 
there are government facilities, facilities licensed by or 
registered with the federal government such as airports and 
ports, there has to be some recognition that they have a huge 
impact, and at times a negative impact, on our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Great revenues accrue from these types of facilities and we all 
benefit from these types of facilities. Certainly I benefit from 
the airport in Toronto.  I live in Vancouver but I travel through 
there.  I use it and I am a beneficiary.  But in saying that, we 
have to recognize that it does have an impact on local people. 
The quality of their lives is impacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the situation I described the impact has just come into play, 
and has magnified in the last two years by the development of the 
new container service at Vancouver port's Roberts Bank facility. 
Neighbourhoods which had experienced a fair amount of through 
traffic but limited truck traffic are now subject to an ongoing 
barrage of trucks, convoys of trucks, day in and day out, 
basically 24 hours a day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow or another we have to come to grips with that because 
this port is one which benefits everybody.  It not only benefits 
the people who live in Delta, but the benefit is enjoyed by all 
Canadians.  It brings great wealth into the country.  We have to 
recognize that the lives of many people have been impacted. We 
have to look at ways of extracting revenue from the port to try 
to compensate those people whose lives have been negatively 
impacted by the port. It is only fair and just.  I do not see it 
as a great imposition on the port or the government to do that; I 
see it as an obligation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-227, an act to establish a National 
Organ Donor Registry and to co-ordinate and promote organ 
donation throughout Canada, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, Bill C-227 seeks to create an act to 
establish a National Organ Donor Registry to promote organ 
donation throughout Canada.  The objective of Bill C-227 is to 
provide the means to increase the amount of available organs in 
Canada for the purpose of transplantation through organ 
acquisition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national organ donor registry would allow people to register 
legal consent for organ donations and would subsequently lead to 
an increase in Canada's low rate of donations.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must establish a system to support high levels of organ 
donation in Canada.  We have the opportunity to store or provide 
a link between information on organ donors from participating 
provinces.  Information will be maintained in an efficient form 
for the purposes of identifying intended or potential organ 
donors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the report of the Standing Committee on Health 
released in April 1999, entitled “Organ and Tissue Donation and 
Transplantation:  A Canadian Approach”, Canada is currently 
facing a serious situation with respect to organ and tissue 
donation and transplantation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present organ donor rate is unacceptable.  Organ donation 
must be made an issue of national importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national registry would provide an efficient means to allow 
available organs to be matched with waiting recipients.  This 
co-ordinated effort would ultimately reduce the current waiting 
time for a match.  As it now stands, one-third of individuals who 
wait for an organ transplant die as they wait for a matching 
donor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lives will be saved with the establishment of an organized and 
efficient national organ donor registry.  It will be possible to 
co-ordinate the supply and demand of available organs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The widening gap between the organs available and the number of 
Canadians in need of them highlights the void that we will 
continue to have without a national organ donor registry.  The 
problem is that there is no national system to ensure that usable 
organs are used and matched to those in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The annual number of patients waiting for an organ replacement 
grows faster than the number of transplants being performed each 
year.  Potential organ donors are lost because we lack a clear, 
organized and simple system in Canada.  Laws need to follow 
rather than lead the issues that require a legislative response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national organ donor registry would provide the means to 
prevent the deaths of a third of all people who wait for an organ 
transplant now.  The very success of transplants clearly depends 
on every effort that is made to increase the number of available 
donors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is becoming increasingly aware of the vast potential 
of organ transplantation.  Public awareness is the key to 
tackling the issue of transplant shortages in this country.  The 
first week of April is now designated as National Organ Donor 
Week.  Public awareness of the importance of organ donation 
continues as April 18 to April 25 now marks National Organ Donor 
Awareness Week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem only logical to have people's organ compatibility 
levels easily accessible in a national database so that matches 
could be made in seconds once the organs become available.  The 
price of a human life is worth the time needed to organize a 
national co-ordinating organ donor system, as opposed to the many 
lives that are now lost without it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success rate for transplantation is worth noting.  After one 
year, both liver and kidney transplant recipients enjoy a very 
high rate of survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent figures indicate that the current rate of organ 
donations in this country remains at a standstill of 14.8 organs 
available per million, as opposed to 21 organs per million in the 
United States.  A national organ donor registry would help 
reverse the critical shortage of donated organs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has one of the lowest donor rates among western 
industrialized countries.  Organ donations need to be on the 
public agenda simply because the situation is at a crisis level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national registry would enable provinces to share information 
about prospective donors.  The ability to provide donor data when 
required by a hospital is crucial to the success of any registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary purpose for the establishment of an organ donor 
registry is for donor identification.  Donor identification is 
effective only if there is a system for linking the potential 
donor to a potential recipient.  There are three different types 
of donors.  They include the following:  intended donors, 
potential donors and actual donors. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT91"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT91"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1735

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An intended donor is an individual who has expressed the desire 
or intention to become a donor upon death, or when appropriate 
during life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A potential donor is an individual who has been identified 
within the health care facility as being appropriate for the 
purpose of being an organ or tissue donor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, an actual donor is an individual from whom at least one 
organ or tissue has been procured, allocated and transplanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Potential organ donors must satisfy brain death criteria before 
they can be deemed suitable for donation.  Brain death is the 
irreversible ending of all brain functions, including that of the 
brain stem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Canadian Medical Association, the whole brain 
must be dead in order for the patient's organs to be harvested. 
After brain death has been declared there is no hope.  It is time 
to let go and give hope to someone else.  The pronouncement of 
brain death is never made by a physician who has anything to do 
with the transplant process.  Death is not prematurely announced 
in order for the patient to become an organ donor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to find a workable plan to address the very real lack of 
available organs in the country.  We need one central database, 
or linked databases, which will allow Canadians the opportunity 
to register their choice about organ donations in a legally 
enforceable manner.  Lifesaving information should be available 
to those in the health care profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Securing organ donations is a community responsibility.  Now is 
the time to rethink our approach to organ donation.  Social 
awareness of the need to make a conscious and deliberate choice 
to donate one's organs at the time of death brings us to the 
point where we can acknowledge the importance of a national organ 
donor registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a national program that will co-ordinate well with 
participating provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British Columbia Transplant Society is a provincially funded 
health organization that supports the needs of transplant 
patients and families.  The British Columbia Transplant Society 
directs, delivers or contracts for all organ transplants within 
the province and sets standards on quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spring of 1997, the British Columbia Transplant Society 
tested a new and significant program to help increase the 
effectiveness of organ donation in Canada.  The program is called 
the organ donor registry.  This provincial registry includes a 
computerized database that records the wishes of organ donors in 
B.C.  Since the creation of the British Columbia Transplant 
Society the number of organ transplants performed annually has 
increased by more than 400%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The multiple organ retrieval and exchange program of Ontario, 
founded by the ministry of health, was developed as the central 
registry of organ donors and recipients for Ontario to facilitate 
the equitable distribution of transplant organs in the province. 
Potential recipients, once registered and listed on the system, 
are eligible for the fast, efficient and equitable allocation of 
organ donors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian organ replacement register includes data and 
analysis of kidney dialysis, organ donation and transplantation 
activities in Canada.  The Canadian organ replacement register 
provides information on the level of activity and outcomes of 
dialysis in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian organ replacement register is managed by the 
Canadian Institute for Health Information.  More Canadians are 
waiting for organ transplants and the numbers are rising 
annually, with kidneys in the greatest demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best treatment replacing dialysis is a kidney transplant. 
The shortage of organ donations causes patients to be left on 
dialysis, which remains very costly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to gather our resources to turn the desire to live into 
a realistic goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because there are millions of people in Canada, the chances of 
finding an organ donor and recipient who are chemically 
compatible are significantly reasonable. 
However, testing for compatibility takes time.  Minutes are 
critical when deciding where to transport the newly acquired 
organ.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many as one-third of the potential donors remain unidentified 
or poorly managed.  Another third is lost due to family or 
coroner refusal.  The actual number of donors is only one-third 
of the potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about removing obstacles and creating a venue for 
change.  Donors ensure a future for those in need of 
transplantation by providing the option for a longer life.  There 
is an increasing demand for organ transplantation as the medical 
procedure maintains a high level of success.  This demand has not 
been met due to the shortage of available organs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The critical shortage of organs and tissues remains the most 
important challenge for health care professionals.  The presence 
of a national organ and tissue sharing system would help to 
ensure safe, equitable and efficient transplantation in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see the positive effects of successful organ 
transplantation in our everyday lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Transplant Games Association is a non-profit 
organization of transplant athletes and others committed to 
positively influencing public attitudes toward organ donation and 
motivating transplant recipients to maintain a healthy lifestyle 
by holding athletic events.  Public awareness and community 
involvement can combine to offer help to needy recipients. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to compliment the member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam for bringing this bill to the 
House.  As he mentioned, it is a very important issue and one of 
the silent tragedies that has been occurring in our country for 
quite a long time.  This problem existed at the time I was 
training to be a physician in the 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a very long time we have had constructive solutions to deal 
with the issue of organ donation.  Yet, while there has been 
widespread agreement on solutions, there has been a lack of 
action.  We have seen the cycle go round and round.  Solutions 
are proffered, agreements are made and yet we fall back to square 
one with nothing being done.  No one takes the good ideas and 
puts them into action.  That is why I welcome the member's bill. 
I hope it will be the catalyst that will finally push the 
minister and the government to act on the plethora of good 
solutions they have in their laps today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a nation we have one of the worst organ donor rates in the 
entire developed world.  In fact, it is only about 12.1 per 
million.  To put that into context, in the best circumstances 
there are about 36 per million in parts of the U.S. and Spain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would attribute our inaction on this issue to downright 
neglect.  It is not an academic exercise.  Of the more than 3,000 
people who today sit on waiting lists, 150 or more of them will 
die needlessly.  If there were a bus accident, a train crash or a 
plane crash and 150 people died, a national inquiry or a royal 
commission would be held immediately.  In no short order 
solutions would be put forth and implemented.  But because this 
issue is like a slow bleed which kills people over time it tends 
to be swept under the carpet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those people who are waiting for organs, for their families 
and loved ones who are watching them suffer, it is a painful 
existence. It is all the more painful because something could be 
done about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something has been done about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member knows, in 1997 a motion was passed in the House of 
Commons detailing five points that would enable us to revamp the 
organ donor system in the country.  It was supported by all 
members of the House and passed unanimously.  It gave the 
minister a succinct plan of action which he could have 
implemented in 1997 and it would have had widespread acceptance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to that time the federal government and the provinces got 
together and agreed on a 13 point plan to revamp the organ donor 
system in our country.  All provinces, including the province of 
Quebec, agreed to the national plan.  The provinces were working 
with the federal government to do something for the public good. 
We were working as one. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those solutions were again put on the back burner.  In 1997, 
when I inquired about what was happening to these good solutions, 
I found that people were just sitting on their hands and nothing 
was happening while Canadians suffered and died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I worked with the Minister of Health and, to his credit, 
he showed a great deal of interest in the issue.  Through motions 
and procedures in the Standing Committee on Health, I and the 
Minister of Health asked the committee to study it. The committee 
worked together beautifully and heard fantastic testimony from 
people around the country and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the context of the testimony was a series of solutions 
and ideas that would give Canada the best organ donor system in 
the entire world in my view.  In spite of the fact that we worked 
very well together, the final majority report, which had 
government stamped right on it, was a piece of pabulum. It was a 
piece of bureaucrat-speak.  It did not do justice to the 
solutions that were put forth at that committee for this year, 
nor did it do justice to the well-meaning people who came before 
the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, all of us in the opposition put forth minority 
reports, not because we wanted to but because the government 
majority report was so lacking in direction, in specifics and in 
a plan of action that all of us felt compelled to put forth a 
plan of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following is a plan of action that incorporates what the 
good member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam has put 
forth. It involves the following points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we should have a national organ donor registry that 
involves both potential organs and potential donors, which in and 
of itself will not solve the problems.  We need something else. 
We need a chance to be organ donors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, on every patient's chart across the country, we should 
have a form asking people to be organ donors.  When people go to 
their family doctor, the doctor will ask whether they want to be 
organ donors.  If they agree to be donors, the doctor will give 
them a form and they can ask questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The form must have two things:  first, a request to be a donor, 
and second, but equally important, a question asking if they have 
communicated their wishes to a loved one.  The reason for this is 
very important.  If people do not communicate their wishes to 
their loved ones about whether or not they want to be a donor, 
then their wishes will be respected only half the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event of the untimely death of a person who chooses to be 
a donor, half the time the family will override the wishes of 
their loved one.  However, if people tell their families what 
they want to do regardless of their feelings, 96% of the time 
they will honour their loved one's wish to give the gift of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we need organ donor co-ordinators in every hospital in 
the country.   It can be an existing staff person with extra 
training who can seek permission for organ extraction from family 
members in times of bereavement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, when a hospital is involved in procuring organs from a 
person who has died, it should receive money for the costs 
incurred in extracting the organs from that person.  It is costly 
because it involves time in the intensive care unit and it 
involves personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those four points are followed, we will have the best organ 
donor system in the country.  I plead with the Minister of Health 
not to wait any longer.  It took the Minister of Health months to 
respond to the health care committee, and during the course of 
that month, in October, roughly 66 people died in the country 
while waiting for the minister to respond.  That is not 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On cold, hard, economic grounds, if we remove the obvious 
humanitarian reasons for pursuing this course, the cost savings 
to the health care system are quite extensive.  For example, it 
costs $50,000 to $60,000 per year for somebody to be on dialysis. 
It costs about that much to have a kidney transplant. 
Over the course of five years, the health care system would save 
$200,000 on every patient it dialyzed.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must look into the future, into the crystal ball as we all 
get older.  As the incidence of diabetes increases in certain 
populations and in the population as a whole, the demands on 
dialysis systems will increase dramatically.  We must act now in 
a proactive way to give these people on dialysis the kidneys they 
need in order to prevent further tragedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that we are going to somehow procure kidneys from 
people who are not dead.  The people we get organs from are dead. 
For every organ donor who dies, five lives are saved.  I 
compliment the families of the people who, through their untimely 
deaths, have made the ultimate sacrifice.  Through their 
extraordinary generosity, they have given of themselves to give 
other people a new lease on life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make a plea to the public:  If you want to be an organ donor, 
please sign your card and communicate your wishes to your loved 
ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead with the Minister of Health to support this bill, to 
support the motion I put forth which passed in this House, to 
support the work the committee did and to support the opposition 
members' solutions.  Within that bundle of solutions are the best 
solutions to save Canadian lives.  We need it and we need it now 
for the failure to act will only cost more people's lives.

want to begin by congratulating the hon. member on his bill.  We 
are pleased to support the principle.  Even if it will not be 
votable, we believe it is an excellent opportunity for 
parliamentarians to reflect on and support such a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting to the main thrust of the subject, I will take 
the liberty of being out of order for 30 seconds in order to 
keep a promise I have made relating to the 30th birthday of my 
colleague from Longueuil.  On behalf of her husband Stéphane and 
her son Étienne, I wish her happy birthday from us all, for 
everyone knows that turning 30 is an important milestone in 
life. I am sure my colleagues join me in these wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the bill, I repeat that we are pleased to support the 
principle, and I believe that there are a number of things that 
have to be said.  First of all, unlike blood donations, organ 
donations are unfortunately not much of a part of Canadian 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Reform Party colleague reminded us earlier of the 
statistics: 12 per million, as compared to 36 per million in the 
United States.  We realize that campaigns are necessary in order 
to raise awareness, and this is a collective responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, it is our duty to show the way, to say that 
there are certain things that can be done. 
The first thing to do is to remind ourselves and our 
acquaintances to become potential donors. Indeed, we can only 
become actual donors by first being potential donors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support any measure to help co-ordinate such an initiative. Of 
course, such measures cannot be coercive, cannot be binding on 
the provinces. I think that the wording of the hon. member's 
bill is appropriate. Clause 6 provides that the registrar shall 
endeavour to ensure that the provinces participate in a number 
of co-ordinating measures. This takes us to the very unfair and 
incongruous situation of each of Quebec's regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that a country as large as Canada—which, as we all 
know, includes two nations—only has 28 hospitals that do full 
grafts and organ or tissue transplants, it is appropriate to 
take a closer look at the services being provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two provinces that provide full organ or tissue transplants 
are of course Quebec and Ontario. There are 11 institutions in 
Quebec and 8 in Ontario that provide such services. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia only has two such institutions, and that province 
serves all of Atlantic Canada. Prince Edward Island and New 
Brunswick do not have any hospitals that do organ or tissue 
transplants. In Manitoba, there is only one hospital providing 
that service, and the same goes for Saskatchewan. In the case of 
Alberta and British Columbia, there are three such institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These services are still very limited and there is a need 
for information. We must urge stakeholders in the health care 
sector to do their share, because this is a responsibility that 
falls primarily to doctors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be very interesting if doctors could find some delicate 
way—because a hospital setting is not always conducive to this 
kind of thinking—to ensure that potential donors are not lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be a good thing if doctors were encouraged to 
consider this possibility with patients who, of course, are 
often terminal, who have arrived, or are arriving at the final 
stage of their life.  It is very important that we be able to 
impress on people how compassionate and generous an act this is, 
and how society as a whole will be the better for it.  The 
extension of life and the improvement of individuals' quality of 
life lie behind the reality of organ donation, but there is also 
an economic reality. 
I think one of our colleagues made this point earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of kidney disease, for instance, it would be much 
more economical for society to encourage organ donation than to 
continue to do dialysis, with all the equipment that entails. 
It has often been estimated that the cost could be as much as 
five times higher.  In other words, it costs society five times 
as much to continue with and promote dialysis as it does to 
promote organ donation. That is the point we are making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to take up more time than necessary, but I commend 
the hon. member's sensitivity in introducing his bill.  Let us 
hope that, even if it is not votable, the government will act 
very quickly on the parliamentary committee's report. 
I want those who are listening to us—I realize that we are not 
normally allowed to use documents, but I am counting on the full 
co-operation of the House in this regard—to know that a 
parliamentary committee addressed this issue and tabled its 
report in April 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report was prepared by parliamentarians, with one member 
from each party represented in the House working on it. I would 
say that, on the substance, the committee was unanimous. 
There were dissenting reports with regard to the form because 
some thought the proposed measures did not go far enough, but 
everyone agreed on the principle of establishing a national 
registry and co-ordinating efforts to ensure that, wherever we 
live, be it Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario or 
the Maritimes, someone is keeping track of how many organs are 
available for those who need them, and there is a need to 
quickly identify potential donors so that they are not lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report, which was tabled in April 1999 as I indicated 
earlier, called on the government to take prompt measures and 
contained about 20 recommendations. Again, I believe there was a 
consensus on the principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we support the bill introduced by our colleague and 
commend him for his initiative. I hope the government will 
follow this bill up with implementation measures.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in this debate 
and to join with others in the House who have indicated their 
support for Bill C-227.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too want to congratulate the member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam for bringing this matter before 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very outset I want to indicate our strong support for 
this bill.  Why do I support the bill?  Why do my colleagues in 
the New Democratic Party support the bill?  Why do all members in 
the opposition parties support the bill?  It calls for something 
that was recommended to the member's government many months ago. 
It was the logical step required by the government to deal with a 
very critical situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders, if this bill had been votable, where the Liberal 
members would have stood.  Would they support this bill given the 
past record, the agony, the kind of deliberations and intensive 
study all of us have been through over the last six months to a 
year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill calls for a national organ donor registry.  It is 
something that was recommended by many witnesses before the 
health committee, which went through six months of deliberations. 
That idea was supported by every opposition party in the House 
yet it was vetoed, wiped out, stamped out by the Liberal majority 
on the health committee.  The question we all have today is why? 
Can the member who has brought forward this bill not make a 
difference in terms of his own caucus and get through to the 
Minister of Health to put this item on the agenda today?  Why do 
we have to continually wait and debate something on which there 
is a clear consensus and an absolute need? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you will sense the frustration of opposition 
members around this bill.  It is not because we do not support 
the idea.  It is because we know that this idea could have been 
implemented at least six months ago when the Standing Committee 
on Health completed its deliberations following six months of 
studying the matter.  We express frustration today because there 
are models the government could have used to implement such a 
strategy which are already in the works in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to the B.C. NDP government's registry. Other 
governments are looking at this as a model. The Yukon government 
feels very strongly about adopting something similar. I am sure 
provincial and territorial governments right across the country 
would only be too pleased to join in the creation of such a 
registry, except that we do not have a federal government that is 
prepared to show some leadership, put some money on the table, 
show some political will and get this thing moving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca also deserves some 
credit for advancing the public and political agenda on this 
matter.  His private member's motion got the ball rolling.  It 
could have been acted on very quickly, but the Liberal government 
decided it needed to keep the health committee busy reviewing the 
same studies that have made the same recommendations for the last 
number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of us regret the time we spent talking to witnesses and 
discussing the important issues around organ donation and 
transplantation.  However, we all thought that when that process 
was over we would at least march forward with a clear plan of 
action.  Fundamental to that plan of action was a national donor 
registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to mention the work of the Reform Party's health critic 
in this area. Again I express regrets over the inaction of the 
federal government on this very important matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the stats over and over again. Canada has one of 
the lowest donor rates in the western industrial world.  Our rate 
of donation is about 14.5 donors per million. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  It is 12.1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B> The Reform member has corrected 
me.  It is only 12.1 donors per million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That rate of donation is appallingly low.  The rate could be 
much higher if we had a government that was prepared to work with 
Canadians and provincial governments to advance a workable, 
reasonable strategy to encourage Canadians to indicate their 
wishes at an early opportunity, and to ensure there is a 
mechanism to follow through on the wishes of the donor and the 
donor's family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the situation?  The Liberals are treading water while 
our need for organ donation is growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform health critic mentioned the situation with respect to 
dialysis.  Figures released this summer by the Canadian Institute 
for Health Information show that we are headed toward a crisis in 
kidney dialysis unless some relief is forthcoming from organ 
donation. Dialysis needs increased by 14% in one year between 
1996 and 1997.  What does that cost?  It costs $50,000 per year 
to maintain each patient.  The number of patients is at 12,000 
and is rising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at this from the human point of view and talk about 
the stress on individuals and families who are waiting for organ 
donations.  We can talk about the unnecessary deaths that occur 
because this country does not have a good system for encouraging 
organ donations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that does not work for the government, at least look at the 
costs.  Look at the economic factors.  Look at the financial 
burden this is creating for our society today, at the very time 
when we should be trying like we have never tried before to 
ensure efficiencies in our health care system so that we can do 
everything we can to preserve our universal health care model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public will support it.  We heard the witnesses before our 
committee.  We heard Canadians everywhere say that they are 
supportive of a system to increase the rate of donations.  They 
cannot do it by themselves.  We need a system that ensures we can 
implement the recommendations of the studies we have heard time 
and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is preventing us from moving ahead?  Why are we debating 
this again in the House?  It is undeniably the Liberal 
government's unfathomable reluctance to act.  If it was 
consciously trying to stall, it could not be moving any slower. 
I hope the member will take that message back to his caucus, to 
the cabinet and to the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us submitted minority reports in response to the health 
committee's final report on organ donation.  Why?  Because it was 
missing a very important central element:  a national organ donor 
registry.  Thank goodness it is before us again today. We can 
keep the debate going, but we still come back to the question of 
why we have to debate it.  Why was it not already in place, up 
and running and working? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this country does not have a national organ donor registry 
and there is not a meaningful system to encourage donations and 
ensure we can meet the demand, the human costs are unbearable. 
People die.  Families suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, we are also creating a climate for xeno 
transplantation to take hold.  It could go forward without any 
kind of public debate or consultation, without any kind of 
regulatory framework, without any ethical considerations being 
given to the whole question of using animal organs to deal with 
human needs for organ transplantation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Department officials told the health committee that xeno 
transplantation was not taking place in Canada. That was in 
February 1999.  What did we find out after that? That animal 
transplants were actually taking place in hospitals in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An article came out this past summer in <I>This</I> magazine.  It 
showed that transplantations using animal organs in humans were 
done as far back as 1994 in Montreal.  It was done again in 1997, 
and there was a third case in 1997.  All three were done at the 
Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal.  This government says it 
does not have a clue that anything is going on and there is no 
plan in place to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given those factors, the time to act is now.  I hope we can get 
on with the task at hand and ensure that we move forward with a 
national organ donor registry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, this debate really should not have to take place and if 
you have listened carefully as I have to everyone who has spoken 
this evening on the private member's bill, there is nothing new 
here at all.  The government has simply failed to act. I think 
the NDP member articulated that very well.  The Liberals know 
what they have to do or should do, but they will not do it. Why? 
For the love of me, I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's point of referring this to the member whose 
bill we are actually debating is a good point.  He should go back 
to his caucus, go back to the Prime Minister and the cabinet and 
impress upon them the importance of moving forward on a national 
donor registry and transplant system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard it all before. There is unanimous consent in the 
House on the issue.  A little over two years ago the member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca put forward Motion No. 222 to that 
effect.  It was unanimously agreed upon by the House.  I will 
read it word for word. and I hope the member whose bill we are 
debating takes this back to the Prime Minister tomorrow morning 
when the Liberals have their caucus meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By unanimous consent, it was resolved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in the opinion of this House, the government should: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) implement a national real time database linking all health 
care facilities involved in transplantation and transplantable 
tissue procurement, and listing all potential organ transplant 
recipients and available transplantable tissue; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) implement a national mandated choice strategy for tissue 
donation through a mechanism such as the federal income tax 
return or the census; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) remove all financial disincentives that presently exist for 
health care facilities involved in transplantable tissue 
procurement; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) bring in legislation in order to protect the rights and 
wishes of those who, upon declaration of brain death diagnosis, 
have previously consented to donate their organs. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who authored that motion is here listening intently 
as I knew he would be.  The government, in typical government 
fashion, referred it to the standing committee.  As the NDP 
member mentioned we had hearings that lasted about six months. We 
came up with a report of around 100 pages, in both official 
languages, on what the committee thought should happen.  The 
committee was driven somewhat by the government.  It was another 
foot dragging exercise.  We could see that in the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was nothing new or startling in the report.  We had a 
sense that the minister was directing the outcome. That is not 
unusual.  What we did, and I say we, is that a minority 
opposition report was authored by the Reform Party.  I am quite 
pleased to point out that I signed on to this and I will read the 
notation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, the members of the Reform Party of Canada and Mr. Greg 
Thompson of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, 
respectfully submit this official opposition report in response 
to the Standing Committee on Health's study on organ and tissue 
donation in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were five of us on the committee who signed that.  There 
was the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, the member for Surrey 
Central, the member for Nanaimo—Cowichan and myself, the member 
for New Brunswick Southwest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I have the time, I want to go through some of the points we 
made.  Some of them were articulated by the government member 
whose bill we are discussing and the opposition members who 
talked in detail on the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His bill includes some of what we were talking about in that 
minority report.  I do not think his goes quite far enough.  This 
is what the government should be doing, as articulated in that 
minority report.  Let us step through them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling for more immediate action.  I was talking about 
the foot dragging on the part of the government.  We want 
immediate action.  As I said earlier this evening, we should not 
have to debate this matter.  It has been debated over and over 
again.  No one disagrees, particularly the Canadian public whom 
we are attempting to serve in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling for immediate action to create two national 
registries.  The first would be a real time national waiting list 
of potential recipients and the second would be a real time 
national waiting list of intended donors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be mandatory reporting of all brain deaths to the 
national organ transplant co-ordinator.  This would facilitate 
quicker identification of people willing to donate and of the 
suitability of donations.  It would also link donors to patients 
more quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would identify and educate hospital staff and separate the 
medical professionals who treat the deceased patient and those 
approaching the surviving family members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would increase opportunities to become an organ donor, such 
as a form sent once a year to doctors' offices, for example.  We 
are saying that the form should contain three parts:  first, an 
explanation of organ donation; second, a request to be an 
intended donor; and third, a request that potential donors 
discuss their wishes with loved ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funds should be available from shared federal, provincial and 
territorial contributions.  The money should be targeted for 
organ transplantation.  Recipients of organs should be able to 
meet the families of the donor if both parties are in agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last one is very important.  It does not sound like much, 
but it is recognition.  A medal should be awarded to the donors 
or their families by the governor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have been reminded in the House tonight, an average of 150 
Canadians die every year waiting for organ transplants.  I would 
say that number is smaller than it would be if we actually had a 
databank and we could exchange or share information the way we 
should be able to.  We do not and we cannot.  I think that number 
is very small compared to what is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am on my feet I want to point out that I am a transplant 
recipient.  I was very fortunate because in my case it was bone 
marrow and it was not as difficult to find a donor.  I could be 
my own donor.  Because of medical technology and the advances of 
medical science I was able to donate my own bone marrow after it 
was purified, for lack of a better expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should think of the hundreds of Canadians who are waiting for 
the same type of transplant procedure and there is no one there 
to help them out.  The sad part is that they are there, but there 
is no way to hook them up or connect them up.  We know it can 
work if we want to invest the time and the technology into that 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Truly I would not be here if that procedure had not taken place. 
I was very fortunate because I could be my own donor and not all 
recipients are that fortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come and the message is pretty clear from all sides 
of the House that we want action on the part of the government. 
It has derailed, stalled, and thrown up every obstacle it could 
to keep the issue from moving forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying that regrettably this is not a 
votable motion, but we support the hon. member's initiative. We 
want the government to listen.  The message coming out of the 
House tonight is that we want action and we want it now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to have the 
floor for five minutes to speak on Bill C-227. I want to thank 
the hon. member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam for 
bringing the issue of organ and human tissue donations to the 
attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member will remember that, last year, the health 
minister asked the Standing Committee on Health to consider this 
issue. The minister was right to rely on the committee, given 
that it heard hundreds of witnesses. We in the government do not 
consider that consulting witnesses and listening to the people 
is a waste of time, contrary to what some of the opposition 
members said earlier. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During these consultations two main points consistently 
surfaced: the need for a central co-ordinating and facilitating 
body to bring together elements across jurisdictions and the need 
for greater public education and awareness of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the government endorses the principle of Bill C-227 
and approves its global purpose to improve co-ordination and 
education in order to increase organ and tissue donation rates in 
Canada which are much too weak.  We also agree that Canadians 
should have easier and better opportunities to indicate their 
wish to be potential organ donors and that medical professionals 
have access to this information. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, Bill C-227 urges the federal government to act by 
establishing first and foremost a national organ donor registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House that some witnesses told the 
committee that Canada needs this kind of database. Others argued 
however that this may not be the most efficient way to address 
the issue. They cited the example of Great Britain and Spain. 
Even without a national registry, Spain has a much higher rate 
of real organ donations than Canada does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Great Britain set up such a registry that has not been very 
successful. The registration level has dropped over the last few 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, provinces like BC and Nova Scotia already have 
registries while others, like Quebec and Ontario, are looking 
into it. The Standing Committee on Health took notice of the 
work done by provincial governments. In its report, it 
recognized that provincial and territorial governments have many 
good tools at their disposal to encourage larger numbers of 
people to become donors. Considering what the provinces are 
already doing, the committee did not believe that establishing a 
national registry along the lines of the bill was a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As early as mid-April, the Standing Committee on Health 
recommended greater co-operation between all partners: the 
federal government, the provinces, the territories, the care 
givers and the health care institutions. The government chose to 
rely on co-operation and has made headway. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been and will continue to work closely with the 
provinces and other stakeholders to develop a new approach to 
organ donation.  This will include Canada-wide standards to 
ensure the safety of transplantation and a comprehensive and 
sustainable plan for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our challenge will be to find an appropriate approach for 
Canada, which is a federation where responsibility over health 
is shared between the federal and the provincial and territorial 
governments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamental to this approach is a partnership with provinces 
that was agreed to by federal, provincial and territorial health 
ministers at their September 1999 annual meeting in Charlottetown 
before the government response had been made public within five 
months from the publishing of the committee's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many ministers approved the establishment of a council on organ 
and tissue donation and transplantation in Canada and the guiding 
principles which will govern its operation once a business plan 
has been adopted.  This plan is to implement a co-ordinated, 
comprehensive and integrated donation and transplantation 
strategy across Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that we do not have much time. An eleven-point action plan 
was adopted by the federal and provincial health ministers in 
September and I think that we made important progress on that 
issue in the last while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask our colleague and the members of the opposition to 
recognize that we are taking our responsibilities in this 
respect. I urge them all to support our approach and 
congratulate the hon. member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port 
Coquitlam on raising once again this issue in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am delighted to have support across 
the House.  It makes me feel very good.  The fact is that I did 
make this presentation to a subcommittee that was not made up of 
Liberals only.  The fact is that there were other members who 
must have voted against this bill being a votable bill. Otherwise 
it would have been a votable bill.  It could not be defeated just 
by members on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted.  The fact is I knew the bill had great support 
from all sides of the House.  When I asked for 100 signatures I 
could have got 100 signatures on either side of the House.  It 
was supportable.  The good doctor in the Reform Party has made 
some great comments.  He is a physician and knows what he is 
talking about.  I was delighted to hear those comments. I was 
delighted to hear all the comments that have been made, 
especially those from the Progressive Conservative member who had 
a transplant.  I did not know he was a recipient of a transplant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about price tags and costs today and everything else, 
but we should keep in mind that if we save one life we cannot put 
a price tag on it.  A good friend of mine who was a council 
member with me in Coquitlam before I was elected as a mayor lost 
his wife after five years on kidney dialysis.  Can we imagine the 
cost of that?  Finally they could not find a transplant and she 
died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many provinces probably think about the cost of transplants, but 
as the good doctor across the floor said the fact is the cost is 
very cheap compared to the cost of keeping people on dialysis, 
waiting for a transplant that may never happen.  We can only 
imagine the trauma families must go through, waiting and hoping 
that their little child or some other loved one will get a 
transplant so that he or she can lead a normal life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to the health minister and will continue to speak 
to him and to all members of the House.  I am not giving up on 
this one.  I have never given up on the many things I have 
brought before the House as the new member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought before the House the leaky condo situation.  I am not 
giving up on that and I am not giving up on this one.  The fact 
is that it is an issue with me which I will be fighting every day 
of the week.  I ask all members on all sides of the House to give 
me a hand and come forward in this discussion, this debate and 
this fight.  We will win.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>APEC INQUIRY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on October 29 I asked the Deputy Prime Minister a 
question about the APEC inquiry's chief lawyer, Marvin Storrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Storrow, who in his position with the APEC commission was 
supposed to remain at arm's length from the Liberal government, 
ended up dining with the Prime Minister at a $400 a plate 
fundraiser.  I asked the Deputy Prime Minister why his government 
defined arm's length as being close enough to pass the pepper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Storrow denied that his attendance at that dinner would 
compromise his impartiality at the inquiry, the same inquiry that 
may eventually call the Prime Minister to testify.  Indeed it 
would have been Mr. Storrow who would have had the power of part 
of the decision making process to decide whether or not the Prime 
Minister should testify at the inquiry.  Mr. Storrow still denied 
any conflict of interest but since then has actually done the 
right thing and resigned from the commission because of the 
perception of a problem there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to my initial question in the House the Deputy Prime 
Minister told the House that the commission was well equipped to 
deal with matters of this kind and to let the commission do its 
work, which we have heard over and over again from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the work the commission has done so far. 
This is not the first scandal to have led to a resignation in the 
APEC affair.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just about a year ago we all know that the former solicitor 
general was overheard on an airplane explaining to a friend that 
Staff Sergeant Hugh Stewart would take the fall for the pepper 
spraying of APEC student protesters.  The then solicitor general 
categorically denied in the House day after day that he had done 
anything to undermine the important work of the arm's length 
commission, but finally he too resigned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all.  Also last year the entire original three 
member panel resigned after an RCMP officer said he heard one of 
the members discussing the outcome of the inquiry at a 
Saskatchewan casino.  That member denied the accusation but in 
the end it was he and two of the panel members who resigned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The APEC inquiry is looking a bit more like a three ring circus. 
It has gone on now for two years.  The government keeps feeding 
its media lines and spin about the commission doing its work 
rather than actually getting to the bottom of this incident, 
which could be cleared up very clearly by the Prime Minister's 
own testimony as to the involvement of the Prime Minister's 
Office in APEC security arrangements.  Instead of hearing these 
lines, stalling and jokes about pepper spraying, we would like 
some answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government continue to engage in this process 
instead of simply getting the Prime Minister to the point where 
he is able to testify before the commission?  I am afraid my 
colleague on the other side will say that he has not been called 
yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us clear up once and for all what the Prime Minister's 
involvement was in this APEC security scandal.  It has gone on 
for two years.  It continues to go on.  We have seen people 
resigning and it is going on and on.  We want some answers.  We 
would like them today.  We would like the Prime Minister to 
testify and tell us exactly what his role was in the APEC 
security scandal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member for 
Dewdney Alouette worries because the lawyer representing the 
RCMP Public Complaints Commission at the APEC hearings attended 
a fundraising dinner in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand how such a question could be raised in the 
House. Unless my colleague does not understand the first thing 
about the legislation as it stands and its mechanisms. This 
matter has strictly nothing to do with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain for the umpteenth time, in the hope that the 
message will get across a little bit better this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The complaints commission was established in 1986 to investigate 
complaints made by the public against members of the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the 1986 legislation, the commission is an independent 
administrative tribunal. It conducts investigations as it deems 
appropriate and is accountable for its practices and procedures. 
It is operating at arm's length from the government. That fact 
should be emphasized and repeated again, and I would repeat it 
in 15 different languages if I could: the commission is 
operating at arm's length from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the APEC hearings, the chairperson of the commission 
appointed Mr. Ted Hughes to deal specifically with the events 
that took place in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hughes has a great reputation as an experienced lawyer and, 
under his direction, the hearings have made considerable 
progress. To date, more than 60 witnesses have been heard. I 
think Mr. Hughes has given all possible assurances that his work 
is absolutely honest and beyond reproach. In fact, that in 
itself is the best guarantee that the Canadian public will know 
exactly what happened at the APEC summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In performing his duties, Mr. Hughes recruited Mr. Marvin Storrow, 
who is the lawyer in question; he attended a fundraising dinner 
and has resigned, not to bring the work he was doing into 
disrepute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission has nothing to do— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. parliamentary secretary, but time has run out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.34 p.m.)
