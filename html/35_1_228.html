	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.)</B> moved 
for leave to introduce Bill C-348, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code (mines).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to introduce this bill 
that will ban the production, export and import of land mines and 
anti-personnel devices within Canada.
<P>
	There are over 100 million land mines and anti-personnel 
devices seeded throughout the world. The world produces over a 
million of these land mines and anti-personnel devices every year 
and over 100,000 people are maimed or killed by these devices 
every year, 40 per cent of whom are innocent women and children.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to have Canada take a leadership role 
in banning these devices which have no place in modern warfare.
<P>
	If we can pass this private member's bill which I know has a lot 
of support from across this floor, we will be able to send a clear 
message to other countries that it is unacceptable for these devices 
to continue to be produced, wreaking havoc in so many areas of the 
world and rendering millions of acres uninhabitable for decades.
<P>
	I hope we will be able to have some cross-party support for this 
private member's bill so that Canada can take a leadership role on 
this very important issue.

	He said: Madam Speaker, the motions grouped for debate are 
essentially for linguistic clarification purposes. In my view, these 
motions do not require extensive debate, but only some 
explanations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14683"> 14683 </A></B>
<P>
	I myself will only deal with Motions Nos. 22 and 23, which 
I had the honour of submitting and which were seconded by the 
hon. member for Saint-Hubert.
<P>
	Motion No. 22 seeks to clarify clause 68 of the bill. The 
beginning of the current English version of that clause reads as 
follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The following provisions are amended by replacing the 
expression ``sans surveillance'' with the expression ``sans 
escorte''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The idea is to replace the expression ``sans surveillance'' with 
the expression ``sans escorte'', which is deemed more appropriate 
in French.
<P>
	It would be more logical to say that, in the French version, the 
expression ``sans escorte'' replaces the expression ``sans 
surveillance'', so that the introduction to clause 68 would read as 
follows, should the amendment be passed. The new merged version 
would read:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The French version of the following provisions are amended by 
replacing the expression ``sans surveillance'' with the expression 
``sans escorte''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The same logic is applied as in the case of the two preceding 
clauses, where it is said, in regard to the English version, that:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The English version of the act is amended-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
The same goes for clause 66. The logic is the same as that which 
prevails throughout the bill.
<P>
	The other amendment which I tabled, namely Motion No. 23 
dealing with clause 69, is for the same purpose. I will spare you the 
reading of the merged text which, albeit short, could nevertheless 
be boring. However, the objective of that amendment is the same, 
that is to say that the French version:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The French version of the following provisions are-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I respectfully submit these amendments to the House. As for the 
other amendments, I do hope that they will be accepted without a 
long debate.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, regarding the motion 
tabled by the hon. member for Bellechasse, I wish to underline his 
active involvement in  the committee. I think it is in everyone's 
interest to know how much the hon. member cares about his work. 
He is always striving for perfection. The government and 
especially the members of this House would do well to recognize 
what an excellent job the opposition member did, in my opinion, in 
this committee.
<P>
	But I must stick to this text. We in this government support this 
motion as tabled by the hon. member for Bellechasse.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
was not here but I imagine we are still debating Group No. 2.
<P>
	I wish to repeat that the Bloc Quebecois understands and shares 
the solicitor general's goal of reassuring the public about 
conditional release, given the enduring climate of public 
scepticism toward the federal parole system.
<P>
	In particular, Motion No. 6 tabled by the government is aimed at 
correcting a drafting error. This provision deals with the 
calculation of the automatic release date of an offender sentenced 
to a jail term in a provincial correctional facility who is then 
transferred to a federal penitentiary.
<P>
	As it now reads, clause 40 of the bill excludes those offenders 
who were serving prison sentences on or before November 1, 1992. 
The government's motion is aimed at correcting this oversight and 
we support this motion.

	He said: Madam Speaker, the majority of our amendments in this 
section will address violent offenders.
<P>
	Once again we see in Bill C-45 that there has been an effort by 
the government to do something to address violent offenders, that 
those guilty of child abuse, child aggravated assault or child sexual 
assault should not be released. No one can disagree with that.
<P>
	Once again here is an example of a government saying it will 
move in the direction Canadians want, but it does not go far 
enough.
<P>
	Who is a child? If the child is 15 and is assaulted, does that 
count? Do they have to be under 14, according to the age of 
majority? What are the guidelines? Are we to say in the case of the 
Bernardo trial to the French and the Mahaffy families that their 
daughters were in their upper teens and therefore were not children, 
and that Mr. Bernardo could be released some time in the future? If 
that is what it is saying, it is totally wrong.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	Aggravated assault on anyone, I do not care what their age, when 
violence is shown by these offenders in that fashion there is 
absolutely no reason in the world they should be released at any 
time until we are absolutely certain they will never do it again. If 
that means we have to wait until they are 90 years old, so be it.
<P>
	What the Canadian people want more than anything else if they 
are to feel safe is to be assured by the government that dangerous 
violent offenders will not be on the streets because of the bleeding 
hearts of this country who say we cannot keep them behind bars 
forever.
<P>
	Let us make a separation. A lot of people in penitentiaries are 
non-violent. Many of them should not even be in there. Let us start 
separating these two categories. Let us help those who genuinely 
made mistakes, who did no harm to individuals.
<P>
	If they are non-violent let us treat them as such. Let us look at 
what we can do to rehabilitate them back into the community. 
Maybe we need to look at some alternative measures that would 
prevent them from going there in the first place and let 
communities deal with these problems, people who are closest to 
the scene.
<P>
	When it comes to individuals who hunt down children or women 
or any kind of a victim with ball bats just to kill them, those are the 
kinds of people we do not need in this country, certainly not on our 
streets. If the best solution we have is to keep them behind bars, for 
heaven's sake let us do it.
<P>
	I am not certain how accurate some reports are. Recently I read a 
report by Diane Francis who claimed she received her information 
from the solicitor general's office, that 78 individuals were 
released from penitentiaries and went on to murder. It did not say 
how many people they murdered but if 78 people committed 
murder, it was definitely no less than 78.
<P>
	I remember a year or two ago when we first came to the House I 
asked the solicitor general about a list we had compiled. Our little 
research group had managed to find 46 individuals who had been 
released who were violent and killed again.
<P>
	In one of those instances I remember a quote in the newspaper 
from the convict, and it was the first time I have been able to agree 
fully with a convict: ``The only thing crazier than me is a system 
that would let me out to do what I did''. Finally the whole truth is 
spoken. It is plum crazy.
<P>
	Special interest groups are running around all over the country. 
They have the ear of the solicitor general and the ear of the justice 
department. They simply will not accept that locking them up and 
throwing away the key is the answer.
<P>
	Probably 90 per cent of Canadians would agree with me when I 
say for some individuals that is the only answer. There is a better 
answer for some of these individuals. It is called capital 
punishment. It is my opinion that should apply to some individuals.
<P>
	Clifford Olson may be eligible. He will be heard in 1995, I 
believe. Under section 745 of the Criminal Code he could be 
considered for release, although I am quite certain he will not be. I 
have a little more faith in our justice system than that, that they 
would not let him out. Nevertheless, he can apply, and will because 
he has been complaining and moaning and groaning over the last 
few years.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	It saddens me that we even have to consider such a thing, that we 
have to go to the trouble of having a trial and the expense of paying 
individuals to sit and listen to the likes of these individuals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14686"> 14686 </A></B>
<P>
	He killed once, then he killed twice, then there were three, four, 
five, six. As far as we know, he killed about a dozen times. This 
individual killed once and got life and 25 years. He killed 11 or 
12 more times for free; it did not cost him anything.
<P>
	Then he goes to our justice department and makes a bargain. 
Give me $10,000 for every body I lead you to, put it in a trust fund, 
and I will start telling you what I did with these children I killed. 
And we fell into this bargain. We bargained with an individual like 
that.
<P>
	I dare anyone in the House to go to any community or any town 
in the country and stand on a street corner and ask any Canadian 
what he thinks of our justice system that made a bargain with 
Clifford Olson to the point where he now has $100,000 in a trust 
account for his family because he told us where to find the bodies 
of the people he murdered. That is an example of what people do 
not want.
<P>
	The message should be loud and clear to individuals of that type, 
these highly dangerous, violent offenders: You are not a welcome 
segment to our society; we do not want you; we do not need you. 
For heaven's sake, let us make our communities really safe. Make 
the streets safe for our children who are walking home from school.
<P>
	Why should we have to worry about the mother who has to work 
at 11 o'clock in the evening in a convenience store and who was 
kidnapped and murdered? We have to consider whether it was a 
planned murder. Maybe it was just second degree or maybe even 
manslaughter. It was a violent act, which is not acceptable in this 
society. But the government will not show through its legislation 
that it is not acceptable. It makes it look acceptable.
<P>
	The motion is going to try to send a message to all Canadians 
that we parliamentarians in the 35th Parliament are a little more 
serious than they have been in the past about doing something with 
those who commit a crime. We will continue our prevention 
programs and do as much as we can. We will continue to try to 
rehabilitate those who can be rehabilitated. We will do all the right 
things. But when push comes to shove and there are individuals 
such as Clifford Olson and Paul Bernardo, let us put an end to it. 
Never again should those kinds of things happen. Send the message 
and let us do it with these types of motions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, this is a very delicate 
question. Obviously it will entail probably going into a very 
thorough debate. I think we have had the occasion to do so in 
committee.
<P>
	I would like to remind the hon. member that all those witnesses 
who appeared before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs in regard to Bill C-45 and Bill C-41 expressed the view that 
statutory release plays a fundamental role in the protection of 
society. This period of gradual and carefully planned and 
supervised release  is essential for assisting an offender to 
reintegrate into the community and is preferred over an offender's 
abrupt release at warrant expiry.
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
	I should also add that there is a process in place. It takes a 
required amount of time to serve. We should also keep in mind that 
we do not automatically release people as the opposition likes to 
contend.
<P>
	The provisions in Bill C-45 and the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act already provide a balanced response to the concerns 
posed by repeat offenders. The new sentence calculation model 
would ensure that an offender who receives a new custodial 
sentence for an offence committed while on conditional release 
would be automatically returned to custody. New consecutive 
sentences would always result in the offender serving a minimum 
of one-third of the new sentence in custody before parole 
eligibility.
<P>
	I think we agree here in this House and I would imagine many 
members in the opposition benches would agree that we need to 
constantly seek ways of improving public protection. That is why 
the government continues to focus its efforts on more effective 
methods, which involve better identifying, assessing, and treating 
violent offenders on a case by case basis. However, a blanket 
abolition of statutory release for certain offenders would ultimately 
harm rather than improve public safety.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs recognized the value of statutory release when it voted 
down a similar motion to abolish statutory release for all offenders.
<P>
	I would also add that we will be opposing not only Motion No. 4 
but also Motions Nos. 5, 11, and 17 as presented by the opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I just heard that the member of the Liberal Party opposite is 
opposing Motion No. 5 which deals with the revocation of parole.
<P>
	Having been in many parole hearings and listened to all the cases 
I have listened to, I wonder why this government would not be 
prepared to back this. Let us say a prisoner is in for a crime that was 
undertaken while on drugs or a crime related to drugs. This 
individual gets out of an institution today and is caught in another 
facility while on parole using drugs. His parole is revoked. He 
comes back in and they say he has to serve more time. Today that 
inmate is entitled to again go to a parole board and get out and do 
his thing in the community.
<P>
	We are saying that if a person is incarcerated in this country for a 
crime and gets out and does something such that parole is revoked, 
the person should serve the full term. That to me makes obvious 
common sense. If we are letting somebody out of prison today and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14687"> 14687 </A></B>
<P>
he is  going to go out and commit another crime, he obviously has 
not got the message.
<P>
	As examples I will give a couple of instances where I have been 
in parole hearings. One individual in this country was incarcerated 
in excess of two years for very serious fraud crimes. This 
individual was allowed to go out under UTA, unescorted pass, and 
he was found to be in the middle of a fraudulent exercise, milking 
someone out there out of their money. What did the parole board 
do? They brought him in and told him: ``That is not a good thing. 
You have taken anger management courses in here. You have taken 
courses and by now you should know that is not the right thing, so 
we will leave you locked up again''.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	What happens? He says ``Well, I guess I have not learned the 
lesson, so I am going to stay in here, but I will be back here to apply 
to get out again''. This is obviously a serious problem. The fact is 
the individual has not learned his lesson, and that individual should 
be reincarcerated for the full term of his sentence.
<P>
	Now to some more serious problems. I have been involved with 
several cases. I am not a lawyer. I am an average guy who tries to 
help out a lot of victims in an area where I have seven federal 
institutions around my riding. I have seen people incarcerated for 
rape. I spoke about this last night. Wayne Perkin is an individual 
who got a young lady from Aldergrove, British Columbia, coerced 
her into her garden shed, beat her over the head with a hammer, 
taped her hands behind her back, injected her with cocaine and 
raped her. In this country he gets all of six years for this heinous 
crime. This young lady will never be the same again. He gets six 
years for that, and is eligible for parole after two years.
<P>
	What do they do? They let him out at around three years. He 
goes right back at it again and gets another unsuspecting victim, 
injects her with cocaine, but this time he does not just beat her over 
the head with a hammer, he stabs her 20 times and kills her. The 
family and the family's friends will never again be the same.
<P>
	The system in this country does not work. For a Liberal 
government that brought a lot of this mess upon us to stand here 
and oppose Motion No. 5 is despicable. There are too many victims 
out there. We do not have to talk about Clifford Olson or this 
Bernardo fellow. There are all kinds of them across this country, 
like those three guys who did their thing in McDonald's in Sydney, 
Nova Scotia. Those are the ones who get national attention, but 
there are all kinds of them.
<P>
	I could talk about Jose Mendoza. I have talked about him more 
than enough in this place. That little creep had 12 criminal 
convictions in my community, including what they call sexual 
assault but I call rape. He is escorted out of the country back to El 
Salvador at our cost so we are rid of him, right? No. He says: ``I 
like the Canadian penal system, the Canadian criminal justice 
system; it treats me pretty good''. He got out early too, by the way, 
on parole.
<P>
	He comes back in illegally, past Guatemala, Mexico, the United 
States, shows up at our door and says: ``Now I am a refugee, I am 
not an immigrant, so take me back''. Just before that happened he 
raped another woman, an 18-year old in my community.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Shame. Who is responsible?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> This government has to 
understand that this parole system works for some, but what we are 
trying to tell this government is if an individual is incarcerated and 
if they are allowed out under escort or unescorted and if they 
commit another crime while they are out, they are obviously not 
the best apple in the barrel. They should be brought in, their parole 
should be revoked, and they should be in to the end of their 
sentence, obviously.
<P>
	There is good old Karel Kral, again in my community. Is this a 
case of ``I have all these isolated incidents'', or is this just common 
around the country? After speaking here last night I received calls, 
letters and faxes from Ontario people saying that the same thing 
was happening in their communities.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Let us talk about Karel Kral in my town. Good old Karel, up on 
cocaine, has been in and out of prison for about 14 years on 
different occasions. Karel was hyped up on cocaine one night not 
too long ago and attacked Joan in Langley, British Columbia. He 
was charged with sexual assault with a weapon and convicted. Joan 
is 65 years old. He used a needle with cocaine as the weapon. This 
is a common weapon to use now, because if the victim is injected 
with cocaine and the criminal is on cocaine it might be a good 
excuse for the damage being done.
<P>
	Karel has been out on parole time and time again: out, back in, 
out, back in. Joan would not have been assaulted had somebody 
said: ``Wait, there is a message here. This guy is a bad apple. His 
paroles are being revoked. He is in and out, in and out. Stop it. Put 
him in for a long term, give him a heavier term or call him a 
dangerous offender''.
<P>
	In the name of God, we have to listen to reason. The government 
is listening to the very few Liberals in cabinet who want to push a 
Liberal agenda. How much more can we say on behalf of victims?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will make a few preliminary remarks before I directly 
oppose the motions we are dealing with.
<P>
	I am very concerned that as we sit in the House we do not feel for 
the victims, for the people who are suffering from the crimes being 
committed outside this place. We need to take more responsibility 
for the laws we pass. I  realize a lot of people are possibly watching 
this debate on television, but we need to focus more on what we are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14688"> 14688 </A></B>
<P>
putting through the House. I am very concerned with what is 
happening here.
<P>
	We are giving the impression to people out there that Bill C-45 
will fix what is broken in the criminal justice system. It will not. It 
is one small step in the right direction. Why do we not have the 
courage to do it right, right now? That is the problem we have.
<P>
	Let us look at the things we are doing here. I look at a motion we 
just put through. It was tinkering and playing with words. People 
may look at this and say that the words life sentence are being 
changed to imprisonment for life. It may seem innocuous at first; it 
may seem like no big deal. However there is a difference. 
Imprisonment for life is always 25 years and a life sentence can be 
as low as 10 years. The Liberals are going soft with the 
amendments they are making, which is not right. People ought to 
know it is not just playing with words. We are dealing with people's 
lives. As the hon. member for Fraser Valley West just pointed out, 
these criminals are being released when they should not be 
released.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	I support Motion No. 4 which the hon. member for Wild Rose 
put forward because it will prevent an offender convicted of a 
violent offence from getting statutory release. We must enforce full 
term sentences for violent offenders. That has to be the bottom line. 
The message must go out that we will not tolerate this kind of 
thing.
<P>
	The Liberals believe in harsher sentences. They gave that 
impression with Bill C-41 in which they made hate crimes more 
punishable than other crimes. They give the impression that they 
believe in harsher sentences and then they come up with this stuff. 
It is inconsistent. Why should violent criminals not get harsh, full 
term sentences?
<P>
	What is the most basic function of government? What is the 
primary function government should be performing? It is to 
provide for the safety of its citizens. It is simply that. We are not 
here to create huge programs, tax people to death, and do all this 
wonderful stuff that gives the impression government is taking care 
of its people. The basic function of government is to provide for the 
safety of its citizens. That is why it is so important for us to debate 
the bill.
<P>
	We were here yesterday for the entire afternoon and I only heard 
Reformers dealing with the substance of the bill. Are we the only 
ones who care about the safety of people? Surely to goodness there 
must be enough compassion in this place that we would begin to 
seriously debate what should be the direction of our criminal 
justice system.
<P>
	Like I said before, it is not our job to create and run big social 
programs and all kinds of other wonderful  things. That may be 
something people will ask us to do from time to time, but the big 
picture is that government should first and foremost provide for the 
safety of the citizens within its borders. We need to pay more 
attention to crime, not just big crime but all crime.
<P>
	On Motion No. 5 which the hon. member for Wild Rose put 
forward, we do not support statutory release in general but some 
may consider it for non-violent offences to be all right. The 
amendment still allows some form of non-violent statutory release 
but forces the offender to serve the full sentence if the statutory 
release is revoked or suspended.
<P>
	The hon. member for Fraser Valley West has made the point, and 
I will make again. If a person receives a sentence for a crime and 
then commits another crime when on parole, not only should that 
person complete the first sentence but the next sentence the person 
gets should be tacked on. It should be consecutive.
<P>
	Too often our courts do not add two and two to make four. For 
them two and two equals two. What is that? Is it Liberal 
mathematics? I am not sure. In my books two and two should equal 
four and that is what such people should be serving. For every 
single crime they commit they should be punished. They should not 
be able to commit five crimes and be punished for only one.
<P>
	I strongly oppose the motion previously put forth in which 
offenders serving time at a provincial institution are transferred to a 
federal institution and can be released from the federal institution 
on the day they would have been released from the provincial 
institution. Why should they get out early just because the federal 
government is now paying the bill? That should not happen. They 
should not be able to play within the system. It is not right.
<P>
	We oppose Motion No. 10. The amendment will not allow full 
term sentences for sexual offences against an adult female. The 
point has been made previously that there should not be a great 
distinction about whom someone commits the crime against. A 
crime is a crime and it is serious no matter whom it is committed 
against. We do not want statutory release.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	I have made the point already that sentences need to be 
consecutive. If criminals recommit crimes they should serve those 
sentences plus the full sentences for the crimes committed 
previously.
<P>
	We are moving in the right direction but we need to take more 
seriously what is happening in the House. We need to deal with 
these things and make sure we get them right. We need to provide 
for the safety of our citizens so they can feel safer in this great 
country of ours.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 9</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-45, in Clause 43, be amended by replacing lines 27 to 29, on page 
24, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``an offence causing the death of or serious harm to another person or a sexual 
offence involving a child''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Madam Speaker, we keep hearing that ignorance of the 
law is no excuse. Still it should be intelligible. Bill C-45 is already 
a very complex piece of legislation as far as calculating the period 
of sentence and eligibility for parole is concerned. So if even the 
drafters stumble over words and sentence structure, it will take a 
clever person indeed to understand.
<P>
	As the Barreau du Québec indicated in its brief on Bill C-45 
submitted to the Standing Committee on Justice, and I quote: ``In 
fact, although we brought together the varied expertise of a number 
of professionals from academia, the prisons and private practice, 
they were not able to conduct an exhaustive review of clause 34 of 
the Bill and the related provisions because both the methods of 
calculation adopted and the wording used seemed so recondite''.
<P>
	Clause 34 of the bill is the key element of the methods for 
calculating sentence and eligibility for parole. If experts have a 
hard time making out what it means, how is a judge expected to 
benefit from a reform that is far from being as crystal clear as 
requested?
<P>
	Motion No. 9, which I just moved, is not designed to amend 
clause 34, which will serve as an example however, but to complete 
in clause 43 of Bill C-45 the information that is missing in the 
French version. I do not know if the drafters were making fun of us 
or not, but there is a limit.
<P>
	Francophone readers must refer to the subsections listed in order 
to know what it is all about, while the English version mentions the 
subsections and goes on to describe the offences in extenso.
<P>
	Either the drafters assumed that francophone readers know by 
heart the sections referred to in Bill C-45 and their content or they 
were trying to make the clause difficult to understand in the French 
version.
<P>
	Either way, this is adding insult to injury. I will not stand for this 
kind of abuse any longer, for myself or francophones in general. 
There is a plethora of instances where federal legislation makes a 
mockery of the language of Molière. Drafters are misusing the 
French language under the pretext of simplifying.
<P>
	The new section 120.1 proposed in the bill is another example. In 
English, this section sets a basis for the computation of the 
prescribed time, yet this information is missing in the French 
version. It will be easier for an anglophone judge to understand 
what it is all about. At any rate, in either language, the bench is not 
likely to be able to make head nor tail of it.
<P>
	That is why is important to set a start point, this point being the 
day on which the additional sentence was imposed. This correction 
is essential. However, this will only be a partial solution to an 
endemic problem.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	The following is typical of Bill C-45, and I am referring to the 
wording of clause 34. Let me first get my breath, because there are 
no commas in the next paragraph, which is a simple sentence. And 
I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Le délinquant dont la peine d'emprisonnement n'est pas expirée et qui est 
condamné à une peine d'emprisonnement supplémentaire à purger à la suite de 
l'autre n'est admissible à la libération conditionnelle totale qu'à la date à 
laquelle il a accompli le temps d'épreuve requis à la fois sur la partie de la peine 
non encore exécutée au moment de la condamnation et sur la peine 
supplémentaire.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If you understand this, Madam Speaker, congratulations. The 
point is that the additional sentence was consecutive. In the English 
version, however, we read:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-``commencing on the day on which the additional sentence was 
imposed''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We do not find these words in the French text. So in English, an 
individual can find out when he is eligible for parole, while a 
Francophone cannot because he does not know where to start 
counting.
<P>
	A judge who cannot interpret a legal text will have to judge in 
equity and ignore the text, which is so convoluted that the results 
would be absurd. That is how the rule of law ends up at the bottom 
of the culture gap.
<P>
	Another striking example may be found in clause 45 of the 
English version, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-``any factor that is relevant''-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The French version says, and I quote: ``tous les facteurs utiles''. 
This must be corrected. The use of the word ``utiles'' in the French 
version is not appropriate. This is about the relevance of the 
information concerned, not about its usefulness.
<P>
	For years I have tried to tell this House that respect for 
Francophones starts with respect for their language. I find this bad 
habit editors have of making their French translation a carbon copy 
of the English extremely annoying. When will they realize that the 
French language is not well served by a translation from a text 
originally written in English? When can I expect to see federal 
legislation drafted in correct French? Certainly not before October 
30.
<P>
	I have been a member of this House for nearly seven years, and 
there have been few occasions when I could say that both the 
English and the French versions of a bill were drafted with the 
same care. Aside from awkward syntax or grammatical errors, 
there is also the fact that the law may be interpreted in such a way 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14691"> 14691 </A></B>
<P>
that the intent  of the legislator is obscured by semantics and our 
work here in the House will be for naught.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Madam Speaker, a point of order. I would like 
some clarification. Is the hon. member speaking to the motions in 
group 4 or has she moved to group 5? I am a little confused.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member is 
debating motions in group 4.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> To continue, Madam Speaker, it is we who are the 
legislators. In answer to my colleague who wonders where we are 
up to-I imagine he had had to absent himself-we are indeed still 
in group No. 4. It is our duty therefore to see that our intentions are 
respected. The best way to do this is to make them intelligible.
<P>
	In conclusion, I have a piece of advice to give those drafting 
texts: they should take a look at the Quebec civil code and our code 
of criminal procedure in order to learn how to write in French. 
These are both bold pieces of legislation, the Quebec civil code in 
particular, whose legislative texts have been able to stand the test of 
Quebec's changing times, customs and habits without becoming 
outmoded, ever since 1866. If only out of respect for the 
francophones of this country, I am therefore requesting that this 
House support Motion No. 9.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert is obviously raising an issue beyond the technical 
scope of this motion. We have covered the role of French here in 
the House of Commons, within the federal government. I would 
like to point out to the hon. member that everyone tries to speak 
and write proper and correct French.
<P>
	What I am saying to you could certainly apply directly to 
English speakers. Sometimes I myself go over and correct texts 
that have been given me by anglophones, and that are full of 
mistakes. There are syntax problems, and I often find these texts 
completely incomprehensible as the hon. member for Saint-Hubert 
claims happens in French. Unfortunately it seems to be the case for 
both official languages.
<P>
	However, I am keeping to this text and to the motion as such. I 
do not think this is the time to politicize the debate and I do not 
think this motion has anything to do with the probable results on 
October 30, which will be, as we know full well, that a majority of 
Quebecers will vote no.
<P>
	By deleting the words ``serious drug offence'', the motion would 
exclude serious drug offenders from the effect of the provisions on 
detention. It would defeat  Parliament's purpose in expanding the 
scope of the provisions on detention to include serious drug 
offenders.
<P>
	The aim of this measure was to calm the growing concerns of the 
public over the persistent problem of drug trafficking. In short, this 
is to some extent what the work of the legislator is about-making 
society as we know it safer. The measure is one of the initiatives in 
the national anti-drug strategy.
<P>
	Under section 232 of the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act, the provisions on detention shall be subject to a 
comprehensive review by a committee of the House of Commons 
three years after coming into force-which was November 1992. 
So, very soon.
<P>
	This review will be more appropriate for the consideration of an 
amendment of this scope. I therefore invite the hon. members to 
vote against this motion and I would like to remind the hon. 
member that we are always careful in our use of French.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Resuming debate on 
Motion No. 9, group 4.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have a couple of comments. The previous speaker was talking 
about the confusion in these bills, how they are written and how 
they are having a difficult time trying to get the same meaning in 
two languages.
<P>
	There is one thing on which I can agree with the hon. member. 
Not only with this bill but with every piece of legislation I see 
coming from the government, whether it is the Income Tax Act, 
GST rebates, transportation or whatever it is, it makes sure it words 
these bills in such a way that a common, ordinary guy like myself is 
not going to be able to understand everything. We have to hire legal 
minds to give the proper interpretation. That is one thing to which I 
certainly object. If we are going to make laws for ordinary 
Canadians it would not hurt to put them in language that ordinary 
Canadians can understand.
<P>
	I have a comment as well for the parliamentary secretary to the 
solicitor general who made the comment that now is the time not to 
politicize. I would like hon. members from the Liberal Party to 
realize one thing. What they are really saying is: ``Let us not get 
these things on the floor any more than we have to because 
Canadians might realize what the devil we are doing''. Not only do 
we want to confuse them on how we write laws but let us conduct 
the business of the House in a manner that anybody watching 
television really does not know what is happening.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I will take every opportunity I can to try and illustrate what is 
happening so the people out there will know what is happening. 
Reformers are the only ones willing to do that. The little puppets in 
the back row in the Liberal  Party wait until the cabinet barks so 
they know who to bite. We do not operate that way. There are 
things happening with documents coming through like Bill C-45, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14692"> 14692 </A></B>
<P>
things the Canadian people need to know. No, let us razzle-dazzle 
them with several hundred pages of a law and then we will pass it 
off as doing our job.
<P>
	We and the Liberal backbenchers will then go to our 
constituencies and will be asked what we did in Bill C-45. Most of 
them will be like me, struggling because we really do not know. 
They will be able to pick up a few little things here and there but 
they really do not know.
<P>
	Are we living in a country where the whole idea is to confuse 
ordinary Canadians so we can really run this show? If that is the 
case it is time to change. What a shame to say we are trying to 
politicize.
<P>
	Motion No. 9 is dropping off drug offences. It states we should 
keep dangerous offenders and murderers behind bars but let us drop 
off the drug offenders. It so happens that drug dealers are a serious 
and major problem in our country. We do not know how to treat 
major problems.
<P>
	What we want to do is take this member's motion and drop those 
kinds of things off because the government is attempting to get a 
little tougher. I applaud the government for its attempt. If it needs 
some advice it should talk to Canadians. They will tell the 
government what to do with drug offenders.
<P>
	Listen to the old guy from Wild Rose, the old backwoods kid 
who was born yesterday. He is not smart enough to pick up 
legislation and say: ``My, my, is that not pretty''. All my little 
lawyer friends over there in the justice department or the solicitor 
general's department have put this wonderful document together 
that nobody can understand. Try reading the Income Tax Act 
sometime if members want some fun.
<P>
	Back in the 1960s I used to teach how to do income tax. By the 
middle 1970s I had to hire somebody to do my own. They are doing 
a good job if they are trying to confuse people.
<P>
	One thing that is really confusing is why the member who is 
introducing this motion would think for a second that serious drug 
offenders are not a problem and should not be classified in some of 
these areas.
<P>
	We will be opposing this motion.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent to go to group 8 after we debate group 5?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Motions Nos. 14 and 15 deal with a very important 
clause of Bill C-45. Clause 45(3) of the bill amends section 132 of 
the Corrections and Conditional Release Act by adding subsection 
(1.1) regarding the determining by the Correctional Service and the 
National Parole Board of the likelihood of the offender committing 
a sexual offence involving a child.
<P>
	Under the current legislation, a dangerous sexual offender who is 
likely to commit, at the expiration of his sentence according to the 
law, an offence causing death or harm to another person, harm 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14693"> 14693 </A></B>
<P>
being described as serious physical or emotional injury, can be 
maintained in detention.
<P>
	With Bill C-45, clause 42, the National Parole Board would not 
be required to establish the existence or likelihood of injury, in the 
case of a sexual offence involving a child. It would need only be 
satisfied of the likelihood of the commission of a sexual offence 
involving a child before the expiration of the sentence according to 
the law.
<P>
	In other words, where the board believes the risk is too high, the 
prisoner remains behind bars. The onus is substantially reduced.
<P>
	The message is clear: when in doubt, do nothing.
<P>
	In the case of sexual offenders in particular, it seems to me that 
the rule is sometimes applied in reverse. Release should not be 
statutory; it should always be based on the absence of any 
likelihood that a prisoner convicted of a sexual offence involving a 
child will commit a further offence.
<P>
	There is no sexual crime more contemptible and loathsome than 
one involving a child. The very thought of it disgusts me.
<P>
	Bear in mind that an individual who is eligible for parole or 
statutory release was properly tried and found guilty by a court of 
law and has exhausted all possible grounds of appeals.
<P>
	This is an offender who has been jailed for the monstrous things 
he has done. We are not talking about a defendant at this stage. This 
is an individual serving time for the crimes he has committed. He is 
paying his debt to society and to his young victim. As far as I am 
concerned, this is not high enough a price to pay; he could rot in 
jail.
<P>
	The role of the parole board was questioned on several 
occasions. I myself disputed in this House the validity of certain 
decisions made by commissioners.
<P>
	Repeat offenses must be denounced as unacceptable. The board 
is duty-bound to make the right decision concerning those 
convicted of sexual offenses involving children who are likely to 
re-offend: keep them in jail. The safety of the public, and children 
in particular, prevails over any right a prisoner may have if he or 
she poses too great a threat.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	However, and this is the reason I tabled Motions Nos. 14 and 15, 
it is necessary to specify the admissible sources of ``reliable 
information'' which can be taken into consideration by the 
Correctional Service and which are referred to in clause 45 of the 
bill.
<P>
	Police forces, prosecutors and probation services are examples 
of ``recognized and dependable sources'', as suggested in Motions 
Nos. 14 and 15. If the bill is not specific in that regard, there is a 
risk that mere  allegations could turn into conclusive evidence and 
create a despotic regime or, conversely, and this is what I fear most, 
encourage an interpretation which greatly favours the suspect and 
which could therefore result in a premature release. This is why I 
ask the House to support Motions Nos. 14 and 15.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, before presenting our position on 
the motion as it was tabled, I want to stress the good work of the 
hon. member for Saint-Hubert, and her colleague from 
Bellechasse. Indeed, the hon. member attaches a great deal of 
importance to details, and I often agree with her on those details.
<P>
	However, as regards her motion, I maintain that the word 
``reliable'' implies that the information comes from sources which 
are recognized and dependable. Moreover, the proposed wording is 
not in line with that used elsewhere in the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act. Consequently, we feel that Motions Nos. 
14 and 15 serve no useful purpose, and they will not be supported 
by the government.

	She said: Madam Speaker, the motions I am submitting to this 
House for approval are simply aimed at repealing subsection 2 in 
section 741.2 of the Criminal Code as amended by Bill C-45.
<P>
	It is surprising to say the least to see that incarceration is the 
preferred way to deal with delinquency. But it is ridiculous to 
suggest that society's denunciation and deterrence should be the 
only guiding principle for sentencing.
<P>
	To understand Motions Nos. 24 through 26, one must first 
understand the guidelines set out by legislators to help judges 
decide whether or not to suspend application of the usual parole 
regulations.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	In 1992, legislators gave extraordinary powers to judges 
imposing prison sentences of two years or more. In fact, section 
741.2 of the Criminal Code as it now stands makes it possible to 
disregard section 120(1) of the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act. Section 120 of the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act sets the usual period after which an individual 
becomes eligible for parole. This period usually amounts to a third 
of the sentence. Thus, if the judge is convinced by the 
circumstances of the offence, the character and specifics of the 
criminal and the degree of denunciation by society, he may order 
the criminal to serve half of the detention time imposed before 
being eligible for full parole.
<P>
	It may seem normal for inmates to have to serve half of their 
sentence before being eligible for parole. It must be kept in mind, 
however, that the sentencing judge has already taken into 
consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the offence and 
the criminal's individual and social characteristics, as well as a 
presentencing report with a victim impact statement.
<P>
	Thus, if he sets a four year sentence for sexual assault for 
example, he has already weighed the aggravating and attenuating 
circumstances in imposing this four year rating. Judges know very 
well when they sentence an individual that he will become eligible 
for parole after a third of the sentence has been served.
<P>
	This factor is therefore taken into consideration by the judge. He 
does a little mathematical calculation before sentencing, in order to 
know how much real penitentiary time the accused who has been 
found guilty will serve. If he considers that the real time might be 
ridiculous in light of the offence committed, he will increase the 
period of incarceration imposed and thus the length of time 
actually spent behind bars.
<P>
	In giving greater powers to trial judges, the legislator has 
provided them with an important tool for setting a dissuasive 
example. That tool must, however, be used with discretion and on 
an exceptional basis. Section 741.2 should not be used as a matter 
of course, as a sop to the frustration felt by most people when they 
see individuals released on parole who are not ready for 
rehabilitation.
<P>
	By expanding the role of the trial judge and letting him go 
beyond the procedure that is customary in dealing with the inmate, 
the legislator is trying, and I say trying, to strike a balance between 
the judicial power to judge and sentence and the powers of the 
Board in the parole process.
<P>
	The exceptional character of section 741.2 has been pointed out 
a number of times by the Quebec Court of Appeal. In 1993, in the 
Dankyi judgment, the judges of the highest court of the province 
stated that the range of sentences for trafficking and possession for 
the purposes of trafficking was normally adequate to cover both 
minor and more serious cases. The trial judge did not have to resort 
to section 741.2 of the Criminal Code to hand down an exemplary 
sentence. Ordering the inmate to serve half of his sentence can only 
be justified in exceptional circumstances.
<P>
	In the Leblanc judgment in 1995, the Appeal Court maintained 
its position and said this was an exceptional measure, to be used 
only in specific cases that warranted such measures.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Not long ago, in February 7, 1995, the Quebec Court of Appeal 
reiterated its position, stating that the trial judge should have 
formulated separate and distinct grounds for imposing a severe but 
fair sentence while ordering the inmate to serve at least half of the 
sentence before being eligible for full parole. The judges of the 
Appeal Court decided that the trial judge's reasons for imposing a 
sentence of 13 years in the penitentiary for robbery were based on 
the same grounds as his order that at least half the sentence was to 
be served. According to the judges, this was an error in law. 
Grounds and reasons should be distinct, which is what the 
legislator had in mind in section 741.2.
<P>
	In Bill C-45, as amended and reported by the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, the present section 741.2 
appears on page 44, where the committee added subsection (2) 
which reads as follows: ``For greater certainty, the paramount 
principles which are to  guide the court under this section are 
denunciation and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14695"> 14695 </A></B>
<P>
specific or general deterrence, with rehabilitation of the offender, 
in all cases, being subordinate to these paramount principles''.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois could never support such principles. The 
Bloc members on the committee did not support them, and today, I 
wish to reiterate our position on the use of these archaic principles 
to deal with crime.
<P>
	On the whole, Bill C-45 formulates principles and objectives for 
sentencing that are supported by the Bloc. Nowhere in the bill does 
it say that society's denunciation and deterrents are the paramount 
principles which are to guide our courts. On the contrary, Bill C-45 
tries to strike a balance between rehabilitation of the offender and 
protecting society.
<P>
	If new section 741.2 remains in its present form, Bill C-45 will 
no longer be consistent. On the one hand, the legislator asks the 
judge to consider the rehabilitation of the offender, while on the 
other hand, he tells him to ignore it.
<P>
	If this House sends ambiguous signals to the courts, we should 
not be surprised to see a number of absurd decisions that will 
become part of our jurisprudence. Therefore, subsection (2) of 
section 741.2 should be repealed, and I ask this House to support 
motions 24, 25 and 26.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the motion proposed 
by the hon. member would delete from the provision an 
amendment adopted by the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs.
<P>
	The provision to the effect that deterrence and society's 
denunciation are principles, and in my opinion, fundamental 
principles, guiding the courts and that rehabilitation of the offender 
is subordinate to them was added to clarify Parliament's intent in 
the matter of the courts' application of section 741.2 of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Saint-Hubert so rightly pointed out, the 
thrust of Bill C-45 is to ensure that these individuals' return to 
society is done in a balanced manner, and of course the aim of the 
bill is to ensure greater public safety. However, I must 
unfortunately advise you that the government cannot support 
Motions Nos. 24, 25 and 26 as presented by the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
once again we are seeing some proposals we cannot support.
<P>
	Bill C-45 is an attempt by the government to try to show 
Canadians that it is going to look at deterrence and punishment as 
kind of paramount to rehabilitation. It was a feeble attempt I might 
add, but at least it was an attempt.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Then along come the separatists and their ideas. Believe me, if 
you think the Liberals are left wing or bleeding hearts or whatever 
else you want to call them, the Bloc far exceeds that. This is 
another example of these kinds of motions: How dare us in Canada 
make such a scene over heinous criminals and crime. Deterrence 
and punishment is not how we operate in Canada; it is 
rehabilitation and prevention. Agreed, but let us make them 
paramount.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, when you cross that line of breaking the law, it 
is time to punish. And I hope the punishment will cause a deterrent, 
because a deterrent is one of the best methods of prevention.
<P>
	I congratulate the government members a little bit. The reason I 
congratulate them a little bit, only a little bit, is because that is all 
they have attempted to do, only a little bit. Tinker around, make the 
people think we are really going to do something about this, that we 
are going to get tough, and then along comes the Bloc saying: ``No, 
no, no, we cannot be so cruel and harsh to our criminals''.
<P>
	I am at a loss for words for people with that attitude. I sure would 
like them to come to my riding of Wild Rose and stand before 
crowds there, anywhere they want to go, and announce these 
wonderful new ideas. They will not sell.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine):</B> I will go.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I will welcome the parliamentary secretary. I 
welcome him to come out. It is an invitation. You want to sell my 
people in Wild Rose all your wonderful solutions to crime? You are 
welcome and good luck. If you think I am loud, wait until you get 
out there.
<P>
	The whole point is we have to get the message out to criminals: 
You will be punished severely if you commit these kinds of 
heinous, violent, dangerous crimes. We have to get that message 
out. That is what Canadians are asking for when you see capital 
punishment polls all across the country, all in favour, everywhere 
you go, 70 per cent to 75 per cent everywhere. But no, we cannot 
get the message. Besides, we are Parliament, we know better. We 
are smarter than the rest of Canadians. Hogwash and baloney. They 
do not know what they are talking about.

He said: Madam Speaker, here we go again. Welcome to law and 
order land.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	I know most of the members of this Parliament know or 
remember a certain person. They will remember her from the past. 
Her name is Monica Rainey. She worked hard for a group called 
CACE which had to fold because it was not supported by 
government funds like some other bleeding heart societies are. She 
could not afford to keep going.
<P>
	A major aspect of her fight was to do all she could do in Canada 
to protect the children in this country, the youth, from sexual 
assaults, abuse, et cetera.
<P>
	Monica Rainey came to this building a number of times with 
armloads of petitions calling for the government to do such things 
as create a registry of all violent dangerous individuals so when 
they were released and on the streets people would know who they 
were.
<P>
	She packed wheelbarrow loads of petitions and letters. All 
members received letters supporting what she was trying to do. I 
will be willing to bet a dollar to a doughnut that when we finish 
explaining why there should be a registry the old Liberal strings 
will be pulled and the backbenchers will be like puppets and jump 
up and oppose it because it is something we do not do in Canada. 
We could not dare put a child molester or a dangerous violent 
offender who hurts children on a list so the public would know who 
this person was. He might happen to be your nextdoor neighbour. 
We do not do that. Perhaps the charter of rights will not allow us to.
<P>
	There have been other documents from the Liberal government 
that have caused more chaos. I am not sure which ones but some 
have caused all sorts of things not to happen to protect people. 
There is only one explanation for not wanting a registry of 
individuals who are a threat to our society. It should not be limited 
to children. However, my party and I will settle with that for now 
although we would like a lot more. Why in the world should the 
parents of our young children not know who these people are?
<P>
	I am a grandfather and I have some little ones. I am disgusted 
with a government that does not try to help me protect them. The 
bleeding hearts over here sound like nothing more than cats-psst, 
psst-which is all they are good for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> They would rather spend time 
talking about separation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> They would rather spend time talking about 
separation than protecting children. That is more important to 
them.
<P>
	Canadians are fed up. The Liberals do not think so but I know so. 
Talk to any parent who has lost a young child. They would like to 
have known that neighbour or that fellow at the end of the street 
had the potential to do that. It might really have helped.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14697"> 14697 </A></B>
<P>
	We are steadily losing more and more faith in the justice 
system. I will be perfectly honest. If anyone hurts my little child 
please let me have them, do not give him to the bleeding hearts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Vigilante.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> No that is not being a vigilante. That is being a 
grandfather who really cares for the security of his grandchildren. I 
would like to see some kind of action from the government that 
will say yes, let us make sense. Why not help parents and 
grandparents to protect the young people of our country? No, that 
interferes with the rights of criminals. I am sick and tired of 
hearing about the rights of criminals. That is all we ever hear. Not 
once do we hear about the rights of victims, only about the rights of 
criminals. It is so far outweighed it is sickening.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	I hope when these bleeding hearts get back into their 
constituencies the people will send them a loud and clear message 
for such things as setting up a registry of people who are on the 
streets and have the potential to hurt our kids. Setting up that 
registry makes perfectly good sense and would help make our 
country a better, safer place to live, a good old red book promise.
<P>
	Come on, get with it. Quit being a bunch of deadheads and start 
thinking about what is really right. Is the cabinet pulling the strings 
and will members be jumping up and voting no against this motion 
as well?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I was no fan of the 
Grateful Dead.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Is that supposed to be funny?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> I think the language used in the House has been at 
times unparliamentary and the people from Wild Rose expect more 
from their member.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> In the past we have heard 
many comments on decorum in the House and many comments that 
the public is tired of seeing the House reacting in this manner. I ask 
that we have order, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate your intervention. 
This is a civil forum and it allows elected members from various 
parts of Canada to exchange in a civil and correct manner.
<P>
	I also thank the hon. member for Wild Rose for his kind 
invitation to his constituency. I would be more than pleased to have 
a civil exchange with the hon. member and with his constituents on 
various issues of concern to the people.
<P>
	The motion, which we will oppose, was raised during a clause by 
clause review by the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs. The motion was ruled out of order because it entailed 
expenditure of funds and I believe cost saving measures are in 
order.
<P>
	However, the hon. member failed to recognize one of the major 
accomplishments of the government, the establishment of the 
Canadian police information centre, CPIC, announced in 
November 1994. I assure the hon. member and his constituency and 
all Canadians that CPIC basically provides a comprehensive 
registry, including an offender's entire criminal history and 
additional information such as whether an individual has a 
restraining order, a peace bond or is prohibited from working with 
children.
<P>
	We have had a number of cases in which in minor hockey 
leagues or when certain adults are called to supervise children, the 
organizations have access to this information. We encourage all 
volunteer service organizations in which children are involved to 
contact CPIC to make sure the people willing to lend their help are 
within the law and would not pose any danger to innocent children.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	The motion in question is unnecessary. It would otherwise be 
inappropriate for inclusion in a bill which deals with corrections 
and conditional release.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I will speak to Motion No. 16.
<P>
	It is interesting that my colleague from the Liberal Party spoke 
about ruling one of the motions out of order for lack of funds. This 
is the government in the process of spending $6 billion on 
infrastructure. This is the government which allows convicts, 
regardless of their conviction, to pick up old age security, the 
Canada pension plan and GST rebates. The government wants to 
move the motion out of order because it calls for an expenditure of 
funds. That is laughable.
<P>
	On a registry of sex offenders, the amending motion of my friend 
from Wild Rose is right. I would have the registry circulated 
throughout the country to all individuals, not just enforcement 
officers. It is about time we did that.
<P>
	I know Germaine is watching this. She is from my riding. If 
Germaine were in the House she would likely not hold back on a lot 
of the comments she has. Germaine was involved with a victim of 
Alan Winter. He molested, as far as we can find out in my riding 
thus far, in excess of 30 children over a number of years. They were 
young kids. He undertook the most heinous activities with these 
kids, which I shall not describe in the House.
<P>
	What do we do with Alan Winter? After Germaine took him to 
court a number of years ago we put him in prison and labelled him 
a dangerous offender. That means he should stay in prison for quite 
a long time. Along came more victims of Alan we did not know 
about and they tried to press charges, only to find out that after five 
years Alan Winter was let out unbeknownst to anybody. We also 
found out Alan Winter was on  unescorted passes while labelled a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14698"> 14698 </A></B>
<P>
dangerous offender. No one knew the predator was crawling 
through the streets of our communities.
<P>
	Where did he go? Good old Alan, courtesy of Canada, went to 
Britain. Interestingly enough a deal was made and he has dual 
citizenship and can return to Canada. There is no registry. Very few 
people know what he looks like. We have pictures of him. They are 
up on my office wall and they may well go in my householder.
<P>
	I want to read a letter from John Denham, an MP of 
Southampton, England, about this case:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am grateful for the assistance which you have given in providing details of 
the parole conditions attached to the release of Mr. Alan Winter.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As you may know, we in Southampton recently became aware that Mr. Winter 
was living in our community. People in Southampton were appalled to learn that 
he has served only a small part of a lengthy sentence imposed for appalling acts 
against children. They were equally concerned to learn that those agencies 
responsible for child protection had no knowledge of his presence in this city.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The information which you have provided confirms that Mr. Winter was 
released from prison on condition that he leave Canada and that he would be in 
prison once again if he returned to your country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is actually not the case. He is a citizen of both countries and 
can return to Canada. The letter continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I will of course be raising this matter with the British government's home, 
foreign and commonwealth offices. I will be asking them to make strong 
representation to the Canadian government to ensure that a situation like this 
can never arise again and that there is a clear agreement between two countries 
on the international application of parole conditions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would be grateful if you could make every effort to raise my concerns and 
those of my constituents in the Canadian Parliament. I believe that if Mr. Winter 
was not fit to be released into Canadian society he was not fit for release into my 
country either and I hope that you can express this view in the appropriate way.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	No one in this country knows really what he looks like. There is 
no registry. This guy is filthy scum. He has ruined the lives of 
countless young men and women. Today they are around the age of 
40. I have met with six of them in a room. Their lives are ruined. 
There is not even a registry on this guy.
<P>
	Some people are doing some things. Sandra Cunningham looks 
after the tri-city child care guide. I have spoken with Sandra many 
times. She has taken it on herself to put in this child care guide the 
pictures and MOs of these predators, these pedophiles. She is doing 
it at her own cost, her own risk.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> That is something the government should be 
doing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> That is right. My colleague 
from Calgary says that is something the government should be 
doing. It is opposing a motion that says exactly what so many 
people are trying to do. They want sex offenders on some form of 
registry. They want the registry to be available to everyone. They 
want to know who is living next door. It does not much matter if 
only the police know about it.
<P>
	I do not have access to CPIC. It is a police system. If I have 
children in my home I want to know who is living next door, if they 
are serious sexual offenders. Today in this country we are not 
permitted to know that, courtesy of this government.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And the parliamentary secretary over there is 
laughing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Yes, it is unfortunate, we even 
get laughs at this kind of stuff here.
<P>
	Let us take the matter away from the political sphere for a 
moment. Let us see what CAVEAT has to say about this, Canadians 
Against Violence Everywhere Advocating its Termination. Its 
members met and talked about this. In fact they have quite an 
interesting document from recent meetings which people from 
right across the country attended.
<P>
	One such group that met with CAVEAT is the Community 
Standards and Child Exploitation Committee. Its chairs included 
people like Justice John McGarry, Ontario Court of Justice, 
General Division; the London police were represented; the London 
family court; the president of a group against pornography and so 
on.
<P>
	What did these groups say about it? Is it just the Reform Party 
talking here? They state: ``We recommend the creation of a 
national child abuse registry. Such a registry would work in the 
same way as bonding at a financial institution. In order to work 
with children in a position of trust, such as teacher or babysitter, the 
onus is upon the prospective employee to produce an updated 
recent certificate from the registry to prove that the individual has 
no previous convictions for sexual offences against children. We 
acknowledge that those who sexually offend against children are 
highly likely to recidivate. Accordingly we recommend that if such 
offenders are to be released in the community, measures be 
undertaken to inform the community of the offender's release''.
<P>
	It is not just the Reform Party. This is across the country. If we 
are to err in areas of criminality we must err on the side of caution. 
We must take the route of protecting our young at all costs. We 
cannot afford to debate whether or not such things are as important 
as the other. What we must do is protect our young.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14699"> 14699 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	Therefore, can any Liberal in this House stand up and say that a 
national registry for sex offenders against children and others is not 
necessary for everybody? I keep hearing that we have one. CPIC 
has one. Members opposite do not understand. That is a police 
registry system. People do not have access to it. We must know 
who are the child offenders and who perpetrates these offences. We 
must know who they are, where they are and what their MOs are. It 
is critical.
<P>
	To listen to rhetoric like I just heard is just so Liberal. I cannot 
think of anything else. They got us into this mess and we are still in 
the mess. Notwithstanding CAVEAT, Victims of Violence, Citizens 
Against Violence Everywhere, the Melanie Carpenter Society and 
on and on, they do not listen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too would 
like to think the government would realize the importance of 
bringing in a child sex offender registry.
<P>
	We have had the parliamentary secretary tell us this morning that 
it is out of order because it will cost money. Surely the rights of the 
innocent deserve a little bit of money. We seem to spend millions 
and millions of dollars and all kinds of effort by the police to try to 
convict people after the crimes are committed.
<P>
	As we have heard the previous speaker tell us, even those who 
are convicted of dangerous offences and should be in jail, not only 
for a long time but perhaps as long as they live, are out on the 
street. Perhaps it is not a Canadian street but the street of another 
country, in order for them to continue to perpetrate these horrible 
and horrific crimes to destroy innocent young children who are the 
most precious people we have.
<P>
	The government is totally and absolutely opposed to trying to 
protect and help the innocent, not the criminals but the innocent, 
our young and vulnerable. The government is not prepared to spend 
any money whatsoever to help these people before they are 
victimized, before their lives are ruined and before they are turned 
perhaps into criminals themselves. The government would far 
rather keep the money and spend it on recycling prisoners through 
our jail system. They are out the door as soon as they are in to 
continue on in their awful ways.
<P>
	In the last little while I have been hearing about Gustafsen Lake 
on the television and the fact that we now have the criminals in that 
situation behind bars. It is said this is going to be the largest police 
investigation in history. No doubt millions and millions of dollars 
will be spent building a huge case against people who are obviously 
guilty. It is going to drag through the courts for months and perhaps 
years while the government says it has no money whatsoever to 
protect our young.
<P>
	In this House we have had debates covering weeks on setting up 
a registry for guns and other firearms. The  Minister of Justice is 
prepared to spend by his own admission up to $200 million of 
taxpayers' money to set up a national gun registration system so 
that law-abiding citizens can be registered, fined and penalized if 
convicted of not following the rules. This is $200 million of 
taxpayers' money. The innocent law-abiding citizens are going to 
be put through hoops time and time again. If they fail to register 
their guns they are going to be subject to the Criminal Code, 
imprisoned and everything else.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	These are not people who have committed a crime. They are not 
people who by and large will commit a crime. Yet the Minister of 
Justice says it is perfectly A-okay to spend $200 million on the 
effort. However there is no money to protect our young, our 
innocent and our vulnerable.
<P>
	Where is the government coming from? I cannot understand the 
logic of the $200 million, the imposition of all kinds of rules and 
regulations on law-abiding citizens. Yet the Minister of Justice 
absolutely and completely refuses to take the worst criminals in the 
country and put their names on a list to let people know who they 
are, where they are, what they have done and what they could do to 
children in our neighbourhoods.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> It does not make sense.
<P>
	The charter of rights and freedoms is hauled out every time 
somebody accused of a crime ends up in court. It is the criminals 
who always seem to benefit from it. However the charter of rights 
says we have the right to live free from fear, free from persecution, 
free of assault by someone else. We have these rights and freedoms 
and we should be able to enjoy them in a civilized society.
<P>
	Presumably the government is committed to protecting the 
charter of rights and freedoms and the rights and freedoms of the 
innocent individuals but it is not. It would far rather spend the 
taxpayers' money creating all kinds of rules for law-abiding people 
and letting those who have abused the privileges, assaulted our 
young, destroyed the vulnerable in society. The government is not 
prepared to spend any money on the law-abiding people 
whatsoever.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning of my speech, the parliamentary 
secretary ruled this motion out of order because it will cost some 
money. That speaks for itself and for the Liberal government that 
has its priorities totally and absolutely wrong. I think the Canadian 
people would agree with the Reform Party when we stand up and 
say: We want to protect our children. We want to protect our 
vulnerable, protect the innocent people in the land. If it takes a few 
dollars-not $200 million-to do so then it is money well spent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14700"> 14700 </A></B>
<P>
	I suggest that Mr. Rock cancel his gun registration program and 
use that money, if necessary 10 times over, on a program that will 
produce a child sex offence registry and the country will be far 
better off.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues we are all recently back in the 
House. I would ask all members to not refer to ministers by their 
surnames, family names or first names, but by the name of the 
ministry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to the debate on the amendments and I felt I had to say something 
on behalf of Canadians, particularly those in my constituency 
whom I met with over the summer and Canadians in Atlantic 
Canada whom I met with recently.
<P>
	Canadians are saying they want our justice system changed to 
give more protection to its citizens. They never talk about changing 
the system to give more protection to the criminal. They do not 
want that. They are not particularly concerned about spending more 
money to rehabilitate criminals although most want rehabilitation 
to take place where possible. Canadians want a justice system that 
protects the people.
<P>
	The amendments presented by the hon. member for Wild Rose 
provide more protection at least for a certain group of people, in 
this case, children. The amendment should certainly be supported 
by all members of the House. I just do not believe that all members 
of the House are not willing to put in place an amendment which 
would allow more protection for children. I find it hard to believe 
that they would not pass this amendment.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Specifically these amendments would put information on a 
police computer system, CPIC. It would allow information to be 
entered in the computer system on the modus operandi used by 
sexual offenders who commit sexual abuse on children. That is 
what the amendment would provide. It would make this 
information available to all peace officers across the country.
<P>
	In that way, if police were investigating a sexual offence against 
a child, they would have quick and ready access to information 
across the country which would point out if a similar type of a 
crime had been committed in another part of the country in the 
past.
<P>
	Also the amendment would give information to peace officers 
again on CPIC. Specifically it would give the location of the 
prisons in which offenders are imprisoned and the date of release of 
any offender who has committed a sexual offence against a child. 
Because the information would be on CPIC it would be readily 
available to all police officers across the country.
<P>
	Therefore it is very difficult for me to understand why the 
amendment would not be supported by all members of the House. 
For that reason too I thank the hon.  member for Wild Rose for 
bringing the amendment forward.
<P>
	There is much more that can be done. It is necessary to clearly 
redefine the priorities in our justice system. Through a conscious 
effort made by Liberal governments starting in 1972 with Solicitor 
General Goyer, the priorities of the justice system were shifted 
from a system that put the highest priority on the rights of the 
people in the country to be safe and to feel safe to the rights of the 
victims. They shifted the priorities to a situation where the top 
priority has become the rights of the criminal, the poor criminal; 
we have to do everything we can to protect the criminal, the rights 
of the criminal and the rehabilitation of the criminal. I do not think 
most Canadians believe the criminal should be the top priority in 
our justice system.
<P>
	The amendment proposed by the hon. member for Wild Rose 
will do something to shift the focus back again to the victims. For 
all the talk I have heard across the country about the need to care 
for the victims, I have not seen legislation in the House that has 
done much in terms of giving the victims more say, making them a 
higher priority within our justice system.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary to the solicitor general has said that 
the amendment cannot possibly go through because we cannot 
afford it. We have to always be very conscious of spending. The 
Reform zero in three plan which we presented across the country 
during the 1993 election campaign laid out in some detail a plan 
which would lead to a balanced budget in three years. In that plan 
we allowed for spending in the justice area. If we are to have the 
deterrents in place and the deterrents sometimes are longer prison 
sentences-other deterrents can be used as well-it costs money. It 
is a matter of priorizing spending. In our zero in three plan we did 
that. Justice is such a high priority that we allocated money to it.
<P>
	In our taxpayers' budget presented before the finance minister's 
budget last February we put aside money to put in place systems 
like the one proposed by the member for Wild Rose.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	We are always conscious of spending money but we also know 
how to priorize. It is important to know where Canadians are 
willing to spend money and where they are not. In most cases the 
government has those priorities completely turned around. It does 
not know what is important to Canadians and it does not know in 
what areas Canadians are willing to spend money and what areas 
they are not.
<P>
	It will take a continual reminder from us on this side of the 
House for government members of what is important to Canadians. 
It seems the government is out of touch. Perhaps I am being a little 
unfair when I say that all members of the governing party are out of 
touch,  because I believe it is mainly the cabinet, the old boys who 
have been around for years that are out of touch.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14701"> 14701 </A></B>
<P>
	Unfortunately in the old party system that is all that really 
matters. If the leader of a party wants it done this way it will be 
done this way. We have seen party discipline that is way beyond 
democratic. It is anti-democratic. We have seen party discipline 
used in the House over and over again, to the extent that the 
members of Parliament who know what the people want are 
completely ignored and are not even allowed to vote for what their 
constituents want.
<P>
	The system is in collapse and it must be fixed. Until the system 
is fixed I suspect the legislation in the area of justice will do very 
little to improve the system.
<P>
	Positive proposals like those presented by the member for Wild 
Rose will continue to be ignored in spite of the fact that many 
members across the floor, those who are still in touch with their 
constituents, know they should be passed. The Prime Minister says 
that they are not going to support it, the whip cracks the whip and 
those members have no voice.
<P>
	I do not care much that members of Parliament have no voice, 
but I do care that their constituents have no voice. It is time that 
was changed. The changes to the justice system that we need, the 
changes that Reform has proposed in the House over and over 
again, will not happen until the system is fixed. We have to fix it. 
We have to fix it quickly, but I am afraid it will not happen with the 
government that is in place.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Motion No. 19 concerns a difference of opinion about whether or 
not there should be or may be a mandatory review of parole board 
decisions if someone who is out on parole commits a crime.
<P>
	Our belief is that there should be a mandatory review of parole 
board decisions when it makes errors. I will give some examples. I 
have mentioned it twice but I have to mention the Wayne Perkin 
case again because it is so close to the real problem. This fellow 
went into a home, coerced an individual in my community into her 
garden shed, beat her over the head with a hammer, raped her, taped 
her hands behind her back, injected her with cocaine and left her 
for dead. He got six years, which is light, was put out on parole and 
while on parole murdered Angela Richards.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I always wondered in that particular case as I attended the 
sentencing hearing where the parole board was. What 
responsibility and what accountability are on the parole board for 
the absolutely disastrous error it made? Had Perkin not got out on 
parole the first time for such a terrible crime, Angela Richards 
would be alive today. I have talked with Corrine and Ron about it, 
Angela's sister and brother-in-law. That is one of the significant 
questions they have.
<P>
	Why is the parole board that made this terrible decision going on 
with more decisions? Why is it not held accountable? Why was it 
not brought in to listen to the whole court case? Surely we need to 
have better answers.
<P>
	This is what the motion is talking about. It wants a mandatory 
review of its decisions. I am for the termination of employment of 
those people when they make such drastic decisions. What we are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14702"> 14702 </A></B>
<P>
asking for  seems realistic. It seems the Liberal government should 
agree that there be a mandatory review.
<P>
	Let us talk a bit about parole for a moment. Most of us are aware 
that we have a legal system and not a justice system in Canada. It is 
fraught with lawyers who have made it so convoluted, so difficult 
to understand and so complex that the average person has lost his or 
her way throughout the system.
<P>
	Since 1975, 240 murders have been committed by parolees. 
They say 70 per cent of those on full parole are successful, but it is 
the 30 per cent who are the problem.
<P>
	Not too long ago I received a call from a parole board member 
who was upset at my making these kinds of comments. He said that 
in his region there was an 87 per cent success rate. I said: ``While 
that is nice, I wonder if the victims take much consolation in the 13 
per cent failure rate''. We cannot tell Corrine and Ron that 
everything should be a bit better for them because we have an 87 
per cent success rate. They are a part of the 13 per cent failure rate, 
and that is what we have to concentrate on.
<P>
	In 1977, 85 per cent of parole board members had experience in 
the justice system; in 1988, just 10 years later, 53 per cent. It went 
down. Why did it go down? It was because that party and the other 
party from Jurassic Park started appointing their friends to parole 
board positions. How do I know? In 1993, 16 of 22 full or part time 
members were either defeated or failed politicians.
<P>
	What kind of decisions do we get from them? They are their 
friends. They are party hacks. They collected money for your 
campaigns. The cost of doing that business results in people like 
Angela Richards being stabbed 22 times and murdered 
unnecessarily. This is not much consolation for Corrine and Ron, or 
Mrs. Richards.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Do we have any solutions? What do we do when they let these 
people out and they ruin the lives of thousands of people? There is 
no question that parole board members need more training. If the 
Liberals are going to run this country by a majority and they are 
going to put all their friends into these important jobs, then they 
should at least have the courtesy to the rest of us to train them.
<P>
	I was in a parole board hearing not too long ago and received 
some information from an administrator who said that the 
psychologists' reports, which are relied upon for decisions by 
parole boards, are going to be given to them in a précis. That is just 
a short capsulation by a civil servant who makes a judgment as to 
what a psychologist says on five or six pages.
<P>
	I can say that when people like Wayne Perkin go up before a 
parole board I would really like them to have a full psychologist's 
assessment and not a précis. Listen to  what we are saying. The 
safety of the public is the number one concern.
<P>
	While the heads are down and they are all quiet over there I 
cannot understand why they would oppose a mandatory review. 
Just exactly what is wrong with a mandatory review of a parole 
board and its members for making bad decisions?
<P>
	It is understandable why we stand here in frustration and say this 
is absolute common sense. What is the problem? Who are you not 
listening to?
<P>
	I would like to give some recommendations from another group.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member has approximately two 
minutes left, but when he says you and looks across the Chamber 
the poor Speaker is left thinking that nobody cares whether he or 
she is here at all. I would ask the member to please look this way 
when he says you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I will talk through you, 
Mr. Speaker. It is difficult enough talking about this over here, 
because it does not register in here.
<P>
	We have to bite the bullet in this country and remove bad 
decision makers. The bad decision makers were in part responsible 
for a young lady losing her life by allowing a terrible criminal out 
on parole, and they walked away unscathed. They did not even get 
a reprimand on their job performance sheets. Nothing happened. 
Maybe one said: ``I am sorry''. A hell of a lot of good that is to 
Corrine, Ron, or Angela.
<P>
	Some day either they are going to have to listen over here or they 
are going to be replaced. The time is coming because these Liberals 
are not listening to a major groundswell in this country.
<P>
	Since I only have a minute, I am going to give you one 
recommendation from CAVEAT, Canadians Against Violence 
Everywhere Advocating its Termination. ``Allow discipline of 
parole board members short of termination to be carried out by the 
chairman of the National Parole Board, a procedure akin to the 
Federal Inquiries Act, allowing for private or public inquiries. A 
mandate for a maximum five-year term of appointment for parole 
board members''. They are not going to listen.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I must tell the member that his time has 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I wish I had an hour.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I was watching 
the debate on television outside the Chamber and heard the 
member who just spoke use unparliamentary language. I would like 
to draw it to your attention and to his and request that you ask him 
to withdraw the comments he made and refrain in future from using 
that kind of language in the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14703"> 14703 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member. Perhaps we 
should all remind ourselves that there are certain words that are 
unparliamentary. We all know which ones they are. There is a 
fairly short list now.
<P>
	The first test is that the language does not cause an uproar. I did 
hear the expression the member referred to and I noticed that there 
was no uproar caused by the expression. Frankly, I was surprised 
by that. I would ask all members that since we are starting afresh 
this fall to please, if they hear something offensive, get up and put 
the objection on the floor immediately rather than waiting.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member will take note of what has been said. I 
would ask then if we are ready for the question.
<P>
	The member is entitled to reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of 
order, I would like to know what I said that was offensive.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is a phrase we have all heard many 
times involving a word that begins with <I>h</I> and ends with <I>l</I>. I do not 
think the Chair should string this thing out.
<P>
	Is the parliamentary secretary to the solicitor general rising on a 
point of order or on debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is on a point of order and it could very well lead to a 
debate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am afraid the hon. parliamentary 
secretary has to choose. If it is on debate, it is the turn of the Liberal 
Party and the hon. parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are discussing the last 
motion raised by the opposition, Motion No. 19.
<P>
	We heard a number of things here this morning and indeed most 
of yesterday afternoon about Canadians having a constant worry 
about the apparent rise in criminality in the country. I think we 
should keep in mind that criminality in Canada has been somewhat 
stable for the past 20 years. The statistics are there. There have 
indeed been a number of cases that were brought to the attention of 
the public and many of those were indeed heinous crimes and very 
disturbing. That is why the government and we on this side of the 
House have done considerable work to try to reduce criminality and 
make Canada a safer place.
<P>
	I found it interesting when I heard a number of members claim 
that the federal government is not putting any money whatsoever 
into trying to protect Canadians and especially our youth. I would 
like to point out that the Ministry of the Solicitor General of 
Canada  is one of the few departments that has seen a slight 
increase in its expenditures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, a while ago we 
were talking about the finances. Now we are on Motion No. 19 
dealing with parole. I would like the member to stick to the subject.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All hon. members will understand the 
relevance rule. It is even more important since we are discussing 
motions and perhaps second reading. I am sure the hon. 
parliamentary secretary will make his remarks relevant very 
quickly.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have heard from the opposition on Motion No. 19, on 
Motion No. 16, and on all the other motions. I think we have been 
patient enough on this side of the House by giving these people the 
chance to express themselves. What we have heard all day is a 
well-founded concern about the safety of Canadians. However, 
after hearing a number of those debates it is my opinion and that of 
most members of the House that often the information that was 
introduced by the opposition was not entirely correct.
<P>
	We have the obligation to explain to these people, as it concerns 
Motion No. 19, that we have done a number of things to make 
Canada a safer place. I will make this point very briefly. I think that 
members sitting on the opposition benches should know that 
money has been put into the system. We are out there protecting 
Canadians. We are now spending considerable amounts of money 
building new facilities. That was a concern raised by the 
opposition. Five new facilities are going to open in the short term 
here in Canada in order to accommodate the incarcerated members 
of our society.
<P>
	There was also talk about CPIC, the screening mechanism we 
now have in place. We should also inform the hon. members of the 
opposition that they have the right through various service and 
volunteer associations, for instance the brownies, the scouts, minor 
hockey and what not, to screen volunteers in these organizations 
for a previous criminal record to avoid endangering the lives of 
many young innocent Canadians. We have instituted that. It is a 
tangible benefit from the Liberal government. We are concerned 
about the safety of the younger members of our society.
<P>
	We also spoke about gun control. If opposition members are 
concerned about the rise in criminality, why did they oppose gun 
control? That is a fundamental issue. Most crimes committed in 
Canada are committed with guns and rifles. Often these weapons 
are acquired illegally. We are trying to make Canada a safer place, 
and this is all we have heard all day. The opposition benches are 
supposed to be the law and order side of government, but we have 
done the tangible thing. We have done the right thing. We pushed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14704"> 14704 </A></B>
<P>
through the gun control law  because it was the will and the wish of 
the Canadian public, as numerous polls have suggested.
<P>
	I could continue. We have made amendments to the Criminal 
Code to tighten up the intoxication defence. We were referring to 
cases where someone was under the influence of certain drugs and 
alcohol and had committed a crime. That will no longer be 
admissible in court. That is very tangible. I think the ministry and 
the Government of Canada should be applauded for their efforts.
<P>
	We have set up the task force on high risk, violent offenders. We 
are reviewing that with our provincial and territorial counterparts. 
We have experts in the field looking into this. Of course more can 
be done, but we do have the commitment of the government. We 
have the commitment of the Solicitor General and the Minister of 
Justice to do something about it.
<P>
	There was also Bill C-37. They made no mention of it. We have 
tightened up the Young Offenders Act. We are making it more 
difficult for youngsters to come out. We are imposing different 
rules and regulations in order to make Canada a safer place. The 
public should know that. The public has a right to know what we 
are doing, instead of going on with these debates and these 
unfounded arguments, which are not based on fact. Factually, I 
think we have done a commendable job.
<P>
	We have also created a national crime prevention council. The 
Government of Canada, after two years, with its so-called liberal 
values as members opposite like to call them, has proven to the 
Canadian public that it is taking these concerns very seriously.
<P>
	Another one is the DNA legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine):</B> Exactly. I 
am happy to see that the hon. member for Wild Rose is approving 
our initiative. We are trying to do what was never done in the past. 
The previous government did not measure up and that is why it was 
soundly defeated.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	We on the government side after two years in the House are 
starting to show Canadians we are taking very seriously these 
concerns. That is why I have a duty as a parliamentarian and we 
have a duty as a government to explain this to the public, to explain 
this to, I must admit, the misinformed and ill-informed members of 
the opposition.
<P>
	Another private member's bill came to our attention, the witness 
protection program. Again we are trying to encourage Canadians 
who in some cases are in difficult situations and we are asking for 
their help in trying to find the criminal elements in Canada and to 
bring them out to public view in order to try them in a court of law.
<P>
	What we have done over the past two years is quite 
commendable. There are a number of instances where we can do 
more no doubt. The various accomplishments of our most 
competent Minister of Justice and the Solicitor General of Canada 
prove once again the the Liberal government is taking Canadians' 
concerns very seriously.
<P>
	This is all within the purview of Motion No. 19. Why we are 
opposing the hon. member's motion is that in our opinion, and 
given these recent accomplishments by the Government of Canada, 
there is sufficient inquiry powers under the Inquiries Act and 
Corrections and Condition Release Act to address instances where 
a conditionally released offender commits a serious crime. The 
disciplinary inquiry should not be misused for that purpose.
<P>
	In all fairness to the government, in all fairness to the people of 
Canada we are very concerned about their security. I regret to say 
the opposition benches have not been paying much attention to our 
accomplishments. That is why in Reform country and in other parts 
of Canada we are trying to reassure Canadians we are taking their 
concerns in a most serious sense.
<P>
	I am very pleased the hon. member for Wild Rose has invited me 
once again to his wonderful riding. I have never had the privilege 
of going to that part of Alberta. It is one of the most beautiful 
provinces in Canada, especially with the Rockies. During the 
referendum debate this is an issue we would like to bring up.
<P>
	However, we will not support this opposition motion and I would 
gladly like to debate this a little further with the hon. member for 
Wild Rose in his constituency.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, quite a 
bit was said by my colleague from Fraser Valley in terms of giving 
examples of why Motion No. 19 is on the floor, why we want this 
review in place when there has obviously been something that did 
not go right. Simply asking for a review makes sense.
<P>
	If we parole a killer and he kills somebody again, it is only 
common sense that we look at the results that brought us to that 
decision. How many times do we have to say that? It is called 
accountability. It is time all of us became accountable for that for 
which we are responsible.
<P>
	We have the charter of rights and freedoms. We really need a 
charter of responsibilities. It should apply to everyone, including 
members of parole boards.
<P>
	I believe in this past year there have been some improvements. 
One improvement was the firing of the previous chairman of the 
parole board and the hiring of the new one. I compliment the 
present chairman. I have had many visits with the present 
chairman. He wants to ensure to the best of his ability that the most 
competent people, the most able, the most knowledgeable are 
placed in those positions.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14705"> 14705 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	The biggest fear I have for him is that patronage goes on and on, 
another patronage appointment. I read not too long ago that 11 
people were put on the queen's bench across the provinces; failed 
Liberal candidates, party hacks and fundraisers to fill the benches 
across the land. Mr. justice minister and his 11 disciples are now in 
place.
<P>
	Making patronage appointments is not the way to fill these 
positions. The present chairman of the board wants competent 
people. He is very knowledgeable. If we allow him the authority to 
run it the way he feels appropriate it will be better. Nevertheless, 
regardless of whether they are judges or whatever else, everybody 
has to be responsible for what they are expected to do.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, being from Edmonton you will remember Daniel 
Gingras. Good old Daniel Gingras, the guy who was awarded a 
birthday pass. Remember how it blew everybody's mind that this 
killer, this dangerous offender, could be awarded a birthday pass. 
He had been in for a long time and the parole board decided he 
should have a birthday pass. Not only that, it allowed him to pick 
the guard to go with him because it was supposed to be a supervised 
day.
<P>
	I do not have to say he sized the guard up. He did not pick the 
most powerful, biggest one he could find. He picked the one he 
thought he could overcome, and he did. How many women died 
that day, two or three? And nobody is accountable.
<P>
	Surely with something like that it would make sense to review 
the whole thing to make sure it never happens again, which is all 
this motion is asking for. It will not create a huge expense. It will 
not do anything except accomplish one thing, an effort to make 
sure we are accountable to the people of Canada when we are 
drawing money from them and filling our pockets with 
paycheques. If we are being paid by the people we should be 
accountable to them. This motion will allow that.
<P>
	Once again it blows my mind how anybody can oppose such a 
common sense motion. I heard rhetoric a few minutes ago by the 
parliamentary secretary about all of the wonderful things this 
genius of a justice minister has done. He has not done anything. 
There has been nothing accomplished. Wait, he fixed the Young 
Offenders Act. No he did not. Wait, let us talk about guns, 
remember? He has fixed that. He has gone after duck hunters, deer 
hunters and rabbit shooters. Give me a break.
<P>
	I forgot about Bill C-41. Now we have done it. We will get tough 
on those who commit crime based on hate. We will let them have it. 
However, if we ask them to get tough on all crime they say that is 
not the Liberal way. They talk out of four sides of their mouths. 
Sometimes I do not know what they do want.
<P>
	I have one last appeal. It is time people who are paid by 
Canadians are held accountable for the decisions and the jobs they 
do. This motion would help that happen.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADA-UNITEDSTATESTAXCONVENTIONACT,1984">CANADA-UNITED STATES TAX CONVENTION ACT, 
1984</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (on behalf of the Minister of Finance)</B> 
moved that Bill S-9, an act to amend the Canada-United States Tax 
Convention Act, be read the second time and referred to 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak in 
support of Bill S-9 to ratify the recently-signed revised Protocol to 
the Canada-United States Tax Convention.
<P>
	This is work-a-day legislation that addresses the dual issues of 
fair taxation and good international relations. In fact, Canada 
currently has double-taxation conventions in force with 55 
countries, including the U.S.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14706"> 14706 </A></B>
<P>
	This particular agreement was originally signed in 1980. The 
protocol being ratified under S-9 will be the third formal 
modification enacted over a 15-year period.
<P>
	A substantial amount of the protocol deals with technical issues 
of definition and clarification of existing rules regarding taxes on 
income and capital. But there are also a number of important 
changes which should deliver real benefits to Canada and 
Canadians, or that enhance the fairness of the two tax systems as 
they apply to non-residents.
<P>
	One of these important elements is that the protocol reduces or 
eliminates the rate of witholding tax that each country will apply to 
interest payments, direct dividends and certain royalties.
<P>
	Canada and the U.S. already enjoy the most extensive trade 
relationship of any two industrial nations in the world.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	And our exports to the U.S. are a critical component of Canada's 
1994 economic growth, which was the best in the G-7.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	By reducing tax withholding rates this protocol should ease and 
encourage the continuing growth of this trade and investment 
between our two nations. I should mention that it brings these rates 
into line with those provided in the OECD model tax convention, 
rates accepted by a majority of the 25 member countries of that 
organization.
<P>
	Let me outline the specifics of these changes. Under the protocol 
the general rate of holding tax on direct dividends will be reduced 
to 5 per cent by 1997 from the current 10 per cent. In consequence, 
the protocol also drops the rate of the branch tax to 5 per cent again 
by 1997.
<P>
	Regarding the withholding tax on interest payments, the protocol 
will see the rate reduced to 10 per cent from the 15 per cent rate that 
applied under the previous 1984 protocol. As well, the new 
agreement ensures that interest paid between a buyer and an 
unrelated seller will continue to be exempt from the withholding 
tax in the source country, even if the indebtedness has been 
transferred to a third person.
<P>
	Finally, this agreement will eliminate completely the 
withholding tax on royalties on computer software and on patent 
and technological information. Let me remind this House that this 
bilateral relief will have very beneficial effects: first, by reducing 
the cost to Canadian companies of accessing technology and 
know-how from the U.S.; and second, by enhancing the ability of 
Canadian high tech firms to sell their products and services in the 
U.S.
<P>
	Let me move to another area where Bill S-9 will have a 
beneficial impact: it will restore fairness regarding the  impact of 
U.S. estate taxes on Canadians holding property there. I should 
acknowledge right off that there have been some concerns raised 
about this aspect of Bill S-9. Let me be blunt. Anyone who thinks 
that this is an unwarranted tax gift to the wealthy is mistaken and 
clearly does not understand the legislation and the changes in U.S. 
law it addresses.
<P>
	Under current U.S. law enacted in 1988, Canadians who die 
holding U.S. property valued at over $60,000 U.S. may be subject 
to U.S. estate taxes. This is a much lower threshold than American 
citizens face. Once the protocol is ratified by our two nations 
however, Canadian residents will be entitled to treatment that is not 
less favourable than that available to our American neighbours. In 
other words, this means Canadians will generally not be subjected 
to estate taxes unless the value of the individual's worldwide gross 
estate exceeds $600,000. In addition, a special marital credit will 
be available with respect to property transferred to the spouse of 
the deceased.
<P>
	There is a further change, again to enhance fairness in the way 
our two tax systems operate, involving U.S. estate taxes and their 
Canadian equivalent. Under the protocol our government has 
agreed to provide a credit against Canadian taxes on U.S. source 
income to the estate of a Canadian citizen in those cases where U.S. 
estate taxes are also levied. The United States will grant a 
reciprocal credit for Canadian income taxes levied on a deceased 
American.
<P>
	Incidentally, it is also important to note that this provision is 
effective retroactively for death occurring after November 10, 1988 
when the major changes to the U.S. estate taxes affecting Canadian 
residents were introduced.
<P>
	Let me reiterate that these changes do not represent a gift of any 
sort to any Canadian. Given the fiscal challenges facing our 
government, we have no interest in helping the affluent escape 
paying their fair share of taxes. But fairness equally demands that 
no Canadian, whatever their means, should be cavalierly subject to 
the bane of double taxation. This is what this tax treaty protocol 
works to do, eliminate double taxation.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	The changes agreed to by our nations recognize that while both 
Canada and the United States impose taxes regarding death, these 
take two separate forms. The U.S. applies an estate tax, but in 
Canada the levy takes the form of an income tax on any 
appreciation of a deceased's property over his or her lifetime. It is 
these different forms of death tax that have created a problem.
<P>
	Canada, like most countries, has rules to prevent double 
taxation. However, these rules do not cover a situation like this 
where the taxes are imposed in different forms. As a result, unless 
the dilemma is corrected cases could arise where the estate of a 
Canadian  with U.S. property would face combined Canadian and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14707"> 14707 </A></B>
<P>
American taxes conceivably exceeding the property's value. 
Obviously, that is absurd.
<P>
	Our revised Canada-U.S. tax treaty corrects the problem. It does 
so by allowing Canadians to credit U.S. estate taxes against 
Canadian income taxes on U.S. income. In parallel, it allows 
Americans to credit Canadian income taxes against the U.S. estate 
tax liability.
<P>
	I have covered the two most important areas of the tax treaty 
change that this legislation will ratify. There is another aspect to 
the protocol that I would like to review briefly. This deals with 
social security payments made by one country to someone who is 
now a resident of another country. Under the existing convention, 
such payments are not taxable in the source country. In other 
words, an old age security or Canada pension plan payment to 
someone who now lives in the United States is not subject to 
Canadian tax and only one-half of the benefit is taxable in the other 
country. Once the protocol is ratified however, social security 
benefits paid from one country will be taxable exclusively in that 
country. They will no longer be subject to tax in the other country.
<P>
	I should point out that once the protocol is ratified our 
government will be proposing amendments in the Income Tax Act 
to apply the non-resident withholding tax to these payments. These 
should take effect next year.
<P>
	The issues I have highlighted represent the most important and 
substantive changes to the existing tax convention between Canada 
and the United States. Now let me flag some of the more technical 
amendments the protocol also addresses.
<P>
	There is a provision allowing for a better working of the rules 
concerning charitable contributions to tax exempt organizations of 
the other state.
<P>
	Another provision covers an arbitration mechanism for the 
settlement of difficulties over the interpretation or application of 
this convention.
<P>
	The protocol also introduces an article providing for assistance 
in the collection of taxes of the other state and to improve the 
exchange of tax information between our two countries.
<P>
	These are small but useful steps for improving our country's 
ability to collect taxes owing, something the Minister of Finance 
pledged loud and clear in the February budget.
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill S-9 is the result of carefully considered 
negotiations between Canada and the United States and I ask the 
House for its support as soon as possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as far as 
Bill S-9, whose purpose is to amend the August 31, 1994 tax 
convention between Canada and the United States, is concerned, 
we do not see any major problems  with these amendments to a tax 
convention that was first signed with the U.S. in 1980, if I am not 
mistaken, and then amended in 1983 and again in 1984. So this is 
the third time we are amending this tax convention to make it better 
with time and facilitate trade between Canada and the U.S. to the 
maximum extent possible. I will get back to these trade relations 
between Canada and the U.S. and between Canada and its other 
trading partners toward the end of my speech.
<P>
	Of course, since this is my first speech in this House since 
Parliament reconvened, I cannot help but point out that our 
legislative agenda is extremely modest. The bills we are reviewing 
are anything but controversial or would have very little impact in 
the short term. In other words, we are trying to dispose of our 
leftovers.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	While we might have expected, upon returning to the House, to 
be able to debate the reforms announced by the government that are 
late in coming with respect to unemployment, the old age pension 
plan, the human resources investment fund as well as the 
long-awaited GST reform that the Liberal Party promised in the 
election to carry out within two years. Time is running out; we are 
almost there. We now realize that this will not happen. There is 
absolutely nothing on the table indicating this can be done within 
the next two years.
<P>
	Since these matters are not on the table, we are debating those 
bills that were tabled. However, we can deplore the fact that a 
government which claims to be concerned with job creation and the 
real problems has put so little on the table for the people of Quebec 
and Canada to enable us to discuss the economic and social future 
of this country as seen by this government. Instead, we are debating 
other important issues. There is no denying that tax conventions are 
important, but we would have liked to be able to discuss other 
topics as well.
<P>
	Coming back to this convention and the subject of tax 
conventions in general, the purpose of tax conventions is to avoid 
double taxation, that is to say the levying of taxes in two different 
countries on foreign investments. This fosters the free movement 
of capital without putting tax barriers in the way of investing in 
other regions. And this fits in with the strong world-wide trend 
towards free capital flow. This is a good thing in that it allows 
resources to be directed where they will be the most useful to make 
better use of often scarce resources. In time, this will enable us to 
improve our economic system, provided of course that we manage 
to incorporate the other factors.
<P>
	So, avoiding double taxation and ensuring that fiscal constraints 
are not created fosters trade between countries. Bilateral trade 
between Canada and the United States is constantly growing. As 
well, trade between Quebec and the U.S. is also on the rise, 
particularly since the free trade agreement, which received strong 
support  from Quebecers, came into effect. In fact, Quebecers were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14708"> 14708 </A></B>
<P>
the instigators of this agreement. Therefore, we are dealing with a 
strong tendency.
<P>
	We know that a north-south pattern, that is commercial trade 
between the U.S. and Canada or Quebec, is often much more 
natural than an east-west movement.
<P>
	We often overlook the fact that it is very appealing to trade with 
several northern U.S. states, given their huge potential market, both 
for Quebec and for Canada. The same is true for western provinces 
in particular, but also for Ontario. There is a huge market out there 
and this is why we must ensure the best possible movement of 
capital, goods and services between the two countries.
<P>
	I am pleased to see that the Liberal Party finally changed its tune 
regarding international trade. As you remember, the Liberals were 
strongly opposed to the free trade agreement. Even during the 
election campaign, they still had some reservations. However, once 
they came to office and saw the benefits of that treaty, common 
sense prevailed. I am glad to see that when the government is 
confronted with economic reality, common sense prevails. And this 
will always be the case in the future.
<P>
	I am also pleased to see that the Prime Minister's views on 
international trade, which seemed so irresponsible to me during the 
election campaign, have now been adjusted in light of reality.
<P>
	Sure, we can criticize someone who says one thing during the 
election campaign only to act differently once in office. However, 
that irresponsibility is not related to what is said or done once in 
office: rather, it has to do with the promises made to Canadians 
during the campaign and the resulting expectations.
<P>
	The government's attitude is now much more responsible. And 
that is true in the case of international trade. We are pleased to see 
that Canada is prepared to accept Chile as a party to the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. Indeed, we are glad to see that 
when there are real opportunities to promote economic trade, the 
government leaves politics aside and strives to promote the 
development of new markets.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	All this leads me to believe that, if Quebecers decide, as they 
will be asked to do very shortly, to opt for political sovereignty and 
be in charge of their own political agenda, their tax system and 
their economy, logic and common sense will prevail. I think 
Quebecers realize that. My riding is right on the border with 
Ontario, and I think people are well aware of the day-to-day reality 
of this when they go and buy or sell goods outside the province. So 
the economy is one thing and, in many cases, the interests of 
partisan politics are something else altogether.
<P>
	As far as tax treaties are concerned, I must say that although it is 
not the first time we have discussed tax treaties since the beginning 
of this session-there were a number of other occasions-we never 
really tackled a problem mentioned by the auditor general, when he 
said that tax treaties were a very good way to avoid double taxation 
but that in some cases, when tax rates differed substantially in each 
country, they could lead to a tax haven. It could be very attractive 
for some people to put their profits on the books of a foreign branch 
instead of letting them be realized by parent corporations which are 
often located in countries with higher tax rates.
<P>
	This is quite a problem. The auditor general gave 16 examples 
which could be considered tax havens, to varying degrees. Some 
very slight changes were made in one of the finance minister's two 
budgets, but they were not more than that. There have been no 
further discussions on the subject since that time, but we will have 
to do it sooner or later.
<P>
	Trade is expanding between countries throughout the world. The 
free trade movement is spreading and covers all of North America. 
If you go to South America, each country has its own tax system. 
Increasingly, multinationals are using the so-called butterfly 
system, in which certain components are manufactured by one 
company and other components by another company. They are all 
connected to the same corporation which, in the process, manages 
to pay the lowest possible tax rate.
<P>
	Companies do that, they hire tax experts to check the various tax 
rates and best locations for booking losses and profits. These 
companies sell goods to each other, to their various branches, and 
they can often artificially change their prices so as to channel their 
profits to the country with the most attractive tax rate and their 
losses to another country. Furthermore, in Canada, interest 
payments on loans are tax deductible.
<P>
	So a company can decide it is attractive to borrow money here, 
to use our tax system to deduct interest costs, and then try to 
channel profits to another location. We must not forget that capital 
losses are also deductible in this country, which is normal, so they 
can declare their losses here, take advantage of the deduction on 
interest payments and channel their profits abroad. This is quite a 
problem.
<P>
	It is less of a problem with our biggest trading partner, the 
United States. But that does not mean it is not a problem in the 16 
cases listed by the auditor general. As I said, we must not 
necessarily assume that the same degree is involved in all 16 cases, 
but an extremely thorough analysis would need to be done, looking 
at each situation closely.
<P>
	The government has undertaken no action in this connection. 
The finance minister has even been questioned on this matter on 
several occasions and has never even admitted that it was a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14709"> 14709 </A></B>
<P>
problem for him. Under such circumstances, we have a long way to 
go. It is  like denying reality. As you know, in solving problems the 
first step is admitting there is a problem. I therefore hope that my 
colleagues in the government who are present will be able to make 
the minister aware that there is a major problem he will have to 
address. It is certain that our Parliament can pass tax conventions 
piecemeal, one at a time, as they are modified and adopted. Others 
will need to be adopted in future with other countries with which 
we might create economic ties.
<P>
	There is much talk of Canada's turning its eyes to Asian markets. 
One day there will also be talk of agreements with them, and that 
will have to be looked into. It would therefore be rather appropriate 
for somebody, somewhere, who is concerned with real problems 
and admits to being concerned with real problems to say that this is 
something that needs further examination.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	There is no denying it could become a financial problem, at a 
time when we are continuing to tighten the screws on society's 
most disadvantaged, claiming rightly that public finances are in a 
sorry state. Socially, however, it is becoming hard to accept, 
because the same people are always being hit.
<P>
	I understand that these things are complex and not easy to 
explain to the public, but it is our job to follow them.
<P>
	According to a newspaper article I was reading, there is even a 
Liberal member challenging this and other tax conventions and 
other government actions, on sometimes legitimate and sometimes 
debatable issues. So, as we can see, even within their ranks, things 
are not unanimous. It would be worthwhile discussing this 
seriously.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Finance would be an appropriate 
venue, but this must not become simply a matter of passing a hot 
potato on to the committee so the minister does not have to deal 
with it. We have to give some quick thought to the situation.
<P>
	This bill is at second reading and will go to the Standing 
Committee on Finance between second and third reading. There is 
one aspect of this convention, which the parliamentary secretary 
talked about earlier and which we will be wanting clarification on. 
It has to do with the fact that an amendment in 1988 in the United 
States reduced the non taxable amount of estates for foreigners 
from $600,000 to $60,000. This tax convention re-establishes the 
non taxable amount of foreigners' estates at $600,000.
<P>
	As, today, we are correcting matters and returning to the 1988 
figure, it appears that the amendment is retroactive. In a number of 
cases, therefore, it will mean expenditures, because at the same 
time a deduction will be allowed for amounts paid as taxes on 
estates.
<P>
	This point requires some technical clarification. I am not sure I 
have hit on the effects of the provision, but we would be happy to 
clarify this in committee and to have a better look at what it is 
about. I noted that the parliamentary secretary indicated this was a 
good thing to do. I know that the matter was discussed in the Senate 
as well. We in the finance committee can seek clarification from 
department officials and make sure that, if it is done retroactively, 
there is some logic behind it and that the government does not lose 
a lot of money to people who might be able to afford these taxes.
<P>
	It is a sensitive issue. I have some problems with it. It is difficult 
to accept such changes on a retroactive basis. This is something 
governments are increasingly resorting to and it is a rather 
dangerous trend. It would be better if retroactive amendments were 
to the people's advantage, but that is not always the case. We have 
been through this before. I remember in particular the cool 
reception given the rather important retroactive amendment made 
by the former government of the current leader of the No side in 
Quebec.
<P>
	It is difficult because individuals are being asked to act more 
responsibly, to plan for their retirement, and so on, while the 
government can decide to change the rules of the game from year to 
year. The retroactive effect of one provision of the amendments to 
the convention is something that should be clarified in committee.
<P>
	In conclusion, may I remind you that this tax convention is 
nothing new. These are simply amendments to a convention that 
was signed with the U.S. 15 years ago. This is the third time it is 
being amended. That is quite normal. Things evolve with time, 
allowing us to improve economic relations, especially since the 
1988 free trade agreement with the U.S., which is an important 
instrument of future trade for both Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	I am happy to see that when the government side does something 
concrete for the economy, common sense prevails over last year's 
electoral stand on the U.S. They must be pragmatic enough to make 
sure that businesspeople in both Quebec and Canada can do 
business and be as profitable and efficient as possible so they can 
contribute to the country's economic growth.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	I hope they will take the same attitude during the Quebec 
referendum campaign, although I doubt they will because of their 
partisan politics. But common sense will prevail again the day 
after. The economy is one thing, but politics is something else.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to support Bill S-9 amending the Canada-United States Tax 
Convention Act of 1984 for a third time, as mentioned by the two 
previous speakers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14710"> 14710 </A></B>
<P>
	For all intents and purposes the act is already a done deal as 
its contents were agreed on in a protocol signed by trade 
representatives from both countries on March 17, 1995. The 
protocol bill became Bill S-9 and the Senate subsequently 
approved it on May 3, 1995. That leaves it up to members of the 
House of Commons and specifically members of the Standing 
Committee on Finance to give it one last good look.
<P>
	Basically tax treaties and their amending protocols have two 
main objectives, the avoidance of double taxation and the 
prevention of fiscal evasion. Since they contain taxation rules 
different from the provisions of the Income Tax Act they become 
effective only if we give them precedence over domestic legislation 
by passing bills like Bill S-9 through Parliament.
<P>
	I want to make sure Liberal members opposite understand what 
that means. For Canada to simplify its tax rules with regard to trade 
with the U.S. its politicians pass bills like Bill S-9 that bypass the 
convoluted, complex and complicated Income Tax Act. With all 
due respect, what a treat that must be. Canadians sit at home trying 
to figure out their T4s and their T4As and phrases such as 
discernible loss while a few trade representatives sign a tax 
protocol not subject to any aspect of the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	The primary objective of most tax treaties is the avoidance of 
double taxation. Bill S-9 makes a number of important changes in 
this area, including bilateral reductions and withholding tax rates 
on dividends, interest and royalties reflecting the rates now 
accepted in most countries, a complete withholding tax exemption 
for payments for the use of U.S. technology, relief for Canadian 
residents from the application of U.S. estate taxes, increasing the 
maximum estate tax exemption from $60,000 to between $600,000 
and $1.2 million U.S.
<P>
	I wonder if the Minister of Finance will be bringing in estate 
taxes in Canada in his next budget, making this section of the bill 
an exercise in futility.
<P>
	With regard to double taxation, Bill S-9 expands the exemption 
from U.S. tax for the income earned by RRSPs, RRIFs and the 
Canada pension plan.
<P>
	In the area of fiscal evasion the bill gives authority to impose 
withholding on CPP and OAS payments made to American 
residents. The 1984 treaty only allowed the American state these 
former Canadian residents lived in to tax such payments. Now we 
can withhold the money at source if it is being collected illegally.
<P>
	There is also a provision in Bill S-9 for a mutual assistance in the 
collection of taxes owed by a citizen of one country who resides in 
the other.
<P>
	These are very positive measures which our party fully supports. 
However, what disturbs me is that we can accomplish these 
changes internationally but not internally, not domestically. For 
example, we can agree to chase tax evaders north and south of the 
Canada-U.S.  border yet nothing has been done by the government 
to chase those who evade things like child support across our 
provincial borders. It is a double standard.
<P>
	Another example of this can be seen in reductions and 
withholding tax rates on the dividends, interest and royalties held 
in Canada and the United States. What about the continuing double 
taxation of domestic dividends in Canada? This is a double 
standard. Our trade representatives seem to be able to negotiate 
what our domestic politicians and representatives cannot.
<P>
	The question that begs to be asked is why. The answer is because 
bills like Bill S-9 take precedence over the Income Tax Act. They 
are not governed by it. Maybe it is time Canadians did not have to 
be governed by the Income Tax Act either. Maybe it should be 
repealed. Maybe it is time to get rid of it altogether, start from 
scratch and build up a whole new base to create a simple, visible 
and fair system of taxation such as the flat tax.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Philosophically, certainly it is in tune with the times. Practically, 
it would be keeping in step with what is going on in the United 
States. A protocol bill like this one seems to solve all our problems. 
Many Republican representatives in the United States are looking 
at a flat tax. They are looking to simplify their system. They are 
looking to make it more fair, where people who make the same 
level of income pay relatively the same amount of tax. They are 
looking to reduce the high compliance costs of tax collection.
<P>
	What is frustrating to me is that the majority of Canadians have 
to hire accountants to do their personal income tax returns. Our 
corporations have to hire accountants to do their tax returns. 
Businesses have to figure out their GST calculations and submit 
them to the government. In other words, the private citizens and 
businesses are paying to keep track of taxation for the government, 
and it still costs Revenue Canada $1.2 billion to collect our taxes. It 
still costs $400 million to $500 million for the GST revenues to add 
it all up. That is almost a cost of $2 billion when the people in the 
businesses are doing the work. Implementing a simplified taxation 
system would reduce that cost. It would be in line with what we are 
doing with protocol agreements such as we have in Bill S-9.
<P>
	It is so obvious and so clear that I do not know what the 
government has to fear. The Liberal member for 
Broadview-Greenwood is proposing a flat tax. He has been 
ignored for 10 years. I do not know why. What is it that makes 
politicians when they form government afraid to look at a new, 
clear and fair system of taxation? Why not send the trade 
representatives who negotiated the deal into the House and let them 
negotiate in the standing committees a new system of taxation? 
Businesses would be better off and individuals would be better off.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14711"> 14711 </A></B>
<P>
	We have to get rid of the intertwining of our social and 
economic programs through the Income Tax Act, separate them 
and have a system of taxation that collects the amount of money 
we need to pay for the programs Canadians want, be it child care, 
be it health care, be it education, or whatever it is they want. It 
could be a megaproject that we would cut but the government 
would probably continue. Then we would know what the rate 
should be. Then we would know whom to tax. Then we would 
know how much to tax. It would be there for us. It would be within 
our grasp. It is a system of taxation whose time has come; there 
is no question.
<P>
	If we can agree on issues between two nations such as how to 
avoid double taxation, why do we not look at an internal system 
that would avoid double taxation within our own country? Why are 
we being so foolish in keeping the burden and the cost of 
calculating income tax and in keeping the burden and cost of high 
taxes?
<P>
	More bills will be coming up later today and tomorrow that 
concern excise taxes. Some will be decreased; some will be 
increased. Bill C-90 will increase taxes all over the place. We do 
not need that. We need tax reduction, not tax increase. I will be 
talking more about the flat tax in future speeches, so I will drop the 
analogy of the good things in Bill S-9.
<P>
	I see the parliamentary secretary to the finance minister. I am 
encouraged he is somewhat willing to look at what the flat tax has 
to offer. He has made no commitments, but it is a start in the right 
direction because it will benefit all Canadians.
<P>
	In conclusion, once again I repeat that we are in favour of Bill 
S-9. However we are opposed to the fact that the government will 
not negotiate the same type of deals at home as it does abroad. Our 
government cannot continue to smile at the neighbours, make good 
deals with them and not make the same good deals at home. It is 
engaging us in fights at home. The separation fight is all about 
power. It is all about taxation, who should be taxing and at what 
levels, and getting rid of the double taxation system and the 
duplication of services. Why not tell the province of Quebec that it 
can handle <I>x, y</I> and <I>z</I>, that the federal government will get out of 
that business and that it can collect the taxes for it? That is 
something which shows that federalism works, but no, the 
government would not do that.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	People in Canada need change in a big way. As we have seen 
today, positive change can only come about through bypassing, 
ignoring or disregarding the Income Tax Act altogether. If we had 
to continue to abide by the rules of the Income Tax Act to negotiate 
with other countries, we would not get anywhere because no one 
would understand it.
<P>
	We have tax lawyers and accountants in this country who are 
intelligent and highly educated. They give advice  to individuals 
and corporations and at the end of the day sign a disclaimer: 
``Notwithstanding all the advice I have given you, everything in 
here might be true or might not be true. My interpretation should be 
accepted by Revenue Canada, but if it is not it is not my fault''. 
They do our tax returns. If it is in a grey area, Revenue Canada 
says: ``No, you cannot have that''. Then the department charges us 
and we have to pay. If we do not pay we end up having to pay 
double interest. A person has more rights as a criminal-and I do 
not want to go back to Bill C-45-than one who misses the filing 
date of the income tax return.
<P>
	The government goes after us. It is arbitrary. It leads to conflict 
between citizens and the bureaucrats. We do not need that. We do 
not need the department to be frowned on, to be cursed at, to be 
sworn at. We can simplify the matter and make it better by having a 
simple system of taxation that everyone understands. Then we 
would not have taxpayers fighting the department over appeals, 
over treatment or over rulings. We do not need that.
<P>
	In conclusion it is time that we start giving Canadians in Canada 
the same types of rules and rates governing Canadians outside 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was going to 
let the matter go to a vote but I was encouraged by the previous 
speaker to say a few words.
<P>
	It is clear that Bill S-9 is a result of a complex process flowing 
from a tax treaty signed between Canada and the United States in 
March 1995. The Senate quickly got on to this important matter in 
its judgment and decided to give it top priority over a number of 
other pieces of legislation. As far as the Senate is concerned it 
requires top priority. The bill passed in May before the summer 
recess. Now, in the first few hours of this session of Parliament, the 
government also says that this is a priority. This tax measure has 
taken priority in Parliament over all kinds of other initiatives.
<P>
	I can talk about the high levels of unemployment that are not 
being addressed. I can talk about all sorts of social, economic and 
cultural issues that are simply being ignored. The government is 
saying that this is a priority, that we must bring in a tax provision 
changing the Income Tax Act to benefit basically a handful of the 
wealthiest families of Canada.
<P>
	That is what we are talking about. Let us be perfectly clear. This 
tax measure will not benefit many people in the constituency of 
Kamloops or the constituency of Okanagan-Shuswap. I could go 
through the entire country.
<P>
	The legislation has been written, drafted or designed to assist the 
financial concerns of a handful of very wealthy Canadian families.
<P>
	As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance has 
argued, it is a matter of equity. I suspect that is true in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14712"> 14712 </A></B>
<P>
government's eyes. Changes are required in  the Income Tax Act so 
that they are not double taxed on U.S. investments and the fact they 
live in Canada. The whole matter of tax protocols, tax treaties and 
the resultant changes in the tax act is something anyone would 
support.
<P>
	It is the process that troubles us. We are talking now about the 
principle of the bill. This is second reading. We are talking about 
the principle of the bill, that the government and the Senate feel 
that the matter is of top priority and that we have to do something 
to facilitate the financial concerns of a handful of very wealthy 
Canadian families. I doubt it. I doubt if Canadians would recognize 
it as a top priority.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	I find it surprising that my friends opposite, including the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, would have the 
courage to stand in the House of Commons to say that we have to 
spend hours today, if necessary, to help a handful of wealthy 
Canadian families get a better financial deal on their tax bills. 
There is something cynical about that.
<P>
	No wonder Canadians are cynical about the government. It is the 
same members who said to all Canadians not many months ago that 
if they elected the Liberals they would abolish the GST. That was 
said from coast to coast to coast, constituency to constituency 
throughout the lower mainland of British Columbia, throughout 
southern Ontario, throughout the province of Quebec, et cetera. 
Liberal contenders in the election said: ``If you elect us we will 
abolish the GST''.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister said that if the GST were not 
abolished within the first year she would resign her seat. To be fair, 
I wish we could believe these folks. Canadians are saying that they 
believe they are actually telling the truth. When my friends from 
Toronto said to their constituents: ``You elect me and I will abolish 
the GST'', they believed them; they said yes.
<P>
	Bringing some financial tax pain relief to every Canadian is not a 
priority. As my friend says-and I believe what he says-we will 
eventually get to it. I suspect that rather than abolish the GST they 
will abolish the name GST and keep the tax. They might do a bit of 
harmonizing and so on to broaden it even more so that more items 
would come under taxation. We could refer to the province of 
Alberta. Albertans will now have all goods and services taxed as 
opposed to none.
<P>
	Changing the GST is not a priority but Bill S-9 is. I wonder how 
many of my Liberal friends across the way actually know what is in 
the bill or how many Canadians will benefit from it. Those people 
that have $600,000 or $1 million in investments coming from the 
United States will benefit. How many Canadians does that account 
for?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> One per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> My friend from Calgary says 1 per cent. I doubt it is 
one per cent. We should not be giving priority to tax policy that 
addresses the concerns of less than 1 per cent of the Canadian 
population.
<P>
	My hon. friend from Calgary Centre made a point that was well 
taken. He said that most times when we are trying to change the 
Income Tax Act we use the normal process through the finance 
committee and various other subcommittees to look at tax 
exemptions and ask whether they are of benefit to Canada. My 
friend from Toronto will know about this; he has been working on 
them for many years. Do they result in some benefit? Often when 
we have done a cost benefit analysis we have found that they have 
not. From time to time the government has eliminated tax 
exemptions or what some of us call tax loopholes. Even the 
Minister of Finance is using the term tax loophole more frequently.
<P>
	We ask ourselves how we got into this debt problem. I know it 
seems to be a jump from Bill S-9 to the debt problem. Let us 
recognize that Statistics Canada did us a great favour back in 1991 
when it identified that 44 per cent of our accumulated federal debt 
was the result of tax exemptions over the years, the drainage of 
billions and billions of dollars through tax loopholes.
<P>
	We might say that some of the tax breaks, tax loopholes or tax 
exemptions are beneficial. Some are absolute boondoggles and 
some are debatable. Do Parliament and government give priority to 
a process that would see the elimination of some tax exemptions 
and as a result take a major step toward reducing the accumulated 
debt and deficit? Is that where we devote our attention, energy and 
time? No. Time is given to Bill S-9 that will benefit a handful of the 
wealthiest families of Canada. We will send this off to the finance 
committee now for thorough study where its advantages and 
problems will be identified.
<P>
	In summary let us acknowledge what we are doing today. We are 
taking up valuable House of Commons time at a crucial time in our 
economic history, when we have 1.4 million Canadians who are 
jobless, another two million Canadians who are underemployed, 
probably many more than that who are working in low paying jobs 
and are barely getting by. We are seeing that a priority for this 
government is to assist a handful of wealthy families with their tax 
problems.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	What about the tax problems of every other Canadian? What 
about the tax problems that every small business person in this 
country is struggling with today? My friend from Calgary Centre 
indicated that people are struggling through their tax returns and so 
on and need a tax accountant, a tax adviser, a tax lawyer for the 
simplest type of taxation situation.
<P>
	It is with regret that we have this debate today, because of all the 
priorities facing this country this has to be  almost at the bottom of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14713"> 14713 </A></B>
<P>
the bloody list. However, the government says this is a priority, so 
to them it is and we have to deal with it.
<P>
	Let me say that on the principle of this bill we in the New 
Democratic Party will be voting against it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I commend the member for 
Kamloops for his commitment to total comprehensive personal and 
corporate tax reform. I too share with the member and also the 
member from Calgary Centre the view-and there are many other 
Liberals on this side of the House who share their view-that this is 
an issue the people of Canada want us to address. Canadians are 
hoping we address this issue of personal and corporate income tax 
reform in the next little while.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance over the next 90 days will be preparing 
a budget statement and preparing for a budget obviously early next 
spring. This will be our window. This will be the time for all of us 
in this House to deal with this very important issue.
<P>
	I am not going to get into a long debate on this. I do not think that 
is where I am coming from today, but I would like to ask the 
member from Kamloops a very specific question. Over the next 60 
days, could we count on the support of the member and the New 
Democratic Party to roll up their sleeves and work with us to see if 
we could, as a bipartisan effort in this House, come up with a 
package that deals with the whole notion of comprehensive tax 
reform, both on the personal and the corporate side?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, this could be one of the happiest days of 
my life, responding to this question.
<P>
	If there is an issue facing this country right now, one of the top 
issues that is frustrating Canadians is the matter of our unfair, 
unjust, biased tax system at both the corporate and personal levels. 
A major overhaul is required. For us to go into the details of why 
that is the case, they are all well known. I suspect we have all had 
constituents lined up 50 or 60 deep some days explaining their 
problems with the tax system.
<P>
	I can commit to my hon. friend from Broadview-Greenwood 
that there is nothing I would enjoy more than to sit down with him 
and others in a non-partisan effort to examine every tax provision 
that presently exists on a cost benefit basis to the people of Canada 
and come up with a comprehensive system of tax reform that would 
bring fairness back into the system. People would see the tax 
system as being fair to both them and others, where there would be 
nobody who would obviously benefit from that system.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	I know some of my friends are very keen about the flat tax 
system. I am not sure what they mean by the flat tax  because there 
are all kinds of definitions of that, as my friend from 
Broadview-Greenwood has explained in his publication and 
others beyond what he said. However, it is something we need to 
look at among a whole set of alternatives and various proposals to 
have a fairer tax system so that the most popular book come the 
new year is not on how to avoid tax.
<P>
	When we go into bookstores across Canada, no matter what 
bookstore it is the front counter now has issues and issues and 
various publications on how to beat the tax man. The reason they 
are popular is because every single person and business person 
knows that the tax system is unfair.
<P>
	I will use one example to measure the unfairness in how the tax 
system is being used. The audit division of Revenue Canada tells us 
that for every $1 it invests in an audit procedure it collects $6 back. 
It is not necessarily that people are all breaking the law, but they 
are certainly hedging on that. In other words, they are saying that 
this does not seem to be clear so I am going to make my tax 
decision in this grey area. As a result, the treasury of our country is 
losing billions of dollars that would normally be collected. 
However, because of a tax system that is so vague, so grey, so 
biased, so unjust and so unfair, people are revolting against it in a 
number of ways.
<P>
	Let us not forget that the obvious way the people are revolting is 
to participate in the underground economy. What are the losses 
there? The experts will tell us that anywhere from $40 billion and 
$160 billion are lost each year because of transactions that are not 
registered and not taxed as a result of the underground economy.
<P>
	Therefore, I say with enthusiasm, in response to my friend, yes, I 
will be willing, with my party very strongly behind me, to 
participate in any measure that will result in a fairer tax system 
than we have today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member for Kamloops a question. If he believes 
that the current system of taxation is unfair, that the current 
taxation system is too high, what does he think about the current 
level of government spending?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to my friend. He might 
be playing a little bit of politics here, but I think it is a question that 
deserves a serious answer on my part.
<P>
	How has our accumulated debt occurred? Fifty per cent of our 
accumulated debt comes from the result of compound interest 
because of our high interest rate policy. Forty-four per cent of our 
compound debt is as a result of tax exemptions. Six per cent of our 
compound debt is as a result of government expenditures.
<P>
	Let us recognize that in some areas we have overspent, but in my 
judgment in some areas we have underspent. There are some areas 
where we should be spending now  to encourage people to find 
ways and means of getting back to productive work. Let us 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14714"> 14714 </A></B>
<P>
recognize that the best social program in this country is for 
someone to have a decent paying job.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's time has expired. Is the 
House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the

Control Systems Inc., located in the riding of Waterloo, is the 
world's leading designer, manufacturer, and supplier of 
technologically advanced natural gas and propane automotive fuel 
systems. GFI holds the coveted ISO 9001 quality certification for 
its entire facility.
<P>
	GFI products are now being exported to the U.S. and to over 10 
other countries and to dozens of original equipment manufacturers 
that are moving to alternative fuels.
<P>
	As a result of legislation in the U.S. and Bill S-7 in Canada, GFI 
is looking forward to additional sales and employment. In order to 
accommodate this growth, GFI is enlarging its facility. This 
expansion will produce several advantages. The new and improved 
facility will accelerate the development of leading edge technology 
for markets worldwide. It will allow GFI to operate an inhouse 
emissions control laboratory. It will also offer opportunities for 
more extensive training of dealers and technicians. The centre will 
create 50 new jobs.
<P>
	The success of GFI is good news for the consumer, the 
environment, and Canada. To all the people involved with GFI we

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in July 1948, barely 52 per cent of Newfoundland 
voters taking part in a referendum agreed to join the Canadian 
federation. In November 1994, 52 per cent of Swedish voters 
supported their country's  entry into the European Union. Two 
weeks later, 52 per cent of Norwegians voted against joining the 
EU. And in France, the Maastricht Agreement was approved by 
50.9 per cent of voters.
<P>
	In fact, the simple majority rule as applied to referendums is 
universal because it is the only democratic rule. The official 
opposition did the right thing by reminding the Prime Minister of 
this fact this week, as Robert Bourassa did in Washington 
yesterday. The only one who does not admit that Quebecers have 
this right is the Prime Minister of Canada, who should know this 
basic democratic rule.

to draw attention to the weakness of this government's agenda, an 
agenda so thin the government House leader's closest relatives 
would have trouble getting excited about it.
<P>
	This thin soup agenda is creating a tremendous leadership 
vacuum. The provinces are losing faith in Ottawa as a force for 
social change. Individuals are losing faith in Ottawa as a catalyst 
for jobs and economic growth. The country is losing faith in 
Ottawa as a source of fresh innovative ideas.
<P>
	Reformers are not going to wait for this government any longer. 
It is time to put some meat in the soup. Earlier today the Reform 
Party took the first step by outlining the national Reform agenda 
for Canadians.
<P>
	From the day we arrived in Ottawa, Reform has acted as the de 
facto official opposition, but the Liberals' continued silence on 
important national issues has convinced us we have to act as the de 
facto government as well. As Canadians will see, that is the role we 
are prepared to play.

How hollow the 1993 promises of the Liberals now ring about jobs 
and preserving Winnipeg as a rail centre.
<P>
	Workers are being let go to improve the books for privatization

until after the referendum. Where I come from, we still say there is 
no need to sell it at all.

	At the very least, the government should indicate that it will 
reconsider the way it has bound privatized crown corporations like 
Air Canada and soon CN to keep their headquarters in Montreal, 
especially if the vote goes the wrong way on October 30. I am sure 
that Canadians want privatized Canadian crown corporations to be 
headquartered in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding Canadian 
athlete and the community that honoured him.
<P>
	On September 14 the town of St. Mary's, the future home of the 
Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, hosted 15-year major league 
veteran Terry Puhl.
<P>
	Terry, a native of Melville, Saskatchewan, spent 14 of his 15 
seasons with the Houston Astros and holds a .280 career batting 
average. Also known as a superb defensive player, Terry holds the 
major league record for the best fielding percentage in baseball, 
.993.
<P>
	In six of his seasons he did not make a single error and he had 
only 19 in his entire career. Terry Puhl is the first player to be 
inducted into the new St. Mary's home of the Baseball Hall of 
Fame and Museum.
<P>
	This visionary and enthusiastic community of only 5,000 people 
is undertaking to build an $8.7 million complex to showcase 
Canadian baseball history and heroes.
<P>
	I congratulate the people of St. Mary's for their hard work and 
dedication toward this goal. I wish them success.

	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
16-year old Sarah Balabagan faces the death penalty in the United 
Arab Emirates for the stabbing death of her employer.
<P>
	Last June she was given a prison term but was awarded 
compensation for the rape she endured at her employer's hands.
<P>
	It was shocking that last Saturday her sentence was changed to 
death. This is reminiscent of the hasty execution six months ago in 
Singapore of another Filipino nanny, an execution deemed unjust 
on subsequent inquiry, but too late.
<P>
	I therefore urge the House to intervene on Sarah's behalf, to 
allow a full and impartial judicial review of her case.
<P>
	Canada has long prized human life and championed women's 
rights worldwide, the theme of the U.N. conference on women held 
in Beijing. Canada's support may well be the saving voice for this 
young woman's life.
<P>
	Canada's timely stand on this matter goes beyond the life of this 
one young woman to the lives of all women of the world.

issues from a spiritual perspective. This assembly will bring 
together native and non-native spiritual leaders in the spirit of 
healing and reconciliation.
<P>
	I am pleased to report to the House I have received positive 
responses from churches, spiritual leaders, communities, national 
groups and also my colleague, the hon. minister of Indian affairs. 
We are now in the process of assembling a working group.
<P>
	I envision this assembly as a forum for sharing spiritual wisdom 
on aboriginal issues and also as a forum for promoting 
reconciliation between native and non-native communities in 
Canada.
<P>
	This must happen if Canada is to heal and grow strong. I know 
many here have drawn on faith in our creator to guide and sustain 
us in our work in the House. In the spirit of this faith I call on all 
my colleagues in the House to offer their support on this initiative.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the tour 
organized by women for the Yes side in Quebec allowed thousands 
of women to find out about the choices in the upcoming 
referendum: on the one hand, a federal system in which 
unemployed workers and welfare recipients are seen as lazy and 
higher education is reserved for the rich; and on the other, a 
sovereign Quebec where women can help meet the challenges of a 
modern society attuned to their needs and priorities.
<P>
	For the increasingly numerous sovereignist women in Quebec, 
history has clearly shown how federalism has become a barrier to 
collective growth. And this government's policies are not likely to 
make them change their minds.
<P>
	What Quebec women want above all is a blueprint for society 
that will finally meet their aspirations. The side in favour of change 
is proposing such a blueprint. Women  see sovereignty as an

<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	The FCC and banks are reneging on giving a fair share of the

efficiency into the grain handling and transportation system. 
Furthermore, organic growers are penalized for marketing and 
transporting their own grain. Domestic beef producers are 
constantly harassed by arbitrary offshore beef imports.

putting small seed cleaner plants out of business with more

	In his own words the member was ``trying to be nice'' because

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria,

a sovereign Quebec, it is interesting to look at the recent case of the 
Czech and Slovak republics. These two new republics had agreed 
to use a common currency for a transition period of at least six 
months following their separation. After thirty-nine days, the fear 
and insecurity of capital holders, that resulted in a massive transfer 
of assets to other countries, led to this laudable goal being 
discarded.
<P>
	The new Slovak republic only had three days to print its own 
currency to put an end to the massive flight of capital. Today, the 
currency of that republic, which is the smaller and more vulnerable 
of the two new states, is worth 12 per cent less than the Czech 
currency.
<P>
	By separating from Canada, Quebec would also become 
extremely vulnerable to such a massive flight of capital. Is the 
separatist dream really worth the price that will have to be paid? 
Mr. Speaker, the answer is no.

	Such a practice is unacceptable in a democratic system. It seems

connection with Ontario, when it comes time to negotiate

<P>
	Contrary to their claims in their referendum agenda, a separate

by an American expert who took part in the Free Trade

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Privy Council took great pains to remove three 
quarters of a document intended for the Minister of Labour from 
the public eye. The document, which appears to describe the 
activities of the operation unity centre, was obtained by the 
opposition under the Access to Information Act. I say ``appears'', 
because the government whited out most of the pages before 
sending them to the Information Commissioner. Even the table of 
contents is secret. Mr. Speaker, this is too much.
<P>
	What lessons in transparency can the Prime Minister offer to the 
Government of Quebec when he keeps three quarters of a Privy 
Council document on the activities of the operation unity centre 
secret?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, under the Access to Information Act, the government 
makes public what has to be made public. Some of the 
government's activities are not made public. The Privy Council 
operates daily in connection with the referendum and the national 
problem facing the country at the moment.
<P>
	As you can imagine, it provides the Canadian government with 
very effective information and advice on keeping the country 
together.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am asking the Prime Minister what is so secret about the 
activities of the operation unity centre-the information that 
appears in the document in question-that it is being turned into a 
real state secret? What is the government trying to hide from 
Quebecers? This is the question.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, ministerial activities and communications in cabinet are 
privileged. We try to release as much as possible to the press and 
the public, but some matters of discussion in a government remain 
privileged between members of the administration. There is 
nothing cynical in this, particularly because it is an open campaign.
<P>
	We are very open, and the burden of proof lies with the 
opposition to say why Quebecers should separate from Canada. All 
we have to say is that we who are defending Canada are defending 
more than 125 years of history considered by the world to be a 
great history of political evolution from a former colony to one of 
the world's model countries.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question is a very simple one: why is the government 
hiding three quarters of a document on the hottest item at the 
moment, the Quebec referendum? Since the Prime Minister says 
the campaign is an open one, I am going to give him the 
opportunity to show how open it is, since the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs said in February that most of the funds 
injected into operation unity would go to pay for studies on 
eliminating overlap.
<P>
	How then can the Prime Minister justify the fact that the Privy 
Council has not made public these studies, which were conducted 
and paid for with public funds?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on May 21, I wrote the chairman of the standing 
committee of the House of Commons providing him with a 
complete list of all those working in the unity group, identifying 
their duties and indicating the amount of the budget.
<P>
	I also told him then that, so long as the date of the referendum 
was not known, we could quite likely spend more than the $2.5 
million in the blue book.
<P>
	Since then, the Parti Quebecois has spend more than $22 million. 
This figure does not appear in the expenditures of the Quebec 
government as referendum expenditures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
simply repeat the question put by the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	The minister accused another government of keeping studies 
under wraps, although these studies are published regularly. The 
problem, and that is the gist of our question, is this. He told us that 
most Operation Unity funds would be used for studies of the 
extremely costly duplication that exists within the Canadian federal 
system.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Our question is this: If he is so open, what about these studies 
which absorb most of the funds of this organization? Tell us about 
them, Mr. Minister.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I indicated at the time that members of the Unity Group 
had been recruited to  prepare analyses of the government's 
situation, and obviously some of these can be released to the public 
but some are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14719"> 14719 </A></B>
<P>
clearly intended for those who make the decisions and are, by their 
very nature, confidential.
<P>
	But what is far more important is the difference with studies that 
were kept under wraps, that were ordered from a separate 
organization, and the fact that the PQ government, at the behest by 
the Minister of Restructuration, refused to release a study of Mr. 
Mathews unless Mr. Mathews deleted certain paragraphs. That is 
controlling information, and we do not do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs would be willing to tell 
us his criteria for keeping certain studies confidential and releasing 
others.
<P>
	I would appreciate if he would tell us and then explain how he 
can decide to keep all these studies under wraps and then comment 
on the actions of another government that really does not need any 
lessons from him?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think it is clear there is a difference between strategic 
analyses, and the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois have 
these as well, which are clearly intended for decision-makers, and 
studies prepared for publication by scientific institutes and 
published with the institute's stamp of approval.
<P>
	What the Parti Quebecois did is unacceptable, and everybody 
knows what happened. They prevented the release of studies that 
contained conclusions they did not agree with.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is not a federalist in the House who does not want to 
defeat the Bloc and its separatist allies in the referendum and bury 
this secession issue six feet deep.
<P>
	If this is to happen it is going to require some fresher thinking 
and some bolder tactics than have been practised in the past by the 
traditional guardians of national unity.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. To what extent is he 
consulting and involving federalists outside Quebec in improving 
the federal government's response to the referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, from time to time I am in communication with some 
premiers and other people who call me to discuss the referendum 
and make suggestions. Anybody who feels he or she can make a 
contribution is invited to call me or members of my cabinet to give 
good advice.
<P>
	On many occasions I have been called by officials of other 
governments and people in the private sector to ask for my views 
on how we can make sure the country remains together. I welcome 
the suggestions and the commitment of so many people inside and 
outside of Quebec who just want to work hard to make sure the 
country remains united so we can move on to the real agenda: the 
creation of jobs, good administration and giving a real future to the 
young people of the nation.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure that the Prime Minister is consulting, but I 
wonder whether he is hearing and absorbing the advice that he is 
getting.
<P>
	For example, the vast majority of Reform MPs are from the 
west. What the west wants on this issue-and this has been 
discussed for some 10 years-is not only national unity but 
resolution of the issue, clarity in the federalist position, toughness 
in calling the separatists' bluff and a better and more decentralized 
federalism as an alternative to the status quo.
<P>
	What is the Prime Minister doing to bring these elements into 
the federal government approach: the resolution, the clarity, the 
toughness and the better federalism that western Canadians and 
many other Canadians want?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the people of western Canada, like everyone else in 
Canada, want a good government in Ottawa that is going its job 
properly.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> They know quite well it is very 
seldom that I am applauded in this House by the Bloc Quebecois. It 
is not the same thing in your case.
<P>
	My view is that we are working very hard to make sure that some 
of the aspirations of everybody are attended to. For example, the 
minister of federal-provincial relations is talking about the work he 
is doing not only with the province of Quebec but with all the other 
governments in Canada on how we can end duplication. It has to be 
discussed with all the provinces. Some provinces are willing to see 
us moving out of some fields; other provinces do not want us to 
move out of those fields because they do not have the means to 
operate in certain fields.
<P>
	The province of Alberta is richer than the others. As the federal 
government we have to make sure that some of the poorer parts of 
Canada receive the same quality of services as the people happily 
can afford in Alberta.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all we have heard so far in response to these questions has 
been the traditional approach to managing national unity that has 
been carried on by often the same people for the last 32 years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14720"> 14720 </A></B>
<P>
	Where has that approach led? It has led to two failed 
constitutional agreements. It has led to two secession referendums 
in 15 years. It has led to fostering the development of two full 
blown separatist parties in the province of Quebec. The traditional 
approach to national unity has not worked.
<P>
	That is why we need fresh thinking. The west's contribution is to 
bring resolution, clarity, toughness and a better vision.
<P>
	Instead of ignoring these elements or worse yet labelling them as 
somehow disloyal to Canada, why does the Prime Minister not 
incorporate them into the federal government's strategy on the 
referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the hon. member is ill-advised to raise the failure 
of the Charlottetown accord which he opposed because the 
Government of Alberta supported it, as did the Government of 
British Columbia and so on. Don't blame it on us, blame it on you. 
You are one of those who campaigned against us.
<P>
	At this moment I think the burden of proof is on those who want 
to separate Quebec from Canada. The preoccupation of the leader 
of the third party should be to tell them because when it comes 
from me they do not like it very much. Perhaps because you have 
managed to get applause from them once in a while you could at 
this moment tell them why you believe that what they are trying to 
sell to Quebecers; that it is going to be easy for them after 
separation to keep their citizenship, the dollar, the economic union 
and political union, why in your judgment that is a dream they 
cannot realize.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	In the wake of the car bomb that killed an innocent 11-year old 
boy last August, there has been an alarming increase in the number 
of bombings, with two more people killed in Saint-Luc, in the 
Montérégie region, last night.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Justice tell us if his government still thinks 
that the current provisions of the Criminal Code are sufficient to 
allow police forces to wage an effective fight against this kind of 
crime?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are concerned about the tragedy 
of little Daniel Desrochers's death a few weeks ago in Montreal. 
The problem of gang wars  and organized crime is a very difficult 
one and a major challenge for Montreal police forces.
<P>
	This past summer, I had a meeting with the solicitor general, 
Mr. Sangollo, Denis Asselin of the CUM, and the Commissioner of 
the RCMP. We discussed in detail all the various strategies we 
could use to deal with this problem. We decided to work together 
and set up a joint committee that will go through the Criminal Code 
to look for answers.
<P>
	This is a very serious, very important matter to us. We are now 
working in a very constructive and positive fashion and I am very 
confident that we will find a solution to the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind the minister that bombs are exploding. 
There have been thirty of them since the beginning of the year. 
Casualties are mounting. In Quebec, 25 people have died. Police 
forces have been calling for amendments to the Criminal Code for 
a long time, and what is the minister telling us? That he is studying 
the matter. The time for studying is over, the time has come for 
action.
<P>
	When will the minister table in this House amendments to the 
Criminal Code that would meet police demands?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are quite aware that there is a 
problem at this time, just as there was last week and as there will be 
next week. It is not only in Montreal but also in Toronto and 
Vancouver. It is the problem of organized crime.
<P>
	There is no simple solution. When I met with the hon. member a 
few months ago, I asked him: ``What do you suggest?'' He had a 
suggestion, which we discussed, but it is not a real solution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is not an easy question of just passing another law.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, the Quebec Minister of Public Security, Mr. Ménard, 
clearly said: ``We do not need new laws. We need the police forces 
to work on collecting evidence against organized crime''. So let us 
work together to find a solution to this problem, this tragic matter. 
As I said, I am confident that we will find a solution in the coming 
weeks.

it said that a yes vote was a one-way  ticket to separation and that it

would be respected. Without explanation that strategy was changed 
on us and we have been wondering why.
<P>
	We have obtained a letter written by the Liberal member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. It indicates categorically that the federal 
government will not honour a yes vote. It states: ``The results of the 
referendum will not be binding and have no legal consequences. 
The federal government has no obligation to respond''.
<P>
	Does this represent the real position of the federal government?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am having some difficulty with regard to the

may or may not be accurate.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have

<P>
	We still demand that the government show transparency. Did the 
minister explain to Quebecers that, if the Yes side wins, and 
especially if it does by a narrow margin, the Government of 
Quebec, the PQ government, will be negotiating separation from a 
position where Quebecers will be divided, weakened and isolated?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have always said and we still maintain that the choice 
the people of Quebec are about to make is a major decision, a 
serious decision regarding their future. It is not like choosing a 
political party in an election. This is not the kind of decision about 
which Quebecers will be able to change their minds four or five 
years from now and say: ``We made a mistake; we want to be a part 
of Canada again''.
<P>
	This choice is very important, not only for us today but also for 
generations to come. That is why we care so much about the 
process currently under way in Quebec. We are going to put all our 
energies into providing accurate information to the people of 
Quebec.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health. At the federal-provincial 
conference of health ministers, provincial ministers vigorously 
denounced the federal government's decision to cut transfers to the 
provinces for social programs, including health care, by $7 billion  
over two years. These cuts can only have a disastrous effect on 
health care provided to the public.
<P>
	How can the minister claim to be the champion of a universal 
and accessible health care system, when at the same time her 
government is cutting $7 billion in transfers to the provinces, 
thereby forcing them to cut back on the quantity and quality of 
services?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there has not been one health economist, there has not been anyone, 
who has said that there was not enough money in the system.
<P>
	We must live within our fiscal means, our financial means. 
Seven billion dollars are projected to be cut over the next few 
years. Take, for instance, next year. When we consider the 
provinces altogether spend $100 billion in health and social 
programs, the cut for next year will be under 3 per cent. While it 
will be a difficult challenge we believe it is manageable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, would 
the minister at least admit that a $7 billion cut in transfer payments 
will mean nothing short of scaled-down health care for the public?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
our health care system is continually changing. While we must 
keep up with technological changes, we will insist that the Canada 
Health Act ensure that Canadians receive adequate care based on 
what they need and not how much money they have in their 
pockets.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had occasion to 
talk to some of the provincial health ministers who had been at the 
conference in Victoria. They told me frankly that this health 
minister was mangling medicare.
<P>
	The provincial ministers are here. Our federal minister is over 
there. Her answer to them was no innovation, no to choice, no to 
new thinking.
<P>
	We call on the federal Minister of Health to get out of the sixties 
and old-fashioned thinking and join us in the nineties with new 
thinking for health care. Will she do that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
had occasion to spend considerable time with the provincial 
ministers of health. I do not know to whom the hon. member was 
speaking but I can say nonsense.
<P>
	We have done a lot of work together. We will continue to do a lot 
of work together. We co-operate and we have moved forward 
considerably. Obviously we do not all  agree. We have said that we

language sometimes we transcend the boundaries. I would ask hon. 
members to be careful in their choice of words.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, the provinces are asking for 
very specific changes. What do they say no to? They say no to 
uncertain funding. They say no to long waiting lines. They say no 
to ``we care so much about medicare''.

have one thing I would like to say to the hon. member. I probably 
have others.
<P>
	One issue that has been spoken to is that I should respond to 
provincial ministers of health. I do at all times. I would like to 
remind the hon. member as well as anyone out there that I was not 
elected by ministers of health. The government was elected by 
Canadians, who value our medicare system, a system that works 
for Canadians.
<P>
	It is my responsibility as Minister of Health for all Canadians to 
ensure that health care is available to all Canadians, based on need, 
that we do not have a system where taxpayers subsidize queue 
jumping by the rich, and that we offer the very best care in the

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is also for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	The Supreme Court finally rendered its decision on the Tobacco 
Products Control Act. The court concluded that the total ban on the 
advertising of tobacco products was unconstitutional, and it also 
questioned the legality of forcing companies to display a health 
warning on cigarette packages.
<P>
	Since tobacco companies have decided, for the time being, to 
comply with the Tobacco Products Control Act, when does the 
minister intend to meet with these manufacturers, to ensure that we 
do not go back to the situation that existed before?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the fact is that yesterday I informed manufacturers that I was going 
to meet with them to discuss the decision. That was before the 
decision was even known.
<P>
	However, it goes without saying that we need some time to look 
at this decision, which is 116 pages long and which took 7 years 
and 21 days to come. Consequently, you will understand that we 
need a bit of time to look at that judgment and decide on what to do 
next.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, following 
the failure of the previous government's strategy of excessive taxes 
on cigarettes, and given the court's questioning of the obligation to 
display a health warning, what is left of the tobacco strategy?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are in the process of studying the decision. We will use the 
guidance of the decision to set the course and we will use those 
powers that are appropriate to their fullest extent.
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	There continue to be 40,000 deaths that are directly attributed to

of it.

minister indicate what stance Canada will take if the Americans 
might attempt to reimpose a tariff rate quota?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, once again we are getting into the 
realm of hypothetical questions. The question as worded is 
hypothetical. If the hon. minister wishes to respond I will permit it, 
but the formulation of the question is not acceptable.
<P>

question that has been raised.

quota against Canadian wheat expired on time at midnight on 
Monday, September 11, 1995.
<P>
	On the point about future U.S. trade action, Canada fully expects 
the United States to honour all of its international trading

<P>
	The provincial ministers of health are frustrated after yesterday's 
meeting with the federal minister. She insists that funding will be 
cut, but she also insists militantly that none of the provincial 
ministers' policies to save money are acceptable. This policy 
stance is not only arrogant, it verges on the irrational.
<P>
	What precisely are provincial health ministers allowed to change 
in the allegedly perfect present system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
many of the provincial ministers of health have done some very 
good work. I have worked very closely with them and I encourage 
them to continue with the good work.
<P>
	There is one place where I and this government draw the line: 
We will not allow a U.S. style two tier medicare system because it 
does not work. It is not good for Canadians. It is not good for the 
economy. That is what we are talking about here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course the health minister's policy stance is not entirely 
irrational. It is rational if she expects provinces to raise taxes to pay 
for the financing deficit of the federally mandated program.
<P>
	What does the minister say to those who see her policies as an 
unwarranted violation of provincial rights that feeds the demand 
for independence in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this government spends considerable sums on health and social 
programs. Under the spending powers  this government has it can 
set certain principles. That is what the Canada Health Act does.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	Oftentimes in this debate we are not aware of just how much 
money this government does spend on social programs and health. 
It is time to remind people.
<P>
	I think it is important also to put this all in context. I used an 
example yesterday. For instance, the cuts in transfers next year for 
the British Columbia government will be minus 1.7 per cent of 
their total revenues. The revenues are projected to increase by 5 per 
cent. We still contend that this is manageable.

<P>
	Like the hon. member, I too hope that initial payment levels in 
Canada can be increased progressively throughout the current crop 
year and from my point of view the sooner the better.
<P>
	There are two factors that need to be borne in mind. First, even 
though the North American harvest may be virtually complete, the 
western Canadian harvest is now only about 60 per cent complete. 
There are still questions to be answered about final quantity and 
quality. It would obviously be premature on the basis of the amount 
that is completed so far to move at this point with respect to initial 
payments.
<P>
	However, I fully expect the Canadian Wheat Board to make its 
most favourable recommendations to me at the earliest possible 
date.
<P>

referred to a letter which I had sent to one of my constituents who 
had asked me questions about the referendum. As a matter of fact, 
that letter was one of several letters exchanged with this same 
constituent.
<P>
	Since the hon. member for Calgary West only referred to part of 
a point I was making to the constituent, I would like the entire point 
to be on the record and I quote from the letter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I might say in closing that the results of the referendum will not be binding 
and have no legal consequences. It is simply a plebiscite in which the people of 
Quebec will be expressing their preferences. As such, even with the best result, 
the PQ government could only use it to negotiate a constitutional amendment 
and even then the federal government has no obligation to respond.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would ask the hon. member for Calgary West that since the 
letter he sent over to me is incomplete, would he table the complete 
letter in the House so that all members can read it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have a request by the hon. member. If there is 
unanimous consent for the tabling of this letter then the Chair 
would be prepared to receive it.
<P>
	It there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my point 
of order I am referring to section 409(3) of Beachesne's with regard 
to the question that was raised by my hon. colleague from Calgary 
West. The question was whether it was hypothetical or not.
<P>
	I would like to make a request to the Chair that the question be 
reviewed. I listened to the question and I believe that according to 
citation 409.3 questions can be asked for information with regard 
to policy. I believe the question would qualify under that. I would 
appreciate the Speaker's review of the matter.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will take the Reform Party House leader's 
request to heart.
<P>
	It seemed to me at the time the preamble that set up the question 
set it up to be a hypothetical question. I will look at it and if I find 
there is reason to come back to the House I will.

which tightens up the corrections and parole process.
<P>
	When this is completed I would like to proceed with second

<P>
	This is our weekly business statement.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
things which occurred in the spring session was the heavy agenda. 
Many of the important legislative items came in in the latter part of 
the session, in the last three to four weeks. We were then faced with 
time allocation. We forced through a number of readings of bills 
under, I would say, duress, as members of the House of Commons.
<P>
	I would ask the government House leader if there are pieces of 
legislation which are planned and will those pieces of legislation be 
made available to us, or at least will the House be advised that they 
are coming within the next 10-day period?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously there is other legislation 
which we intend to debate in addition to the legislation which has 
already been mentioned on the Order Paper. I will see what further 
information I can provide my hon. friend. I cannot say that 
everything we intend to introduce before the Christmas 
adjournment can be made available in the next 10-day period. 
There are things which we are working on within the government. 
Some measures have not had the drafting process completed.
<P>
	I would think there are measures which will be introduced before 
the Christmas adjournment regarding which we cannot inform our 
hon. friend within the next 10-day period. However, I will 
endeavour to be helpful in responding to his question.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, yesterday the hon. parliamentary 
secretary to the government House leader pursued the point of 
order raised by the hon. member for Roberval on Tuesday, 
September 19, 1995 relating to a question of the hon. member for 
Vaudreuil.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At that time, the hon. member for Roberval asked me to review 
the question the hon. member for Vaudreuil had put to the President 
of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs. The hon. member for Roberval was 
wondering about the nature of this question and how it related to 
the responsibilities of the federal government.
<P>
	Yesterday, the hon. parliamentary secretary to the government 
House leader expressed the opinion that the question was in order, 
as the minister is in fact responsible for intergovernmental issues.
<P>
	I did review <I>Hansard </I>and I have come to the conclusion that, as 
formulated, the question asked by the hon. member for Vaudreuil 
does not strictly speaking meet the guidelines on oral questions. It 
was seeking an opinion from the minister instead of information on 
a matter coming within his administrative capacity.
<P>
	The Chair should at least have cut in and asked that the question 
be restated in terms that related more closely to the government's 
administrative responsibilities. As a matter of fact, yesterday, the 
hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi asked a similar question in a 
way that meets the requirements of our rules.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All hon. members will no doubt sympathize with the Chair that 
in the cut and thrust of question period sometimes certain questions 
escape your Speaker. I take this opportunity to ask for all hon. 
members to co-operate with the Chair and formulate the questions 
so that they are strictly relevant to the administrative 
responsibilities of the government, that they are not based on 
hypotheses, and respect the dignity of this Chamber in the choice of 
vocabulary.

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-102, an act to amend the Customs Act and the 
Customs Tariff and to make related and consequential amendments 
to other acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to begin 
debate on second reading of Bill C-102, an act to amend the 
Customs Act and Customs Tariff.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14727"> 14727 </A></B>
<P>
	I will begin by going through the major points the bill touches 
on. It provides for the enhancement to Canada's duty deferral 
program, including duty drawback, inward  processing and bonding 
warehousing to improve the competitive position of Canadian 
industry.
<P>
	It provides for tariff reductions on a wide range of 
manufacturing inputs and certain other goods requested by 
Canadian manufacturers to improve competitiveness.
<P>
	It provides for increases in travellers' exemptions on what is 
called basket tariff items to facilitate the processing of travellers.
<P>
	It provides for amendments to the Access to Information Act to 
ensure confidential business information provided to Revenue 
Canada and finance is protected from disclosure to third parties.
<P>
	The conversion of the Canadian retailers duty remission order 
1993 is changed for statutory provisions to improve the 
transparency of these tariff relief provisions.
<P>
	Certain regulatory tariff reductions will be introduced directly 
into the customs tariff to improve the transparency of these tariff 
relief provisions.
<P>
	It provides for seasonal and non-seasonal tariff provisions for 
dry shallots to ensure they are duty free when unavailable from 
Canadian growers.
<P>
	There are amendments to allow for possible future 
improvements to preferential tariff treatments for the world's 
poorest developing countries to improve their export opportunities.
<P>
	It provides for the withdrawal of the duty free British 
preferential tariff rate on certain rubber footwear to protect 
Canadian production and jobs.
<P>
	It provides for a clarification of various provisions in current 
customs and tariff legislation.
<P>
	It provides a number of other technical and housekeeping 
changes to the customs tariff.
<P>
	A number of these provisions, including the tariff reductions, 
increases in travellers' exemption and withdrawal of the BPT, the 
British preferential tariff on rubber footwear, came into effect on 
the tabling of the notice of ways and means motion by the Minister 
of Finance on June 13, 1995. The remaining provisions, including 
the duty deferral amendments, are to come into force by order in 
council after royal assent.
<P>
	This bill contributes largely to the good government theme that 
we have provided to Canadians since the election two years ago. A 
number of the measures provided for in Bill C-102 build on the 
government's review of Canada's tariff regime announced in the 
1994 budget and are designed to ensure Canada remains a 
favourable location for producing goods and for investment and 
also that Canadian businesses, including small businesses, are 
placed in a better position to profit from Canada's free trade 
agreements.
<P>
	Certain amendments, for example the enhancements to duty 
deferral programs and tariff reductions on  manufacturing inputs, 
are designed to lower business' input costs and maintain and 
enhance the competitiveness of Canadian businesses in Canadian 
and world markets.
<P>
	Bill C-102 also provides for a number of technical changes to 
simplify and clarify and modernize the customs tariff and its 
administration and make it easier and less costly for business to 
access tariff relief programs. The amendments to facilitate the 
processing of travellers at the border will allow Revenue Canada, 
through its customs section, to focus on other important border 
issues such as the smuggling and processing of growing 
commercial imports.
<P>
	Several of the amendments in Bill C-102 result from broad 
consultations with the private sector and are at its request to 
respond to competitiveness problems faced by Canadian 
businesses.
<P>
	The bill seeks to implement three major tariff amendments that 
will deliver significant long term benefits to Canadian businesses 
and individuals.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	I will outline these. The first two will improve the competitive 
position of Canadian industry by lowering input costs, thereby 
creating employment opportunities for Canadians and lowering 
prices for consumers. The two amendments to which I am referring 
are the enhancement to Canada's duty deferral programs and the 
reduction of tariffs on a wide range of manufacturing imports.
<P>
	A third amendment, increasing travellers' exemptions, will 
facilitate the processing of travellers. In addition to benefiting 
consumers this will help our customs officers focus on real 
priorities by processing our growing commercial imports and 
combating the crime of smuggling. The legislation also contains a 
number of technical changes that will help modernize the customs 
tariff and its administration.
<P>
	We believe the proposed changes will affect billions of dollars 
worth of trade. Their impact then will be both beneficial and 
significant in scope.
<P>
	Because of the significance of these changes the government has 
consulted on them, responding directly to problems Canadians, 
whether in their businesses or as individuals, have identified. We 
can say therefore with confidence the measures I am about to 
describe will be welcomed by the great majority of Canadians 
affected by them. I urge my hon. colleagues to bear this in mind 
when they are asked to give their support to the bill.
<P>
	Let me outline each of the three major amendments. I will first 
talk about the enhancements to Canada's duty deferral programs. I 
know duty deferral is not the stuff of everyday conversation and so 
I will take a moment to provide some background.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14728"> 14728 </A></B>
<P>
	Duty deferral programs defer or relieve certain customs duties 
and taxes on imported goods which are re-exported. Canada 
presently has three duty deferral programs, duty drawback, inward 
processing and bonded warehousing. Over the years Canadian 
business has asked for improvements to these programs to make 
them more competitive with similar programs of our major trading 
partners.
<P>
	The changes contained in the bill before us respond to that need. 
They will enhance, streamline and consolidate these three 
programs. They will provide as much up front relief as possible to 
ease cash flow pressures and to reduce input costs on Canada's 
exports.
<P>
	The proposed changes will also make the program more easily 
accessible for small and medium size businesses by reducing the 
administrative restrictions currently in place. Other changes will 
enable regions to market Canada's duty deferral programs more 
effectively in competition with free trade zones around the world. 
This will help attract and keep investment in Canada. The changes I 
have described enjoy broad industry and regional support.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, for other members of Parliament in your area of St. 
Catharines there will be a great deal of improvements through the 
changes in these programs. The government is very proud of its 
ability to help out areas such as the Niagara Peninsula in dealing 
with the American market. In Winnipeg there are many proposals 
being brought forward as a result of the changes we are proposing.
<P>
	It is a key priority of the government to ensure Canadian 
business has every opportunity to compete fairly and effectively 
and profit fully from Canada's expanding access to international 
markets.
<P>
	Related to the enhancement of duty deferral is a change to the 
Access to Information Act. This change will protect the 
confidentiality of taxpayer information provided by the importing 
community under the Customs Act, Customs Tariff and the Special 
Import Measures Act.
<P>
	Let me turn now to the second major amendment to Bill C-102, 
the reduction in tariffs on a wide range of manufacturing inputs. 
This amendment is also directed toward the relief of duties on 
Canadian manufacturing inputs so that our producers compete 
more effectively. This amendment will enhance the 
competitiveness of Canadian producers both internationally and 
within Canada.
<P>
	In essence we will be removing a competitive disadvantage that 
currently burdens Canadian manufacturers vis-à-vis with their 
American counterparts. We will do this by reducing tariffs on some 
1,500 imported manufacturing inputs dutiable at rates higher than 
those of the United States. I remind my hon. colleagues this 
measure was announced in the 1994  budget. It is being 
implemented now following extensive consultations. The measure 
enjoys strong industry support.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	To appreciate the significance of this measure hon. members 
should be aware that one third of Canada's imports are 
manufacturing imports. Since American tariff rates are on average 
about 3.2 percentage points below ours, 5.4 per cent versus 8.5 per 
cent, U.S. producers enjoy a significant advantage.
<P>
	Right now this discrepancy negatively affects Canadian 
manufacturers, principally in the domestic markets. That is 
because exporters are entitled to receive reimbursement of their 
input duties through what is commonly known as duty drawback or 
inward processing.
<P>
	However, as of January 1, 1996 under the NAFTA drawback will 
be subject to certain restrictions. Therefore to ensure Canadian 
exporters enjoy the full benefit of Canada's free trade agreement 
we must bring our most favoured nation status tariffs on input in 
line with those of the United States. The 1,500 inputs covered by 
this amendment account for over $2.5 billion in trade.
<P>
	The third amendment is the increase of duty exemptions for 
Canadians travelling abroad. Traveller exemptions are adjusted 
periodically. However, our exemptions have not been increased 
since 1983. As a result they are currently out of line with the 
exemptions provided for by our major trading partners. Our current 
limits are $20 after a 24 hour absence, $100 after 48 hours and $300 
after seven days, but only once a year.
<P>
	U.S. limits in a striking contrast are $400 once a month with a 
general exemption of $200. Residents of the European Union can 
bring in about $300 Canadian in dutiable goods after any absence.
<P>
	The status quo is hard on consumers and customs officials alike. 
It also runs counter to Canada's and the United States' commitment 
under the accord of our shared border to permit travellers and 
goods to move easily across the Canada-U.S. border. For these 
reasons the bill will raise the levels of exemptions to as follows: to 
$50 from $20 after a 24 hour absence; to $200 from $100 after 48 
hours and to $500 from $300 after seven days, with the once a year 
limit being dropped. Naturally Canadian travellers will welcome 
this change. It also benefits customs administration because it will 
ease border congestion.
<P>
	As I said earlier, this will enable Canadian customs authorities to 
concentrate more effectively on real priorities like cracking down 
on smugglers and processing commercial imports. These have 
increased by 43 per cent since 1992.
<P>
	I am aware some of my hon. colleagues may be concerned about 
the possible impact on retailers in  border areas. I too care about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14729"> 14729 </A></B>
<P>
these retailers but I am convinced this legislation will not have a 
negative impact on their operations.
<P>
	In short, this should be regarded as a simple updating measure 
with minimal economic or revenue loss and a potentially positive 
impact on trade, business and tourism. It is already operating 
without disruption.
<P>
	In addition to the three principle amendments, the bill contains a 
number of other changes of a largely technical or housekeeping 
nature. Most will serve to clarify the intent of existing custom and 
tariff provisions.
<P>
	Also included in the legislation is a measure that will, like the 
increase in traveller exemptions, work to streamline Canada's 
customs clearance procedures under what is known as a basket 
tariff item basis.
<P>
	Under this travellers measure the government is proposing to 
replace the thousands of existing categories of goods with as few as 
12 categories. This will speed up collection of duties from 
travellers at the border by more than 50 per cent.
<P>
	The bill also provides for tariff reductions on certain finished 
goods. These reductions have been made at the request of Canadian 
manufacturers on grounds of competitiveness.
<P>
	There is only one tariff rate increase in the package. The British 
preferential tariff is being withdraw from certain rubber footwear, 
thereby restoring the 20 per cent most favoured nation tariff rate.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	This change is consistent with the permanent removal last year 
of a general preferential tariff on rubber footwear from developing 
countries. It will prevent countries from circumventing the general 
preferential tariff withdrawal action and thereby jeopardizing 
production and jobs in the Canadian shoe industry.
<P>
	Former British preferential trade tariff exports will still have 
access to the Canadian market. They will simply have to compete 
on the same basis as other foreign suppliers.
<P>
	At the same time the bill allows for possible future 
improvements to preferential tariff treatment for the world's 
poorest developing nations. I am confident that Canadians support 
the goal of enabling these countries to improve their export 
opportunities. Such changes could also result in lower import costs 
that will benefit Canadian consumers.
<P>
	Some of my hon. colleagues may ask about the revenue 
implications of all these changes as I am outlining them today. As I 
have already said, the decision to increase travellers' exemptions 
has minimal implications for government revenues. As for the 
revenue impact and other measures, we are confident that any cost 
will be more than outweighed by the long term economic benefits 
of the proposals: improved  competitiveness, increased exports and 
enhanced employment prospects for Canadians.
<P>
	In short, the legislation is about providing a meaningful, long 
term boost to the Canadian economy. It will help ensure that 
Canada maximizes its benefit under the free trade agreement we 
have entered. It enjoys the support of business and consumers 
alike.
<P>
	Last year alone, Canada's merchandise trade surplus with the 
U.S. was over $28 million, our largest ever. The benefits to 
Canadians of such a healthy export sector are beyond doubt, and 
the government is committed to ensuring that they continue and 
expand. I urge all my hon. colleagues to join me in sustaining that 
commitment by supporting the legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-102 is rather complex but can be summarized easily by 
explaining that it seeks to lower custom duties, in compliance with 
NAFTA's most-favoured-nation tariff.
<P>
	This bill includes some 100 pages of tariff items which I will not 
list, for obvious reasons. We will support this legislation because it 
is consistent with the opening up of our borders, something which 
the Bloc Quebecois has always promoted and which reflects the 
situation that has always prevailed in Quebec, particularly since 
1988, when free trade was a major issue in the federal elections. At 
the time, Quebecers massively supported a party which was 
promoting free trade. The 1988 election was essentially a vote on 
free trade and the Conservative party won.
<P>
	Quebecers showed their strong desire to be part of the major 
economic blocs. They felt confident that they could do well in the 
context of a global market.
<P>
	Bill C-102, an act to amend the Customs Act and the Customs 
Tariff and to make related and consequential amendments to other 
acts, is essentially in line with the recent North American Free 
Trade Agreement.
<P>
	Some provisions of this bill seek to amend amounts and increase 
exemptions, depending on the length of the stay abroad, when 
goods are brought back to Canada.
<P>
	These amounts vary depending on certain factors, including the 
length of stay. In fact, these provisions have been in effect for 
several months, since a ways and means notice was passed before 
the end of the last session.
<P>
	This is all part of promoting trade with our economic partners in 
the United States and now Mexico, and increasingly, there are 
plans to extend this free trade zone to other countries, Chile, for 
instance, and then we would have a vast economic zone covering 
North America and gradually extending towards South America. 
This is now the policy of a government that, since it came to power, 
has been won over by the arguments of certain ministers, including 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14730"> 14730 </A></B>
<P>
the Minister of International  Trade who was pro free trade, 
although his leader was far less enthusiastic, at least during the last 
election campaign.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	But once they came to power, common sense seems to have 
prevailed. We now see on the government benches a party that is 
very pro free trade and very open to international trade, which 
corresponds with the interests of the Canada they represent and the 
interests of the Quebec we represent.
<P>
	You can see what I am driving at. Of course I am going to draw a 
parallel with what is going to happen. I just want to say I am 
surprised at what people say outside the House or even in the House 
when they talk about the political situation in Quebec. As we know, 
in Quebec there will be a referendum in which Quebecers will be 
asked to speak out on sovereignty, and also on an offer of economic 
and political partnership which, to use the terms of this bill, is 
aimed at maintaining the free circulation of goods, persons, capital, 
a customs union, a monetary policy, manpower mobility, and so 
forth. All measures we are trying to take now.
<P>
	Canada today, especially with respect to the free circulation of 
goods and services, capital and individuals-admittedly not as free 
in the case of individuals, but consider the other three-especially 
with the Americans and the Mexicans and soon with the Chileans, 
and there is also a whole strategy of trade development, which is 
more important for provinces like British Columbia or the other 
western provinces where they are looking at the Asian market for 
business opportunities.
<P>
	However, behind all these rules for trading with these countries, 
we have to look at the figures and the nitty-gritty. Today, trade 
between Quebec and Ontario is very substantial. Trade in goods 
and services between the two is around 40 to 45 billion. I would 
like to say to those who are listening to us that when I see a 
government, the present federal government, adopting a measure 
such as this which is aimed at facilitating trade with the United 
States, I have trouble understanding why the same thing would not 
be done with a partner just on the other side of its border, that is 
Quebec, instead of saying ``Between us and you trade will be 
restricted''.
<P>
	I was listening to the parliamentary secretary's interesting 
statement, in which he said that it would make it possible to reduce 
input costs. That when you reduce input costs, it makes it possible 
to create employment opportunities and stimulate exports. That is 
absolutely true.
<P>
	The input referred to is the material used to produce a finished 
product. For example, the wood used to make a piece of furniture is 
an input. So, the items used as an input in production, that is where 
customs tariffs are reduced progressively on inputs, tending toward 
their  eventual elimination in order to create employment. This is 
the same logic which gave rise to the goods and services tax. That 
system of taxation resulted in no tax on inputs used in 
manufacturing. That is what the previous government did.
<P>
	The members of this government vigorously criticized this tax, 
which they labelled as new but which replaced an old one. It did not 
necessarily replace it because they are very much aware that this 
tax is totally in line with the principles they are defending in this 
act, that is to encourage our exports. Yet the GST is not perfect. 
There will be a chance to discuss it when taxation is discussed a 
little later this afternoon. We are still waiting for the amendments 
the government intends to propose and implement in order to make 
good on its election promises. It does not have much time left. I 
doubt it can do so but we will have an opportunity to discuss this 
later.
<P>
	Saying that we must promote our exports and ensure that the 
materials used in our exports are as cheap as possible is quite 
consistent with the trade logic of 1995 and the next decade.
<P>
	Political decisions matter little. However, if Quebecers decided 
to take control of their political future while maintaining economic 
links with Canada, why would an entrepreneur from Ontario, for 
instance, who buys materials from Quebec because they are 
cheaper there say, ``In the future I will buy more expensive 
materials; I want to be less competitive because the Prime Minister 
of Canada tells me we should not do business with Quebec''?
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Do you think this kind of logic will prevail? No way. What will 
prevail is the same capitalist business logic in effect today. These 
people will look for the cheapest materials and products available. 
They will continue to buy and to sell to all those willing to buy their 
products. No one will refuse to sell goods and services to those who 
want to buy them. This is not the way our economy works.
<P>
	I do not know any entrepreneur in Quebec or Canada who would 
refuse to sell their products to anyone because of their political 
affiliation or the political system in which they live. Even Canadian 
business people invest in South Africa despite its very 
controversial political system. Although that country does not have 
the most stable political system, people still invest there because 
they see business opportunities in mining and gold among other 
sectors.
<P>
	The people who will invest here know that it will be more 
profitable for them. It will be the same thing the day after the 
referendum. They invest here because they see the best market 
opportunities.
<P>
	That is why I am quite puzzled by the Prime Minister's political 
stand. His Minister of Labour, who is  responsible for the referen-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14731"> 14731 </A></B>
<P>
dum in Quebec, seems out of step with the bill before us, which is 
aimed at promoting Canada's foreign trade.
<P>
	It seems to me that this government is committed to promoting 
trade so Canadian businesses can export as much as possible. I 
would be very surprised if, after October 30, the government 
decided to put a brake on this direction for all kinds of political 
reasons because its stated priority, although it is still hard to 
believe, is job creation. If job creation is a priority, would it be in 
the government's interest to act in a way that will hinder job 
creation? I think not.
<P>
	The people of Quebec and Canada can clearly see the economic 
conditions we are in. In Ville-Marie, where I live, if I look across 
the lake as I wake up in the morning, I can see Ontario. All that 
separates us is a lake just a few miles long. So, on not too foggy 
days, we can see the other side of the lake. On week-ends, people 
often go across to buy goods and services in Ontario; out of habit 
for some, but also because a certain type of service-based economy 
has developed over there. The same thing goes for the other end of 
my riding, in the City of Témiscamingue, where 200 Ontarians 
come in to work every morning at a very successful pulp and paper 
operation we have there. These people will want to keep on 
working in Quebec, I am sure. They will also want Quebec 
customers who buy their products in their shopping centres and 
businesses to keep doing so. Coincidentally, Témiscamingue is 
also located in the riding represented by the Premier of Ontario, 
who just got himself elected on the promise of major tax 
reductions.
<P>
	I am convinced that he will want to look after the interests of his 
constituents, protect their jobs and business opportunities for the 
local business community. There will be discussions, negotiations 
and agreements. Everybody will keep working according to the 
spirit of the legislation before us today and which we support. It is 
intended to foster foreign trade. The days of closed, self-centred 
economies are over. Around the world, all markets are becoming 
increasingly open, forming into major trading blocs, be it in 
Europe, here in North America, in South America or Asia.
<P>
	Last year, a parliamentary delegation travelled to Australia. It 
became clear that this country wished to integrate the Asian 
economic bloc. Everyone is trying to join a bloc without 
necessarily losing their own political identity in the process. 
Australians remain Australians, even though they are trying to join 
the Asian economic market place.
<P>
	The same choice is being put to the people of Quebec, who will 
have to decide. What I want to do is to reassure them by showing 
them that, when we see people act like the government today, we 
realize that when the time comes to take concrete action, the 
economic reality prevails over the strategic political line designed 
to sow  fear, confusion and doubt in the people's minds. I often say 
that economics are one thing and politics another. I was involved 
with economics before getting into politics, and I may revert back 
some say, who knows, but it is quite clear to me that trends-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Six weeks from now.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> We will see. If Quebecers say yes, it will indeed be 
soon. Otherwise, we will see. There is an economic logic which all 
political parties, regardless of their position, have had to recognize 
in recent years. I doubt there are many in this House who are 
opposed to the opening up of our borders and to the fact that we can 
now help our businesses have access to foreign markets.
<P>
	The American market is extremely appealing and will be even 
more so in the years to come, given the natural interest that 
currently exists for a north-south trade corridor. Over time, we did 
manage to develop an east-west economy in Canada. We built a 
railroad network and developed infrastructures to promote 
interprovincial trade. We can now see what is happening with the 
dismantling of the railway system. The more natural corridors are 
now emerging. The government can no longer afford to try to 
create artificial corridors.
<P>
	Nevertheless, east-west trade developed over time and will 
continue to exist, but there is a natural need for a north-south 
movement of goods and services. The northern U.S. states 
immediately come to mind, but there is also the whole American 
market. Some very interesting business opportunities currently 
exist and will continue to exist after October 30.
<P>
	We will do well if our entrepreneurs are able to manufacture 
products which offer a good quality-price ratio. If we are good 
today, we will still be good in a month. Canadians will still be good 
in a month and so will Quebecers, in those sectors where they 
already do well. However, we will not instantly become good in 
those sectors where do not already do well. We will have to work 
hard. But we will continue to do business on the basis of the logic 
that governs business activity.
<P>
	At some point, we will have to stop getting the public confused 
by saying that business activity develops according to the political 
opinions of politicians. The business community will be there long 
after this government is gone. The logic that governs free trade will 
probably prevail longer than this government, at least I hope so, 
thus offering interesting development opportunities.
<P>
	Later on this afternoon, I will have the opportunity to address 
another bill dealing with taxation. However, the bill before us, 
which contains some 100 pages of amendments designed to reflect 
the international agreements and treaties signed by Canada, 
promotes economic development and is also in line with the 
economic logic that currently prevails and that will  continue to 
prevail in the future. I am pleased to see that the government is 
headed in the right direction. When it comes to the economy as a 
concrete reality, the logic that applies will still apply in six weeks.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we 
are discussing and debating Bill C-102, an act to amend the 
Customs Act and the customs tariff and make related and 
consequential amendments to other acts. It is a fairly large bill and 
there are some pretty good items in here. I would like to address a 
few of them.
<P>
	The Reform Party favours and supports Bill C-102. This bill 
reduces tariffs on a broad range of goods used as inputs in Canadian 
manufacturing and operations and on certain finished goods. It 
enacts changes to streamline and consolidate Canada's duty 
deferral programs and make them more accessible to all 
manufacturers. It increases the amount of goods that Canadians can 
bring home from abroad. I will get back to that more specifically 
later.
<P>
	Overall, this bill reflects all Canadian tariffs where previously 
the tariff was higher than the U.S. level. This of course was a 
requirement in the NAFTA agreement and allows us to compete on 
an equal footing with the United States.
<P>
	This bill sets the framework for establishing free trade zones 
within Canada. By streamlining regulations regarding tariffs, cities 
or other regions are now able to provide additional incentives to set 
up a free trade zone. This allows free trade zones to be set up and 
funded under the auspices of local rather than the federal 
government, that level of government closest to the people. It is a 
philosophy and a theory we support. It eliminates the duplication of 
services among federal, provincial and municipal governments. It 
even gets communities involved and is something that is headed in 
the right direction.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	Other tariff reductions in the bill are part of a biannual review of 
Canadian tariffs and are a result of ongoing consultations with 
various industries and other requests to lower tariffs to increase the 
competitiveness of Canadian exports.
<P>
	I would like to say to the taxpayers who are listening to the 
debate today that this bill gives effect to what they have already 
been enjoying. It often baffles me how we can be doing things 
when the law has not yet been passed, but we are out there in the 
marketplace doing it. I do not know how it works. Nevertheless, 
this is a measure my party supports.
<P>
	For those taxpayers who are listening, this is a bill that increases 
the limits when they go to the United States. If Canadian citizens 
are out of the country for not less than 24 hours they can bring 
home $50 worth of product. If  they are out for 48 hours it is $200, 
and if it is not less than seven days it is $500.
<P>
	Reformers support Bill C-102 because it reduces tariffs and 
makes Canadian business more internationally competitive. It is in 
favour of free trade, as our party has been all along. It started that 
way and it always will be that way, unlike the government.
<P>
	Government members argued and said that they were against the 
NAFTA. They argued and said that they would renegotiate the 
NAFTA. They argued and said that it is not in the best interests of 
Canadians. Perhaps the hon. member for Kamloops might have a 
few more words to say on that topic. However, when they formed 
the government they reneged on that promise. I recall that they 
indicated in the red book that they would look at the NAFTA. I 
believe the government made the right decision. It was wise for 
them to change their minds. It was wise to break that promise. It 
did Canadians a favour and we will benefit from it in the long term.
<P>
	Of all the tariff changes, and there are well over 1,500, there is 
only one increase in tariff; all the others are decreases. In case the 
finance minister wants to buy a pair to present his next budget, the 
increase is on rubber boots imported from Great Britain. I think he 
needs a pair of rubber boots. We all know how he keeps digging our 
debt hole deeper and deeper every day. He believes in digging 
deeper. He is committed to digging deeper. He is only adding at the 
rate of 3 per cent of GDP. That is much less than the Conservative 
government, but it is still in the billions and billions of dollars. He 
keeps adding to the problem, not solving the problem. I think a pair 
of boots rather than a pair of shoes might be ideal for the next 
budget. Why not, in light of our economic situation?
<P>
	This is an opportunity for me to put in a plug for something I 
think has to happen. It has to come about. The time has come. 
There are members on the other side who agree with this and there 
are members on this side who agree with this. I believe there are 
even some members of the Bloc Quebecois who agree with it. 
Whether they are in this country or in another country, they will 
probably have to look at this as well.
<P>
	Why not look at the total reform of our taxation system? 
Simplify it by redistributing the tax base. Broaden the tax base so 
that we can introduce the lowest possible rate. This sort of taxation 
system that is being bandied about is called a flat tax. A flat tax is 
something that should be debated. It is necessary.
<P>
	The underground economy is growing. We know how strong the 
underground economy is in Atlantic Canada. We have just come 
back from there and we know it is operating. We know that it 
operates here. I know it operates in Calgary. I know it operates in 
Edmonton. There is no need for that to happen.
<P>
	Businesses are losing out to American companies. Bills like Bill 
C-102 help to restore faith in imports and exports. It helps to bring 
us back to competitiveness. However, because of our complicated 
income tax system investors are investing outside of Canada at a 
faster pace than ever before. I hope the government listens and does 
something about it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14733"> 14733 </A></B>
<P>
	The United States is also looking. The United States initiated the 
free trade discussions and is looking at ways and means to improve 
their tax system. The United States already has a lower tax regime 
than we do. It already has governments that spend less than we do. 
Our problem is still high spending in this country, and the 
government will not reduce it fast enough. Eventually, when we get 
over on the other side, we will be able to solve that problem.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	If the United States is going to be looking at a flat tax, we should 
be doing the same. If we are not working in parallel, if we are not 
working in unison, we will become uncompetitive and our 
businesses will not be able to compete. If we do not address this 
and soon, it will hurt an awful lot of Canadians and this country.
<P>
	We encourage the government to continue further down the road 
established by this bill and continue to reduce tariffs to facilitate 
international trade. The federal government has extensive powers 
to reduce tariffs further and should continue to do so.
<P>
	There is one item I just remembered. When the parliamentary 
secretary to the Minister of Finance addressed Bill C-102 he 
indicated that this bill and also Bill S-9 would help the customs 
people do a good job and represent us well. When he made that 
point he gave the impression that our customs officials are right on 
top of it and doing a good job.
<P>
	I would like to point out to him two issues and two stories. We 
read about the spray story in the media where Bob and Ramona 
Edgerton got rapped on the knuckles for bringing that in. This is 
another one that sadly distresses me. This happened to a couple 
who came to Canada on a holiday. It happened at the 
Huntington-Sumas border crossing. They are in their sixties. They 
were driving through customs. The official asked if they had 
anything to declare. As Mr. Edgerton says in his own words:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The sin was, of course, honesty. While files of cars with Canadian plates 
streamed north unimpeded, I told the customs agent that we had a bottle of wine 
and a six-pack of beer in the trunk.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He asked what kind of bottle and I told him a ``jug''. This immediately 
excited him and he was out of his border hut in a flash-well more like a waddle. 
Sitting for hours and harassing geriatric tourists doesn't keep one physically fit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Anyway, he seemed puzzled by the word ``jug'' (perhaps the term is unknown 
in Canada) and demanded to see it. I opened the trunk and pointed to a paper sack; 
therein was a jug of cheap  white wine. The agent examined it at length. It was as if it 
was the Holy Grail had fallen into his hands.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The man replaced the jug and started to scribble on a pad. I started to close the 
trunk, but he stayed my hand, demanding to examine the six-pack of beer. This 
he did with the bedazzled look of a person who is viewing a six-pack for the first 
time.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then he announced that I could pay duty or abandon these items. I foolishly 
opted for duty. Inside the office, I encountered another agent who examined the 
first one's citation and asked if I had a receipt for the wine and beer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Back I went to the car and after some rummaging actually found a grocery 
receipt. All this time scores of cars with Canadian plates were streaming 
northward at a mighty clip. Not a truck was opened, hardly did they pause at the 
checkpoint.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We know that smuggling of guns and liquor is also a big item 
with these trucks, so we should have been checking a few of them.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I took the receipt inside, handed it over. The beer and wine had cost just under 
$12. The agent inside said the duty would be $18. I couldn't believe it! A duty of 
150 per cent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It was then I decided to abandon the potables to the customs people, who next 
asked me-demanded, actually-that I sign a receipt. I signed something that 
was written partially in French. I don't read French. I may have agreed to give 
up my possessions and spend my few remaining years in a penal colony outside 
Yellowknife. I know not, nor do I care.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What I do know is I shall never willingly return to Canada, which will no 
doubt please most Canadians. The question then is how to recoup my $12. I 
thought of poaching a few salmon from the mighty Fraser or spray-painting a 
police cruiser.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But no. Instead, my plan is to avoid all western Canadian games events, 
cancel a trip to Vancouver, begin dieting and get out of Canada post haste.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Actually, the customs people-who even now are drinking cheap white wine 
and quaffing economy beer-have not cost me $12, but saved me hundreds. Oh, 
Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Doug Walker has gratefully returned to his home in Asheville, 
North Carolina.
<P>
	I would not want this government to think that everything it has 
done, the way it has done it, and how it has done it is perfect. It is 
not a perfect world. There is work out there to be done. To gloss 
over events like this hurts Canada and its reputation. I see no need 
for that kind of action and activity. That division and that 
department should be looked at.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
great pleasure for me to speak today on Bill C-102. As a member of 
the St. Catharines promotion task force prior to my election as MP 
and one who had worked on free trade zones in the U.S., it gives me 
great pleasure to be able to speak today as a member of Parliament 
on the bill.
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not give credit to a number of 
committee members in St. Catharines: Don Chambers, Don 
Johnston, Don Wiley, Ian Spraggon, James Wakil  and Mike Haines 
who helped in the work on free trade zones.
<P>
	Free trade zones in the U.S. are right across the border from us. 
There are six free trade zones with which the Niagara area has to 
compete. It is not only the fact that they are free trade zones but the 
Association of Free Trade Zones meets directly across the border in 
Buffalo.
<P>
	While doing some research and working on the committee it was 
interesting to note the advantages of free trade zones that were 
published in the U.S: land and store imported goods quickly 
without full custom formalities; wait until goods leave the zone to 
pay duty; display goods in showrooms in the zone and have buyers 
inspect and sample merchandise; process, assemble and otherwise 
process goods to qualify for lower duty; when manufacturing in a 
foreign trade zone choose the most advantageous type of duty and 
quota limitations; salvage or repair damaged goods duty and quota 
free while finding a suitable market; and store goods indefinitely to 
await the best market conditions. These are only some of the 
advantages proposed by free trade zones in the U.S.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14734"> 14734 </A></B>
<P>
	Curiously the six free trade zones across from the Niagara area 
were all started by a Canadian, George Keitner, from Montreal. I 
give him credit for starting free trade zones. In the previous 
government he could not get his point across that in addition to free 
trade and NAFTA we had to work out the details in the accounting 
systems of our country. It seems that those details were not taken 
care of back home.
<P>
	We had consultations and worked with various communities 
across the country. I had the pleasure of working with members 
from the communities of Vancouver, Calgary, Newfoundland, St. 
Catharines and Montreal. Consultations with businesses have 
accommodated Bill C-102. More important, business, industry and 
manufacturing people played a part in the changes.
<P>
	Other advantages were the streamlining and consolidating of 
duty deferral programs in the customs tariff; making the paperwork 
more user friendly; making it easier on cash flow; and, more 
important, allowing various businesses in regions and 
municipalities to effectively market their programs from their 
areas.
<P>
	We all have various opportunities in our communities, no matter 
where we come from as members of Parliament. The bill will allow 
various teams in communities to create their focus and exporting 
niche. We have different products across the country so we can all 
take advantage of additional exports.
<P>
	As cited in the foreign affairs and international trade report last 
spring, creating and promoting an international orientation for 
business in Canada should be a priority objective. Bill C-102 helps 
meet that objective by providing access to the program by the 
businesses and communities I mentioned earlier and by  allowing 
the economic development programs to flourish. It does not 
restrict. It assists business manufacturers to make things happen. 
Of course in the end this means jobs for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	I especially like the wording of the bill. As my colleague across 
the way mentioned, the bill is quite thick. Current inward 
processing allows the relief of customs duties and the various taxes 
and excise taxes and enables the cost of doing business to come 
down. The bill also allows new manufacturers and new start-up 
companies to get into the business instead of having a history on 
which they have to report. Having new businesses getting into 
exports allows us to build our international export trade.
<P>
	Streamlining customs duties and requirements will make it much 
easier for our manufacturers. We will have to build in 
accountability but it is better to build in accountability rather than 
restrictions.
<P>
	I am reminded when we toured many of the free trade zones in 
the U.S. of the physical barrier requirement. In Bill C-102 no 
physical barrier will be required. It will be an easy and simple 
system, created as such so that our manufacturing strength in 
Canada can be improved even further on the export markets.
<P>
	I am also reminded imported goods and domestic goods can be 
used interchangeably. Many of the items previous speakers have 
mentioned will be advantageous. After touring some 60 free trade 
zones in the U.S. and having discussions with various people, the 
government in the co-operation with the users of the bill has made 
a substantial improvement on how we do business in Canada.
<P>
	As mentioned before, it is the duty of the Government of Canada 
to assist business in making things happen. In the bonded 
warehouse provisions, activities currently provided for in the 
bonded warehouse legislation such as storage, packaging, 
repackaging, labelling, normal maintenance, servicing, complying 
with any applicable law of Canada and testing of same will 
continue. There are also improvements. The government needs to 
continue to look at our systems, in this case duty deferral and 
remission programs, and make continuous improvements as we go 
along.
<P>
	Over time product research and product lifecycles change. 
Therefore our accounting system needs to change. In the proposal 
storage time has been increased to four years, which will allow 
various businesses and companies in the manufacturing sector to 
determine their own productivity planning, to determine their own 
productivity cycles, rather than the system telling them how to 
produce.
<P>
	In previous discussions I mentioned the 60 free trade zones with 
which our committee exchanged information. In this government 
proposal and the submission put  forward we have taken the best of 
many free trade zones and incorporated them into our structure. It 
is a team Canada approach to making things happen.
<P>
	As a result we will increase our exports. More and more 
companies and businesses will see that although their competitors 
may be unproductive they will be co-operating as they export more 
and more products around the world. We are into a global situation 
and these improvements are perfect timing as we look forward to 
next year's budget.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	I bring to the attention of the House how manufacturing will 
benefit from this proposal. Often we take manufacturing and 
manufacturing jobs lightly. We forget that some 1.8 million 
Canadians are directly employed in manufacturing and over 2 
million depend on our industry for their livelihood. Almost 50 per 
cent of goods manufactured in Canada are exported. In 1980 it was 
25 per cent and now it is 50 per cent.
<P>
	I also bring to the attention of the House that some 75 per cent of 
the research and development in the private sector is done in 
manufacturing.
<P>
	With the assistance of Bill C-102 I am sure that many 
manufacturing businesses will take advantage of the system 
because the cost of doing business will be reduced. When we 
reduce the cost of doing business we allow for more business to be 
done and we can compete on a world scale.
<P>
	The government continues to work to remove paperwork and 
make the system more effective. It helps companies and businesses 
to spend their time on sales, research and productivity. It will 
improve exports, Canadian quality and costs, making us even more 
competitive. As I mentioned earlier, jobs in Canada will be 
improved by exports without a major cost or expenditure by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14735"> 14735 </A></B>
<P>
government. There is a way to improve the employment situation 
and make things happen.
<P>
	I commend the finance department for all the work it has done on 
the bill. It is obvious that with support from the three previous 
speakers and working together as Canadians we can improve our 
system in Canada and complete on a global level.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we 
have heard a couple of times today, we are debating Bill C-102, an 
act to amend the Customs Act and customs tariff and make related 
amendments to other acts.
<P>
	This is a very important bill. As the trade critic for our party I 
say that it is vitally important to reduce tariffs as quickly as we can. 
The Reform Party fully supports the bill.
<P>
	The bill reduces well over 1,500 tariffs and since we are a pro 
free trade party we are in favour of all of them.  The tariffs being 
reduced are on a broad range of goods used as inputs into Canadian 
manufacturing operations on certain finished products. By 
reducing these tariffs our costs of manufacturing will be reduced. 
The result is that manufacturers will be able to invest more money 
into plants and equipment.
<P>
	This type of tariff reduction, I would submit, is a stimulant to our 
economy. It will create more jobs than the old-fashioned job 
creation programs we have seen in the past. I urge the government 
to go further down the road and establish as many cuts to existing 
tariffs as possible to move this along as quickly as possible.
<P>
	The cost incurred by Canadian manufacturers are already high 
enough by virtue of our climate and our great distance from 
markets. Let us give our manufacturers a break and eliminate these 
tariffs wherever possible.
<P>
	We will also be eliminating a lot of paperwork and red tape. 
Working through all the red tape is a big cost of doing business. I 
would not be surprised if many of these tariffs actually cost the 
government more to collect than what it gets from them.
<P>
	Not long ago I recall reading a story about the so-called Asian 
tigers of the South Pacific that have enjoyed spectacular growth 
because they have slashed tariffs more quickly than their 
competing nations. That demonstrates open competition is very 
good. We have seen growth rates in some of those areas of 10 per 
cent per year.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	We in Canada have been too cautious in this regard and too 
concerned about protecting industries and companies that do not 
really deserve that protection. I would much rather see real 
competition in the marketplace rather than protectionism.
<P>
	Bill C-102 also increases the value of goods that travellers 
returning to Canada can bring back. Returning residents now have a 
$50 exemption after the absence of 24 hours, an increase of $30. 
The exemption for 48 hours goes to $200 from $100 and the seven 
day exemption increases from $300 to $500, all good moves I 
think.
<P>
	These changes bring Canadian travellers' exemptions into line 
with those of our major trading partners and eliminates some of the 
petty hassles we have heard addressed in the House earlier today 
that travellers face at our border. I would rather see customs 
officials concentrating on drug and gun smugglers and other types 
of smugglers than have them preoccupied with what amounts to a 
pair of Adidas runners.
<P>
	Another measure the bill streamlines is customs clearance 
procedures by treating goods imported by travellers as basket tariff 
items. My understanding is there is a proposal presently under 
consideration to  replace the thousands of existing customs 
categories to just 12. That would be welcome as well.
<P>
	When these changes are implemented at a later date they should 
speed up our collection of duties by more than 50 per cent. The 
time savings will allow Revenue Canada to focus on processing 
commercial imports and spend more time for enforcing the laws 
against smuggling.
<P>
	The final major change the bill brings about is streamlining and 
consolidating the duty deferral programs, making them more 
accessible to the manufacturing community. Canada has three 
programs which defer or relieve duties on goods for export or 
goods awaiting formal entry into Canada. These are duty drawback, 
inward processing and bonded warehouse programs. By 
eliminating certain administration restrictions that currently exist 
these programs will be now more accessible to small and medium 
size companies.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade is currently studying ways to make small and medium size 
companies more able to take advantage of trade pacts we have 
introduced in the House such as NAFTA and the GATT agreement. 
Anything we can do to relieve the pressure they have in doing 
business in this country is welcome.
<P>
	Because these free trade zones will now be set up and funded 
under the auspices of local government rather than the federal, 
cities and other regions will have greater incentives to set up these 
free trade zones. I believe more natural trade corridors will develop 
as a result of this.
<P>
	Such a free trade zone was set up at the Vancouver airport in 
March 1994. More recently a similar free trade zone was 
established at an Edmonton airport. I believe Atlantic Canada is a 
natural one that should take advantage of this as well.
<P>
	These free trade zones allow businesses to bring in goods from 
abroad without paying the federal GST, provincial sales tax or 
import duties until the goods actually leave the free trade zones. 
Companies are free to repackage, test or make value added 
modifications to these imported goods. No taxes or duties are 
payable until the goods are shipped off again. The companies get to 
use their working capital for a longer period of time and save a lot 
of unnecessary paperwork.
<P>
	Here is another example of how the government can stimulate by 
getting out of the way; free the hands of business, cut the 
bureaucracy, the red tape, and watch this great country get back on 
track. It is something we certainly need.
<P>

	We support all of these measures and we welcome additional 
measures to make further cuts in tariffs even if we do it unilaterally.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to have an opportunity to say a few words regarding Bill C-102.
<P>
	At a time when too many Canadians are out of work, too many 
Canadians are underemployed and too many Canadians who are 
employed find it a struggle to make ends meet as a result of low 
paying jobs and so on, in the service sector particularly, Bill C-102 
is a step which will facilitate expansion in the manufacturing 
sector. It will have a direct bearing on an increase in future jobs. In 
that sense we see there is an upside to this legislation which will be 
helpful to people from coast to coast.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	I was pleased to find that Bill C-102 enables customs officers to 
spend more time with clients. This is much needed. A constituent 
of mine, Tony Walters, was visiting in the American southwest not 
long ago and when he came across the border into Canada he 
indicated to the customs officer he had bought himself a pair of 
riding boots made of armadillo skin. The customs officer said he 
would have to keep the boots and examine them. My friend asked if 
there were any problems. The officer said he did not think so but 
that he had to confiscate the boots, which he did.
<P>
	Nothing happened. My friend some weeks later inquired and the 
officer said: ``We notice there are armadillo skins on these boots 
and we think they might be an endangered species in the future''. 
My friend said: ``Fair enough, but at the moment they are not an 
endangered species and there is no reason I cannot collect my 
riding boots''. He said: ``You will have to wait and check with the 
minister''.
<P>
	I checked with the Minister of National Revenue, who is 
responsible for customs, and told him of the plight of my 
constituent. The minister said he would look into it but 
unfortunately that is the last I have heard of it.
<P>
	I did receive a call from my constituent who informed me he had 
received a letter from Canada Customs saying it had burned the 
boots. My friend was not pleased. He felt they were legitimate 
riding boots, a legitimate import. They cost him a couple of 
hundred dollars and they had been burned by Canada Customs. He 
felt he was due some compensation. It seemed to me he was right in 
that assumption. Perhaps the Minister of National Revenue is out 
there listening and will once again address this matter. As I said, 
unfortunately I did not hear anything back from him once I brought 
it to his attention.
<P>
	Bill C-102 moves us in an encouraging direction by eliminating 
more than 1,500 manufacturing input tariffs. It will be good for the 
expansion sector. However, what has driven this bill is the NAFTA. 
This will bring our tariff schedules in line with American 
manufacturers in an effort to obtain a more harmonious or level 
playing field in the manufacturing sector between Canada and  the 
United States. We have had the NAFTA debate and it is over.
<P>
	I will register a concern which I, my party and increasing 
numbers of Canadians have. I do not want to say anything against 
our American friends but is it wise for an exporting country to put 
so many of its eggs in one trade basket, to link itself so 
inextricably, intensely and extensively with one country?
<P>
	I think we can all acknowledge that now for all intents and 
purposes economically speaking we are the equivalent of an 
additional U.S. state or territory. Our economy and the economy of 
the United States is inextricably connected. That makes us very 
vulnerable to economic occurrences in the United States. If its 
economy starts to falter the ramifications will ripple through our 
economy within minutes.
<P>
	I know many members of the House are enthusiastic supporters 
of the NAFTA and what that means and that we are now nothing 
more than an economic extension of the United States.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	In our long term best interest as a country is it to our economic 
advantage to put all of these trade eggs in one basket? Will our 
children and grandchildren benefit from this initiative? I do not 
think so and I raise that as an extension of the debate on Bill C-102.
<P>
	On balance we support this legislation. I particularly like the 
idea that the duty exemptions for travellers have been increased. As 
I recall, the last increase was in the early eighties. Now travellers 
will be able to bring in goods duty free to reflect these changing 
times. I still think they are too small. However, it is a step in the 
right direction.
<P>
	My friend from Calgary Centre raised the point that one of the 
motives behind this legislation is to bring our tax regime in Canada 
more closely in line with that of the United States. He expanded to 
say it would not only be in terms of tariffs and so on but also our 
corporate and individual taxation systems.
<P>
	He mentioned theirs was somewhat lower than ours in Canada. I 
noticed the Minister of Health is here. One reason our tax system is 
somewhat higher than in the United States is a reflection of some of 
the benefits we obtain because of our tax system.
<P>
	I had the good fortune two years ago to spend time on a formal 
visit to the United States. Part of that visit included a visit with an 
American family every evening to talk about life as it saw it and to 
provide an opportunity for it to meet a Canadian to hear about what 
life in Canada is all about.
<P>
	One of the questions I asked every evening for 28 days in 
succession concerned what that family paid for health care, what 
the cost for that family was. In every case the cost of health care, 
not to the same extent we have in  Canada but at least close to it, 
varied between $5,000 and $7,000 per family. That is what it cost 
them out of their pockets each year. That was a system through 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14737"> 14737 </A></B>
<P>
which all sorts of medical services were deductible. If someone had 
their tonsils out they might have to pay a $500 deductible.
<P>
	While we discuss taxation-goodness knows we are doing it 
today and I suspect we will be doing it for many weeks beyond 
this-as we work to compare the tax regimes of the United States 
and Canada we should always keep in mind the relative benefits 
citizens in each country receive as a result of those tax regimes.

	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-90, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act and the 
Excise Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to 
speak at second reading of Bill C-90. This is an important bill in 
that it will give legislative effect to excise tax changes announced 
earlier this year, including measures that were contained in the 
budget of February 27, 1995.
<P>
	The key budget measures in this legislation are: first, changes to 
the air transportation tax that will recover a greater proportion of 
the cost of providing air transportation services and facilities.
<P>
	Second, an increase in the rate of excise tax on gasoline equal to 
1.5 cents per litre that will assist the government in meeting its 
deficit reduction targets.
<P>
	Third, amendments to the marking requirements for tobacco 
products for sale in Prince Edward Island that will phase out the 
sale of black stock or unmarked tobacco products and allow for the 
sale of Nova Scotia marked tobacco products.
<P>
	Last, changes to the seizure and notification provisions in 
respect of offences under the Excise Act that will improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of enforcement activities.
<P>
	The bill also contains important changes in respect of excise tax 
rates for tobacco products for sale in Quebec, Ontario and Prince 
Edward Island. The amendments contained in the bill will give 
legislative effect to a modest federal excise tax increases that were 
announced earlier this year in conjunction with provincial tobacco 
tax increases in these three provinces.
<P>
	These tax increases follow the success to date of the national 
action plan to combat smuggling in significantly  reducing 
contraband tobacco activity and restoring the domestic tobacco 
market to legitimate Canadian wholesalers and retailers.
<P>
	Let me begin by addressing the key budget features that are 
implemented by Bill C-90, the air transportation tax. As part of the 
government's efforts to meet its deficit reduction targets the budget 
of February 27, 1995 proposed changes to the air transportation tax 
that will recover a greater proportion of the cost of providing air 
transportation services and facilities.
<P>
	In accordance with this proposal the bill contains amendments to 
the Excise Tax Act that will increase the maximum air 
transportation tax on higher priced domestic and transborder air 
travel and the tax on international air travel purchased in Canada 
from $50 to $55.
<P>
	In addition, the maximum tax on transborder air travel subject to 
the United States' 10 per cent air transportation tax and the tax on 
international air travel purchased outside Canada will increase 
from $25 to $27.50. These new rates will apply to air travel 
purchased on or after May 1, 1995. Where air travel is purchased 
outside Canada and the tax is not prepaid, the new rates will apply 
to air travel which includes an international departure from Canada 
on or after May 1.
<P>
	These changes to the air transportation tax will generate 
additional revenues of $27 million in the 1995-96 fiscal year and 
$33 million in the 1996-97 fiscal year.
<P>
	Also as part of the government's efforts to meet its deficit 
reduction targets, the budget of February 17, 1995 proposed to 
increase the rate of excise tax on leaded and unleaded gasoline and 
aviation gasoline by 1.5 cents per litre.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	To give legislative effect to the proposals Bill C-90 contains 
amendments to the Excise Tax Act that will increase the excise tax 
on leaded gas and aviation gasoline from 9.5 cents per litre to 11.0 
cents per litre and the excise tax on unleaded gasoline and aviation 
gasoline from 8.5 cents to 10 cents per litre.
<P>
	These changes apply to sales of gasoline and aviation gasoline 
after February 27, 1995 and will raise an additional $500 million 
per fiscal year. At the same time I would like to note that the 
federal excise tax on diesel fuel will not be increased.
<P>
	The budget of February 27, 1995 also announced the 
government's intention to phase out the sale of black stock or 
unmarked tobacco products and authorize the sale of Nova Scotia 
marked tobacco products in Prince Edward Island. These changes 
are being 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14738"> 14738 </A></B>
<P>
undertaken at the request of and pursuant to an agreement between 
the governments of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island  
concerning the use of Nova Scotia marked tobacco products.
<P>
	In order to give effect to this agreement Bill C-90 contains a 
series of technical amendments to the taxation, offence and rebate 
provisions of the Excise Tax Act. These amendments will 
effectively phase out the sale of black stock tobacco products and 
authorize the sale of Nova Scotia marked tobacco products in 
Prince Edward Island at the reduced rate of federal excise taxes that 
are applicable in Prince Edward Island. These changes will be 
effective on royal assent to the bill.
<P>
	The final budget related measure contained in this bill involves 
changes to the seizure and notification provisions of the Excise 
Act. The Excise Act currently provides that officers must seize any 
vehicle used to transport alcohol and tobacco in contravention of 
the Excise Act even where relatively minor amounts of contraband 
are discovered. In the past this provision has created enforcement 
difficulties by forcing officers to seize vehicles in situations where 
seizure is neither a practical nor an appropriate remedy. To rectify 
the situation this bill amends the Excise Act to provide officers 
with the discretion to use the power to seize vehicles that are used 
to transport contraband alcohol and tobacco.
<P>
	The Excise Act will also be amended to require that where 
officers have evidence that a person other than the person from 
whom the vehicle is seized has an ownership or similar interest in a 
vehicle, the officers shall take reasonable efforts to ensure that 
notification of seizure is sent to the last known address of that 
person.
<P>
	Both of these measures will operate to improve the efficiency 
and effectiveness of enforcement activity.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-90 contains important changes to the excise tax 
rates for tobacco products for sale in Quebec, Ontario and Prince 
Edward Island. As my hon. colleagues are aware, the national 
action plan to combat smuggling was announced by the Prime 
Minister on February 8, 1994. The combination of initiatives 
launched under this plan, including increased enforcement 
resources, tobacco tax changes and the special surtax on tobacco 
manufacturers has proven effective in significantly reducing 
contraband tobacco activity and restoring the domestic tobacco 
market to legitimate wholesalers and retailers.
<P>
	As a result of these efforts, the government has been able to take 
important first steps toward the long term restoration of uniform 
federal excise tax rates for tobacco products across Canada.
<P>
	In Quebec and Ontario federal excise tax rates are being 
increased by 60 cents per carton of 200 cigarettes, while in Prince 
Edward Island excise taxes are being increased by $1 per carton of 
200 cigarettes and 32 cents per 200 tobacco sticks.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	It is important to note that these federal excise tax increases are 
being undertaken in conjunction with provincial tobacco tax 
increases in the three provinces. These joint federal-provincial tax 
increases follow the scheme of matching tax reductions announced 
under the national action plan and reinforce the importance of 
co-ordinated, federal-provincial action to deal effectively with 
contraband activity.
<P>
	The excise tax increases in respect of cigarettes for sale in 
Quebec and Ontario are effective February 18, 1995 while the 
increases in respect of tobacco sticks and cigarettes for sale in 
Prince Edward Island are effective April 1, 1995. These changes 
will generate an additional $65 million in federal revenues on a 
fiscal year basis.
<P>
	In conclusion, and as members can tell from the outline of this 
speech, Bill C-90 is an important bill. This bill enacts a number of 
key revenue raising measures contained in the budget of February 
27, 1995.
<P>
	While I would note that the budget delivered on that date 
emphasizes reductions in spending by a margin of seven to one 
over tax increases, the measures contained in this bill relating to 
the air transportation tax and the excise tax on gasoline are key 
components of the government's commitment to both increased 
cost recovery and meeting its deficit reduction targets.
<P>
	Other measures, such as the amendments to the seizure and 
notification provisions of the Excise Act will improve the delivery 
of enforcement activity, while changes to the tobacco marking 
scheme for Prince Edward Island will allow for greater efficiency 
in serving the Prince Edward Island market.
<P>
	Finally, the changes to the excise tax rate for tobacco products 
for sale in Quebec, Ontario and Prince Edward Island emphasizes 
the success to date of a national action plan to combat smuggling 
and to raise important, additional revenue for the government.
<P>
	As a result, I would urge my colleagues to give speedy passage 
to this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
our third bill this afternoon. We shall continue, but our differences 
are now going to surface. We could agree on the first two bills, but 
we can only go so far. When we get to the excise tax on gasoline, 
our views will no longer coincide.
<P>
	Bill C-90 contains a number of acceptable measures to which we 
have no objection. For instance, bringing the price of cigarettes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14739"> 14739 </A></B>
<P>
back to levels that are less an incentive to consumption. Provided 
this does not resurrect the smuggling network and does not give 
them that opportunity, I think it is satisfactory. Everyone expected 
this, if we want to keep fighting cigarette smuggling from the point 
of view of law enforcement and avoid  encouraging people to buy 
this product, on health grounds.
<P>
	Of course we have some questions, because there are a number 
of problems we will have to deal with in connection with 
anti-smoking campaigns. We need a plan with a very clear-cut 
purpose to ensure this campaign does not encourage smoking, 
especially among the young and young women, where smoking is 
very widespread. We will have to find ways to restrict tobacco 
consumption.
<P>
	I will be very brief about this aspect. I agree that reducing the 
excise tax probably helped to destabilize smuggling rings, but there 
was not much in the way of law enforcement. Smuggling still exists 
because we have not dealt with the real problem. We may have the 
same problem with other products. It could happen whenever the 
tax on the product is unreasonably high. That is one reason we have 
to be careful in the case of gasoline, because there is a limit to what 
the public will tolerate.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	When we consider the price of gas, when we break down the 
price at the pump, fortunately people do not see the real price, 
because taxpayers would be rather upset. The price includes a lot of 
different taxes. So many that we may have gone too far, 
especially-and this was said by the Canadian Automobile 
Association-since there is no guarantee that this money is 
invested in highway maintenance or used to compensate for 
environmental damage. It all goes into the consolidated fund, and 
there is no way to find out how this revenue is used.
<P>
	In fact, they were in favour of creating a fund to ensure that 
gasoline taxes are used to compensate for the impact on the 
environment or reinvested in road maintenance. They did not talk 
much about an environmental fund, but if this initiative ever went 
ahead, one option would be to bypass the consolidated revenue 
fund and put part of this tax revenue into environmental funds.
<P>
	There are other measures, including an air transportation tax, 
which would increase the maximum tax on international air travel 
from $50 to $55. This is no big deal, but when we consider taxation 
in general, after two years in the House, after everything that has 
been said and heard and discussed on the subject, the tax on gas 
was discussed in the last budget and this was basically a fiscal 
measure to quickly raise $500 million.
<P>
	The purpose of this tax was to raise revenue fast. The air 
transportation tax was affected as well, and once again, it was 
changed at the expense of people in the regions, because they 
reduced the tax on short haul flights but the tax on longer flights 
was increased, in the case of domestic flights, which means that 
people in Baie-Comeau, Val-d'Or or Rouyn, in my region, are now  
faced with a tax increase of several dollars. It is not much, but the 
price of plane tickets was already very high.
<P>
	But the major tax initiative, the campaign promise, was not to 
increase gasoline taxes, but to change the tax on goods and 
services. That was the campaign promise. The subject was raised in 
the House and studied in committee. The committee gave a report, 
which, if memory serves me, lasted 17 or 18 hours. The next day in 
the House, the Prime Minister distanced himself from the report, 
because the committee-and when I refer to the committee, I am 
excluding myself and the Bloc Quebecois-proposed a tax, a sort 
of hybrid tax on business activities mixed in with the GST, in other 
words, a very short lived and now shelved proposal.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's promise was that two years after the 
Liberals arrived in power, let us give them two and a half years-so 
we will say January 1, 1996-the GST would disappear. Both 
during the election campaign and in the House, I have heard the 
Prime Minister say: ``We hate this tax and we are going to 
eliminate it''. Now, whether he hates it less or whether he is not 
going to eliminate it, the Prime Minister is no longer saying that he 
will eliminate the GST.
<P>
	Is the magic gone? What happened? There is no more mention of 
it at all, just as with every hot item here in Ottawa. The government 
gives the illusion of working on real things, but the legislative 
agenda is sparse. They are all more or less contentious matters, 
which have already been announced, whereas we are still waiting 
for measures on pension reform and on unemployment insurance 
reform.
<P>
	What of the new human resource investment fund that is to be set 
up by the Minister of Human Resources Development, which is 
very important and will involve the reform or dismantling of the 
network of employment centres? Everyone is waiting to see it to 
get an idea where the federal government is going, but only a 
minimum of information is being provided, because of the political 
context in Quebec, and the federal government does not want to tell 
us clearly what is happening.
<P>
	It is a bit unfortunate, particularly on the part of people like the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who is taking pleasure in 
saying that the Government of Quebec is hiding things or studies. 
Well, here they are keeping what will happen after the referendum 
really under wraps. The people do not know what is going on. They 
have a hard choice to make, and I understand them, but when they 
look at the No side, they see nothing. They do not know what will 
happen to them. It will be a matter of trust. Are they going to trust 
the people who represent this camp, the present Prime Minister? If 
I were he, I would be worried. I am not sure people are going to 
give him a blank cheque to do what he likes afterward.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14740"> 14740 </A></B>
<P>
	We are entitled to expect to know what initiatives the 
government plans to take. It remains silent, however. About the 
GST, though, I would like to remind them, because the opportunity 
is too good to miss, that they made promises to the people. In the 
finance committee, we heard just about anything. That tax is a bad 
one, everyone agrees on that, on a number of things.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The underlying principles are not all bad in it, but some 
government members were saying that the black market economy 
was due in large part to the GST. There are limits. Let us not 
exaggerate. The figures bandied about were surprising. The 
government was said to be losing billions of dollars in revenue just 
because people did not accept the GST. There is some truth in that, 
but not in the proportions they were talking about in the elections 
or before the committee.
<P>
	Nevertheless, this was their opinion. They have all become silent 
about the GST. Apparently there was some discussion about it in 
caucus before Parliament resumed. There has been some 
discussion but not much in public, and in the long run the hope is 
that people will forget.
<P>
	Implementing a reformed tax is not easy. The main criticism of 
the GST by business was the short time between when the decisions 
were made, when the tax was defined, and when it was 
implemented. Since it was all done very rapidly there was a great 
deal of confusion. This has moreover never been settled completely 
because there are still close to a billion dollars in unsettled 
accounts or unrecovered taxes, in large part the result of the initial 
difficulties many people experienced in understanding the tax.
<P>
	If they want to reform this tax before the end of their mandate, 
there is not much time left for defining the rules. It is surprising 
that we are not hearing about it any more. These are people who are 
asking Quebecers to write them a blank cheque and trust them at 
their word. And yet, during the election campaing, they promised 
to do away with this tax and replace it with something else. Since 
that something else has not been defined yet, the first part is 
irrelevant. Nobody is currently looking for something else. Once in 
a while, the finance minister uses fancy words to tell us that he is 
holding discussions with his provincial counterparts, but are all 
these discussions leading somewhere? Where is this getting us?
<P>
	We know full well that they were hoping for a Liberal 
government in Ontario, which would have been more inclined to 
cooperate; as we know the main stumbling block to revamping this 
tax is the fact that Ontario still taxes inputs used in the manufacture 
of other goods. For instance, a piece of wood used to manufacture a 
piece of furniture becomes an input when processed.
<P>
	In Ontario, a number of inputs are taxed, apparently to the tune 
of a few billions of dollars. If both taxes were harmonized, Ontario 
would stand to lose substantial revenues.
<P>
	As a result, far from being simple, the tax system is relatively 
complex. Quebec went ahead with harmonization but this reveals 
once again one of the fundamental problems of the current political 
system in Canada, which is the result of the federal government's 
spending power allowing it to spend in any area it chooses; but to 
do this it must collect money.
<P>
	Since all governments, either provincial or federal, collect 
money the same way, through income tax and other taxes, the 
stakeholders are numerous. More particularly in Quebec, because 
in Quebec we never really had any confidence in receiving money 
indirectly through transfer payments. If we look at what is going on 
now, perhaps we did the right thing; it is still far better to get tax 
points than transfer payments, because sooner or later the 
government could very easily be tempted to cut them.
<P>
	That has really complicated the system for people. For 
businesses as well. I am often asked by business people in my 
province what the concrete advantages for us would be if Quebec 
were to decide to take control of its own destiny and be fully 
autonomous, while maintaining relations with our trade partners? 
When we talk with them, they soon realize that there are very 
concrete, immediate advantages for them, and I am happy to 
underline that to my Reform colleague. Indeed, there will be only 
one taxation system.
<P>
	For them, that means a lot less paperwork, a lot less trouble, and 
it is a lot easier to understand. It is the same for individuals. One 
need only think of the spring, when the deadline for income tax 
returns is near; we get out our receipts, our employment 
statements, our unemployment insurance statements or other 
papers, and have a look at them to fill our income tax returns. It is 
extremely complicated.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Not much effort is put in making things simpler. Eliminating one 
level of government will already be an improvement in that area. 
For starters, this natural tendency towards duplication, with two 
levels of government collecting money they are free to spend as 
they please, will no longer be an issue.
<P>
	This is one of the major problems with this political system in 
which a $500 billion debt was accumulated without any concrete 
steps being taken to restructure the federal government's spending 
power, this power to spend that eventually turned into the power to 
get into debt. What was achieved by this in concrete terms? With 
respect to employment, it did not even succeed in preventing 
unemployment and joblessness from reaching unacceptable levels.

	There is one lesson to draw from the current situation and that is 
that we just cannot keep our heads buried in the sand all the time 
and claim on the basis of any odd statistical report that we are 
living in the best country in the world. It is not true that we have to 
hide behind this kind of thing.
<P>
	I went to a school of administration where we studied cases, 
problem cases, and ways of resolving them. The first step in a good 
diagnostic, and the same applies to our personal circumstances, it is 
always the case, is to admit a problem exists. When I see people 
who refuse to admit there is a problem, even when it is staring us in 
the face, then the problem is compounded. I think that the people 
should not feel reassured, even though they have been told that in 
future administrative agreements will be negotiated or other ways 
will be found to improve the system. Unless we change the basic 
rules, we will always have problems.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that we in Canada have trivialized such an 
important word as ``constitution''. A constitution sets out the rules 
of the game. Before sitting down to play a parlour game, people 
should first agree on the rules. If, in the middle of the game, they 
start to disagree on how the rules should be interpreted, they will 
have problems. That is what is happening with our Canadian 
constitution.  We cannot agree on the rules of the game but we are 
not redefining them. This creates a lot of problems. We have tried 
to change the rules over the years but all our efforts have met with 
failure.
<P>
	A country that is afraid to discuss its constitution is a sick 
country. A country whose prime minister refuses to use the word 
Constitution because he is not very proud of it is a country with a 
lot of problems. And this is what we see in Canada, at present. They 
say: We do not want to talk about it. They are ashamed. They are 
ashamed because there are past events they would rather not refer 
to.
<P>
	Having said that, I would like to come back to the bill before the 
House and state that we cannot support the tax on gasoline, which 
raised the price per litre by 1.5 cents following the last budget. 
Since these taxes are often not visible, we tend to forget about 
them. After a couple of days, we forget about them, but I now have 
the opportunity to remind all those who are listening that they 
should not forget the 1.5 cent increase per litre they have been 
paying these last few months, because of the federal government 
and the measures undertaken in the last budget to generate $500 
million.
<P>
	Taxpayers are willing to let the government raise more taxes if it 
keeps a better control over its spending, but it is frustrating to give 
more and more money to the government and feel there is no real 
improvement in our debt situation.
<P>
	It is all very fine to say that the Minister of Finance is likely to 
meet his deficit target of about $32 billion this year, but that still 
leaves us with a $32 billion deficit.
<P>
	With our economic situation and the likelihood of a slowdown in 
the United States-maybe not later this year, but next year-that 
could affect Canada too, there is no guarantee we will still be on 
track with our public finances. The Conservatives had reduced the 
deficit to an acceptable level, but when the recession came about, it 
went out of control. It is a bit like trying to cram something into a 
box. When the box is too full, it just bursts open.
<P>
	I think the same thing is happening now. Every time the box 
bursts open, it becomes harder and harder to pick up the pieces. The 
deficit has now reached a level that is extremely high.
<P>
	We are certainly not willing to support measures aimed at 
increasing government revenues when there is still so much to do 
in terms of reducing government spending.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to remind the government of its 
commitments, one of which was to review the GST. We thought 
that it was too little, that the whole tax system needed to be looked 
at. We offered our help but the government refused. We did a 
detailed study of the GST in committee. Recommendations were 
made but the government never followed up on those 
recommendations, particularly those of the Bloc Quebecois, which 
were the best among those contained in the report. The day after the 
report was tabled, the Prime Minister himself rejected a 
recommendation made by the Liberal majority.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	So they have commitments. They say they are people of their 
word and look after the real problems and are concerned about 
them. During the election campaign they said they were going to 
change the tax. We are still awaiting outcome and are eager to see 
what happens.
<P>
	The Minister of Health, who was on the finance committee 
herself at the time, must really know what is happening with this 
tax. They must have been studying it when it was introduced. The 
time has come for them to act and to stop hiding behind all the 
illusions they are giving the public about getting down to the real 
problems. Because in reality, nothing much happens in this House, 
except for the legislative agenda, which drags on and must be 
adopted. The real issues have to be put on the table so we can see 
what they are really going to offer the people. We will be able to do 
much more enlightened things.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I 
begin my speech on Bill C-90, I will comment on the speech from 
the member for Témiscamingue about broken promises. I agree the 
government promised to get rid of the GST but it will not get rid of 
it. The Deputy Prime Minister promised to resign if the govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14742"> 14742 </A></B>
<P>
ment did  not get rid of the GST and she is still here and will not 
resign. This is another example of two broken promises.
<P>
	Bill C-90 is a tax bill, pure and simple, and a huge tax grab that 
serves only to hurt the economy. The Liberals have been big on 
their flowery rhetoric of no tax increases. On a personal basis they 
did keep that promise. However, Bill C-90 hits Canadians in their 
pocketbooks both at the pumps and in the air.
<P>
	Our main contention or disagreement with the bill is it 
implements the 1.5 cent per litre gasoline tax discussed in the 1995 
budget. This revenue raising measure, a tax hike, will raise $500 
million. As Reformers we vehemently oppose this measure.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Lethbridge, will rise this 
afternoon as well and talk more about the effects of gas taxes, and 
so I will leave this important subject for him.
<P>
	Other aspects of the bill include an increase in the air 
transportation tax from $50 to $55 for domestic and transborder 
flights purchased in Canada, and from $25 to $27.50 for 
transborder flights purchased outside Canada. The tax on airlines is 
based on the amount of time people spend in the air. It is designed 
to recover government costs for things like air traffic controllers, 
maintenance, et cetera.
<P>
	This is the second time in as many budgets the finance minister 
and the Liberals have increased the airline transfer tax; $40 on 
domestic flights when they took office and $55 now, a $15 
increase. This tax hike, revenue raising measure, will raise $27 
million to $33 million for government spending.
<P>
	Bill C-90 increases the excise tax rates on tobacco products for 
sale in Quebec and Ontario by 60 cents per carton and on tobacco 
products for sale in Prince Edward Island by $1 per carton. 
Originally in Bill C-11 the Liberals thought the best way to battle 
the underground economy was through reductions in incentives to 
smuggle because of the high rate of taxation; that is, take the profit 
out of smuggling. I agreed with that position and it was a good 
thing to do. It worked on cigarettes, so why not do the same for 
liquor which is now also causing a big problem at the borders and is 
offering opportunities for smugglers to make extra money and not 
pay their share of the taxes?
<P>
	They killed the taxes on smokes in Ontario and Quebec and now 
those taxes are creeping up again. This revenue raising measure, 
this tax hike, will generate $65 million for government spending.
<P>
	I question how the government spends our money. Every one of 
these three measures increase taxes when the finance minister 
presented his budget, pretending all along he was not raising taxes. 
What we need is tax decreases, lower taxes so people can create 
long term meaningful jobs. If people have more disposable income 
in their hands and in their pockets and businesses had more 
disposable income they could stimulate the  economy. The 
government is blind as to what to do in terms of an economic 
philosophy which has long term meaningful benefits for the 
country.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	We have just come back from Atlantic Canada. It does not want 
any part of ACOA. It told us that. ACOA subsidizes and helps high 
risk businesses. High risk businesses have a tendency to have a 
high failure rate. Those people concluded early on that therefore 
the government is subsidizing failure and they do not want that. 
They want the government to not spend that money and to lower 
their taxes instead, leave the money in their pocket and they will 
look after themselves very well, thank you very much. That is in 
P.E.I., in Nova Scotia and in New Brunswick and Newfoundland. 
Those provincial governments, Newfoundland and New 
Brunswick, are cutting with real cuts, unlike this government.
<P>
	Government red tape, involvement and intrusion are all driving 
up costs and driving investment out of the country. The government 
may laugh and think it has have the perfect plan but sadly and faster 
than we realize capital is leaving the country. The global market 
has shrunk the opportunities to having it as quick as pushing a 
button on a computer. We can move products, goods, services and 
the dollar signs simply go from one account to another and Canada 
is not participating. Canada is blind with its cumbersome, 
complicated, convoluted Income Tax Act and we are missing 
opportunities.
<P>
	We need lower taxes and a new tax system, a flat tax with high 
and good personal exemptions and no double taxation. It is funny 
that when we deal with other countries such as the United States on 
NAFTA we send trade representatives with to meet its trade 
representatives. We negotiate agreements with them. What do we 
do? We eliminate double taxation. We lower tariffs. We look at 
ways of stimulating more competition. We look at ways of helping 
business. When the government comes back to Canada to its own 
people and businesses it raises taxes and keeps double taxation. 
That is hypocritical. Why does it not have its trade representatives 
negotiate with the finance minister and get it changed?
<P>
	What we need is a simplified taxation system that reduces 
compliance costs and makes everybody more willing to participate 
and able to participate in stimulating the economy.
<P>
	Bill C-90 amends seizure and notification provisions of the 
Excise Tax Act to provide enforcement officers with greater 
discretion. Previously customs officers had to seize vehicles if 
contraband tobacco was discovered. This bill will allow them some 
discretion. However, I do not know if this discretion is the answer 
for some of these officers in light of a couple of stories about senior 
citizens from the States travelling to Canada and being treated like 
terrorists for a bottle of pepper spray used to  fight off attackers. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14743"> 14743 </A></B>
<P>
Another couple was recently forced to pay $18 of tax on $12 worth 
of wine and beer.
<P>
	Bill C-90 is a disgrace for the Liberals. They claim they are not 
raising taxes. They try to use smoke and mirrors but the finance 
minister's rhetoric is not fooling anybody. Canadians know how 
this hurts them. Canadians see it every day. They will not forget at 
the next election.
<P>
	The Reform Party is opposed and will always stand opposed to 
tax increases and we are against Bill C-90.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure in one sense to speak to Bill C-90 but in another sense not 
at all because what we are talking about is the Liberals following 
tradition, just as the Conservatives did in the 10 years they were in 
government, of increasing taxes. That is all we hear and they are 
following the traditional pattern of new taxes for Canadians.
<P>
	Here we are after the fact. The taxes have already been 
implemented and we in the House are asked to stand up and pass a 
law which puts legislative effect to that action of the government. 
That is wrong in principle. I cannot believe how the government is 
able to do that. I know there is precedent for it in this assembly. We 
witnessed this in the spring session, last fall and the spring before. 
The government brought legislation forward to legislate some tax 
act or some act that was already happening in the general public 
without a legislative authority. In principle that is absolutely 
wrong. That is one of the first reasons I am saying no to Bill C-90.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	There is another reason. We are witnessing government in the 
pockets of Canadians, government at the table of Canadians and 
government in the gas tanks of Canadians. The government is a 
partner and wants to be an ever increasing and intervening partner 
in the private finances of individual Canadians.
<P>
	Look at tax freedom day. It is sometime in July before Canadians 
are free from taxes. They have finally paid their taxes to the 
government in July of each year. Canadians are working half of the 
year to pay their taxes to the government. That is wrong. It is 
suppressive and it is not good for Canada. That is why the Reform 
Party has said over and over we must reduce the tax load on 
Canadians. To do that we must first reduce the deficit. That will 
lead to a balanced budget and responsible spending. That is what 
must happen.
<P>
	We talk about the government at the table. During our recent 
visit to the maritimes we heard all kinds of presentations from 
people in the maritimes and Newfoundland who told us the 
representation in that part of Canada is inadequate. There are major 
problems not being dealt with. They are suppressed by taxes. They 
were not listened to in terms of gun legislation, in terms of health 
care, in terms of tougher criminal laws, and the list goes on. The 
inshore fishermen, the mid-shore fishermen  and the hand liners all 
said they tried to tell the government what it should do but it does 
not listen.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It would seem the hon. 
member for Lethbridge has as many supporters for his view on his 
side as there are dissenters on the other side. I am caught in the 
middle and I am having great difficulty hearing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians want to 
hear what we say in the House of Commons and they certainly want 
to judge the points of view the various parties have with respect to a 
variety of issues.
<P>
	During my visit to the maritimes I had the pleasure of being in 
Digby County where we met many friends and people who were 
interested in the point of view of the Reform Party. My wife and I 
visited one of the restaurants. We had an excellent seafood dinner, 
at the end of which I was presented with the bill. I looked at the bill 
and I said to my wife: ``Do you realize you and I were not alone at 
this table? Do you realize there was a third party sitting here with 
us enjoying dinner? I am sure it was one of my good colleagues 
from the Liberal Party acting as a phantom''.
<P>
	When I looked at the bill there was GST at 7 per cent, there was 
PST at 8 per cent and then there was the 15 per cent tip. About 30 
per cent of the bill was this third partner sitting at the table, 
enjoying the food, but taking it back to Ottawa. Not only is the 
government in the pockets of Canadians, it sits at our table every 
day, taking things away from us.
<P>
	Now let us talk about the gas tax.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	Let us talk about the excise tax in this bill where government is 
in our gas tank. It is unbelievable the percentage of taxes that are 
now in a litre of gas or a gallon of gas, whichever way you want to 
describe it. The percentage of take is unbelievable. When we drive 
up to the pump the government says: ``You pay for your gas and we 
are taking this percentage of that revenue that was paid for the 
gas''. If we compare that to what the retailer gets, the percentage is 
very minimal for the retailer.
<P>
	After the new excise tax of 1.5 cents per litre of tax was put on, 
retailers said to me: ``We must take that out of our percentage. We 
cannot increase the price any more. The competition is very keen at 
the street level. We cannot increase price. So where does the 1.5 
cents come from? It comes out of our net profit''.
<P>
	Anyone who has been in the retail business relative to gasoline 
sales at the pump or has talked to retailers who sell gas from the 
pump knows the margin is very slim. Many of them say they sell 
the gas just to get the customer up to the door, that they do not 
make any money at it but have to make a gain on the other services.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14744"> 14744 </A></B>
<P>
	By this bill that is before us and by its act earlier in the spring in 
the announcement of the budget, the government only hurt small 
business across this nation.
<P>
	The chart that was sent out to all of us in this assembly states: 
Where does your gasoline dollar go? The source of this is the 
Government of Canada. It issued this statement on June 27, 1995. It 
shows gasoline prices right across Canada. For example, in 
Vancouver a litre of gas is 59.6 cents and the taxes out of that are 48 
per cent. The dealer gets about 5 per cent of it. In Calgary taxes are 
43 per cent, dealer 7 per cent; in Regina taxes 49 per cent, dealer 6 
per cent; in Winnipeg taxes 44 per cent, dealer 7 per cent; in 
Toronto taxes 52 per cent, dealer 5 per cent, which is even worse; in 
Whitehorse taxes 32 per cent, dealer 10 per cent, which is perhaps a 
little more reasonable and maybe that is the right place to live; in 
Saint John taxes 42 per cent, dealer 8 per cent; in Halifax taxes 48 
per cent, dealer 6 per cent; in Charlottetown taxes 44 per cent, 
dealer 9 per cent; in St. John's taxes 47 per cent, dealer 7 per cent; 
in Yellowknife taxes 34 per cent, dealer 13 per cent.
<P>
	The major portion of the gasoline price is excise taxes. We in this 
House think that there is a cow we can milk continually and 
increase that tax. I think we have milked it for everything we can. 
The 1.5 cents per litre is another nail in the coffin of many of the 
dealers across Canada and the retailer is suffering the consequences 
of this legislation.
<P>
	I could talk about the consumer or the person who needs gasoline 
to go to work, to carry out business in and across Canada. Those 
people are hurt in a very drastic way. I have heard it being said by 
the Bloc members, I have heard it from the Liberal members, I 
have heard it from my colleagues here as Reformers that if we are 
to improve the economy of Canada it will be the small 
businessman. The small businessman will do it for us.
<P>
	When we enact increases in excise tax of 1.5 cents per litre on 
gasoline it is obvious what that would do to small business across 
Canada. It only suppresses them. It does not allow them to have 
that capital to reinvest or to do other things. The government has 
made a move here that is contrary to the rhetoric I hear from the 
Minister of Finance who says the economy is going to grow, we are 
going to help small business and they are going to be the engine for 
our economy. I hear him saying all those things with the wave and 
the gusto of his arms. Here is a policy that cuts the cloth in a 
negative way.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	So how can we support this? We cannot. The Reform Party is 
against it. We are going to vote against Bill C-90.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to conclude on the government's behalf the 
section on Bill C-90.
<P>
	Bill C-90 is just the legalization or legitimization of items 
covered in the 1995 budget in the areas of air  transportation tax, 
excise tax on gasoline, and the marketing requirements for tobacco 
products sold in Prince Edward Island in order to sort the problems 
out there and to allow for sale the Nova Scotia marked tobacco 
products. As well, there is a seizure notification provision with 
respect to offences under the excise tax which will improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the enforcement activities.
<P>
	This is basically a housekeeping bill that follows up and has to 
be done to legitimize and formalize our budget process. It also 
contains important changes with respect to the excise tax rates for 
tobacco products for sale in Quebec, Ontario, and Prince Edward 
Island. The amendment contained in this bill will give legislative 
effect to the modest federal excise tax increases that were 
announced earlier this year in conjunction with the provincial 
tobacco tax increases.
<P>
	No one who sat through this modest tax increase likes it, but this 
kind of tax was a restructuring type tax. These taxes are necessary 
to sort out.
<P>
	The air transportation tax will increase the maximum air 
transportation tax on the higher domestic and transborder air travel 
in Canada from $50 to $55. This is not a significant amount, but it 
would assist in underwriting the loss leading operations we have in 
running our international airports and the airports in Canada.
<P>
	Gasoline taxes are needed to keep up the Trans-Canada Highway 
and other vital routes in the movement of goods and services in 
Canada.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say that the government taxes were 
modest in reference to the budget and were based on the need to 
service our airports and roads across Canada and to restructure 
some of the taxes in some of the provinces as well as the tobacco 
selling in Prince Edward Island.
<P>

question?

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.)</B> moved that Bill C-260, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
(replica firearms, theft, import or unlawful use of firearms) be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I have been involved with the gun control 
issue for almost three years, since the Reform Party asked me to 
chair a subcommittee on the issue in January 1992. Prior to that 
date I was blissfully unaware of the topic, since I was not 
personally affected by the legislation. Since then I have found it to 
be one subject that evokes a great deal of passion whenever it is 
debated. Much of the argument is dominated by those who take 
extreme positions on either side of the argument. That is probably 
why I was asked to chair the Reform Party subcommittee on the 
gun control issue.
<P>
	I do not now own nor have I ever owned a firearm. I do not hunt, 
target shoot or collect guns, nor would I allow one in my house. 
However, having spent 15 years living in northern Alberta, I 
recognize that for many  people, especially those living in rural 
Canada, a firearm is a necessary tool in their daily lives.
<P>
	With this background I set out with four colleagues to examine 
the question of gun control. I reviewed the legislation that is in 
place now. I received a number of briefs from organizations like the 
Gun Control Coalition and the National Firearms Association and 
countless groups in between. I spoke to Canadians from coast to 
coast to coast, pro and con. I learned very quickly there is little 
common ground and I admit that it is likely impossible to come up 
with a gun control bill that would satisfy everyone. The solution 
became a little more basic: to address the problems caused by 
firearms in our society.
<P>
	With very few exceptions, the central concern everyone has 
about firearms is their criminal use. People are concerned about the 
number of crimes that are committed with guns. They are 
frightened about the apparent increased willingness of criminals to 
use guns, and they are terrified to hear about random drive-by 
shootings like the one that killed Nicholas Battersby here in Ottawa 
last year.
<P>
	In other words, people wanted the government to enact 
legislation that would deter criminals from using firearms. In 
response to those concerns we heard the justice minister making 
statements last year that he believed only police officers and 
soldiers should have guns. One can imagine how legitimate gun 
owners felt when they heard comments like this from the new 
justice minister.
<P>
	It was apparent that alternative legislation needed to be drafted. I 
approached the police and crown counsel and asked them what 
legislation they needed to assist them in combating the illegal use 
of firearms. I listened to the current shortcomings of section 85 of 
the Criminal Code and heard how these weaknesses had led to 
charges under section 5 frequently plea bargained away. I felt that 
with improved legislation in section 85 we would be taking a giant 
step in deterring the criminal use of firearms. On June 15, 1994 I 
introduced Bill C-260. I want to remind the House that the 
government's Bill C-68 was introduced eight months later on 
February 14, 1995.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-260 addresses the weaknesses in section 85 and creates 
new offences for the theft and possession of stolen firearms, the 
illegal importation of firearms for criminal purposes and makes an 
individual who illegally sells a firearm that is subsequently used in 
criminal offence a party to that office.
<P>
	Under Bill C-260 anyone convicted of using a firearm in the 
commission of a criminal offence would receive a minimum 
five-year sentence consecutive to any sentence for the crime itself. 
For a second offence the penalty would increase to a minimum 
10-years consecutive.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14746"> 14746 </A></B>
<P>
	These minimum sentences would be a real deterrent for any 
criminal who chose to use a firearm. Not too many criminals would 
be prepared to risk that additional five-year minimum sentence.
<P>
	Similarly, the new subsections created by Bill C-260 would also 
have had a deterrent effect. Today a break and enter conviction 
usually nets an offender probation or at most, a sentence of up to 
six months. However, if during that break and enter the offender 
happens to steal a firearm, that criminal would suddenly be facing a 
minimum three-year prison sentence, an effective deterrent, as is 
the minimum three-year sentence for those illegally importing 
firearms for criminal purposes or illegal resale in Canada. The last 
subsection of the bill would make those individuals who provide 
the guns illegally to criminals responsible for their illegal acts. 
These individuals play an integral role in the commission of these 
crimes so they should be made a party to those crimes.
<P>
	Another issue that the bill addresses is the inclusion of replicas 
in section 85. One reason that section 85 charges seldom succeed is 
the existence of replica firearms. Currently the crown must prove 
that the weapon used in the commission of an offence meets the 
legal definition of a firearm. This is only possible in those instance 
where the accused is immediately arrested with the firearm still in 
his or her possession or if a shot is actually fired during the 
commission of the crime. If neither of those things happens, the 
crown cannot prove it is a firearm and therefore, no conviction 
under section 85.
<P>
	Bill C-260 just requires that the object used in the offence 
appears to be a firearm. The bank teller who has a firearm shoved 
in her face during a robbery is just as terrorized by a replica as she 
would be by a real firearm.
<P>
	That is the bill, a bill that addresses the problem of the criminal 
use of firearms, a bill that could be called gun control and crime 
control. It is not what the government wanted. It wants to control 
the firearms in the hands of law-abiding citizens so the government 
gave us Bill C-68.
<P>
	Only about 20 per cent of Bill C-68 deals with the criminal use 
of firearms, although the other 80 per cent of the bill will likely 
make criminals out of a lot of otherwise law-abiding firearm users.
<P>
	While the section of Bill C-68 that deals with increasing the 
penalties for the criminal use of firearms has been loudly touted by 
the government as a get tough policy, it will in reality become a 
paper tiger.
<P>
	In British Columbia today the average sentence for a criminal 
convicted of using a firearm during the course of a robbery is five 
years. Bill C-68 introduces a minimum sentence of four years. How 
is this going to deter anyone?
<P>
	In addition, Bill C-68 introduces a new section to deal with 
replica firearms. The only problem is that it is now up to the crown 
to prove that the object used in a crime  was either a firearm or a 
replica. In most cases it will be able to prove neither so the 
legislation will be used as infrequently as it is today.
<P>
	I have no difficulty in defending my Bill C-260 compared to the 
Liberal Bill C-68. I targeted the criminal who uses a firearm during 
the commission of an offence. The government targeted the 
legitimate gun owner. This is an example of the basic philosophical 
difference between Reformers and Liberals. We get tough on 
criminals. The government gets tough on ordinary Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will take a moment to 
consult with the Table.
<P>
	I wonder if I might ask for the assistance of my colleagues. In 
this debate the member would have been entitled to 20 minutes. I 
do not know if there was any indication given that she was splitting 
that time. Could she indicate to the Chair if she was?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I had not made any arrangements to 
split my time but several colleagues would like to speak on it in due 
course, given the rotation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Under those circumstances I 
will follow the rotation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on June 13, 1995 the House gave third reading to Bill C-68, an act 
respecting firearms and other weapons. Bill C-68 is comprehensive 
legislation concerning firearms which has been extensively 
researched and debated by members of the House and the House of 
Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. It is 
now being studied by the Senate Committee on Legal and 
Constitutional Affairs.
<P>
	Bill C-260, which was presented by my colleague from British 
Columbia, who previously spoke, is a bill which I believe is 
basically similar to Bill C-68. Bill C-260 was introduced before the 
Minister of Justice introduced Bill C-68 and the hon. member 
might have introduced a different bill had the provisions of Bill 
C-68 been known to her at the time.
<P>
	I want to examine the differences between the two bills. I would 
like to start with the issue of mandatory minimum sentences.
<P>
	Section 85 of the Criminal Code now provides for a minimum 
term of one-year imprisonment for the use of a firearm in the 
commission of an indictable offence and three years for any 
subsequent offence, in addition to the sentence imposed for the 
underlying offence. The maximum is 14 years.
<P>
	Concerns have been expressed with respect to the way section 85 
has been operating because of the large number of charges which 
have resulted in acquittal or in  the charges being withdrawn. 
Sometimes section 85 charges are withdrawn as a plea bargaining 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14747"> 14747 </A></B>
<P>
mechanism. Bill C-68 will address the problems relating to section 
85 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Specifically, the bill states expressly under each of the 10 
selected serious offences that the offender will be subject to a 
mandatory minimum sentence of four years imprisonment if the 
offender uses a firearm during the commission of the offence. The 
penalty for using a firearm is blended with the penalty for the 10 
offences to which this applies. These offences are: causing death by 
criminal negligence, manslaughter, attempted murder, causing 
bodily harm with intent to wound, sexual assault, aggravated 
sexual assault, kidnapping, hostage taking, robbery, and extortion.
<P>
	When in force Bill C-68 should eliminate the abuses tied to the 
existing application of section 85 of the Criminal Code, while Bill 
C-260 would not solve these problems.
<P>
	I believe the intention of the hon. member is to get tougher on 
criminals who use firearms in the commission of an offence. In fact 
the minimum penalties found in her bill would treat offenders who 
use firearms to commit serious offences more leniently than Bill 
C-68. Her bill would simply subject all persons who commit 
offences with firearms, regardless of the severity of the crime, to a 
three-year minimum prison term, while Bill C-68 ensures that 
persons convicted of serious violent offences committed with a 
firearm receive, at a minimum, a four-year prison term.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-68 also addresses in a comprehensive and effective 
fashion the problem of replica and imitation firearms. Bill C-68 
defines a replica as a device that is not in itself a firearm but is 
designed to resemble ``precisely or with near precision a real 
firearm''. In contrast a device such as a toy water gun that clearly 
does not resemble in the last detail a real firearm is not a replica but 
an imitation firearm. Because replicas are virtually 
indistinguishable from real firearms, their future sale, purchase and 
importation will be strictly controlled under Bill C-68 while 
imitation firearms, such as toy water guns and the like, will 
continue to sold in stores.
<P>
	When it comes to a crime, the potential danger is very high, 
whether a real firearm, a replica or an imitation firearm is used. 
Bill C-68 will solve evidentiary problems which now exist because 
of the current section 85 in the Criminal Code. Section 85 
encompasses only real firearms. Bill C-68 will include within 
section 85 presently in the Criminal Code real firearms, imitations 
and replicas.
<P>
	Bill C-260, presented by the hon. member, would punish 
offences committed with replicas but not with imitation firearms. 
Moreover the bill would do nothing to control dissemination of 
replicas in Canadian society. In  effect, Bill C-260 would only 
come into play after someone had been hurt or killed while Bill 
C-68 includes preventive action against violent crime by 
controlling the availability of replicas and imitations.
<P>
	I would like to speak to the new offences that the hon. member 
proposes to add to the Criminal Code. The actions the hon. member 
seeks to criminalize are already included in Bill C-68 or in the 
current Criminal Code. For instance, clause 96 of Bill C-68 makes 
it an offence to possess a firearm or other weapon that the person 
knows was obtained through the commission of an offence.
<P>
	As well, the Criminal Code currently contains an offence for 
theft and clauses 103 and 104 of Bill C-68 already include offences 
for illegal importation of firearms. These clauses also include 
illegal exportation of firearms and therefore are more 
comprehensive than the ones proposed by the hon. member.
<P>
	Bill C-260 presented by the hon. member would increase the 
mandatory minimum sentence for these two offences from one year 
to three years' imprisonment. The House indicated it to be an 
appropriate punishment for various firearms offences in Bill C-68 
that a one-year minimum sentence is stiff, demonstrating the 
potential lethal nature of firearms and the danger their illegal and 
unsafe possession pose to Canadian society. At the same time it is 
not so harsh as to encourage judges and juries to find ways around 
them where some sympathetic factual circumstances exist.
<P>
	These minimum sentences are very important. We want to send a 
message about the illegal use of firearms.
<P>
	Keeping people in prison is costly and raising minimum 
sentences from one to three years, as the hon. member suggests, 
would cost Canadian taxpayers an enormous amount of money. 
Moreover, where the facts warrant I am confident that judges and 
juries will impose harsher sentences. We have to have some faith in 
our judges and juries. There is a role for minimum sentences but 
basically the length of the sentences and the incarceration must rest 
with our courts.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member proposes to make a person who improperly 
sells a firearm liable for subsequent criminal actions committed by 
the purchaser of that firearm. In other words, a person who does not 
check for a firearms licence before selling the firearm would not 
only commit a serious office of illegal transfer but if the buyer 
commits a murder Bill C-260 would make the seller liable for the 
murder or murders as an accomplice, even though the seller knew 
nothing of the purchaser's murderous intentions. Such a result 
seems to me to be out of proportion with the seller's culpability.
<P>
	Moreover, based on the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court, it 
would also be contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms because criminal liability would not be imposed, not on 
the intentions of the accused to  commit criminal acts and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14748"> 14748 </A></B>
<P>
actual doing of these acts but also on the actions that the person did 
intend and did not foresee.
<P>
	I cannot support that provision. There are severe penalties in Bill 
C-68 for illegal transfer. These penalties do not have the risk of 
contravening the charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	I appreciate what the hon. member is proposing. A lot of what 
she is proposing is included in Bill C-68. The areas that are not I do 
not think add anything other than potential contraventions of the 
charter and completely reducing the authority of our courts in very 
important areas.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we just heard 
how Bill C-260 has been taken care of by government Bill C-68, a 
bill that I am not at all convinced has done much good for Canada.
<P>
	The member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley has 
produced a bill very specifically directed at the criminal misuse of 
firearm. This is where Canadians hope we will direct our efforts. 
Reformers want cost effective gun control directed at criminals that 
will be complied with by the Canadian population.
<P>
	A couple of weeks ago I had an opportunity to be in Labrador 
and to exchange ideas with a number of individuals. Labrador is a 
spot where there are few people in a very large area, some 33,000 
people. Virtually everyone in Labrador has a firearm, every home 
has a firearm. I was fascinated to listen to their responses to Bill 
C-68 and how they received it. They received it much like the 
people in my own home community, with some suspicion and some 
misgivings.
<P>
	A fellow told me a story. Members of the RCMP used to do their 
policing in Labrador. The Newfoundland constabulary came in and 
replaced them. The new constables gave out tickets very regularly 
for putting a shotgun on one's shoulder and driving it out to the 
tundra on a snowmobile. They could not believe their ears. They 
wondered how else they were to get out to hunt the ptarmigan but 
with their shotguns over their shoulders and off they go on their 
snowmobiles. What did the constables think they would do? This 
was a normal reaction for people in Labrador. They resisted the 
constables. They said: ``You cannot give us tickets for that. We will 
all be lawbreakers''.
<P>
	If somebody carried a shotgun over his shoulder down Bank 
Street he would be considered a criminal. It is inappropriate in this 
community. What I am getting at is that the individuals in Labrador 
have a very strong need for firearms. Giving them tickets and 
putting them under Bill C-68 for an activity that is normal for them 
is foolish. They reacted with surprise. They reacted with 
frustration. They reacted with resentment. They would not comply.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	On Bill C-68 I had individual after individual tell me they would 
not comply. They would not register their firearms. They all agree 
with the portions of Bill C-68 directed toward criminal misuse. 
They virtually all disagree with that portion of the bill directed at 
gun registration.
<P>
	How did they respond to Bill C-68? First, they said that their 
member would not listen. Second, they said that when they phoned 
his contact person he argued with them and did not listen. Third, 
they said that their member of Parliament voted against their 
wishes. They said they could bring him there for a forum with 
33,000 Labrador residents who would tell him unanimously that 
they do not want this bill. This bill is not wanted in Labrador.
<P>
	They started out puzzled. They then had disbelief that this could 
happen. Some government members listened to their constituents 
and were punished for following the wishes of their people. They 
asked me whether I thought what those members did was 
democratic and whether the punishment was undemocratic. Then 
they said that there was nothing they could do. One fellow said that 
my party was first off against gun registration. He asked if a 
member of my caucus was directed by his constituents to vote for it 
and what happened to him? He was given a hearty handshake for 
doing what he was elected to do, doing what he came to Ottawa to 
do, that is represent his constituents.
<P>
	They were no longer puzzled with disbelief. There was a spark of 
hope, a spark of enthusiasm. They asked me what they could do, 
how to organize and how to approach Bill C-68 with a different 
group of individuals.
<P>
	There was a very plain message there for the government. 
Canadians expect their representatives to listen to them and to 
follow their wishes, especially on a bill like Bill C-68 that was not 
discussed in the election campaign. There was no mandate for Bill 
C-68 during the election campaign. It would be entirely different if 
it was a big plank of the Liberal platform. It was not.
<P>
	Whom can we listen to? We hear that the police support the bill. 
I want to tell a short story about a policeman. He started in police 
work some 25 years ago. He caught a guy with a gun in his trunk. 
He was pretty sure he had robbed a safe. He could not prove it, but 
the gun in his trunk gave him two years ``in the clink'', in his 
words. He is a pretty basic buy.
<P>
	He had just retired as an RCMP officer. A couple of weeks 
before retiring he caught a bank robber. The guy shoved a 357 
magnum in the mouth of the bank manager and locked him in the 
safe, scared him so bad that he quit his job. He was so frightened 
that he quit his job. He could not function as a bank manager any 
longer. He caught the bank robber. It was witnessed. There was no 
question. What did he get?
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Six months.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> No, he got an eight-month suspended 
sentence.
<P>
	Officers in Canada tell me that Bill C-68 will not work unless the 
public supports it. We need laws in Canada against criminal misuse 
that will be enforced by our police and enforced strongly. Bill C-68 
fails.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
a great deal of pleasure to speak on the bill presented by the hon. 
member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley. I hope all 
members of the House recognize the merits of the bill and support 
it.
<P>
	As Reformers we believe public safety is the number one 
priority. Our goal is to prevent violent crime while not unduly 
restricting the activities of legitimate firearm owners. I firmly 
believe the existing controls on law-abiding, responsible firearm 
owners are more than enough and no further controls are necessary 
to ensure public safety. I reiterate that I do not think further 
controls are necessary for law-abiding gun owners.
<P>
	The bill focuses on the criminals who use guns and replicas of 
guns during the commission of crimes, not on law-abiding gun 
owners. The hon. member is to be commended for presenting such 
a common sense bill which focuses on the root cause of crime, 
criminals. The justice minister should take note.
<P>
	The bill, if passed, will send a clear message to criminals that the 
use of guns in the commission of crimes will not be tolerated. It 
increases the minimum penalty for a first offence from one to 
fourteen years, as it is now, to five to fourteen years and the 
sentence is to be served consecutive to the sentence for committing 
the crime. On the second offence the penalty increases from three 
to fourteen years to ten years to life.
<P>
	It sets out a new offence for the theft of a firearm punishable by a 
penalty of three to fourteen years. It states that subsequent 
sentences are to be served consecutively. That is a key difference 
between this bill and Bill C-68 where there is no consecutive 
sentencing but rather concurrent sentencing. For that reason those 
sentences are not really what is indicated.
<P>
	As well the bill provides for a new offence for unlawful 
importation of firearms for the purpose of selling or using them in 
the commission of an offence. The penalty is three to fourteen 
years. This common sense bill will help to prevent and deter crime.
<P>
	Why am I so sure of what the bill will accomplish? As I said 
earlier, it focuses on the root cause of crime. How many times have 
we heard the Liberals talk about focusing on the root cause of 
crime? Usually the root cause of crime according to the Liberals is 
a whole series of things having to do with the background of the  
criminal. However the root cause of crime is one thing, the 
criminal, and the bill focuses on the criminal.
<P>
	Once again I am reminded of Ted Byfield's editorial in the 
September 11 issue of the Alberta <I>Report</I>. In the editorial he refutes 
the notion that criminals are not responsible for their actions and 
that society is to blame. He cites the example of New York City and 
the dramatic decrease in crime experienced as a result of a police 
crackdown on petty crimes.
<P>
	The police took the advice of two criminologists-it is very 
unusual to group criminologists together-who believed that 
cracking down on so-called petty crime would send a message on 
what behaviour would or would not be tolerated. The new chief of 
police in New York City focused on the root cause of crime, the 
criminal.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	When the experiment worked-it worked extremely well-the 
old school criminologists were less than pleased because it meant 
that crime is somehow a voluntary action and therefore the 
criminal can control what he or she does, contrary to what the 
Liberals have been saying for some time in the House over the past 
30 years. This completely blew their theory that a criminal is not 
responsible for their actions right out of the water.
<P>
	I want to relate this bill back to Bill C-260. This bill focuses on 
what I also believe is the root cause of crime, criminals. This bill 
sends a clear message to criminals that the use of guns in the 
commission of a crime will not be tolerated.
<P>
	Thinking about this common sense bill I am reminded of the 
other gun legislation debated in the House quite a lot over the past 
year. That legislation, Bill C-68, focused on guns and law-abiding 
citizens who use and own guns. The cornerstone of this legislation, 
the national gun registry, will not affect criminals.
<P>
	I know of very few criminals who will register their guns. 
Instead of dealing directly with criminals, the justice minister's 
legislation ignores the criminals completely and concentrates on 
the law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	Should not the purpose of legislation be to deter and prevent 
crime? If this is the case it will come as no surprise the Liberal gun 
control bill will not help to reduce or deter crime. The justice 
minister on several occasions has been asked to demonstrate to the 
House that the gun registry would actually reduce crime.
<P>
	Despite repeated requests in the House during debate, during 
question period and by letters from groups in my constituency and 
in other constituencies across the country the response from the 
justice minister has been that the answer should be sufficiently 
obvious. This is his favourite phrase. It should be sufficiently 
obvious that a gun registry will help to reduce crime.
<P>
	I wonder who it is sufficiently obvious to. Certainly not to the 
people who talk to me in my constituency and  right across the 
country, most recently in Prince Edward Island. The people of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14750"> 14750 </A></B>
<P>
Prince Edward Island made it abundantly clear to me last weekend 
they do not see the connection between a gun registry and 
preventing crime as being sufficiently obvious.
<P>
	I have an article from the <I>Globe and Mail</I> dated September 20 
entitled ``Gun registration won't stem crime'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A federal council on crime and safety supports universal gun registration but 
doubts it would do much to stamp out criminal activity. The national crime 
prevention council said that it backs the federal gun bill, including the plans to 
register all owners and their firearms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The crime prevention council is a group of Liberal appointees. 
This is a quote from the submission from this Liberal group: ``The 
system is, however, a costly and complicated proposal which may 
have a relatively limited impact on the prevention of criminal 
activity or victimization''. This is from a submission by this 
Liberal commission-Liberal thinking at its best. I have heard an 
awful lot of that over the past few months in the House.
<P>
	This clearly sums up the difference between the Reform Party 
and the Liberal Party and their special interest groups. Reform 
targets criminals who use guns; the Liberals make criminals out of 
law-abiding citizens. On the one hand the government has 
presented us with a bill that wants law-abiding gun owners to 
register their guns. These same law-abiding gun owners will face 
punishment if they do not register their guns, and many of them 
will not register their guns. No government can force people to 
obey a law they never wanted. Who asked for this law?
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-260 is a common sense bill which focuses on criminals 
who use a gun in the commission of a crime. It sets out harsh 
penalties for the offences and thus sends the message that this type 
of behaviour will not be tolerated.
<P>
	I am proud to support the bill, presented by the hon. member for 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley. I thank her on behalf of 
Canadians across for the effort. I look forward to support from all 
parties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a few 
months back when I was in Kelowna one of the Liberal members 
and I debated Bill C-68 in front of a crowd of about 400. I felt sorry 
for her because there were no supporters at that gathering for Bill 
C-68.
<P>
	Before the debate started they brought in an RCMP officer who 
went through section 85. The officer wanted all the people to know 
what was now in the law pertaining to guns. It took him over an 
hour to go through all the laws related to guns presently in the 
Criminal Code. I could not believe all of the things that apply not 
only to criminals but to law-abiding people. I commend my 
colleague from British Columbia for being  able to find a flaw in 
there which really addresses what we need to address, the criminal. 
I applaud her for coming out with this bill long before we saw Bill 
C-68.
<P>
	Her bill is pretty small but it has a lot of meat in it. She probably 
has an underpaid staff that did a little work and managed to come 
up with it. The enormous justice department managed to come out 
with about 190 pages. It called it Bill C-68, the answer to all our 
problems. It was accomplished by who knows how many highly 
paid senior bureaucrats, probably all with many degrees in law. 
They are brilliant people who suddenly out of the blue sky had all 
the answers to our problems regarding law and order. They would 
straighten it out.
<P>
	When I remembered that presentation by the RCMP officer I 
found it unbelievable how many laws were already on the books. 
Really what makes it most unbelievable is to come out with a new 
bill of which 80 per cent applies to law-abiding people.
<P>
	All this morning and yesterday we debated amendments we 
wanted to make to Bill C-45. We wanted to get restitution for 
victims. No, said the Liberals. That did not pass. We wanted to 
have a review of parole decisions which were not good. A mistake 
was made, the guy was paroled and he killed again. We think there 
should be a review. No, said the Liberals. They were little common 
sense things we wanted to do for the victims, for the innocent of the 
country.
<P>
	Instead the Liberals came out with about 190 pages, 80 per cent 
of which attacked the innocent and the potential victims. Instead of 
addressing the criminal in all of those pages, with all the high paid 
lawyers working in the justice department, all of these geniuses, all 
of these champions of the people, they came out with that while my 
colleague and a couple of staff came out with something which 
absolutely makes sense and which I guarantee Canadians want. It 
attacks the criminal. I really applaud her.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	My colleague says it is just duplicating what is there. This bill 
was presented eight months before Bill C-68 probably was even 
thought about. I take that back. It had to take those bureaucrats at 
least a year and a half to make that bill. After all, we have to keep 
them employed. That is part of job creation, to put a bunch of 
gobbledegook together and sell it to the public and then sit back 
and blow your horn that you have really done a great thing.
<P>
	We are trying to address crime. We are trying to fight criminals. 
My colleague across the floor talked about how it costs so much 
money to keep these people in prison. It is such a burden and we 
cannot afford it. I did a little research from the solicitor general's 
department. In federal prisons about 65 per cent are violent 
criminals and 35 are not. In provincial prisons it is the reverse.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="14751"> 14751 </A></B>
<P>
	With my little back in the mountains brain I tried to calculate 
that and it sounds like it comes out about half and half. Fifty per 
cent are violent and 50 per cent are non-violent.
<P>
	Then I remembered the years I worked voluntarily in prisons, 
counselling and trying to help young people particularly. A number 
of 18 and 19-year olds in there were not violent. I could not 
understand why they were sentenced to prison for as long as they 
were because they were not violent. There were better things we 
could have done with these young people. The amazing part about 
it was most of these young people were in jail because they had a 
drug problem. If they were not into drugs they would not have been 
in the problems they were.
<P>
	What is our justice system doing? We are putting those kinds of 
people behind bars, we will rehabilitate them, fix them up. Guess 
what? As I visit every prison across the country I find out by 
talking to inmates and guards, as will anybody on that side of the 
House if they do the same, that it is 10 times easier to get drugs in a 
prison than it is on the streets of the communities.
<P>
	We have a drug problem. We are putting them in a situation in 
which it is easier to get drugs than anywhere else. Then six or seven 
years later we will put them back on the streets. They have gone 
through <I>X</I> number of programs because they know how to jump the 
hoops, but we have not taken the drugs away because we cannot 
control it.
<P>
	That is not the Liberal way. Let us not get tough on things like 
that. Let us come out with a big document that says: ``You farmer, 
you duck hunter, you rabbit hole shooter, you gopher shooter, you 
are the guys we will have to take care of. You have to start 
registering these things. It is a problem''.
<P>
	The next day we hear the Ontario attorney general saying: 
``Good grief, the trucks are coming through. We are not stopping 
them. They are being driven by criminals''. They do not even know 
what is in them. Probably guns.
<P>
	Then we go out to another border and the boats are coming 
across with nobody to stop them. The standing orders are if the boat 
sets at this angle it has probably got booze. If it is at this angle it 
has probably got guns. If it is at this angle it has probably got drugs. 
They have no way of controlling it.
<P>
	To produce Bill C-68, which will to do nothing about those kinds 
of problems, it will probably cost millions. Why not put those 
millions into border patrol and starting fight crime? That is what 
the member is wanting to do with her bill. Start fighting crime and 
quit being so picky over replicas. Walk down the street sometime 
and if somebody comes up behind you and you do not see them and 
they stick a pencil in your back and say: ``Give me your wallet or I 
will shoot'', I will guarantee you will go through a trauma. It might 
as well be a .38.
<P>
	It is the actions they do, these kinds of people. It is those kinds of 
people we want. Let us get them into jail. Let us look for alternative 
programs for those who do not belong in there. Let us genuinely 
start helping those who are helpable and let us start putting those 
away who are violent and dangerous and keep them where they 
belong. It would probably save lots of money there as well.
<P>
	Do not write any more documents. That is enough of that. All 
morning long the victims were denied help from the government. 
All afternoon on Bill C-45 victims were not even talked about by 
this government. Thirteen Reformers stood in the House and 
defended the rights of victims. Not one on that side stood and did 
the same. Instead they voted all those motions down.
<P>
	I just bet they will vote this motion down. I will bet on it right 
now, because it just makes sense. It is what Canadians want. They 
do not use their heads. They listen to the little front row people. 
Their strings are pulled, the puppets jump up, and they support. 
That is what has to stop in this country. I am tired of it. Canadians 
are tired of it. Let us get to work. Let us start fighting crime and 
quit being so ridiculous.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Debate 
throughout this day and particularly the speech we just heard and 
the final remarks from the member for Wild Rose have been 
permeated with questioning the motives of other members of the 
House. I believe that is contrary to proper procedure in the House.
<P>
	I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that you take that under consideration 
and report back to the House on whether or not members in fact 
should be encouraged to avoid questioning the motives of other 
members.
<P>
	I have a side comment. The other side again made the same 
error, I believe, accusing me of having a guilty conscience. I go 
home and I sleep just fine at night, thank you very much.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to thank the hon. 
member for her intervention. I have been following the debate very 
attentively. My recollection also allows me to think back to a few 
months ago when a debate on the same issue raised some very 
strong views. I find the comments that were made today were a 
matter of debate and not a point of order.
<P>
	There being no further members rising for debate and the motion 
not being designated as a votable item, the time provided for the 
consideration of private members' business has now expired and 
the order is dropped from the Order Paper pursuant to Standing 
Order 96.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, if you were to ask, I think the House 
would consent to calling it 6.30 p.m.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous consent 
to see the clock as being 6.30 p.m.?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 6.30 p.m., this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to 
Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.18 p.m.)
<P>
