</I></B></P><P align=left>Next Tuesday, it will be my privilege, in the company of 
representative veterans and other Canadian witnesses, to fly to 
Vimy, France, to receive the remains of an unidentified Canadian 
soldier from World War I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian veterans, military from Canada and France, diplomats, 
along with French government and community leaders will all 
witness the event.  Honorary pallbearers from our wartime allies 
will bear the casket which our delegation from Canada will 
officially receive from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The casket will contain the remains of a young soldier who made 
the supreme sacrifice in the area of Vimy.  We do not know his 
name, we do not know his age, we do not know his unit but we do 
know that he was one of our brave Canadian soldiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the ceremony at Vimy Ridge, the remains of the unknown 
soldier will be flown to Ottawa on the afternoon of May 25.  In 
Ottawa there will be a procession to Parliament Hill where the 
unknown soldier will lie in state for three days in the Hall of 
Honour.  The casket will be under constant vigil of serving 
members of the Canadian Forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police.  Members of the public will be invited to pay their 
respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 28 the casket will be taken on a gun carriage to the 
National War Memorial accompanied by a military escort, Her 
Excellency the Governor General of Canada, the Prime Minister, 
members of the diplomatic corps, veterans and the RCMP.  There 
the casket will be placed on a specially designed memorial tomb, 
after which a committal service will be conducted with military 
honours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Soil from each province and the territories will be mixed with 
the soil taken from his resting place in France and placed in the 
tomb.  After completion of the service the tomb will be sealed 
forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be a unique occasion of commemoration as we honour the 
unknown soldier.  I want to express, on behalf of all members of 
the House, our deep appreciation for the great efforts of the 
Royal Canadian Legion and others who have worked so hard to bring 
the unknown soldier home. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to respond to the statement of the 
Minister of Veterans Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The events to occur next week are truly historic and long 
overdue.  The ceremonies in Ottawa will bring together all 
provinces, since earth gathered from each province and the soil 
of France where a soldier fell so long ago, will be interred with 
his remains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week a soldier will be carried home from the shadow of Vimy 
Ridge to rest forever on Canadian soil, not to the town he left 
so long ago, for we know not where he lived, not to his family's 
home, for we know not who his family is, but home he will come to 
rest in an honourable place and to receive the deserving respect 
of all as we, the public, remember the war, think of his soul and 
ponder the supreme “price of peace” that his death reflects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These actions show to us that the unknown soldier represents all 
Canadians.  In falling at Vimy, the unknown soldier fell in a 
crucial battle, a Canadian victory that all the world would see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many would say that Canada took birth that day.  Born into the 
world of nations with respect, born by the blood of our young, 
born through the determination and skill.  Their spirit lives on 
to this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 60,000 Canadian soldiers died in “the war to end all 
wars”.  This last century, over 100,000 Canadians never returned 
home.  More than 27,000 of our war dead, nearly 25% of all 
Canadians who lost their lives in fighting for our freedoms, have 
no marked grave having been buried at sea or on land. 
It is this soldier's life and his death that is of singular 
importance at this time. The unknown soldier is whom we speak of 
today.  His name is known only unto God.  Soon he will rest in 
peace on Canadian soil.  Soon he will be with his family; all 
Canadians who will honour his past.  Soon he will be home at long 
last.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
somewhat familiar with the Vimy area, in France, where, next 
week, we will go to gather up the remains of an unknown Canadian 
soldier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago, I visited this World War I battlefield. I 
remember walking over the plain, which now looks so peaceful 
with its wheat fields and small wooded areas, in a contemplative 
mood but also feeling the anguish that grips us when we find 
ourselves in a place where thousands of men died while fighting 
for freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Morts pour la liberté”. These people made the ultimate 
sacrifice for freedom. 
It is with reluctance that I use this expression, because I am 
well aware that after having been used in so many speeches and 
read, unfortunately, on so many tombstones, it may have lost 
some of its meaning and may no longer fully reflect the noble 
yet terrible reality that it should evoke. Still, let us try to 
visualize what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are close to the village of Vimy. Can we see that young man, 
whose remains we will bring back home? Like thousands of others 
he is there, alive, with his helmet, his rifle and his khaki 
uniform in a trench, where he is taking cover, alongside his 
brothers in arms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stunned by the din of battle, which prevents him from thinking, 
he shoots again and again. His rifle is hot. 
But in the lulls between firing, he lights a cigarette and, 
leaning on the muddy wall of the trench, he dreams.  For the 
hundredth time, we can be sure, he imagines the wonderful moment 
when the war is ended, he has travelled back across the ocean, 
and the train carrying him and his buddies home finally reaches 
its destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He can picture himself already, a young soldier flush with 
victory, searching through the cheering crowd on the platform 
for the anxious faces of his mother, his father, his girlfriend 
or his wife, and perhaps his children, older now.  “Will he be 
there”, they must be asking themselves.  There, he has seen 
them.  “Yes, yes, I am here”, he shouts to them, leaning out the 
open train window. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A whistling sound, an explosion, a blast—it must have been a 
shell that killed him because his remains, likely mixed in with 
those of other soldiers, could not be identified. 
A shell which shattered his dream and robbed him of his 
identity.  But today, it is this anonymity which has earned him 
a place in history by conferring on him the honour of forever 
representing in his native land, to which he has returned after 
more than 80 years, all those who, like him, gave their lives 
for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week, the coffin of this soldier will be on view in 
parliament's Hall of Honour so that his fellow Canadians may pay 
tribute to him.  I hope that many men and women will do so for, 
were he not back among us, they might perhaps have eventually 
forgotten to whom they owe their freedom.  They need not be 
great readers of literature to help make the following two lines 
of verse ring as true today as when they were first written: 
<UL>

pleased to rise on behalf of the New Democratic Party of Canada 
in response to the minister's announcement of the significant 
events that will take place in France and Canada next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the repatriation and interment of the remains of an 
unidentified Canadian solider from World War I is important to 
all Canadians.  This unknown young man will receive posthumously 
the honour, respect and recognition that was so devoutly earned 
as he, like so many others, gave his life in service to his 
country and fellow man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ceremonies that will take place will express the 
appreciation of all Canadians and their allies for the ultimate 
sacrifice that was made by this young man and so many other men 
and women who fought for the peace and good order that we enjoy 
today.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, these ceremonies will be a stark reminder of 
the horrors of war, of man's inhumanity to man and the real and 
tragic cost involved when nations rise against nations, when 
greed, hatred and lust for power and domination take precedence 
over love, respect, sharing, kindness and a sense of fair play, 
equality and social justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we pay our respects to this young Canadian while he lies in 
state in the Hall of Honour, may each of us search our hearts for 
what we can do individually and collectively to advance the cause 
for which this young man died:  peace on earth and goodwill to 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, at long last we are bringing him home, but perhaps he never 
really left.  While his body may have left home and died, I 
believe his spirit, like the spirits of many others who have gone 
on before, remains with us seeking peace and justice for all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honour one who is without a name, one who carries the 
names of many.  Next week I will be accompanying the minister to 
Vimy.  Next week for Canada, an unknown soldier becomes the 
Unknown Soldier.  He will be removed from his many, many comrades 
at Vimy to lie in a new place of equal but solitary honour in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This man's family should escort him to his new grave for he is 
our father, he is our son.  On behalf of his country, I am proud 
to be part of the mourners who will bring him to his Canadian 
resting place of honour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our men and women who died in war are all equally honoured by 
this act.  We remember those who died in the fields of foreign 
nations.  So too we remember those who died in the air and on the 
seas.  Their mortal bodies were committed to earthless graves 
that cannot be visited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All across this country there are monuments, memorials sacred to 
the remembrance of those who died in the wars fought in our name. 
On many of the cenotaphs is written these appropriate words from 
Ecclesiasticus, “their name liveth for evermore”. Today, let us 
also remember the words preceding this citation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And some there be, which have no memorial...and are become as if 
they had never been born...But these were merciful men, whose 
righteousness hath not been forgotten...Their seed shall remain 
forever, and their glory shall not be blotted out.  Their bodies 
are buried in peace; but their names liveth for evermore. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this solemn occasion, we again express our sorrow and 
sympathy for the families of those who have died in the service 
of Canada.  They survive with a lifelong loss and unending pain. 
Some will feel extra grief because their family member was killed 
in a manner that did not permit identification or burial.  May 
they know serenity through this expression of the perpetual 
gratefulness of all Canadians for all time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We express our gratitude to those who took up the torch, who saw 
injustice and tyranny and were prepared to suffer and die for 
their fellow Canadians.  We remember those who returned from war 
and who still suffer the pains of physical and mental wounds.  We 
pray that in paying homage to one unknown soldier we and future 
generations will remember and honour those who died for Canada.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the purchase of mefloquine from the manufacturer

as mandated by the Food and Drug Act: (<I>a</I>) did the Canadian

approval granted prior to the end of the Canadian Forces

Protection Branch received the final results of the Lariam Safety 
Monitoring Study from the manufacturer, and the date of the 
receipt by the Health Protection Branch of the last submission of 
the Safety Monitoring Study's results prior to licensing 
approval; (<I>e</I>) did the Department of National Defence prepare an 
advisory note acknowledging that evidence provided to the Somalia 
Inquiry had mislead the Inquiry as to the status of mefloquine 
approvals for the mefloquine used in the Somalia deployment; was 
the advisory note forwarded to the Minister of National Defence; 
and what action was taken when the Minister was so informed? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> I am informed by the 
departments of Health and National Defence as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) The Canadian Forces did not indicate on the order forms for 
the mefloquine to be used on the Somalia deployment that it was 
for use under the Food and Drugs Act Lariam Safety Monitoring 
Study or on the Somalia deployment. This type of statement is 
also not on the initial order form that was addressed to the 
Ottawa Civic Hospital for the procurement of mefloquine earlier 
in the safety monitoring study. The order dates were September 9, 
11, 14, 15 and 28, 1992 and the drugs were delivered within three 
working days of the order being placed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) At the time of the transaction, the manufacturer was not 
required, nor did they inform Health Canada that the mefloquine 
was being ordered under the authority of the Lariam Safety 
Monitoring Study, and that this mefloquine was apparently 
purchased for the Somalia deployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada was informed only after the allegations arose in 
the media in October 1994, and after investigation and 
consultation with the manufacturer subsequently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Health Canada 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada records reveal that the manufacturer did 
indeed request fast tracking of the new drug submission for 
Lariam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada issued a notice of compliance for Lariam on 
January 22, 1993. Health Canada is not privy to significant dates 
related to Canadian Forces activity in Somalia and is therefore 
unable to comment on the date of approval of Lariam—January 22, 
1993, in relation to the end of the Canadian Forces deployment in 
Somalia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National Defence 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada's response indicates January 22, 1993, as the 
date of approval for Lariam. Licensing approval for Lariam was 
therefore granted prior to the end of the Canadian Forces 
deployment in Somalia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) The last submission of the safety monitoring study results 
received by Health Canada prior to marketing approval was on July 
17, 1992. The final results of the Lariam Safety Monitoring Study 
were received from the manufacturer on July 30, 1993 and in 
August/September 1993, subsequent to marketing approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) An advisory note was prepared for and passed to the Minister 
of National Defence in October 1997 which states, with regard to 
the approval of mefloquine, “there was no intention to mislead 
the Commission”. However, this document goes on to explain, 
“Until very recently, it was believed that the Surgeon General 
Branch had informed Health Canada that mefloquine was being 
dispensed without the consent of individuals—even the 
directorate which authorized the use of mefloquine in Somalia 
was under this misconception”. Consequently, any information 
the department may have passed to the Somalia commission of 
inquiry related to the approval of mefloquine would have been 
based on the assumption that Health Canada and the drug 
manufacturer had been informed that the Department of National 
Defence was administering mefloquine outside the boundaries of 
the manufacturer's study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the advisory note was prepared some four months after the 
publication of the Somalia commission of inquiry report in June 
1997, no action was taken to advise the commission. However, as a 
result of the misunderstanding experienced with the 
administration of mefloquine in Somalia, the department 
implemented several corrective actions to improve monitoring and 
recording procedures relating to the use of unlicensed products. 
A regulatory affairs position has been established to serve as a 
single contact point with Health Canada regarding unlicensed 
products; procedures for acquisition, distribution, use and recording of 
unlicensed medical products have been promulgated; detailed drug 
and vaccine information sheets for health care providers and 
Canadian Forces members are being prepared; and an adverse 
effects monitoring and reporting database is being developed.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>DESIGNATED DAY—CANADA HEALTH ACT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK21">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House call upon the government to act on the words of 
the Health Minister when he said, “we have grave reservations 
about investing public funds in private for-profit facilities”, 
by immediately amending the Canada Health Act to provide that 
provinces be financially penalized if they allow public funds to 
be used for the provision of insured services by private, 
for-profit hospitals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, I am going to share my time with my dear 
colleague for Winnipeg North Centre. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we put forward today comes as a result of what 
transpired here last week.  After months of hand wringing, after 
months of promises to carefully study, after months of posturing, 
the health minister stood in this place and gave the green light 
to Ralph Klein's efforts to privatize health care in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health said that he has a problem with Alberta's 
bill 11. Our motion today offers a solution.  With today's motion 
we are offering the government a way to act on the concerns of 
the health minister, the concerns he himself has been forced to 
acknowledge again and again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a way to stop Alberta's bill 11 from triggering a huge 
expansion of for profit health care for Canadians.  It is a way 
to uphold the intent and promise of the Canada Health Act that 
all Canadians shall have equal access to health care when they 
need it.  It is a way to do what Canadians expect of this 
government which is to stand up for our most cherished social 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us back up a bit.  Let us go over the highlights of the 
tragic comedy known as the federal reaction to bill 11.  Since 
last fall the minister has voiced concerns about bill 11. The 
Klein government has dismissed those concerns, barely able to 
conceal its contempt for Canada's Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's strategy is to buy time.  First he waited to see 
the actual legislation.  The draft the Alberta government sent 
him was not good enough. Then he waited to see the amendments, 
then the legislation in its final form, then it was the 
regulations. Now he wants to see specific violations of the 
Canada Health Act before he is prepared to do anything. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the minister to take action, and right now.  All 
his protestations to the contrary, let us be clear about it, the 
minister does have an option.  If he continues to claim that he 
cannot apply the Canada Health Act, he can change it in order to 
ensure that no Canadian has to make a choice between paying 
extra or taking the risk of getting second class treatment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accessibility is a fundamental principle of the Canada Health 
Act.  The act requires that provincial governments as a condition 
of receiving federal transfers ensure that insured health 
services are provided on uniform terms and conditions.  The 
minister knows that bill 11 compromises the principle of 
accessibility.  He said so in a letter to his Alberta 
counterpart.  He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To permit for profit facilities to sell enhanced services, in 
combination with insured services, would create a circumstance 
that represents a serious concern in relation to the principle of 
accessibility. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern which we share is that bill 11 permits, in fact 
encourages and facilitates, queue jumping and two tier health 
care. All the pious statements by Mr. Klein aside, that is the 
main goal of bill 11.  Patients in private for profit hospitals 
will be offered uninsured, or enhanced services so-called, for 
which they will be required to pay extra and if they refuse they 
will undoubtedly face second class treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us forget about the technical and legal arguments.  Let us 
think about Canadians who are put in that position, Canadians who 
are vulnerable, scared and sometimes desperate, often suffering 
severe pain, Canadians who have always trusted their doctors but 
in that position are not so sure.  With bill 11 American health 
corporations put doctors in the position of having one hand on 
the scalpel and one hand on the cash register.  Canadians who 
cannot pay will be forced to settle for inferior service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister hoped to make bill 11 magically disappear by 
beefing up monitoring.  However, this move described quite 
rightly by the auditor general many months ago, does not solve 
the root problem because these staff cannot be in an operating 
room or in the doctor's office when a patient is asked whether 
she wants to pay a little extra or settle for the minimum level 
of service. They cannot see inside the doctor's head when she 
schedules a procedure or books an appointment for us with a 
specialist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister himself said in his letter that the threat to 
accessibility is the circumstance created by bill 11, namely 
allowing for profit hospitals to sell uninsured services while 
also providing publicly funded insured services.  That is why it 
is a shameful evasion to now say that the Minister of Health must 
wait for specific documented violations before moving to enforce 
the Canada Health Act.  He is hiding behind a legal ambiguity in 
the act to avoid doing anything whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our motion removes that ambiguity.  It clarifies how the 
principle of accessibility must be upheld in a world in which 
commercial health corporations aided by their political cronies 
are trying to dismantle our public health system.  It ensures 
that all Canadians are treated equally in hospitals receiving 
public health care dollars. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question for the leader of the NDP has to do with the 
province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of B.C., which is an NDP government I might add, 
recently allowed a hospital in my riding, Lions Gate Hospital, to 
experiment with the contracting out of services to the private 
sector.  The two areas of treatment covered by the experiment are 
eye surgery and simple surgical procedures. As a result of the 
contracting out of these services to the private sector, the 
waiting list for eye surgery has dropped by 60% and the waiting 
list for simple surgical procedures has dropped by 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the leader of the NDP recognize the success of this private 
sector involvement in the health care sector or will she continue 
to oppose these new approaches which have alleviated the 
suffering of dozens of my constituents?  Would she rather condemn 
her followers to long waiting lists and inadequate procedures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me say first, as I 
have said on many occasions and said again this morning, we are 
absolutely in favour of innovation to improve the public health 
care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we stand against what bill 11 is all about.  Bill 11 
clearly intends to create a two tier health care system where 
those who can pay extra money can jump the queue and get 
preferred services and those who do not have that private wealth 
and deep pockets are not in a position to do so.  That is why 
bill 11 is so lethal.  It threatens the very heart of 
universality and the concept that people shall be eligible for 
equal treatment regardless of where they live or what their 
financial circumstances are.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a fundamental difference between those provinces.  Let 
me say that the NDP provinces have backfilled, infilled dollar 
for dollar, the huge sum of money taken out of the public health 
care system by the federal government.  Also the NDP provinces 
are standing up and fighting against this very serious threat to 
the total health and universality of access to services in the 
public not for profit health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, the 
leader of the NDP did not answer my question.  Does she approve 
of the type of private sector contracting out which is being 
experimented with by the NDP government in British Columbia, or 
would she rather condemn her followers to lengthy waiting lists 
and inadequate procedures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a sad thing, 
which is exactly why Canadians are so alarmed, that members of 
the official opposition talk not at all about the need for 
innovation in health care.  They talk not at all about the threat 
of bill 11 not just to universal not for profit health care in 
Alberta but to universal not for profit public health care across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they finally get up out of their seats and start to raise 
issues about health care, it is after Canadians have noted that 
they have completely abandoned their responsibility as the 
official opposition to stand up for a public not for profit 
universal health care system.  They have it in their heads that 
there is some either/or here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We absolutely want to see innovation.  We need innovation in the 
health care system.  At the very least we need the government to 
deliver on its commitment to home care and to a pharmacare 
program, but it cannot be at the expense of the universal 
provision of health care to those who need it.  That is what the 
official opposition party does not seem willing either to accept 
or take any leadership on. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I know the Canadian Alliance finished with 4% in 
Newfoundland slightly ahead of the extreme wrestling party.  That 
tells how much credibility it has on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed yesterday the Minister of Finance announced that the 
surplus for 1999-2000 was $11 billion higher than projected in 
February.  Would the leader agree with me that this money should 
be spent on health care, on the CBC and on other social programs 
that are a necessity for the future development of our country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think my colleague 
from Regina has said it all.  If Canadians depended upon 
leadership from the Reform Party, in whatever its newest 
incarnation, then we would now have already Americanized our 
health care system in exactly the way that actually some of the 
candidates for the leadership of its renamed party have been 
advocating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is any problem with the agreement with my 
colleagues in my caucus on the issue.  Neither is there any 
problem with Canadians understanding the transparency and the 
hypocrisy of the official opposition position. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased on behalf of my colleagues in the New 
Democratic Party to be able to address a situation that is 
obviously at a very critical juncture in the history of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We come to this debate with a serious, constructive motion to 
demand that the government stand and take action.  We come to 
this debate with the understanding of so many Canadians that we 
are at a defining moment in our history when it comes to the 
number one priority facing Canadians: health care, access to 
quality health care across the country, and the preservation of a 
system that has held the country in good stead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to be able to follow my leader, the leader of 
the New Democratic Party, who has been leading the fight in 
speaking out on behalf of Canadians and their number one concern. 
She is the only leader in the House, the only leader of a 
national political party who has decided to hold the government 
to account and to reflect the concerns of the Canadian public.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All my colleagues in the New Democratic Party have been fighting 
this issue day in and day out, week after week, month after 
month.  It is an important issue.  It is imperative for us to 
hold the government to account and to move it from its words and 
rhetoric to the point where it is prepared to have political 
courage and to take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very constructive proposition for the government 
today.  We hope the Minister of Health is listening carefully, as 
I see he is, and will convince his colleagues to support us in 
this request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my leader has done in her opening remarks, let me just 
briefly put the motion in some historical context.  It will come 
as no surprise to the Minister of Health when I say again today 
that we have been pressuring the minister month after month to do 
something about bill 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to mention the fact that for seven months the 
Minister of Health has said he will act later.  He said he will 
act when he gets the mail.  He will act when the bill is 
unveiled.  He will act when the bill is introduced.  He will act 
after amendments, after regulations, and now he is saying after 
implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been the action so far?  Nothing, nil.  I do not like 
to get carried away with the rhetoric in the House, but I have a 
difficult time not pointing out that this is a very shameful 
performance on the part of the Minister of Health, and I think he 
knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the response of the Minister of Health and his 
colleagues over the last number of months.  We tried in the House 
to do something as simple as getting the government to 
acknowledge the existence of a number of legal opinions about how 
bill 11 violates the Canada Health Act and how it opens up NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could not even get the government to allow us to present 
those legal opinions.  It did not even want to have a look at 
them.  It did not even want to acknowledge their existence 
because it would put the government in the terrible position of 
having to recognize the facts forcing it to act now and act 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked about the NAFTA implications, something that has been 
acknowledged as a very serious concern by credible organizations 
from one end of the country to the other.  What did the Liberals 
do?  They reversed themselves without a single legal opinion to 
back them up.  All the while we have the reform alliance and the 
Tories cheering Ralph Klein on, supporting, aiding and abetting 
an agenda which opens up our health care system to a two tier 
American style approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the inaction of the Minister of Health the government is 
letting the right wing forces send a message, make a difference, 
influence the public agenda.  The passivity and inaction of the 
minister are destructive and dangerous in more ways than one when 
it comes to the future of the country and the future of national 
health care that held Canada in good stead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Canadian Alliance and the Tories are suggesting is 
something that Canadians abhor, something that has been rejected 
time and time again.  It is absolutely critical for the 
government to stand today to put an end to that kind of agenda, 
to counter it immediately and to do so by way of concerted and 
decisive action.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the minister continue to do?  He continues to dodge 
and weave, wait and see, hide and seek.  He is now saying after 
all the time he has had to study bill 11 that it complies with 
the Canada Health Act.  He has given us no legal opinion.  He has 
given no evidence for the sudden decision to claim there is no 
violation of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I should not comment on how many Liberal members are in 
the House, but I hope the Minister of Health will get to all of 
them over the course of the day.  I would like them to think 
about what they are doing and what is happening.  The health 
minister has said private for profit hospitals do not violate the 
Canada Health Act.  The legacy of the government will not be 
brave decisive action but explicit consent to a two tier American 
style health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We used the words of the minister in the motion because we 
thought they were a significant indication of the wishes of 
Canadians. He says that he has grave reservations about investing 
public funds in private for profit facilities.  Grave concerns do 
not stop health care from becoming a commodity to be bought and 
sold on the open market.  Grave concerns do nothing to stop bill 
11 from being proclaimed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the minister has had a heck of a time trying to get his 
head around it and do something decisive over the past seven 
months, but we are here today saying that he now has a window of 
opportunity to act before bill 11 is actually proclaimed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have lots more to say and I think the best way to actually say 
what the motion is all about is to read a letter to the editor of 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I> of today by Don Schmidt.  He wrote:

doing exactly what bill 11 attempts to do, reduce waiting lines

lines by doing exactly what bill 11 is trying to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the alliance 
members want to have it both ways in this debate.  On the one 
hand they say that they are in support of medicare, while on the 
other hand they do not acknowledge that these principles are 
being violated today.  The principle of accessibility is being 
violated under bill 11.  Members cannot stand in the House and 
say they support medicare and then say we should go further than 
bill 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also seems to feel that the only way we can deal with 
waiting lists and the need for more efficiencies in our system is 
through privatization.  Since when did privatization become the 
only solution for innovation?  Alliance members joined with New 
Democrats in the House many months ago and said that the solution 
to the problem was in convincing the government to restore the 
cash transfer payments so that there would be adequate cash on 
the table to meet the needs of Canadians so we could shape our 
system to deal with growing and emerging needs in the health care 
system today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why have these members suddenly decided to support the likes of 
Ralph Klein, Stockwell Day and Mike Harris to pursue an American 
agenda, and not a Canadian approach to something as vital as 
universal access to health care? 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for becoming so dramatic 
and so excited in her answer to my colleague from Macleod. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very simple question being asked.  Does the member 
support or not support the NDP government's approach to an 
innovation that is being tried in Vancouver?  Why is it that the 
member cannot say yes or no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has suggested that there are many different ways 
of innovating, and I quite agree with her.  This is a sister 
organization, an NDP government in British Columbia, which is 
using a particular innovation.  All we want to know is whether 
those members would support that innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have a motion 
before the House today to try to get some support to stop bill 
11.  That party is confused about its own position and is afraid 
to clearly indicate to Canadian people that it is in favour of a 
parallel, private two tier health care system.  That party comes 
to the House with specific issues pertaining to provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be happy to look into examples of health care delivery 
that are innovative.  I would also inquire into each of the 
examples to see if there is any breach of the Canada Health Act. 
What is fundamental to us today—and I would hope alliance 
members would eventually come to this point—is the preservation 
of medicare; it is giving Canadians the wherewithal to preserve 
medicare and build for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My goodness, I would hope that in this kind of questioning from 
alliance members they are not skirting their responsibilities. We 
are engaging in a debate about the future of medicare and whether 
the Canada Health Act is able to uphold the principles of 
medicare.  Are those members prepared to say clearly through this 
debate, and on how they vote on this motion, that they believe in 
medicare and will do anything to uphold the principles of 
accessibility, comprehensiveness, universality, portability and 
non-profit administration?  Are they or are they not prepared to 
join us in this most critical and fundamental question?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be dividing my time this morning with the hon. member for 
Bruce—Grey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the opportunity to address the House, as Minister of 
Health, on an issue of such current and continuing priority.  I 
acknowledge the importance of the motion which the hon. member 
for Halifax has put before the House of Commons today.  The issue 
is of fundamental significance because the way a nation chooses 
to provide for health care services to those who are sick speaks 
directly to the values of that nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our case, the values of Canadians are reflected and codified 
in the Canada Health Act.  Although the Canada Health Act was 
written and adopted many years ago, its principles are as 
relevant now, as important now and as necessary now as they were 
when the statute was first written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public medicare in Canada has allowed us to provide health care 
services to our citizens in a way that is socially fair, while at 
the same time putting in place a health care system that is 
economically efficient and is a competitive advantage in the 
business world to our businesses when they compete with those of 
other nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say at the outset that we, on this side of the House, 
share the concerns that have given rise to the motion which is 
presented today on behalf of the New Democratic Party.  While we 
share those concerns, our strategy in dealing with them differs 
from that proposed by the leader of the NDP.  Simply stated, 
there is no need to amend the Canada Health Act to deal with the 
concerns that have been raised.  The Canada Health Act already 
contains both the rules and the penalties to enable the 
Government of Canada to ensure compliance with its principles. 
They are already in the Canada Health Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that, as Minister of Health for 
Canada, it is my responsibility to monitor the health systems of 
the provinces and territories in order to ensure that they meet 
the criteria and conditions of the Canada Health Act.  If there 
is an infraction, I am required by the act to consult the 
provinces or territories in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, a number of potential problems of non-compliance 
have been resolved by negotiation, without having to invoke the 
penalties provided by the Canada Health Act.  If negotiations 
failed, however, the Government of Canada has the power to 
withhold funds from the provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize that this power is not simply theoretical. 
It is not just a rule written on paper.  This authority has been 
exercised a number of times in recent years.  For example, 
between 1984 and 1987 the Government of Canada withheld about 
$245 million from seven provinces that permitted user fees and/or 
extra billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 to 1993 the Government of Canada withheld funds from 
British Columbia in respect of extra billing arising out of the 
dispute between the provincial government and the B.C. medical 
association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 our government deducted payments from four provinces 
that charged facility fees for medically necessary services at 
private clinics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each case the principles of the Canada Health Act, without 
being amended, had been contravened and in each case the 
Government of Canada acted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of bill 11 I have both spoken publicly and 
written directly to the Government of Alberta to express my 
concerns with that legislation.  Indeed, I asked the Government 
of Alberta to amend bill 11, and I expressed the view that while 
on its face bill 11 does not contravene the Canada Health Act, by 
allowing private for profit facilities to both provide insured 
services and to charge fees for enhanced services bill 11 creates 
circumstances which could be used to contravene the principle of 
accessibility in the Canada Health Act.  That is the real 
concern. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we combine that with the fact that the policy of the 
Alberta government contemplates overnight stays in private for 
profit facilities, which takes private for profit further than it 
has so far gone in the country, we asked the Government of 
Alberta to amend its legislation.  It did not.  As a result, one 
week ago today, in a ministerial statement, speaking on behalf of 
the Prime Minister and this government, I said in the House that 
because Alberta has gone ahead with this legislation, which we 
thought was ill-advised, we would do the following things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we will deem these private for profit facilities, as they 
are called in bill 11, hospitals within the meaning of that term 
in the Canada Health Act.  The practical consequence of that is 
that charging anyone for any part of an insured service will be 
considered a violation of the Canada Health Act and will attract 
the penalties provided for in that statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in response to the concern expressed by the auditor 
general last year that Health Canada does not have the resources 
to monitor and enforce the act, we are increasing considerably 
the capacity of Health Canada to do just that, and, as we have 
watched in the past, we will watch carefully to see if these 
private for profit hospitals imperil the principle of 
accessibility, contravening the Canada Health Act.  If they do, 
as we have done in the past, we will act.  We will exercise the 
power of the Government of Canada under the Canada Health Act and 
do what is necessary to protect medicare. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, we have the will and the means to ensure that the 
Canada Health Act is respected.  We are going to ensure that 
the principles set out in the act are respected in Alberta and 
elsewhere in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be perfectly clear: this government would not like to 
merely to play the role of referee.  We would much prefer to 
work in partnership with our provincial colleagues. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say a few words in closing about medicare renewal.  Like 
almost every other developed country in the world, Canada is 
going through the process of improving and adapting its health 
care system to meet the pressures of our current time:  an aging 
population, the increased cost of drugs and technology, and 
changes in the way in which medical services are delivered on the 
ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an enormous advantage in this country because we have 
the best health care system in the world.  Our challenge, indeed 
our duty, is to renew medicare in a way that is consistent with 
our principles and to overcome the problems of the shortages, the 
waiting lists, while staying true to our basic principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the federal role of enforcer which we are discussing today 
is crucial, simply enforcing the rules is not by itself 
sufficient to achieve the medicare renewal that must be 
undertaken.  It will require much more.  It will require more 
federal money for health care transferred to the provinces.  It 
will require hard work with the provinces to develop common goals 
and priorities to know that additional money is going to support 
a plan that will produce better health care for Canadians.  It 
will require our listening to the health care workers, the 
doctors, the nurses and others, so that they are involved and a 
part of the process, and not excluded.  It will involve hearing 
the public, its concerns and its priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have started a process with my provincial partners toward 
medicare renewal.  I have invited them to come to the table with 
me and talk about a plan for this purpose.  It is to that process 
and that purpose that I am unconditionally committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will succeed.  We must succeed.  Canadians expect and deserve 
no less. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me 
say first that I could not agree more with the Minister of Health 
when he says that Canadians want this government and this 
minister to be more than just an arbiter of disputes and more 
than just an enforcer when provincial governments violate the 
principles of the Canada Health Act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1100"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then goes on in his usual way to talk about the importance of 
partnership.  There is no government in the history of this 
country, since the introduction of the first steps of universal, 
not for profit health care, that has done more damage to the 
health care partnership than this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What clearer indication could there be than provincial 
governments of all political stripes from coast to coast to coast 
having said that if this government is sincere about wanting to 
restore the partnership, then it has to recognize that it cannot 
even claim the mantle of partnership when the federal government 
has reduced its contribution to health care funding from 50% to 
below 14%, and in some provinces, as low as 11%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have already spoken.  The minister, in his pious list 
of things that this government must do, said that we must listen 
to Canadians.  Canadians have said that they want universal, not 
for profit, single tier health care protected and they want it 
protected it now.  They want the federal government to recommit 
to the partnership, to rescind, to get rid of the duplicitous 12 
point deal that it entered into secretly with Alberta, which 
opened the way for bill 11, and to enforce the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that when a government brings in a bill, such as bill 
11, which so clearly and deliberately threatens the universality 
and the most important access principles of the Canada Health 
Act, then this government must take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former minister of health, Monique Bégin, when there was an 
explosion of extra billing of user fees, did not hesitate to 
bring in legislative measures, and we did not hesitate to support 
her in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister think that an American solution is what 
Canadians want, if has he listened to them, when it is a Canadian 
health crisis created by the actions of this federal Liberal 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>   Mr. Speaker, whatever sympathy the 
member might inspire by going generally in the right direction on 
values, she forfeits through her overstatement and 
misunderstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the member to suggest that enforcement means amending the 
act.  I take the member to insist that taking action means 
introducing a bill to change the Canada Health Act.  She is 
wrong.  Taking action, protecting medicare and standing up for 
the principles means doing exactly what we have undertaken to do, 
which is to watch what is happening on the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those private for profit hospitals use the power to charge 
for enhanced services at the same time as insured services in 
order to restrict access only to those with the cash or give 
preferred access to those willing to pay more, that will be a 
contravention of the act and we will act.  We have the power, the 
political will and the mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the New Democratic Party has just suggested that 
the only kind of action she thinks is appropriate is to amend the 
Canada Health Act.  There is no need to amend the Canada Health 
Act.  The principles, the purpose and the powers are already 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House, this member and Canadians have the solemn 
undertaking of this minister, the Prime Minister and this 
government that, if necessary, we will use that power to protect 
those principles not only in Alberta but throughout this land. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will try the same question that I asked of the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In B.C. contracting out for private facilities is being 
attempted to reduce the waiting lines on some minor surgery and 
cataract surgery.  Does this minister have a problem with the NDP 
government in B.C. doing that, yes or no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am familiar with that 
example.  The member for Macleod will discover, if he looks a 
little more closely, that under those circumstances they are not 
permitted to charge for enhanced services at the same time that 
they are charging for insured services.  They do not talk about 
overnight stays.  The policy is not to create private for profit 
hospitals. 
There is room for innovation in Canadian medicare but there is a 
line that should not be crossed.  Imperilling the principles of 
the Canada Health Act is something that ought not to be 
encouraged.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is described in B.C. is not what bill 11 has provided for. 
Bill 11 expressly says that the private for profit facilities can 
charge for the enhanced services as well as the insured services. 
That is the crucial distinction between Alberta and the example 
that the Canadian Alliance is referring to in British Columbia. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to speak to the opposition motion regarding 
Alberta's bill 11.  This is a very important topic and of concern 
to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, I must say that on May 5 the Alberta legislature 
passed bill 11.  The bill will create the regulatory framework 
for contracting services to private for profit facilities.  The 
federal health minister has relayed his concerns about this bill. 
Prior to the passage of the bill, and contrary to the remarks 
made by the opposition, time and time again the minister has 
voiced his concerns about the bill.  He has said that the federal 
government was really concerned about some of the views 
expressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to ensuring that our health care 
system will not be put in jeopardy.  We wish to make sure that 
the opportunity exists to detail these concerns and commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some disturbing trends happening with medicare.  I 
share the views of my fellow Canadians about what is happening in 
Alberta.  These trends do not speak to the values of Canadians. 
Indeed, we need to know how people are looking at medicare.  On 
one hand, Alberta will have the medically necessary services.  On 
the other hand, it will also provide enhanced medical services. I 
believe that is a contradiction.  Time and time again when we 
have compared services provided by the private sector, double 
billings have occurred and it has not worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our medicare system is one of the best in the world.  Like many 
medicare systems, things are changing.  MRIs and various other 
things are causing this change.  Adopting new technology does not 
mean that Canada should end up with a two tier medical system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a policy statement in November 1999, the Alberta government 
announced its intention to have private delivery of some surgical 
services.  At the same time, the federal health minister raised 
some important issues related to the sustainability and integrity 
of the public health care system, including the consistency of 
the proposed measures with the spirit and intent of the Canada 
Health Act.  He conveyed these views publicly  not just in one 
province but across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November we asked how private for profit delivery of health 
services would reduce waiting lines for services in a way that 
would contain costs and maintain quality, but these questions 
were not answered.  On the contrary, based on the opinions of 
experts, and actual experience in Alberta, the waiting period for 
services had increased.  In areas where private for profit 
clinics were used, these lists exceeded those of the public 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of costs, our minister asked if we could expect 
private for profit hospitals to save money.  Would they be more 
cost effective?  Again, the Alberta Consumers Association of 
Canada found that a shift in cataract surgery from the public 
sector to the private sector resulted in increased costs for 
consumers not only in the actual cost of the operation, but in 
administrative costs as well as transaction costs.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister asked how pressure from private investors to 
de-insure more services, so services can be charged for privately 
and their profits will balloon, would be addressed. He also asked 
how pressure from private investors to purchase medical goods or 
services patients do not require would be addressed.  He asked 
how the tendering process for contracting would be open and 
transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was passed.  It contains a commitment to preserve the 
principles of the Canada Health Act as the foundation of the 
health system in Alberta.  However, the sincerity of this 
commitment is suspect given that the question is still 
outstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year the Prime Minister and the Alberta premier 
asked all Canadian health ministers to compare the bill to 
similar provincial legislation.  There are important differences 
in the way Alberta intends to proceed.  In particular, the sale 
of enhanced or extra services in combination with medical goods 
and services insured in the public system, unlike in other 
provinces, represents a serious concern in relation to the 
principles of accessibility in the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How serious is this?  The day the bill was passed, the 
Saskatchewan premier, Mr. Roy Romanow, answered.  He said  “When 
we released our legislation our press release was entitled a bill 
to prevent two tiered health care”.  He continued “We are at 
odds with bill 11 in Alberta”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in Alberta the legislation bans queue-jumping, where 
supposedly people who could afford to pay for these enhanced 
services get quicker access to insured services but concerns 
remain about how this ban will be monitored and reported on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister respectfully suggested that the bill be 
amended to prevent this, as does the legislation in Ontario and 
Saskatchewan, but it was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another key concern, specifically and clearly expressed by our 
government, relates to private for profit facilities 
accommodating overnight stays for patients.  This too represents 
another important difference between the approach of the Alberta 
government, going far beyond what is in place in other provinces. 
The health minister suggested that the bill be changed to 
prohibit services involving overnight stays until the full 
implications for Canada's health care system are understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 7 the health minister put the Alberta government on 
notice that these types of facilities that would be regulated 
under this legislation would be considered hospitals under the 
Canada Health Act.  This means that all hospital services 
provided by these facilities must be fully insured and, like 
hospitals, these facilities are prohibited from selling any 
insured service to an insured person on a private basis.  As the 
federal health minister said “This is in keeping with the 
fundamental principle of our single tiered health care system, 
care based on need not on the ability to pay”, or the size of 
their pocket book or credit card. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the day after bill 11 was passed, the federal health minister 
reiterated these concerns noting how the Alberta government did 
not respond to any of his recommendations.  He said “Bill 11 is 
not the direction in which we should be heading to strengthen our 
publicly funded health care system.  We have grave reservations 
about investing public funds in private-for-profit facilities”. 
He also announced that the federal government would be 
strengthening its capacity to detect violations under the act, 
should they occur.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We will act.  The strengthening means that the minister has now 
committed some $5.5 million to improve administration of the 
Canada Health Act.  With additional staff distributed across the 
country our health care monitoring capabilities will be enhanced 
and will ensure compliance with the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say categorically that the health care system reflects 
one of the basic values of Canadians.  I am not animated too 
often in the House, but I will be right behind the minister to 
make sure that there is not a two tier system.  Let us imagine 
for a minute that somebody thinks he or she could make money from 
somebody who is ill.  I rest my case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be monitoring the legislation.  The government is 
committed to make sure that Canadians get the care they desire, 
that it is not two tiered, and that it is not based on someone's 
pocketbook.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will ask the hon. member a question which I had hoped to ask the 
health minister.  I am sure he can answer it.  Does the 
government have in its possession a legal opinion concerning 
Alberta's bill 11 and the Canada Health Act?  If so, will it 
table that document for the benefit of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not aware that the 
government has any such document.  If the minister has that 
opinion, I am sure that based on the usual conditions of whatever 
privacy laws are involved he will share it with the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the opportunity to speak to health care in broad 
terms and Alberta's bill 11 in more specific terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the NDP has actually called for 
amendments to the Canada Health Act.  It does that with a view to 
strengthening the Canada Health Act, in its opinion.  My idea of 
going down that road would be to make the Canada Health Act more 
rigid, and I would not do so.  I would like to make the Canada 
Health Act more innovative and allow some changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk briefly about the Canada Health Act and how it is 
doing, a subject that is not often addressed in the House.  I 
should like to talk first about portability, one of the big 
principles of the Canada Health Act.  How are we doing with 
portability? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the people of Quebec are concerned, each Quebec 
patient who goes to another province has difficulty with 
services, because the Province of Quebec does not pay full 
compensation for services provided in the other provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Portability in this instance is being broken every day.  The 
health minister sits here saying that he is the enforcer of the 
Canada Health Act.  My comment is that it is complete nonsense 
because portability is being broken.  He knows it, and he does 
nothing about portability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are we doing with accessibility in the Canada Health Act? It 
is pretty straightforward.  We just have to look at the waiting 
lines in Canada.  They are now being monitored by the government. 
A year ago it set up a monitoring system to see how we were doing 
with the waiting lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wait with great interest to see what that monitoring shows. 
There are monitors that have been doing this for almost 10 years 
now.  I monitored it as a physician in my own practice.  When I 
set up my practice in 1970 and I closed it in 1993 I know my 
patients were waiting longer for services.  On accessibility we 
are doing very poorly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comprehensiveness is another big principle of the Canada Health 
Act.  How are we doing with comprehensiveness? 
I listened to members opposite say that delisting is going on. 
That is absolutely true.  More and more procedures are being 
taken off the provincial lists of what is covered and what is not 
covered by health care.  Comprehensiveness is also at risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One part of the Canada Health Act is doing wonderfully well, and 
that is public administration.  There is a monopoly in health 
care in Canada which many of us believe is serving the Canadian 
public poorly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Medicare is in stress.  This is not unique to Canada, but there 
are specific things going on in Canada which put our medicare 
system even more at stress.  I have mentioned the waiting lines. 
I have not mentioned the brain drain of some of our most 
experienced nurses, lab technicians and physicians who are 
leaving the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big reasons for it is that we are falling behind in 
technology.  A well trained nurse who works in a critical care 
unit and does not have the most modern facilities says “I am 
doing a bad job.  I learned in school how to do a better job. 
Just across the line in Boston they have better equipment.  I 
will go there and serve my patients better”. I hear people say 
that it is only about income.  It is not.  There is an income 
difference.  There is a tax difference.  There is also a 
technology difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of a young woman who told me the other day that 
she was having trouble getting pregnant.  She went to her 
physician in Ottawa who said that at one time there was no 
problem because there were a couple of world experts in 
obstetrics in Ottawa.  He wanted to send her to them but they had 
both left.  One of them is in Boston and the other is in Florida. 
He said she would have to wait a little while until we get 
another world renowned expert in obstetrics for those who are 
having trouble getting pregnant.  That was in Ottawa, and that is 
taking place in every city in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned technology.  There are ways to measure it.  We have 
dropped from the top three in technology in 1993 in the OECD 
countries to being number twenty-three.  Something happened in 
1993.  Most people who watch politics will know that there was a 
new government elected at that point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak specifically to bill 11, what it means and what I 
think it offers to Canadians.  I am not certain that bill 11 is 
the answer for waiting lists, but the Klein government has 
plainly said that it wants to try a specific mechanism to reduce 
the waiting lines in that province.  Waiting lines are 
measurable. It is not that tough.  It also said if there were 
complications in terms of minor procedures that it would allow 
people to stay overnight in private facilities which exist in 
Alberta and in every other province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who stand back and say that we should not talk about 
private for profit facilities, every abortion clinic in the 
country, every Morgentaler clinic, is a private for profit 
clinic.  I know that my colleagues in other parties recognize 
this but will not talk about it.  They will not talk about the 
cosmetic surgery clinics that are totally private and are doing 
things that are outside medicare because they are not covered by 
the system.  They will not talk about private facilities that are 
doing minor procedures like vasectomies outside hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there some advantage to those facilities?  There are some 
potential problems recognized but there are some advantages.  The 
cost per day to the taxpayers for a major hospital with an 
emergency, critical care and administration is about $1,500.  A 
private freestanding facility with very little administrative 
cost, with all the cost being borne by the people who are 
investors in that clinic, some of whom might well be nurses or 
lab techs, has relatively low costs which average somewhere 
around $150 per day in terms of overall cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could we take a minor procedure like a tonsillectomy from a 
major hospital costing $1,500 a day and do it in a facility 
costing $150 a day?  Could we free up some spaces in that $1,500 
a day facility for the bigger procedures that are required to 
happen there, the major surgery, the major problems? 
There is some advantage to moving such procedures out of the big 
facility and into a smaller one.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill 11, according to the health minister's own words, does not 
tread on the Canada Health Act.  However he says that it might. 
Here we are talking about motivation.  He said that there was a 
threat of selling uninsured services while offering insured 
services.  He said to me today that was not done in any other 
facility or province.  I want to say that is categorically and 
demonstrably false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister will listen to this example.  In every 
emergency department in the country that provides insured 
services an individual with a broken arm can obtain a cast.  The 
cast is covered by health care.  However, if the individual wants 
to upgrade the cast to a fibreglass one he or she will pay.  It 
is the individual's decision.  It is a little lighter.  It is 
waterproof.  It allows significant mobility in some cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That upgraded service, that enhanced service that is not covered 
by medicare, is being provided in a facility which provides 
insured services.  The minister says that it is not the same.  I 
beg to differ.  Is it not for profit?  Out of the pocket comes 
the $10 for the fibreglass cast.  That is an uninsured service 
being provided by an insured facility.  The minister can say 
anything he wants.  It is just flat out provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go to bill 11.  I have a copy of it.  I believe in going 
to the source.  As I said, this is Alberta's mechanism to try to 
reduce waiting lines for surgery.  Will it be successful?  I am 
not sure but I am willing to give them a chance to prove that it 
will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of enhanced services bill 11 says that enhanced 
medical goods and services are upgrades that are not medically 
necessary, like foldable lenses for cataract surgery.  A person 
might choose those upgrades.  A sensible patient could say that a 
foldable lens has some advantages.  It is not covered under 
medicare, so he or she will have to pay for it.  The information 
must be explained to the person in writing.  It cannot be nudge, 
nudge, wink, wink, we cannot provide the lens wanted but only the 
enhanced lens.  The information must be provided in writing with 
an outline of the costs and advantages.  Patients then have an 
opportunity to review it and change their minds as long as they 
have not received the service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is are big fines of $10,000 for the offence of not 
providing the information and $20,000 for every offence 
thereafter. This is legalistic stuff.  I think the health 
minister would like it.  It is important to note that if the 
upgraded product or service is all that is available, in other 
words if the foldable lens is all that is available, it cannot be 
charged outside medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gets away from the legitimate concern that the facility 
might say that it has no lenses other than foldable lenses.  If 
foldable lenses are all that is available, it cannot charge for 
them.  Those are responses to legitimate concerns.  I admit the 
concerns are legitimate because it would break the principles of 
the public health care system if those services were offered in 
an inappropriate way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strayed from my NDP colleagues and the health minister on bill 
11.  Will it work?  This is Alberta's opportunity to prove 
whether or not it will work.  Would I hire more health police to 
look after it?  There are health police in Alberta.  There are 
patients in every hospital in Alberta in waiting lines. They will 
decide whether to step out of a waiting line and go to an 
overnight facility to receive services.  If it were my mom, I 
might take her in my car and try to get her out of the waiting 
line.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we let Albertans decide this?  If it does not work, what 
will happen?  Bye-bye bill 11, maybe bye-bye Klein.  I think 
Albertans will turf Klein out if it is an inappropriate bill. We 
do not need health police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That would never go down.  Elect the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  My colleague across the way said to elect 
Liberals.  Maybe that would happen if bill 11 is inappropriate. 
But do we need an all-seeing omnipotent health minister from 
Ottawa to come along and say he does not think the motive behind 
the bill is good?  Not in my books we do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have forever, but I will talk about a couple of other 
innovations which I think are worth considering. These are for 
public consumption, to reject, think about, or not. This is not 
alliance policy. These are my thoughts on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about thinking of a completely different way of delivering 
the money to individuals in Canada for health care services? 
What about a medisave account?  I would equate this to an 
insurance policy on a car. We do not insure our cars for oil 
changes.  We insure them for major catastrophes like an awful 
crash that would break us if it happened.  We insure for the 
repair bills on a major issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if we insured for catastrophic things in Canada?  Instead 
of giving money to the governments to look after everything, what 
if we gave $100 to each patient in a medisave account?  This 
would be for the regular run of the mill preventive things, 
regular checkups, a visit to the emergency room for suturing and 
whatnot.  It would be the patient's responsibility.  That first 
$100, which is a very arbitrary figure, would be the patient's 
responsibility.  The person would not spend it if he or she did 
not need it.  The government would allow the person to put those 
funds into retirement, but the person would be able to keep those 
funds in a medisave account for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would that do?  That would make people think about what 
medical procedures cost in this country.  Many do not know. Many 
do not know what an ultrasound for a newborn baby is worth today 
because they never ever get a bill for it.  It is free, paid for 
by the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would put a person in a position where, if they had had a 
cardiogram a year ago and had paid for it out of their medisave 
account, and they were told during their annual physical they 
needed a cardiogram again, they might ask whether they really did 
need it because it would eat up their medisave money.  There 
would be a discussion as to whether or not that would be useful. 
I believe there is some degree of personal responsibility when it 
comes to the funding for our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the medisave account idea.  It was a very brief 
overview and I admit not very thorough, but it is an idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a second idea.  The threat of suit in Canada for nurses 
and doctors is a major cost driver.  Somebody who comes into the 
office with a headache is often given procedures that are not 
really the best for looking after a headache. They are procedures 
that are designed to prevent a suit, prevent medical legal action 
if the individual ends up having more than a simple headache, for 
example a tumour. The medical legal system in this country is 
driving costs up. It is becoming more and more like the U.S. in 
terms of litigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my first speech in the House many years ago I asked the 
health minister to address the issue of medical jurisprudence.  I 
thought as a lawyer he would grab on to that. Of course, it would 
mean fewer lawyers, so maybe I understand now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What principles do I think should guide the federal government 
on health care?  First, I value our public system.  I have 
practised in it and I know that it is a valuable system.  But I 
think we have gone astray when we talk about American style two 
tier, because on this issue it is literally the wrong debate. 
Medicare is being used in most countries in the world.  It is not 
being used in the U.S.  Taxpayer funded medicare is not there.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we compare ourselves, let us compare ourselves to similar 
medicare systems such as those in Europe, Asia or Scandinavia. 
Countries there have chosen some safety valves in addition to 
taxpayer funded medicare.  Medicare is not falling apart.  It is 
not going down the tubes.  Ours would not either if we looked at 
some of those innovations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big principle is that we should remember the patient.  Let 
us put the patient first.  Let us stop putting the system first. 
If we did that in our deliberations here in Ottawa and across 
Canada, we would be much farther ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a role as a paymaster.  It is so 
straightforward that the funding should be predictable. It should 
be obvious that it is going to medicare and it should be growing 
with our population growth.  Our aging population is another 
issue.  As a paymaster the federal government has a very specific 
role to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister said he would play the role if the provinces 
played by his rules.  I disagree with that. The current approach 
of threatening the provinces if they do not follow the health 
minister's rules to bring in health police to enhance the number 
of people wandering around the country trying to find breaks to 
the Canada Health Act, deeming private clinics as hospitals, have 
we ever heard a more legalistic view?  Deeming.  He is going to 
deem a private clinic as a hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say again that if we forget about imperilling the system and 
instead look at the perils to the patient, we will be better off.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma—Manitoulin, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's speech. While he covered 
a lot of territory, he confused me a bit. The member is a 
physician and has worked in the system.  He is probably aware 
more than most of us in the House of the daily difficulties faced 
not only by practitioners such as himself but by those who depend 
on the system for their health needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member skated around some of the more important fundamental 
issues.  In using that reference, I would like to comment that he 
is a pretty good hockey player.  We on this side appreciated the 
chance to play against that side last night.  He has shown marked 
improvement from the first time we had the experience a few years 
ago.  I commend him in that regard.  But skating around important 
issues such as health care is another matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like others in the House, I read a fairly thorough report in one 
of the national papers which reported on the Australian 
experience with what in no other way could be described as a two 
tier health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member and his fellow reform-alliance members are in the 
midst of a leadership race.  I cannot claim to know exactly what 
position on two tier health care each of the candidates has.  The 
member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca has made it clear that he 
supports a two tier system.  I would suspect that another 
candidate, the treasurer of Alberta who is on leave from that 
position, obviously supports bill 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not an expert on the health system except for having to 
visit the doctor from time to time.  I wonder if the member could 
tell us where he stands with regard to a two tier system where 
those with the resources can have speedier access to certain 
procedures compared to those who depend on a publicly funded 
system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in reference to skating, I 
think he checked me into the boards and it was not very nice at 
all.  I meant that as a joke, it is not true at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of a two tier system, personally I reject two tier 
medicine.  My colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca who is also 
a physician has chosen that as his solution.  That is a personal 
solution.  That is not the alliance position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already suggested the sort of thing I think would be 
useful to innovate in health care.  We need to have more 
responsibility for knowing what the costs are and have a reason 
to husband the resources. Let me take this opportunity to put 
forward another suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every patient for every service in Canada should get a bill that 
shows the date for the service, what the service was and what the 
cost was and they should have to sign it.  They would not pay a 
nickel for that bill, but they would simply sign it to say that 
they received it.  That would do two things.  It would let them 
know what the procedure cost and it would also prevent extra 
billing or padded billing by physicians.  Some physicians put in 
bills that are not really appropriate.  My colleagues do not like 
me to say that, but it is accurate and true.  This would be a 
mechanism for bringing some of the responsibility back to the 
individual patient.  There is none today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague across the way said that I skated around.  I hope 
that is as direct and forceful a way of saying what I believe 
should be some of the changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am willing to listen to others.  Would the Minister of Health 
say the same thing?  I wish he would. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to ask a question.  I know there is 
probably not much time given the hockey references across the 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Macleod is a physician.  He is basically 
saying he is not sure about Bill 11, but let us try it and give 
it a chance.  His arguments are that in one of these new surgical 
facilities it might be $500 a day versus the $1,500 that it would 
cost to run the health care system in a major hospital. Let me 
ask the doctor a hypothetical question. What happens at one of 
these facilities when there is a complication in the surgery? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Macleod mentioned tonsillectomies.  We have all 
heard horror stories about tonsillectomies.  It is normally a 
minor procedure, but there can be serious problems from time to 
time.  What happens at that point?  Presumably the difference of 
$1,000 a day between the surgical facility and the major hospital 
is that the surgical facility does not have all the bells and 
whistles that the major hospital has.  That sick person now needs 
intensive care and has to be rushed to the major hospital.  What 
happens at that point?  Do we have queue jumping?  Is the person 
in the other system who has been slated for that bed available at 
the Edmonton hospital all of a sudden bypassed because somebody 
coming out of the private facility is in intensive care and needs 
help in a hurry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the problem a lot of people have with this notion.  I 
would appreciate the hon. member's response to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what a refreshing change to 
actually have a non-attack.  That is a very legitimate question 
and one which I appreciate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I did tonsillectomies on my own in a public facility, I 
know that the complication rate is somewhere around 1%.  Of 100 
tonsillectomies, one of them will bleed and require the trip to 
the major facility the member talks about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would I then do the 100 in the $1,000 or $1,500 a day facility? 
Not a chance.  I would do the 100 in the $150 a day facility and 
for the complication would go to the big major public facility. 
Surely the math is not tough to figure out. They are both being 
covered by public funds.  They are not being covered by private 
funds because a tonsillectomy is an insured service under 
medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a very legitimate concern if there were 99 coming 
from the one facility and plugging up the major facility.  Surely 
the 99 that would be done outside the major hospital would open 
up beds that are not currently opened up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for what I consider to be a 
constructive, eyeball to eyeball comment.  It is refreshing and a 
treat to get.

high respect for the hon. member for Macleod as a professional. 
I am glad to hear that the hon. member, as a professional, is not 
in favour of a two tier system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early in his speech he mentioned brain drain, but I am not sure 
if the hon. member is aware of brain gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Waterloo region there are probably close to 40 medical, 
highly qualified and experienced doctors from all over the world. 
As he knows, there is a quota in Ontario.  I believe that there 
are quotas all over the country.  Would the hon. member encourage 
the provincial ministers to leave those quotas and to give those 
opportunities to newcomers to practise medicine in the country, as 
well as nurses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
that sensible question.  The issue of brain drain could not be 
made more clear than to recognize that one-third of the current 
medical graduates from our 16 medical schools in Canada do not 
set up practice in Canada.  They leave this country and never set 
up practice.  That is a tragedy.  We, as taxpayers, have a lot to 
say in terms of their training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of foreign graduates and other individuals, some of 
them are driving taxis while their medical credentials are left 
unused.  That is another tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a closed shop mentality in our country.  We have an idea 
that the only training that is good is North American training, 
and that is not accurate.  Those individuals should be able to 
pass an examination.  I would open my arms and my heart to their 
experience, their thoughts, their ideas and their talents.  Many 
of them go to far-flung spots to practise in areas that have 
difficulty getting practitioners.  They will go anywhere to 
practise their skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad thing is that governments bought the idea that 
physicians were driving health care costs and if we restricted 
the number of physicians we would drive down costs.  It would be 
wrong for me to talk so much about physicians.  There is a 
shortage of nurses now due to the same issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very sensible suggestion and I appreciate the hon.

by immediately amending the Canada Health Act to provide that 
provinces be financially penalized if they allow public funds to 
be used for the provision of insured services by private, 
for-profit hospitals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to the members of the House that there is a trap in 
this motion.  First, and I say this right off, our party 
believes that health care must be the most important of all 
public responsibilities.  We believe in a system of universal, 
accessible and public health care for our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Happily—and I will have the opportunity to return to this—the 
Government of Quebec is miles away from considering 
privatization, which of course does not prevent some of our 
fellow citizens from having private health insurance plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trap in the motion by the NDP lies in its inviting the 
government to intervene in the way the provinces organize health 
care.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Favourable as we on this side of the House may be—the Bloc 
Quebecois is, as a party, highly favourable to this idea and 
believes without any shadow of a doubt in the appropriateness of 
using public funds to put in place a health system that must 
also be public—we nevertheless believe that the way the provinces 
organize their use of the health system does not concern the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the Canada Health Act in fact constitutes an 
overstepping of boundaries, because according to the 
Constitution of 1867 and its revision of 1982, there are just 
two areas of the health sector in which the federal government 
is concerned. 
These are the health of aboriginal people and of military 
personnel.  Perhaps there might be a third, the whole matter of 
epidemics and quarantine.  The rest of the health system does 
not concern the federal government.  Nevertheless, over the 
years, the federal government has come to adopt a Canada Health 
Act, which proposes five principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not opposed to those five principles, but we do believe 
that their implementation must be provincial.  What are these 
principles? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 8 of the act is, of course, where it is stated that the 
health insurance system must be administered and operated on a 
non-profit basis by a public authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the principle of comprehensiveness, which 
provides, under the terms of section 9, that the plan must cover 
all the services provided by hospitals, medical practitioners or 
dentists and, where permitted, services provided by other health 
care practitioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third principle is universality.  Section 10 provides that 
100% of the insured persons of a province are entitled to the 
insured health services provided for by the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the principle of portability, and section 11 
provides that a person leaving their province must also be 
eligible for coverage under the health care system of the 
province they move to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, section 12 provides for accessibility.  This refers to 
the ability of our fellow citizens to receive treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important distinction has to be made: we are not addressing 
the right question when we say that provinces tempted to 
privatize should be penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat once again that we do not believe in privatizing the 
health care system.  Those of you who have doubts as to the 
merits of a public health care system need only look to the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There, last year—so this is recent—53% of Americans' spending on 
health care was private.  With this high percentage of use of 
the private system, we must remember that 16% of Americans are 
excluded from health care systems and have no form of protection. 
This means 44 million people who, as we are speaking, are 
excluded, because they do not have the protection that is often 
associated with the workplace and must therefore pay when they 
go to a hospital, or when they require health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real debate that we must have in this House is the one that 
we were reminded of by the premiers. The federal government has 
money. Let us not forget that the budget surpluses for the 
coming years have been estimated at around $95 billion. Yet, the 
federal government backed out of its responsibilities toward the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canada Assistance Plan and medicare were created, the 
federal government pledged, as with the other major joint 
programs that existed at the time, to pay 50% of the costs of 
health care services, just like it had pledged to pay 50% of the 
costs of post-secondary education.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, as we speak, what is the federal government's contribution 
to health care services? How much money does it give to the 
provinces? In Quebec, for example, for each dollar spent on 
health by the provincial government, the federal government 
invests 12 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear: it takes a lot of nerve on the part of the 
Minister of Health to rise in the House and, with his smooth 
voice, tell us that the federal government cares about health 
services in this country. If the federal government cares about 
health services, there is a solution. Its only option is to 
restore transfer payments to their 1994-95 level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing partisan about asking that transfer payments be 
restored to their 1994-95 level, when it is what all the premiers 
did.  The most vocal was Newfoundland's premier, Brian Tobin, a 
former cabinet minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is what the Progressive Conservative premier of New Brunswick 
did; it is what the premier of Nova Scotia did; and it is what 
the premier of Ontario did.  All the premiers called on the 
federal government to restore transfer payments to their 1994-95 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We submit to the NDP that the real issue here is transfer 
payments.  Why is this important?  We know very well that there 
is not one health care system in Canada but several, and that 
health care is first and foremost a provincial jurisdiction. 
All the provinces must cope with new realities affecting how 
they must deliver health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first reality that should be pointed out to the House is 
that people are living increasingly longer.  We no longer talk 
about the elderly but about the very elderly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the parliamentarians here pay a bit of attention to their 
health, to the determinants of health, if they eat well, do not 
smoke or drink too much, and take part in a moderate amount of 
physical activity, they stand a chance of living to be 79, in 
the case of men, and 81, in the case of women.  This means that 
people are living longer and longer.  But that means pressure on 
the various components of the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that is happening in Quebec, in particular, is 
that the population is aging.  It will take less time for a 
significant proportion of our fellow Quebecers to reach age 65 
than will be the case in other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 35 years, 25% of the population of Quebec will be over 65.  I 
say this to the pages, who will take our place, especially those 
who come from Quebec.  In 35 years, in Quebec, there will be 
more people aged 65 and over than there will be aged 15 and 
under. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has all sorts of ramifications in social terms.  It will 
significantly affect our ability as taxpayers to provide public 
services.  It is mostly the people in the labour force who pay 
for public services.  There will be pressure on the system as 
well in the provision of services.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only will people live longer, but they will be wanting very 
specific services.  They will also want to remain in their 
natural surroundings longer, which will mean home care.  There 
are pressures in demographic terms, but also in terms of 
specialities.  I will give a few examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people live increasingly longer, when the population is 
aging, it means people are more likely to end up in hospital 
emergency rooms.  I have a few statistics on this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as Quebec's emergency departments are concerned, in 
1998-99, in other words one year ago, there were 50,000 more 
patients in emergency department beds than the figure for 
1994-95.  Of that number, 56% were over the age of 75.  More and 
more people are going to emergency departments and half of them 
are aged 75 or more.  This means that system administrators need 
to plan for additional care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking the sector of radiation oncology, which has to do with 
the treatment of cancers, the demand is increasing, particularly 
for people aged 50 and over.  The baby boomers, born between the 
second world war and 1966 or 1967, have reached the age to 
require such services.  There is a 3% increase in cancer cases 
every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for cardiology, demand for services is increasing, 
particularly in the 50-plus age group.  Once again, health 
determinants are important. 
The better a person eats, the more physically active he is, the 
less he smokes or drinks, the better his chances of not having 
heart problems.  There is an undeniable statistical correlation 
between lifestyle and the probability of using public health 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community has only recently become aware of this connection. 
A whole generation of us grew up with a positive picture of 
smoking.  It was connected with sex appeal.  We can all remember 
the images televised until very recently of attractive young 
girls with their cigarettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me digress for a moment to say that, five years ago, 29% of 
Canadians aged 15 and over smoked daily and were addicted to 
tobacco. Today, that percentage is 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that in five years it will be down to 20%. However, the 
heaviest smokers are found among young people and in Quebec in 
particular, with 38% of young Quebecers being smokers, compared 
to 23% of young British Columbians. As a society, we must make 
sure that all the information is available to young people so 
that they never start to smoke.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a coincidence that, for years, tobacco companies 
targeted that clientele. Just remember that picture of a race 
car driver. Mr. Speaker, you know what I am talking about, 
because you were a young man once, some years ago. I do not dare 
say many years ago, because I know that you are a very dynamic 
person, you are really very alert physically. I had the 
opportunity to go up some stairs with you and you were not even 
out of breath. You have a good cardiovascular system. You could 
work a little on your muscle mass, but I know that your days are 
very full. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this to say that it was just recently that our society 
realized the importance of having winning conditions, from a 
health point of view, to be in good shape. Until very recently, 
tobacco companies were looking for young consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can explain why. If we conducted a survey among 
parliamentarians, we would see that 95% of smokers do not change 
brands of cigarettes. The only opportunity for tobacco 
manufacturers to increase their share of the market is to reach 
young people. These new entrants on the market will, of course, 
adopt new brands of cigarettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I support any measure suggested by either 
government—Quebec has done a lot in that area—to tell people that 
tobacco is the primary cause of avoidable deaths in Canada. 
Every year, 45,000 people die as a result of smoking and this 
could be avoided if we made it socially unacceptable to start in 
the first place, and helped people stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying that there are two ways to end the health 
debate in the House.  The first is to restore transfer payments 
to their 1994-95 level.  Quebec alone is out $6.5 billion, or $1.2 
billion annually, of which $500 million would go to health and 
another $500 million to income security and post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Quebec had 500 million additional health dollars, it would 
not be tempted to consider privatization.  It is not tempted to 
consider privatization but let us not be hypocritical. 
The government cannot be surprised that some provinces are 
considering privatization when it is the reason they are 
cash-strapped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as I am the Bloc Quebecois health critic, I will never 
stop calling on the government to restore transfer payments. 
The government has literally robbed the provinces; it has 
slashed their budgets and misappropriated funds.  We cannot sit 
still for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do I have the time to point out to the House what the Quebec 
government could do with the 500 additional millions that are 
its due?  That is almost one-quarter of the budget of all 
Montreal's hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying that I hope government members will be 
extremely vigilant and bring pressure to bear on the government 
so that it will restore transfer payments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and 
Youth), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my hon. 
colleague for his comments.  I note that I too have a very great 
concern, as the Secretary of State for Children and Youth, and 
being an aboriginal woman, about the rate of consumption of 
tobacco products by different sectors of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, it should be noted that Quebec has a 30% higher 
intake of tobacco products than the rest of the country.  It is 
an extremely huge problem.  Inuit women also have a very high 
rate of lung cancer and very high intake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a pervasive influence on young people across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent months it has been stated that Quebec has $500 million 
in a bank account in Ontario.  Would it not be wise or at least 
appropriate for it to make use of that money for such purposes? 
Would that not make sense?  I am sure that all Canadians watching 
us today would want to know how we could tolerate this situation, 
with that surplus or money not being used for these means.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the explanation the member would give, not 
to me but to Canadians on this issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would expect our hon. colleague, 
with the responsibilities that she has, to be a little better 
informed and a little less of a grandstander. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's finance minister, Bernard Landry, an excellent finance 
minister, who has no equal in this House, may I point out, has 
clearly indicated that Quebec put the money the hon. member 
refers to in trust in order to protect itself from Treasury 
Board accounting practices that would not, had he included it in 
Quebec's operating revenues, have guaranteed the National 
Assembly that this money would be used for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister, with the agreement of the health minister, 
wanted to significantly increase the funding allocated to health 
care in Quebec.  I want to reassure all my fellow Quebecers 
that, if there is a government in recent years that has fully 
assumed its health care responsibilities, it is the government 
of Lucien Bouchard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member if we can count on her as a committed 
voice in her caucus to make it known to the Minister of Finance 
and the Minister of Health that we want transfer payments to be 
returned to their 1994-95 level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can she remain silent?  We are waiting for the government 
caucus to provide something other than the sorry spectacle of 
silent lambs with the government's cuts simply being confirmed 
uncritically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask her to join with the members for Rosemont, 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve and our colleagues in the New Democratic 
Party to say that the real crisis in the provinces' public 
health care system can be laid at the federal government's 
doorstep. Unilaterally, as of 1994, the federal government made 
cuts in transfer payments. 
Since 1994, these cuts have totalled $33 billion, $6.5 billion 
for Quebec alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If transfers were to be restored tomorrow morning, Quebec's 
share would be $1.2 billion.  It would use half of this amount, 
or almost $500 million, for health, and the other half for 
income security and postsecondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore call on the Liberal members to rise out of their 
stupor, to take matters into their own hands and to stand up and 
be counted with opposition members when we call on the 
government to restore transfer payments to the 1994-95 level. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is certainly an interesting debate and I am very 
pleased to take part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is the number one issue in the country.  There is no 
question about it.  The reason, of course, is that we fear for 
the future of health care if the present government continues the 
way it has since its election in 1993.  It has been in power for 
seven years.  In that seven years we have seen the erosion of 
health care.  What is even more frightening is that it has no 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us would take a little comfort in action being taken by 
the government, in any action it might take.  What we have 
basically said all along is that without a plan nobody knows. 
Without a plan we cannot predict the future of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty in Canada, in the eyes of most Canadians, when 
they compare our health care system with others, is that we see 
what is happening in the United States.  People in the country 
south of us do not have a health care system which is universal 
and managed by the federal government. 
Basically they have a health care system which is managed by, run 
by and controlled by litigation lawyers and insurance companies. 
We have all heard the horrendous stories in the United States of 
families going bankrupt because of the burden of health care 
forced upon them because they are sick.  In other words, there is 
no one there to help them.  We do not want to see that happen in 
this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this country about 9.5% of our gross national product is 
spent on health care.  In the United States that percentage is 
around 14.5%, the difference being that in Canada everyone is 
included.  In the United States about 40% of the population is 
excluded from any health care coverage at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this boils down to is that the health care system we have 
in Canada, in terms of the percentage of our GNP, is actually a 
good deal for Canadians.  We want to see it preserved, but there 
is no evidence on the part of the government that it intends to 
pay attention to it to ensure that we will have a system down the 
road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have with me a couple of documents which I thought most 
Canadians would enjoy.  I have the two red books.  I will be 
quoting from both of them, red book one and red book two. 
Incidentally, one of the books was written in preparation for the 
1993 election, the infamous red book one, which has a section on 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1993 election members of the now federal government, then 
the opposition Liberals under the leadership of the present Prime 
Minister, promised some things in terms of health care.  I want 
to show how the Liberals have deviated from what they said they 
would do to what they have actually done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are unfortunate enough to have these people in office in 
the year 2004, by that date they will have effectively taken $30 
billion out of health care.  That $30 billion represents the 
crisis we are experiencing today.  They have simply taken too 
much money out of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of us would stand in our place to argue that money alone 
would solve the problem, because it is about more than money.  We 
are talking about a plan.  We are talking about everyone getting 
together in the same room and talking about a strategy, a game 
plan, which will take us through the next 15 to 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read from red book one, which was the Liberal policy 
platform going into the election, which incidentally brought a 
lot of Liberal members into the House in 1993.  We are going to 
hear some grumbling on the other side because I am getting into 
something that is very painful for them.  I am reciting, line and 
verse, what they ran on in 1993.  Here is the promise which is 
found at page 77, under the title “Canada's Health Care 
System”: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal government will face these challenges squarely, 
thoughtfully, and with confidence.  Our approach will be based on 
our values.  Our solutions will be predicated on our commitment 
to the five fundamental principles of our medicare system... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal government will not withdraw from or abandon the 
health care field. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the very principles which we are debating today. 
Quoting again from the same book: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals cannot and will not accept a health care system that 
offers a higher quality of care for the rich than for the poor. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, according to the Liberals in 1993 we would not 
have a two tier system.  We know what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to table this document.  We will at least send it 
upstairs for <I>Hansard</I> to use in getting the correct quotes, 
the page references and that sort of thing, because we want it 
squarely on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Liberals do between 1993 and the election of 1997? 
They extracted over $17 billion from health care.  Why were they 
able to do that so easily, so effectively and without a lot of 
criticism? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time just about every province in the country was 
Liberal.  The Liberal premiers of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island nodded in agreement.  All 
of the Liberal members of parliament nodded in silent agreement 
as money was hacked and cut out of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House the Bloc Quebecois was the official 
opposition.  It was focused on one thing:  leaving Canada.  Those 
members had one thing on their minds:  a new country.  They were 
not focused on health care.  They did not care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other major party in the House at that time was the Reform 
Party, now known as the united alternative.  No matter what the 
government did to health care, the reformers would not stand to 
protect it.  Nothing could be too draconian for the Reform Party. 
If the government had simply massacred the system completely, 
taken it down to ground zero, the Reform Party would have been 
pleased with that.  Basically there was no intelligent debate in 
this House on health care between 1993 and 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make matters worse, the Liberals went into the 1997 election 
looking for a deathbed reprieve.  They had put some money back 
into health care, but not enough.  They knew they were in 
trouble.  They had taken out $17 billion and they had replaced $1 
billion or so, thinking that would do the trick leading into the 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did not do it, of course.  They did not fix health care. 
The sad thing about this whole story is that in the 1997 election 
they went on to promise more.  Let us read what they said in the 
1997 red book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 red book was their policy book for that election.  We 
just heard in red book one what they promised.  They completely 
reneged on that.  I guess most parties would have abandoned their 
position, knowing that they had misrepresented the Canadian 
people in the election.  No, they did not.  They had the gall to 
stand and say the same thing all over again. On page 72 of red 
book two it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Medicare is a cherished legacy that we will never abandon.  The 
Liberal government remains firmly committed to the five 
fundamental principles of health care in Canada:  it must be 
universal, accessible, comprehensive, portable, and publicly 
administered. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, they simply abandoned us again.  They went on the 
same— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Tired old track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was going to say burn 
and destroy mission; a scorched earth policy in terms of health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thinking that might not be enough, given their record between 
1993 and 1997, they went on to promise even more.  They went on 
to promise a home care program in red book two, on which they 
were elected.  They promised home care and more money for health 
care. Not to end it there, they promised a pharmacare program, 
which they knew they could not afford, but they promised it 
anyway. Apparently the Liberal philosophy is:  the bigger the 
promise, the more votes. 
I suppose we could say:  the bigger the promise, the bigger the 
votes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again they were successful. Since 1997 they have gone on with no 
plan and things are getting worse. Approximately $90 billion will 
be spent in Canada on health care this year.  That $90 billion 
will be made up of the federal government share, the provincial 
share and the private sector.  I want to remind Canadians that 
there is a private sector.  Our system is not totally funded by 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party's concern is that more of our health care system is 
becoming private.  We have to be very careful of the direction we 
go in.  That is what the NDP motion today is about.  The NDP is 
suggesting that the federal government take strong action against 
the province of Alberta because of the introduction of bill 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give an example of how difficult it is for the 
provinces to manage given the set of circumstances that the 
federal government created.  In my home province of New Brunswick 
spending in support of health care is the single largest 
expenditure.  It even overshadows debt charges, believe it or 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998-99 the Department of Health and Community Services in 
New Brunswick expected to spend $1.3 billion, approximately 30% 
of its total provincial budget, on health care.  About half of 
that total was spent on hospitals; 17% on medicare, which is 
predominately payment to physicians; 8% on nursing homes; nearly 
5% on the prescription drug program; 12% on social services; and 
nearly 8% on other things, including mental health services and 
public health.  Mental health services and public health received 
1.7% of the total budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in Newfoundland is worse.  What is so hypocritical 
is that the present premier of Newfoundland, Mr. Tobin, sat in 
the House of Commons and supported the federal Liberal government 
at the time.  He sat in the front row as the minister of 
fisheries.  Mr. Tobin voted for all of the cuts that affected 
every province, including his home province of Newfoundland, of 
which he is now premier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Newfoundland 42% of all spending is on health 
care.  Per capita health care costs are now $2,037, compared to 
approximately $1,700 four years ago.  Ironically, Newfoundland's 
population is decreasing, but health care costs are going up. 
That is the worst of all worlds.  A lot of this was created by 
the federal government, of which Mr. Tobin was a member.  He is 
starting to pay the price back home in terms of his government's 
ability to manage the system.  The system cannot be managed 
without money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Saskatchewan is going through the same set of 
difficulties.  Saskatchewan's population is declining as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  It is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Let me speak.  If members are opposed 
to what I am saying they can get on their feet and debate.  But 
while I am on my feet I expect them to listen, as good children 
normally do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next few weeks Roy Romanow will take a look at 
Saskatchewan's health care system.  He will have a public review 
of what we would consider to be the holy of holies if we were 
members of the NDP, health care, and will define what services 
are essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is almost parallel to what Mr. Klein is doing in Alberta, 
the province next door.  The difference is that Alberta has taken 
measures on its own to deal with the shortfall coming from Ottawa 
in terms of funding.  It is looking at privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan will take a slightly different view.  It will 
determine what services are essential.  I hope hon. members are 
listening to this because it is quite important. It is important 
for members of the NDP because medicare is the holy of holies 
when it comes to their party.  That is great, because we have to 
have more people in the House defending health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of going down the Ralph Klein road in terms of 
privatization, with the aid of the stroke of a pen the premier of 
Saskatchewan will actually take procedures off the list of those 
that today are considered to be essential.  Why?  To cope with 
the shortfall in funding which hurts the poor provinces. Mr. 
Romanow knows that Saskatchewan cannot keep on paying to the 
degree it has.  It has gone beyond its capacity to pay.  The 
point I am attempting to make is simply that the federal 
government has created the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure Canadians get confused when they hear us debating this 
issue in the House ad nauseam. They want this sorted out because 
once we get into the numbers it gets so confusing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canada Health Act primary care delivery is the 
responsibility of the provinces.  This is where the equation has 
gone wrong.  Primary care is the responsibility of the provinces 
and the 50:50 cost share which we originally entered into back in 
the 1970s has been abandoned.  The provinces started out in a 
situation where the federal government would share the costs. The 
equation was that the federal government would pay half of all 
the costs.  Now it is down to about 15%, 15 cents on the dollar 
being taken care of by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative that we get all the players into one room. The 
federal government poisoned the atmosphere a few years ago when 
it unilaterally took $17 billion out of the system.  We have to 
get all the players, the premiers, the health ministers, the 
federal health minister and the Prime Minister along with the 
health care leaders in the country, in the same room to debate 
where we are going and to come up with a plan.  If there is 
anything missing in Canada today, it is a national health care 
plan to let the Canadian people know where we are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to see the Americanization of a system that is 
capable of being saved.  We have a good system.  Let us work to 
preserve it.  It is up to the federal government to come up with 
a plan that will work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member from the 
Conservative Party for his fight when it came to the hepatitis C 
battles and his efforts in his province to fight for medicare as 
well.  But there is a contradiction when the Tories talk about 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently at a byelection in St. John's West, which the NDP came 
very close to winning, the Conservative member said that one of 
the greatest things he will do is fight for health care. He will 
fight for the universal, not for profit health care system in 
this country.  Yet his leader, Joe Clark, said that he supports 
bill 11 in Alberta.  The problem is, does the member not agree 
there may be a contradiction in that?  The member for St. John's 
West said he would fight for health care, yet the leader of the 
Conservative Party said he supports some sort of tinkering with 
the private system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is some form of contradiction.  I would like the 
member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member 
asked that question.  That is an issue on which I have spoken a 
number of times, as has our leader Joe Clark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to set the record straight.  This is why I talked about 
Roy Romanow, the NDP premier of Saskatchewan and the radical 
measures he will have to take as an NDP premier to deal with the 
shortfall in funding in health care. Let us start with Mr. Klein 
who said that this is something he would prefer not to have to 
do.  He is on the record as having said that.  He did not want to 
do it, in other words, bring in bill 11. If we talk with Roy 
Romanow, Saskatchewan is reconstructing the list of essential 
services.  In other words, some of the services deemed to be 
essential will be taken off as a cost saving measure in the 
province of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two premiers are next door to each other.  One is a 
Conservative premier and one is a socialist premier, and I am not 
saying that in a derogatory way, but our position on the issue 
has been much the same as Mr. Klein's.  This is something we 
would not want any government to have to do nor would we want 
Premier Romanow to have to strike off essential services, those 
that are deemed essential today, eliminate the list and make the 
list shorter.  Unfortunately he is being forced to do it.  That 
is exactly what Ralph Klein was forced to do.  Our position and 
Mr. Clark's is simply that we support his right to introduce that 
bill in the legislature.  We understand why he did it.  It is a 
question of survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes down to what province will be next.  We already know 
which one it is.  It is Roy Romanow in the province of 
Saskatchewan. It will be a raging debate in his province, as it 
will be in my province and every other province until we come up 
with a plan that is sustainable and which will work.  That is why 
our leader, Mr. Clark, has suggested in addition to the five 
principles which I mentioned in the House, there has to be one 
more principle and that is sustainable, predictable funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say funding in itself will do it because it will 
not.  Throwing huge gobs of money at the problem will not solve 
it.  That is one of the points John Crosbie, the former fisheries 
minister who is from Newfoundland made this week at our policy 
conference.  We agree with that. We have to have honest debate 
and dialogue on where we are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the NDP to point at us or any other party in terms of where 
we are going and what we want to do, that is not what Canadians 
want to see.  We want to see honest dialogue with honest 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has not engaged in honest dialogue.  On 
bill 11 it has not.  It has sent out mixed signals to the premier 
of Alberta and every other premier in the country because it 
wants the best of two worlds.  It wants to be able to balance its 
books on the backs of every province.  The finance minister wants 
to be able to stand in this place on his hind legs and brag about 
how he balanced the books.  He repeats that day in and day out in 
the House.  He has been successful, but let us examine why he has 
been so successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has done it at the expense of every single living Canadian. 
The government has taken it out of health care.  That is not a 
lot to be proud of.  The truth will be in the next election. That 
is why I am very supportive of our leader Mr. Clark.  There is no 
national leader who is more respected than Mr. Clark when it 
comes to dealing with the provinces and premiers from one end of 
the country to the other.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We need honest dialogue in an attempt to come up with solutions. 
We do not have all the solutions.  We want to engage Canadians in 
the debate so that at the end of the day they will say, “ We can 
see where this is going.  We do not want Americanization of our 
health care system.  We know it will cost us some money but this 
is where it is going.  This is a plan we can live with.  It is an 
honest plan, a sustainable plan and one that will do the trick”. 
That is what Canadians want.  Pointing fingers back and forth is 
not going to work.  The Liberals have done that for the last 
seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, when I concluded my speech, I mentioned that the 
Liberals poisoned the atmosphere.  When we talk about bringing 
the premiers and health care ministers together, they holler 
across that they will not do it.  They will not do it because 
they have poisoned the atmosphere.  Only by having an honest 
dialogue and having a broker come in to solve it will the problem 
get solved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present government cannot do it.  It has been scrambling for 
the last seven years.  We can measure its approach to every 
single problem that has besieged Canadians in the last number of 
years.  Those problems exist today because of the lack of 
leadership. In other words, it has not honestly addressed them. 
The Liberals have been coasting for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If any other members would like to ask a question, I would be 
more than happy to answer them.  Maybe some Liberal members have 
a question or two for me. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
sharing my time with the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say how pleased I am to take part in this debate as a 
member for parliament from Saskatchewan, the birthplace of our 
cherished medicare system. I also want to acknowledge all of the 
hard work that has been done by our leader, the member for 
Halifax, and our health critic, the member for Winnipeg Centre, 
to keep this issue first and foremost in parliament over the last 
several months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by picking up to some extent where the 
previous speaker ended in terms of setting the history of what 
has happened over the last 40 years.  As many Canadians know, 
this is our most cherished and most important social program.  It 
started in Saskatchewan where it was finally brought in by former 
Premier Tommy Douglas and his successor Woodrow Lloyd in 1962. It 
was a program that took 18 years to deliver because the 
Government of Saskatchewan at that time was adamant that it was 
not going to bring in the program until it could fund it for the 
long haul. It took from 1944 until 1962 for the program to come 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years later it was extended to the rest of Canada by the 
then Prime Minister Lester Pearson on the basis of 50:50 funding. 
I remember well that premiers like John Robarts of Ontario and 
Ernest Charles Manning of Alberta wanted nothing to do with 
socialized medicine, but they could not resist the 50 cent 
dollars that were on the table so everybody joined in.  In 1967 
we got a national medicare program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, it has been a cherished program.  Until the last few 
years, medicare has been something Canadians have been 
justifiably proud of.  They have talked about it as they have 
travelled throughout the world and visited other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question before us today is what has happened in recent 
years to the program, which we were so proud of in 1990, 1991 and 
1992, that we are anxiety ridden as to whether we will have a 
national medicare program in the next short while?  There are a 
number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been cutbacks.  I would submit that the principal 
problem we have today happened in 1995 with the Canada health and 
social transfer and the end of the Canada assistance plan and 
established programs financing. 
At that point the government, on its mantra for balancing the 
books and eliminating the deficit as quickly as possible, took 
more than $24 billion out of our health care system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the problems the provinces are having, 
whether it is Alberta, Saskatchewan or another province, they are 
problems driven by the lack of cash in recent years from the 
federal government.  Provinces have had to resort to backfilling. 
Notwithstanding the comments of previous hon. member, the 
province of Saskatchewan has backfilled 100% on the cutbacks to 
federal funding for medicare.  I worked in the department of 
health of that province for a brief period of time before I was 
elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also submit that many other provinces have done the 
same.  The modern day John Robarts, Ernest Mannings, Mike 
Harrises and Ralph Kleins have basically no commitment to 
medicare, especially when there are only 11 cents, 13 cents or 15 
cents of funding instead of the 50:50 funding they once enjoyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point in time, sooner rather than later I would submit, 
one of those provinces will tell the government to forget its 11 
cents or 13 cents and have its own health care system.  That will 
be the end of the national medicare program, which concerns us a 
great deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken billions out of health care.  We have 
an aging population, as the Minister of Health said earlier in 
the debate.  We have a number of new technologies.  Health care 
is not getting less expensive.  We have more demand and less 
money. There is simply not enough money in the system but the 
culprit is across the aisle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members of parliament to concentrate on that issue and 
not get too bogged down in the backbiting of which province is 
doing what.  Although, having said that, I want to come back at 
some point before I close to what is specifically happening in 
the province of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tried to suggest that there is an end to the partnership 
and that 1995 was a watershed in that regard.  We now have a 
government of a province with very little commitment to health 
care, to medicare.  I do not think that is reflected accurately 
by the people of the province of Alberta, but bill 11 would set 
up a legislative framework for surgical facilities offering 
overnight stays as far as we are concerned.  It would also offer 
diagnostic and treatment services, services for both medically 
necessary surgeries as required under the CHA and elective 
surgeries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved in various organizations that have been 
fighting privatization for decades.  The pattern is always the 
same.  Privatization occurs where there is a fast return on 
profits and the more expensive long term care is left to the 
public.   When we talk about tonsillectomies, cataract surgery 
and hip and knee replacements, we are talking generally about 
relatively minor short stays in hospital, quick release in 24 
hours or less.  People are back home and recovering and not a 
burden on the health care system.  That is what people interested 
in privatizing our health care system want to do.  They will 
leave long term care for the public system and we will quickly 
end up with two tiers.  That is the heart of what the bill and 
bill 11 are all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of conclusion, the initial announcement back in 1995 was 
that cash transfers would be cut by 40% and for most provinces 
the cash portion of the transfer would ultimately phase out.  In 
future under the CHST it would be up to the provinces to decide 
how to allocate their much reduced cash transfer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to make mention of one point that has not been 
talked about in the debate.  It caught my eye last week that five 
of the largest pharmaceutical industries in the world have now 
decided in their benevolence to do something about the horrific 
problems with the outbreak of AIDS in Africa.  They have agreed 
under an umbrella agreement that they would provide AIDS related 
drugs to Africa at a much reduced cost.  I guess we would say 
that is a very noble endeavour on the part of the pharmaceutical 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can think about what is driving the cost of medicare and 
pharmacare in Canada, the high cost of drugs, and the fact that 
we had to comply with Bill C-92, the 20 year patent protection 
and the inability to use generic drugs.  How is it that the 
pharmaceutical industry can arbitrarily say that it will provide 
these drugs as a noble endeavour to the continent of Africa?  We 
in Canada are prohibited from saying that we would like reduced 
pharmaceutical costs to benefit our population from coast to 
coast to coast and keep the costs of our health system down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated I am sharing my time with the member for Bras 
D'Or—Cape Breton, but I am pleased to have had the opportunity 
to participate in this important debate today.  I look forward to 
hearing from members of all parties on the issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for his excellent remarks.  He certainly gave 
the real reasons for being in the situation we are today in terms 
of the health care service in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good number of members and I are from a generation in Canada 
that has never had to fight for the benefits in our health care 
system.  We have never had to truly experience the horrendous 
situation that went on prior to medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention an incident that I heard about from the Canadian 
Alliance member for Selkirk—Interlake.  I happened to meet a 
constituent in his riding last week.  He recognized that his own 
member of parliament was not on the right side of the issue, so 
he mentioned to me that he recalls the years when his brother on 
the farm had an appendicitis attack.  They called a doctor who 
came out to the farm.  Before seeing his ailing brother in the 
house, the doctor went out to barn to check out the cow he was to 
receive by way of payment.  That was the state of health care in 
Canada.  That was our health care system prior to medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it absolutely unconscionable that the government would 
not put enough funding into our health care system nationwide to 
ensure that we have those services for all Canadians.  Has my 
colleague heard of any of such instances? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for Churchill 
is saying that there was a time and there may be a time again 
soon when the medical profession will be checking our purse first 
and our pulse second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might help to elaborate on the answer by recalling why Tommy 
Douglas, the founder of medicare, became so passionate and 
committed to it.  It went back to a time when he was growing up 
and had a problem with his leg.  He was living with his family in 
the United States.  He was an ironmonger's son, as I recall. He 
was in a hospital and they were getting ready to amputate his leg 
when a surgeon came along, looked at him, and said that he could 
fix it without the amputation and did so.  Tommy Douglas thought 
from that day until his death why it was that we would have a two 
tier system.  If his parents had the money the possibility of the 
amputation would never have been an issue. 
It was only the generosity and kind services of the surgeon in 
the Chicago area that actually saved his leg.

there if the government has the will to provide the financial 
support.  Could he tell us whether he too was delighted to get 
this news? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was delighted to hear 
the news.  If I heard it correctly it was $14 billion more than 
the projected surplus which is considerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member is suggesting in his question and what I will 
suggest by way of response is that there is money.  Despite the 
dripping sincerity of the Minister of Health, one more time as he 
did this morning, we have the money in the system.  What we do 
not have so far is the will to dispense it in this very necessary 
program. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate but somewhat 
disappointed given that my first speech in the House in 1997 was 
with respect to the deplorable health care system from which the 
constituents of Bras d'Or—Cape Breton were suffering.  Here we 
find ourselves three years later and the only change has been 
that the health care system has become progressively worse and we 
are very close to a two tier private health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act is under attack and the government 
continues to do nothing.  A recent poll showed that nine out of 
10 Canadians clearly stated that they believed there should be 
equal access to medical treatment for everyone regardless of 
income.  What else does private for profit health care do but 
prevent equal access?  This is the essence of the motion we are 
debating today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason the government has had to backtrack and sidestep 
Alberta's bill 11 is that the Canada Health Act is not clear. The 
Canada Health Act needs its own clarity bill and the motion 
begins the process of ensuring that the government is accountable 
for what it says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear members of the government talk about health care.  They 
continue to talk about the cost of maintaining a public health 
care system.  I do not think there is anyone, certainly not in 
the New Democratic Party, who would dispute that public health 
care is costly.  However, as we have heard from my hon. colleague 
from Kamloops, we just found out this morning that the government 
has $11 billion more than it had projected.  It is not about not 
having money.  The reality is that Canadians have paid for the 
services and the government is denying them the money to allow 
for those services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here because the government is still not providing the 
leadership Canadians want.  For months the government waited and 
waited and continued to tell those of us in the House and 
Canadians that it would intervene if the health act were 
violated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk about health care I cannot help but worry and 
concern myself about the importance of health care to women.  It 
is not that men do not use the health care system, but it is 
certainly true that women tend to be greater users of health care 
services because we live longer and are unfortunately more often 
in poorer economic circumstances than men.  The effect a 
privatized for profit health care system would have on women also 
concerns me. 
Profit means that people will have to pay for services rendered. 
The percentage of women who live in poverty in Canada is 18.2%. 
How will they be able to pay for private services?  Will they be 
able to access the same quality of health care that their richer 
neighbours have access to?  I think not.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a poverty rate of 25% in my regional municipality. The 
child poverty rate, I am ashamed to say, is quite a bit higher 
than 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty-eight percent of Canadians recently polled think it is 
very important that everybody be able to access the same level of 
health care no matter what their income.  Canadians do not want a 
two tier system.  Why does the government continue to stand by 
the tiresome excuse that bill 11 does not violate the Canada 
Health Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware of the link between poverty and access to 
quality health care.  This is only one of the concerns Canadian 
women have about these possible changes to our health care 
system.  Women will bear the brunt of a privatized for profit, 
two tier health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women already fill in where the government has failed to provide 
the assistance to its citizens that they expect.  More and more 
women are adding the burden of caring for elderly relatives as 
the system becomes overburdened because of all the cuts to 
funding.  This will not change if bill 11 becomes law and sets 
the precedent for private for profit health care in Canada.  In 
fact, the burden will probably increase even more.  Women already 
perform two-thirds of the unpaid work in Canada.  How much more 
are Canadian women expected to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government changed the Canada Health Act in 1996.  Why not 
change it again now?  Why not make sure that there are more 
incentives to provide accessible, quality health care than 
incentives to make a profit?  Why has the government not 
increased transfer payments and earmarked them specifically for 
health care services to make sure that there is no market or room 
for foreign companies to come in and begin competing with the 
health care system that the overwhelming majority of Canadians 
want us to maintain? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is because the government continues to be influenced 
by a powerful lobby group that would love to see for profit 
health care that they could benefit from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the Prime Minister sent a clear message to the provinces 
that they were basically on their own in their provision of 
health care because of the steady cutbacks to cash transfers over 
the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When health transfers were folded into the CHST, this government 
had to make changes to the act.  First it had to get rid of the 
then health minister who wanted to stop the cuts in funding and 
ensure that the federal government played a leadership role in 
the enforcement of the Canada Health Act.  The government made 
sure it appointed a successor by the name of David Dingwall who 
made nine major changes to the Canada Health Act which paved the 
way for the existence of bill 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is not standing here today saying that there is no work 
to be done in our health care system.  I, as a health care 
worker, know that changes need to be made within the system. What 
we are here to tell the Minister of Health and the government is 
that we are all sick and tired of hearing the government say that 
we should just sit and wait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not want the government to wait.  The government's 
excuses are wearing pretty thin these days as we see its 
inability or unwillingness to jump in and show the leadership 
necessary to protect the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want the Liberals to act now.  They do not want the 
government to pass off the responsibility to the provinces. 
Canadians are sick of this juvenile game of tug of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody should ever make the mistake of thinking that the Canada 
Health Act is or should be a finished document.  It should be 
open to debate and open to change.  Canadians are telling us that 
there are some basic principles that, in their opinion, are not 
open to change.  Highest on their list is accessibility 
regardless of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should act now.  It should change the Canada 
Health Act and do what Canadians want it to do.  The government 
should make sure that bill 11 is stopped and that no other 
province tries to introduce legislation that so clearly violates 
the principles, the morals and the ethics behind what Canadians 
believe their health care system should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all my colleagues in the House to support this motion 
which sends the clear message that private for profit health care 
is not the kind of health care Canadians want and it is not the 
kind of health care that we are going to give them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again I listened with much interest 
to my hon. colleague from Cape Breton who spoke so eloquently 
about the crisis in which health care finds itself, particularly 
as a result of the lack of adequate federal financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have for the member has to do with the situation 
south of the border in the United States where it does have a for 
profit health care system.  A report came out last week 
indicating that the reason for the lion's share of personal 
bankruptcies filed in the United States was as a result of the 
horrendous health care costs that families were required to 
provide and that once those health care costs were provided it 
bankrupted the family operation and they had to declare personal 
bankruptcy as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the United States experience, would the member share 
the concern that this may threaten us here in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, fortunately, I have 
relatives who have been living in the United States for 
approximately 45 years.  I have talked about standing here today 
and being disappointed at having to fight for health care.   One 
of the interesting discussions that I continue to have with my 
relatives is that they do not understand what this government is 
doing.  They have been south of the border for 45 years looking 
at Canada and saying “My God, we wish we had what you have”.  I 
have an uncle who fortunately was not seriously ill but who had 
to be hospitalized for three days. I think the bill totalled 
something like $8,000.  It does concern me and it should concern 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we recently had a medical crisis in my family. My 
mother-in-law had three heart attacks in three days. The doctors 
put her on a nitroglycerine intravenous so they could hold her 
over for the Easter weekend before they did a triple bypass 
because of the shortage of staff, the shortage of surgeons and 
the cost to do the surgery.  We sat around for four days and 
prayed that she would not take that one massive heart attack and 
not make it to the surgery table.  That is a reality every day in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague indicated, what will happen to a single mother 
if she has to pay for health care?  I had a case in my riding 
where a single mother went to a pharmacy with her two young 
children who were sick but, fortunately, not seriously sick.  As 
any mother knows, when our kids are sick we are worried and 
concerned.  The pharmacist called me because he was so disturbed. 
The single mother asked him if he could tell her which one of her 
children was the sickest because she only had enough money for 
the medicine for one.  The pharmacist told me that he gave her 
enough medication for two and that he did not care if he lost his 
licence because he was able to sleep well with himself.  Imagine 
a mother having to decide which one of her kids would get the 
medication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at the tip of the iceberg if this government does not 
stand up and act now to give Canadians what Canadians are clearly 
telling this government and this House that they want.  They are 
saying clearly that they do not want two tier for profit health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary 
question for the member.  After having given a presentation that 
will help people to understand the crisis nature of our health 
care issue, could the member confirm two things?  Does the 
average American family in the United States that is actually 
able to pay the premiums to get some kind of health coverage, all 
of which is deductible I might add, pay an average payment per 
family of between $5,000 U.S. and $7,000 U.S. annually, which is 
a tremendous cost for every household? 
As a matter of fact, as my hon. friend from northern Manitoba has 
told me, that is one of the major reasons that people enter the 
American Armed Forces.  It is an easy way to get good personal 
and family health coverage. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member confirm that the annual family cost ranges 
between $5,000 U.S. and $7,000 U.S.?   Would she also confirm 
from the information that she has that in terms of a cost 
effective system the actual cost of health care in the United 
States, albeit there are millions of people without any coverage, 
actually costs more than it does in Canada on a GDP per capita 
basis? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do agree with my 
hon. colleague in terms of what the cost is of guaranteeing 
medical coverage for our neighbours to the south.  As I said, I 
have had firsthand experience with those costs.  Even the cost of 
small needle for a fly bite is absolutely astronomical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the second part of my colleague's question, the 
figure I saw, and I would not want to be quoted, but the overall 
cost of the American system is something like 40% more than a 
publicly funded system.  Our friends south of the border want 
what we have and our system is going to where they are at. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting that the member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland 
Valleys has a problem with his memory today.  Indeed, he has 
probably forgotten the fact that it was the Liberal Party that 
brought forward medicare in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time today with the member for 
York West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very honoured to take part in the debate about health care. 
As I observed and listened to the New Democratic Party bring 
forward this issue once again in the House, I think forward to 
what its campaign will be like in the next election. I know it 
will be able to save a lot of money on stationery presenting 
public policy documents because, quite simply, its whole public 
policy is based on two words, and that is, more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last couple of days we have heard the NDP members talk 
about the problems at CBC.  It simply needs more money.  When 
they speak about unemployment insurance, it simply needs more 
money.  Today, on health care, it is more of the same, more money 
for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada spends close to 10% of its gross domestic product on 
health care.  Canada is one of the highest spenders in the 
western world on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only reasonable that policymakers would sit down and ask 
themselves how much money they would need to spend on health care 
and what is applicable to our population.  Does that mean that we 
are discriminating and getting a poorer quality of health care? 
Of course not.  The problem with our health care system is clear 
to me:  We are not getting value for our money.  It is not about 
spending on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had this constant debate that the federal government is 
not carrying its share of the health care issue. We contribute 33 
cents on every dollar to health care.  It is not as high as it 
was when it was originally brought in but we cannot ignore the 
whole issue of tax points, even though everyone wants to forget 
they exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax points occurred when the premiers and the federal government 
sat down and decided that rather than the federal government 
taxing people, collecting the money and then turning around and 
giving it to the provinces in transfer payments, that it would 
allow the provinces more tax room to tax directly and collect 
that money and spend it on health care. Today, provinces, like 
the province of Ontario, choose to ignore that part of our 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not making these things up.  Anyone can go down to the 
archives and get various documents and agreements that were 
signed at the time when provinces agreed to this kind of formula. 
Today they want to ignore that.  Mr. Harris in my province has 
caused the spending of something like $6 million to carry on an 
ongoing battle with the federal government for no particular 
purpose at all, as far as I can see.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that we continue to spend significant amounts of 
money on health care.  I did my own analysis to show that the 
province of Ontario was not even spending the money we gave it 
for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear from members of the New Democratic Party that it is 
simply more money that is needed.  They do not have any ideas 
about how they want to change the health care system.  The health 
care system is important to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are giving anecdotal information, my commitment to a 
publicly funded health care system is also based on a bit of a 
life experience. I remember being on a dock down in Key West. The 
next door neighbour of a friend of ours who was a retired doctor 
from Illinois had been out fishing with a friend. His friend 
collapsed with cardiac arrest on the dock.  His friend said to 
the doctor, “Do not take me to a doctor.  I cannot afford it”. 
I thought that was such a great statement, because he was saying 
it to his friend who was a doctor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us in this Chamber would agree that we do not want that 
situation in Canada.  It is important to maintain a publicly 
funded system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, there are things we have to fix.  The problem 
with this whole file is that the federal government is seen by 
many of the provinces as a dispenser of cheques. That is not the 
answer to the problem.  That is not the answer to this file.  We 
should look at the way the country is changing, its demographics. 
Our population is aging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many, many governments before us of all stripes had problems 
with health care.  I would like to reiterate that the New 
Democratic Party was in control of the government in the province 
of Ontario during a significant period of time and our health 
care system eroded during its watch as well.  If we are honest to 
the public, we should say that yes, we think there are some 
problems with the health care system but we have to have a 
comprehensive plan to make it better.  It is not just those two 
words the New Democratic Party constantly uses, more money. It is 
not about more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are problems in our primary care service. There are people 
who are not receiving adequate medical care from their GPs 
because the provinces have developed systems of remunerating 
doctors which quite frankly such as in my own province 
discriminate against the doctors for working certain long hours. 
It is hard for people to get 24 hour health care in the province 
of Ontario. It is because of the way governments have structured 
the payment system for doctors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard in the House that we have to have a publicly 
funded health care system.  Let us be honest with ourselves.  The 
reality is that what most people think of health care will 
probably have a broader definition than that of a good number of 
politicians.  They probably think of chiropractic medicine. They 
may think of pharmaceuticals.  They may even think of 
naturopathic medicine.  If we actually looked at the total 
expenditures on what people think is health care in this country, 
50% of it is probably privately funded already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we are talking about the elements and the aspects of a 
health care system which includes health care workers, nurses and 
doctors and institutions we still feel should be controlled by 
the public because of some of the very reasons that are enshrined 
in the Canada Health Act, accessibility. That is the basic 
principle which I want to address today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to change the way we do health care, primary and 
permanent care.  We have not developed as a nation a full 
appreciation of how to deal with permanent care.  Indeed, Mr. 
Harris in my province said, “Gee, we have all of these beds and 
we have too many people using them.  Really what we need is a 
home care system so we will close the hospitals”.  He forgot the 
other side of the argument.  The other side of the argument is 
that we have to enforce a home care system.  We have to have 
places where people can go, whether they are geriatric cases or 
otherwise, nursing homes or other facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constant studies have been done.  An empirical study was done by 
going to people who were either in nursing homes or in acute care 
in their own homes.  They were asked the very fundamental 
question would they rather be there or would they rather be in an 
institution like a hospital.  The majority of the people said, 
“We would rather be in a home care facility where we have loved 
ones around us assisting us.  And when it comes to dying, heaven 
forbid that we can die with dignity and respect”. 
Lo and behold when we take those figures and start extrapolating, 
it is $2,500 more costly to get this service in an institution. 
It costs the hospital.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the kinds of changes that are needed and the federal 
government is not in the position to do that.  The only position 
we have is to tell the provinces, with our money in our 
back pocket, that we have to move in the area of home care. I do 
not hear members of the NDP talking about this.  I hear them 
saying to just give them more money and that will solve the 
problem.  It is not going to happen that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not put the investment in technology.  We should be able 
to track patients across the country.  We cannot even do 
something simple, use the technology that is available to us 
today, to simply track patient records.  We cannot even do that. 
We talk about investments in MRI equipment and all kinds of other 
new technology.  We have not done that.  We have not put our 
money in those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to restructure the health care system.  I would be the 
first to agree with that but we cannot simply talk about more 
money.  We have to talk about the real things that matter to 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am having a health care forum.  The provincial 
members of parliament in Ontario do not care about this area. 
That is why I am having a health care forum in my riding and 
bringing in a former assistant deputy minister of health. It is 
to talk with the people and ask them how they want the health 
care system to change.  It is not about giving us more money.  It 
is about making the thing work so it protects our health. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have to say it is sometimes very frustrating on this 
side of the House when we hear some of the comments from the 
government that clearly indicate it is clearly not in touch with 
Canadians. Canadians have clearly said that they want the 
guarantee of a publicly funded health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very simple.  Canadians have said the problem 
with the health care system is the lack of money.  We know the 
government has the money. Why does the government not want to use 
money from Canadians to guarantee them the services for which 
they pay? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is very simple.  The 
people of Canada are not asking for more money.  It is the 
members of New Democratic Party because they cannot think 
themselves beyond dollars and cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in my riding are asking us for better quality health 
care.  That is the issue, better quality health care, not more 
money.  Let us talk about money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard these comments today, that now we have $14 billion more 
in surplus.  But we forget about the $890 billion in debt that 
the country still has and the $44 billion we spend every year in 
servicing that debt.  The members over there would walk away from 
it; to heck with money, money is not important. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is seldom that I agree with my 
colleague but on that question I agree with her totally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has cut $25 billion out of health care in the 
country. The member opposite said, “We need to restructure the 
health care system”.  He said the MPPs in Ontario do not care. 
That is nonsense.  They do care.  What they care about is that 
the federal government has taken out $25 billion from the 
provincial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the member think he has to solve the health care 
problem?  Health care is a provincial jurisdiction. Many members 
in the House have been in provincial governments.  They know how 
difficult it has been to operate a proper health system with the 
federal government taking out $25 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the money be put back in?  Give them the money and let 
the provinces run the system.  They can do it very well if they 
get their share of the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the issue of a collapsing 
health care system occurred while there was that $25 billion.  By 
the way, the statistics are quite clear.  With the transfer 
payments we have restored all the money that we were funding in 
health care back in 1993-94. Does the member want to ignore 
reality and forget about tax points? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is just not reality.  The money is back in the system 
today.  My province has something like $300 million from the 
federal government in one time start up funding that was not even 
spent on health care.  So do not tell me that the provinces know 
how to spend money on health care.  The fact is that health care 
across the country is in collapse and the provinces are

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have just 
a brief comment and a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member across the way said that the Liberals had the money 
in their back pocket.  Could they take it out and put it on the 
table?  That would be really good for Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be sure so I will repeat it in English.  My colleague 
across the way said that the Liberals had the money in their back 
pockets.  Canadians wish they would take it out of their back 
pockets and put it on the table where it needs to be to serve 
Canadians.  That is what we need for health care.  It is not 
right that people cannot get into hospitals because of a six 
month wait for heart surgery and every other sickness.  They just 
cannot get the service.  That is the fault of the federal 
government and all the cuts it has made to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Liberal from Newfoundland, Brian Tobin, said the same 
thing.  Maybe they should talk to their cousins down there, too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I talk to our health care 
workers, people such as nurses who actually work in the system. 
They have told me that more money is not the answer.  If we pump 
more money into the system, it is going to be just as inefficient 
as it is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way the federal government can show leadership on this 
file is to say that these are the ways the health care system 
should change across the country from sea to sea to sea. Yes, we 
will put some more money on the table, but we want to see 
commitment from the provinces that they are going to spend it on 
improving health care for people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Durham said that some of the provinces 
that were given money by the federal government kept that money. 
With his accounting background, he would recognize that the money 
transferred to the provinces was for three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he were in the province and received $100 million for health 
care, would he have spent that $100 million in the first week, or 
would he have spread it out over three years, which is what the 
provinces are doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, by all means, no I would 
not.  But I would not be like the province of Ontario which is 
saying that it does not have any money when in fact it has $300 
million sitting in an account.  It turned around and took $160 
million out and did not spend it on health care.  It spent it on 
tax cuts.  That is not my idea of leadership on the health care 
file. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro (York West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad 
to have the opportunity to speak to the opposition motion by the 
NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister has said, the government does have grave 
concerns about public funds going to private for profit 
facilities.  In Canada our health care system is predominantly 
publicly financed and privately delivered.  It is publicly 
financed in that our universal single payer health care system 
accounts for about 70% of total health care expenditures in 
Canada.  It is privately delivered in that most health care 
providers and facilities operate in a private not for profit 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system has always had private components.  For example, most 
of our doctors are private practitioners or entrepreneurs, if you 
like.  Most Canadian hospitals are operated as private non-profit 
entities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the publicly insured physician and hospital 
services we all receive, provinces and territories also provide 
public coverage for other health services that remain outside the 
national health insurance framework for certain groups of the 
population, such as seniors, children and welfare recipients. 
These supplementary health benefits include prescription drugs, 
dental care and vision care.  While provinces and territories do 
provide coverage for some of these additional benefits, for the 
most part they are privately financed.  These health care 
benefits account for about 30% of Canadians' total health 
expenditures and are financed privately through supplementary 
insurance, employer sponsored benefits or directly out of pocket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians know and appreciate, the values that underpin our 
medical care system are synonymous with being Canadian.  The fact 
that people in this country have access to hospital and physician 
services based on their need and not their financial means is 
truly a unifying feature of Canadian life. Our publicly financed 
health system is a social contract between governments and 
citizens to take care of one another regardless of financial 
means or economic position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has only to talk to Canadians born before medicare and 
listen to the stories of families who lost their life savings, of 
individuals who could only have surgery when the community got 
together and raised funds, or of loved ones who suffered because 
they could not afford health services, to know how important 
medicare is to being Canadian. 
This alone is a strong argument for a one tier, single payer 
health care system and, more important, for all of us to be 
working to keep it together. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real threat to medicare is the increasing involvement of the 
private sector in the delivery of necessary health care services 
on a for profit basis.  This raises concerns about the integrity 
of our public system and whether a two tiered system is not far 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is worrisome, especially since our system is envied by many 
other countries.  Globally, Canada's health system is seen as not 
only a core social value, but also a program that enhances our 
competitive position in the world economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at overall health spending.  Canada spends about 
9.2% of its gross domestic product, the GDP, on health.  The 
United States spends 14% of its GDP on health, and still 43 
million Americans do not have health insurance coverage.  Another 
100 million are under-insured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we spend 9% of the GDP and still cover everyone?  The 
big difference is the cost of administration.  The American 
multi-payer system simply costs more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at payroll costs in Canada and the United States.  In the 
U.S. they are six times higher.  Medicare is one of the reasons 
Canada has the lowest payroll taxes of any country in the G-7. 
Canada's business leaders recognize that medicare is a key 
economic asset, not a burden.  Our single payer, publicly 
financed health system makes Canadian businesses more 
competitive by keeping their costs down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As John McCallum, chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, 
said recently with regard to health care in Canada “The goals of 
efficiency and financial egalitarianism go hand in hand”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Canada is the country best equipped to deal with the 
pressures of an aging population and increased health costs, 
there are still challenges and problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health and the Prime Minister have both said and 
emphasize that the status quo is not on.  However, the way to 
solve these problems is not to replace the status quo with a 
private, parallel, for profit system.  Innovation and change do 
not necessitate private for profit health care delivery, but 
sometimes provide an excuse for that very fact.  Yet ironically 
we hear time and time again that the answer is to turn to private 
for profit systems for health care delivery when in fact from an 
economic standpoint there is little evidence to support this 
conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous studies from countries where there is private for 
profit health care demonstrate that when compared to publicly 
provided health care it costs more, provides lower quality and 
fewer services, reduces equity and accessibility and drives up 
the cost of public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A parallel for profit system would draw the best and brightest 
doctors and other health providers also from the public system, 
leaving the rest of us in the public system with diminished 
services.  However, if procedures in the private system get 
complicated and more elaborate service is required, we know where 
those cases will be, right back in the public system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public system ends up subsidizing the private one by having 
to provide services that will not turn a profit in the private 
system.  In short, Canadians would be worse off than if the 
services were delivered publicly.  From my perspective Canadians 
will be better served when changes, innovations and capacity 
issues are addressed within a publicly financed and publicly 
provided health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important decision about changes to medicare should be guided 
by sound, solid evidence, by governments working together to 
address Canadians' needs.  Instead of privatization we need to be 
working together to better organize and manage the current public 
health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear that the Government of Canada has a long term 
sustainable plan to modernize, strengthen and preserve public 
health care in Canada.  Canadians expect their governments to 
work together to ensure the renewal of this most cherished social 
program.  The government stands ready to engage in this most 
important challenge.  It is not beyond us to solve the problems 
that confront medicare, but we must get on with the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act is flexible enough as it stands now to 
protect public health care.  The Minister of Health has stated 
that, as we have in the past, we will enforce the Canada Health 
Act in the future if violations occur.  This government will 
enforce the authority in the Canada Health Act if practices 
threaten the five principles on which our health care system is 
based.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the Liberal 
member seems concerned about the fear of privatization.  She 
talked a lot about a two tier system.  Does she not think that we 
not only have a two tier but probably a three tier system in 
Canada already?  We have our system that is not working well.  We 
have a system of a number of procedures growing in just about 
every province that is not covered by medicare any more, so that 
only people who can afford certain procedures have them.  Then we 
have about $5 billion a year going out of the country to the 
United States and to other parts of the world because Canadians 
leave to have operations they cannot get quickly enough in 
Canada.  Do we really not have a three tier system already? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think that is a gross 
misrepresentation of the facts that I stated and of comments that 
were made earlier in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is firmly committed to enforcing the Canada 
Health Act and providing Canadians with access to great medical 
care in the country.  We have no intention of standing back and 
allowing anything to deteriorate the system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank my colleague.  I recognize that she was speaking as if 
there were a real commitment on behalf of the government to 
support a public health care system and that there was no way it 
would allow for profit medicare or health care within our system. 
However, the reality is that there has been a decrease in 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not funding health care to the degree it was a 
number of years ago.  There is not the 50:50 sharing with the 
provinces.  It is not happening.  That is not accurate.  The 
government is not doing it.  As a result, the provinces make the 
choice as to whether they want to go ahead and start charging for 
this or not covering that, instead of having a system where over 
time we improve it and where we continually benefit Canadians 
with increased services that are covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment on the point of what Canadians want to see. 
Canadians have made it perfectly clear a number of times when 
governments of the past have gone to them and asked what they 
wanted to see in health care.  They have already told the 
governments.  Where have the governments been?  Why have they not 
been listening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have said that they want a universal health care 
system.  They want a national pharmacare program.  They want 
national home care standards.  If people have never heard that 
they should get their ears to an ENT and get them cleaned out. 
That is what Canadians have said loud and clear.  They have said 
that they want a national system.  They want national standards. 
They want to be able to move from one province to the other and 
get those services.  That is not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can my hon. colleague stand behind her statement of what the 
government believes in if it is not willing to put an equal share 
of dollars on the table for the provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with everything the 
member has said in the sense that we are all here as Canadians. 
This is an issue of major importance to each and every one of us 
in the House.  It does not matter what party we are with, we all 
want to make sure that we have the best health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commitment from the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Finance is that there will be additional dollars on the table. 
This is not a pot that we can keep putting dollars into.  We have 
an aging population and a lot seniors in need.  We need to make 
some changes in the system.  We can raise all the concerns about 
home care we want, but we need to work with the provinces. We 
cannot just keep writing the cheques.  Funding, as I understand, 
is back up to the 1993-94 levels.  More money has been committed 
in the health area, but there have to be changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Ontario is sitting with money in the bank while 
people are desperately in need of care.  That is a real problem. 
Giving the province of Ontario more money is not the answer.  The 
question is, what are the changes and how are we going to make 
sure that we have a sustainable health care system for all? 
There is no issue that will unite Canadians, politicians and all 
governments to make sure that happens more than this one.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed listening to the hon. member's remarks compared to some 
of the comments I heard this morning about throwing more cash at 
the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned in her speech that changes are needed 
concerning innovative and capacity issues.  Could she expand on 
that?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we only provide the money. 
We have to be able to co-operate and work with the provinces to 
ensure that they make the changes necessary to preserve our 
health care system so that we will have an effective pharmacare 
program and a home care program that will look after the people, 
which we are all very committed to seeing happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the 
hon. member for Saanich—Gulf Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to participate in the debate on this motion on 
health care.  At the outset, let me say that the motion is 
characteristic of NDP policy on many things.  Regrettably for 
them, times are changing and we must move with the times.  This 
is no more so than in health care.  The situation is code blue. 
It is critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, the NDP is no closer to supporting provincial 
innovations in health care than are the Liberals.  They do not 
like what Mr. Klein is doing, but they will not comment on what 
they are doing in British Columbia, which is very similar to what 
they are doing in Ontario.  They are not willing to demonstrate 
flexibility in reforming the health care system.  Until someone 
is, the situation will continue to deteriorate and the lives of 
Canadians will remain pawns in this game of lethargy by both the 
Liberals and the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the NDP it is easier to point fingers and lay blame.  They, 
like the Liberals, are applying the Canada Health Act as a hammer 
to penalize the provinces, which are in dire straits because of 
lack of funds and increasing pressures on the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the hon. member for Malpeque say that we just 
cannot throw money at a system.  Why does he not stop to think? 
This money belongs to Canadians.  This is not the Liberal 
government's money.  The provinces deserve that money.  Medicare 
is supposed to be a 50:50 proposition.  It is not any more.  It 
is funded 11% to 14% by the federal government.  Money would make 
a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not let the provinces do what our constitution says 
they should be doing, which is running the health care system? 
The Liberals use this big “We are going to do this for the 
health care system”.  Stay out of the health care system and let 
the provinces run it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in the provincial government in British Columbia we 
had an emergency room system which operated very well.  We had a 
$10 user fee.  It was not mandatory.  At the bottom of the form 
which people signed it stated that if they did not have the money 
or if they did not want to pay, they did not have to.  It was a 
voluntary $10 fee.  We were forced by the Liberal government to 
stop taking that $10.  The costs in the emergency rooms went up 
by 145% the next year.  There was no need for it.  That was big 
brother managing a province that was doing quite fine operating 
its own system with a user fee that did not bother anybody in the 
emergency rooms, but the government said it would take away our 
highway grant of $90 million for that year if we did not stop 
collecting that $45 million worth of user fees in the emergency 
rooms.  That was big brother operating.  It has not improved the 
health care system in British Columbia.  Perhaps it makes some 
people feel better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting part is that in all the years I was in the B.C. 
government we collected 98.5% of those $10 fees.  Nobody refused 
to pay.  Nobody minded paying.  The usage rate in the emergency 
rooms went up the next year by a tremendous amount.  Now people 
use it as a drop-in centre when they cannot get in to see their 
doctor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system was operating fine in the province until the 
interference of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be realistic and look at the government's track record on 
health care spending.  The government has cut $25 billion out of 
the Canada health and social transfer over the past seven years. 
It will be cutting another $10 billion over the next four years. 
What does the government expect the provinces to do?  They cannot 
provide the required services now and the government wants them 
to cut more.  How can we expect that services are going to get 
better?  They are going to get worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the impact of the decrease in federal 
health care spending.  Can hon. members imagine being told they 
have a cancerous tumour and have to wait three months for 
treatment?   That is happening in this country.   People are 
being told that it takes three months.  Is it not bad enough that 
the doctor says that word, which shakes everyone from head to 
toe, without having to wait for x-rays? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians we can brag about our health care system, and so we 
should, but why are we spending $5 billion to cross the border 
into the U.S. to have MRIs and hip replacements?  Because we 
cannot get it done here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to solve this problem.  The Liberal government is doing 
nothing to help solve that problem.  The costs of people going 
across the border for treatment are increasing every year because 
of the lack of facilities in Canada.  We have forgotten about 
technology in Canada.  We have developed some of the best 
technology for medicine in the world, which the Americans are 
using, and we are paying to use it in the U.S. because the 
Liberal government has cut funding from the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one major failing in our health care system, and it is 
catching up on us.  Canada has not kept up with technological 
innovations.  Among the OECD countries, Canada is rated 23 out of 
29 with respect to health care. 
In other words we are in the bottom one-third of the 
industrialized countries.  We can sit here and brag all we want 
about our system but we are in the bottom third of the OECD.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technology is the key to propelling our health care system and 
we have it in the country.  I had a call the other day from one 
of my constituents.  His grandmother has a hip which is not 
working.  She can no longer walk and get to her car.  She has 
been told there is an 18 month wait.  She has to suffer for 18 
months.  What is the family doing?  They are all chipping in a 
few dollars so she can go across the border to the Mayo Clinic 
and get her hip replaced.  Are they not lucky that they all have 
a bit of money to help get their grandmother across the border? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should she have to wait?  She spent 84 years paying her 
taxes, being a great Canadian, and now we have to ship her off to 
an American hospital for a hip replacement.  How many people in 
the House have mothers and grandmothers with failing eyes who are 
waiting months and months and months to get into a hospital?  It 
is awfully nice of my friends from Malpeque and elsewhere on the 
other side to say that money is not the problem, that it is the 
way the provinces are managing the system.  That is not the 
problem.  The provinces do not have the money to manage the 
system properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not sit down and negotiate that?  Instead of giving 
great speeches about how we are here to protect the five 
principles of the health care act, why does the Minister of 
Health not talk in realistic terms?  It should be a public 
hearing.  We should let the public come to listen to the 
provincial health ministers and the federal minister debate the 
issue.  Then they could get it out in front instead of the 
nonsense that is taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The country is being divided over the health care issue. 
Provinces are trying to do their best, whether it is British 
Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, or any other one, but they are 
getting very little co-operation from the federal minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an aging population.  There will be greater demands, not 
less, on our system of health care delivery.  That will happen 
year after year after year.  Currently one in ten Canadians is 
over 65.  By the year 2025 it will be one in five, in just 
another quarter of a century.  Mr. Speaker, you and I will be in 
that age bracket 25 years from now.  We will be one in five 
instead of one in ten.  It will be tougher and harder to get our 
hips replaced and to get our eyes fixed if the program does not 
improve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very scary statistic is that the average age of a 
specialist in Canada right now is 59.  With program and training 
cutbacks and so forth, foreign countries are seducing students 
with lower tuitions, better tax environments and better training 
tools.  We will be losing more doctors and thus more specialists. 
While this is happening the Prime Minister is saying that there 
is no brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average age of specialists is 59.  They are not staying 
here.  I know in my riding, which includes Whistler, the number 
one ski resort in the world, the odd person falls down.  In fact 
the minister of fisheries is still using a cane these days 
because of a little accident on a ski hill.  We used to have four 
of the best bone doctors at the Lions Gate Hospital.  There are 
two left and one is leaving.  In Vancouver right now it takes 
months and months to see one of those specialists after that kind 
of an accident.  It is a serious problem and the government is 
not looking at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1974, with a population of 22 million, some 2,640 new doctors 
entered the system.  In 1997, with a population of 30 million, 
only 1,882 new doctors entered the system.  We cannot afford to 
lose any of these doctors to other countries, let alone the 
specialists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases Canadians are currently waiting for up to nine 
months to see a specialist.  We are in a critical situation and 
the government says that it cannot throw money at it, that it has 
to look at the system, that we have a better system than the 
Americans and that we cannot have two tiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, we have a three tier system right now. 
Every member of the House knows that.  We have a system where we 
have to make an appointment to visit a doctor.  If we need to see 
a specialist we have to wait one, three, six or nine months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also every province has increased the number of services not 
covered under medicare.  Every time I have been to my doctor's 
office there is a new list on the wall of items no longer covered 
under medicare.  Who pays for those procedures?  We pay for them 
out of our pockets.  They are not being covered by medicare. That 
is a two tier system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the constituent who is going down to the states for a 
hip replacement?  That is the third tier:  $5 billion going out 
of the country every year.  It should be staying here.  That is 
what Ralph Klein is trying to do and it is going to work very 
well.  These people will rue the day they tried to call this a 
two tier system. 
They already have a three tier system because they have let the 
medicare system go to pot.  They try to defend it by saying it is 
anti-American, which is typical Liberal-NDP action.  Anytime 
there is a problem they say it is anti-American.  That covers it 
up for all Canadians who think they are doing a good job.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very intently to the member's speech.  He mentioned a 
lot of things that have merit.  While he described some of the 
chronic problems of the health care system, he has taken all the 
examples, turned them around and shifted them solely on to the 
shoulders of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I criticized some of my other colleagues who want to get this 
done on the basis of money because I do not think it is about 
money, but the hon. member seems to think that the sole purpose 
of the federal government is to dole out money.  I should like to 
have the member's opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In approximately 20 minutes some of his colleagues in the front 
row will jump up to cross-examine the government.  They will say 
taxes have to be reduced, that expenses have to be cut and so 
forth.  Yet the member says that we should be spending 
significantly more money on health care.  I think some more 
funding is in the cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that and looking at the reality in terms of spending 
on health care, 10% of our gross domestic product is spent on 
health care.  In all seriousness, if they criticize the federal 
government for not spending enough money, what is the percentage 
of our gross domestic product that Canada should spend on health 
care?   We are already one of the highest spenders in the world. 
I want the member to be honest and tell me if the issue is about 
spending or the administration of the spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am hoping that my 
constituent who wants a hip replacement is listening to the 
debate.  I hope there are thousands of others across the country 
who are listening.  They do not give a damn about the gross 
national product or what percentage it is because they do not 
understand it.  All they know is that our health system is 
broken.  If it takes 11%, 12% or 13% to make it work, let us make 
it work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say we have the best health care system in the world.  Let us 
make sure it is the best.  With all due respect I say to the 
member that there is an administration problem.  There are more 
bureaucrats in our health ministry than we need.  The provinces 
should be running health care.  We do not need a big federal 
bureaucracy spending millions of dollars.  We need to get Mrs. 
Smith's hip fixed.  We need to get Mr. Smith's eyes fixed.  We 
need to make sure there are no long six to nine month waits to 
cure our health problems.  That is what the issue is all about. 
It is not about percentage.  It is not about spending more here 
or less there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is right.  In a few minutes we will be up during 
question period asking lots of questions about the waste of $1 
billion in HRDC.  That money should be put into health care. We 
will be asking about files.  How much did it cost to keep 39 
million HRDC files on every Canadian?   Why do we need them? Each 
of those files must have cost a few hundred bucks.  There are 
tens of millions of dollars there that could be put into health 
care instead of having a secret file on how many times Canadians 
went to hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want a file in any government department indicating how 
many times I had to go to a hospital in a year.  Do I smoke 
cigarettes or do I not?  Did I not wear my seatbelt and get a 
ticket for it?  The RCMP could show the file to an insurance 
company that will increase my insurance.  I want my health care 
fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance Party, the NDP and the Bloc will give 
Liberal members a list of the wasted money in the federal system 
that could be going toward better projects than what it is going 
to right now.  The Tories will not participate because they are 
part of the problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thought it rather strange but it sounded good that the NDP would 
be able to give the answers to the health care problems.  We 
certainly can give the answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We never have suggested that money is the only issue.  We never 
have suggested that there is an unending pocket of money to be 
used for health care.  We have said that Canadians want dollars 
put into health care.  If there is a surplus of $11.9 billion or 
$14 billion within the federal government, it is not because the 
Liberals did some good money management as compared to everything 
else they did. 
It means that they cut $25 billion out of health care, took away 
services, continued to take Canadian taxpayer money and never 
provided the services.  I want to get the member's comments on 
that.

hear the end of the question.  All I can say is that when I left 
the Government of British Columbia in 1991, because we were 
replaced by the NDP, our deficit was slightly under $1 billion 
and our health care system was working very well.  The 
deterioration started when the federal government took money away 
from us for emergency rooms.  It took $45 million out of the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my NDP friend.  They have not just asked for money. 
They have asked for a curing of the system.  We all agree with 
but it takes money to do it.  There is a lot of waste in other 
government departments that we could use and should be priorized. 
There are a lot of government departments.  We do not need the 
minister of fisheries.  Fisheries is a provincial jurisdiction. 
We should get rid of him and his department and put that money 
into health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot federal issues on which we could reduce money so 
that average Canadians could get the health care they deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian

scholarships as income.  A Canadian student lucky enough to 
receive a large scholarship is actually unlucky because he must 
pay tax to Revenue Canada on the value of the scholarship as if 
it were income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scholarships to American universities are often large because 
the tuition rates are high.  Canadian students are being forced 
to pay income tax on money they never see because much of it is 
earmarked for tuition.  This situation turns to farce when the 
student spends his whole summer working just to pay taxes.  On 
the other hand, American students receive the tuition portion of 
their scholarship tax free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This draconian tax policy is unfair to Canadian students, 
encourages the brain drain and penalizes bright students who are 
awarded the larger scholarships.  This needs to be fixed.

co-operation in these organizations is so critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The campaign message “Talk to your family about organ donation. 
Someone's life depends on it” emphasizes the key role of 
communication, as almost half of families refuse consent for 
donation, often not aware of their loved one's wishes.

Mr. Speaker, it has been almost one year since the House passed

us in Quebec City were Gary and Sharon Rosenfeldt, whose son 
Daryn was Clifford Olson's third murder victim.  This reminded us 
of the importance of this bill; when remembering Daryn as the 
third victim, the current system did not count him in the 
sentencing calculation.

us that the HRD minister is collecting detailed private 
information on each and every Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's own security audit warns that “a formal national 
information technology security awareness program has not been 
established at HRD”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is bad enough that such a database exists in the first place, 
but why is the minister not concerned that it might fall into the 
wrong hands? 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as she was doing yesterday, the hon. 
member is mixing apples and oranges.  She speaks about an audit 
in my department and that had to do with general information 
technology systems in the Department of Human Resources 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of what the privacy commissioner is looking at, 
it is a stand alone system that is highly controlled.  There is 
limited access and the information is secure. 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thought HRD grants were highly 
secure too.  Not even dead Canadians can be out of the clutches 
of this minister's database.  Mr. Speaker, once you are on that 
list you cannot get off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner is worried about it and he still is, 
even though that came out in September.  He said, “So much 
personal data on almost every person in Canada poses significant 
risks to our privacy”.  The fact that so much sensitive 
information is in the hands of a minister who cannot even seem to 
balance a chequebook is downright scary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At which point did the government decide to ignore the rights of 
Canadians' privacy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

as one of the things that we did in response to the request of 
the privacy commissioner, we have curtailed the amount of time 
for which the data is managed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the privacy commissioner has been on 
TV the last day or two with serious concerns about this.  Here is 
something out of the audit: “One administrator told the internal 
audit branch that the main method of finding out about changes to 
an employee's status or access rights is at the employee's going 
away party”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know why a minister who bungled a billion of 
their dollars is now gathering the most private intimate details 
about their lives.  Will we have to wait until the minister's 
going away party to find out? 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

member is mixing apples and oranges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the audit that she is making reference to it was actually 
identified that our security measures are satisfactory, in fact 
probably better than we would find in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the issues that are the focus of the privacy 
commissioner's review, it is a completely separate system.  It is 
stand alone.  The access is very limited.  All the information is 
encrypted.  It is secure. 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

security is great in system <I>A</I> but terrible in system 
<I>B</I>.  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's privacy commissioner is warning of HRDC's 
“extraordinarily detailed database” on everyone in Canada.  The 
privacy commissioner states bluntly, “Canadians should be 
concerned”.  The minister has been shown to be spectacularly 
unfit to safeguard our money.  Why should Canadians want to trust 
her with the personal details of their private lives? 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

about a billion dollars being missing out of my department for 
grants and contributions.  That is absolutely false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audit that we were talking about today at committee on

Revenue is merrily supplying information from our tax returns to 
his colleague, the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
without our permission.

confidentiality of information.  This is a principle that we will

</I></B></P><P align=left>One example, to be a bit more specific than I was in my answer

can tell us not to cry wolf, but there is a whole pack of wolves 
on the other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing complicated about it: all the information that 
this government has worries the privacy commissioner. And we are 
the ones crying wolf? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of National Revenue assure us that the 
information he is handing over to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is the same as what he hands over to the RCMP in the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and

myself, the element of confidentiality is a fundamental element 
we will continue to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said that there could be exchanges of information in the 
case of jointly administered programs.  I briefly alluded to 
sections of the Income Tax Act authorized us to exchange this 
information, which is done with a view to improving government 
administration.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian

warns:  “Most HRDC personnel do not have a good understanding or 
clear knowledge of current information technology security 
policies”.  How can the minister claim that her department will 
safeguard Canadians' private files when her own officials are not 
even aware of the policy on security? 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  On one side we have “not to be believed” 
and on the other side we have “fabricating”.  I urge members to 
stay away from words— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I ask the hon. secretary of state for 
finance to please keep his voice down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again the opposition is 
mixing apples and oranges.  It is trying to confuse Canadians. 
It is suggesting things that really are not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of this audit we were looking at an information 
technology system and network that has nothing to do—nothing to 
do—with the program that the privacy commissioner focused upon. 
In that case it is a stand alone system.  It is highly secure. 
There is very limited access to this information.  The 
information is encrypted and it is secure. 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it amazing that the

me that the technology that is there now is what is being used to 
gather this information on 33 million people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC security policies are not even uniform across the country. 
The security audit states:  “Variances among regional offices 
led to inconsistent IT security measures, such as various IT 
security risks not being appropriately addressed”.

privacy when she cannot even enforce a basic uniform policy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

information.  On this side of the House we are careful.  On this 
side of the House we protect data.

how appropriate it is to manage personal information in an

yesterday, people asked at an office of Human Resources

personal files.  Their request was denied, and they were referred 
to Ottawa and told to make a request for access to personal 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister tell us why it is so complicated for an

<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

citizen asking for information is indeed the person that he or 
she purports to be.  To use and benefit from the access to 
information process is the right strategy in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member knows people who want to obtain this 
information, it is available, but it should be obtained through 
the access to information system. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
let us be clear.  In order to obtain information that concerns 
me, information in my file, I go personally with my identity 
cards, me the person on file, to Human Resources Development 
Canada where I have to make a request for access to personal 
information in Ottawa with all the delays that entails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister explain why I have to submit a request for 
access, when the departments exchange personal information that 
concerns me, on request, with a snap of the finger? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

that what we do is in the context of the laws of this land. 
There is no breaking of the law in this undertaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the hon. member agrees that to use the access to 
information process, that which comes from an act of this 
parliament, is the appropriate thing to do when dealing with 
sensitive information. 
<P><A NAME="LINK143"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the minister can claim all she wants 
that she has information security under control, but the fact is 
that her own officials who run her computer systems do not even 
get security training.  Listen to this:  “Since most 
administrators received no formal information technology security 
training or had little background in IT security, their concerns 
and expertise for IT security varied and led to inconsistent 
practices”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should Canadians entrust their most private information to a 
proven bungler whose staff is not trained to handle it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would ask members, please, to address each 
other by their proper titles. 
<P><A NAME="LINK144"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member does not have to believe 
in me.  Let us review again what the privacy commissioner said. 
He said:  “Certainly, we are not aware, nor has it been brought 
to our attention, that the database has ever been compromised or 
access inappropriately obtained by virtue of deficiencies in 
security safeguards.  For that your department should be 
commended”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is not just what HRDC does with 
its computers now that is a problem, it is how it gets rid of 
them as well.  The security audit warns:  “There is no assurance 
that all hard drives are erased of potentially sensitive data 
prior to disposal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that keeping track of what leaves her office is not 
exactly the minister's specialty, but this kind of neglect leaves 
privacy vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the minister who bungled $1 billion now in possession of 
Canadians' most private information? 
<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

occasions with reference to this particular audit, it has nothing 
to do with the program that the privacy commissioner is 
reviewing.

a violation.   In his report the commissioner expressed real 
concern with the confidentiality and security of privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister has been denying it for three days.  Five months 
ago we heard the same minister denying that HRDC grants were a

again that he has indicated we are abiding by the laws.  He is

are things we can do to ensure Canadians know the information is

of privilege raised on May 16 by the hon. member for Wild Rose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The allegations made in the question of privilege are serious. 
I agree with the hon. member that members of parliament must be 
treated with respect by Correctional Service Canada and by all 
parts of the government.  That is why I have spoken at length 
with both the commissioner of Correctional Service Canada and to 
the corporate secretary to the service concerning this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I have been advised that there was no threat to 
withhold information made by anyone in Correctional Service 
Canada, nor was there any attempt to intimidate either the hon. 
member or his staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it should be noted that the commissioner and the 
corporate secretary have often dealt with the hon. member's 
assistant in the past.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the hon. member's assistant had placed a phone call to 
the corporate secretary last Friday concerning this very report. 
In this instance I have been informed that following question 
period on Monday, May 15, the corporate secretary phoned the hon. 
member's office seeking particulars regarding the report to which 
he had referred in question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the hon. member's assistant offered to fax a copy of 
the report to CSC, the corporate secretary declined that offer 
and indicated that she would get the report from senior 
Correctional Service Canada officials in the prairie region. When 
she was unable to locate the report within the CSC in a timely 
fashion, the corporate secretary phoned the hon. member's office 
and the hon. member's assistant again offered to fax her a copy 
of the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am advised that when no fax was received, the corporate 
secretary placed a further call to the hon. member's office.  She 
stated that she was on the speakerphone because she was in a 
meeting with the commissioner and the headquarters management 
team. The management team wished to discuss the report in an 
effort to respond to the hon. member's question as quickly as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been informed that the hon. member's assistant indicated 
that she would not be able to provide the document.  The 
commissioner inquired why the report would not be provided and 
was advised that the hon. member had instructed his assistant not 
to provide the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporate secretary concluded the conversation by stating 
she would continue her efforts to obtain a copy through CSC 
channels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately for the commissioner and the corporate secretary, 
this conversation took place with nine other CSC executives in 
the room.  These people have each confirmed that both the 
commissioner and the corporate secretary acted in a businesslike 
manner and that they did not at any time say that the CSC would 
refuse to offer the hon. member help or information concerning 
that report or any other Correctional Service Canada matter. 
These nine individuals have also confirmed that the tone assumed 
by both the commissioner and the corporate secretary through the 
conversation was professional and was not intimidating or rude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the corporate secretary asked me the other evening what 
would have happened if there had been nobody else in the room, I 
did not have an answer for her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having reviewed this matter personally, I am satisfied that CSC 
and its officials at all times acted in a proper and professional 
manner.  I therefore believe that there is no substance to the 
allegations put forth by the hon. member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  What we have is a situation where the 
hon. member himself was not there to hear the conversation nor 
was the hon. minister. We are getting two reports secondhand on 
both sides.  It is possible, I would imagine, for two different 
people to interpret facts in a different way.  Both hon. members 
are to be taken at their word here.  I think that their staffs 
passed down their interpretations and there may have been a 
misunderstanding on both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would find that there is no point of privilege in this 
particular case.  However, I would like some kind of a 
communication between the person who is working in the minister's 
office and the secretary who is working in the office of the 
member for Wild Rose to see if they can straighten this thing out 
and get whatever information they need.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak about the very important issue 
of health care. We have seen the decline of health care for a 
number of years. I can only go to the facts in my own riding with 
which I am very familiar.  I hear the stories from across the 
country about waiting lists.  I would like to take a few minutes 
to talk about some of these problems and then what I see as the 
solution to fix health care in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who are not from British Columbia, Victoria is in my 
riding of Saanich—Gulf Islands.  Victoria has one of two level 
two ICU pediatric intensive care units. The other is in 
Vancouver.  The Victoria level two ICU unit for children is in 
the process of closing purely because of money.  I spoke 
privately with Mr. Closson, the CEO of the Victoria health board. 
He told me that this discussion started purely because of 
economics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other concerns.  Saanich Peninsula Hospital is in my 
riding.  Health services are being restructured there as well. 
What are we seeing?  We are seeing a decrease in the level of 
service.  It is believed that the hospital will be shutting down 
the emergency department and will have only acute care beds. 
Patients on the Saanich peninsula will now have to go to Victoria 
General.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that wherever we go in this country, from coast 
to coast to coast, the level of service is decreasing and the 
waiting lists are getting longer.  The system is seriously 
broken.  I think members opposite recognize that we need to 
revisit how we deliver health care.  If we look at the 
demographics, the population is aging.  Nobody can deny that 
greater demands will be placed on our health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally believe in one national public health care system. 
We need to work harder to make sure that happens.  Our health 
care system is sacred to Canadians.  The status quo is not going 
to do it now.  We saw the magnitude of something like $25 billion 
knocked out of health care in the last seven or eight years, 
which is a significant amount of money.  When that much money is 
taken out of the pot, it is impossible to deliver the same amount 
of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the financial aspect, we also have to be very innovative. 
We have to look at new ideas and be open to them.  We have to be 
open to change on how we can best deliver the most amount of 
health care to Canadians and that the money we put in reaches the 
patient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two side to this, the money side and the innovative 
side when looking for new ideas for delivering health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first want to talk about the economics of health care.  We 
often hear members from all parties in the House talking about 
putting more money into it.  It needs to be emphasized that there 
is only one way we will be able to put the amount of money into 
health care to sustain it for a long time and that is through the 
private sector.  I am not talking about the private sector 
creating its own health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is important to understand that governments cannot 
create wealth.  The only people who can create wealth is the 
private sector.  I firmly believe, if we want to have a truly 
sustainable health care system that Canadians can be proud of, 
that we will have to cut taxes to make Canada number one in the 
world and allow the private sector to flourish so that we attract 
investors from around the world to come to Canada.  Only then 
will we begin to create wealth that the government can then use, 
through taxation, to deliver health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That me brings to the second part of why I got into politics. 
When I spoke to Mr. Closson in Victoria, he said “Mr. Lunn, yes, 
we are having to restructure what services we deliver out of what 
hospitals because there is only such money in the pot and we can 
only deliver so much.  He continued on to say that they had a 
bigger problem that was not getting the emphasis it needed.  He 
said that in Victoria this summer they will have to close 
hospital beds because they will not have the staff.  He said that 
they could not attract people for summer relief because they were 
going south.  He said that the brain drain in the health care 
sector was a real crisis, that it would take a long time to fix 
it and that they needed to start now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not addressing those concerns and it comes back to taxes. 
It is my personal belief that this all comes back to economic 
prosperity.  I firmly believe that if we are going to have the 
money to deliver health care, if we want to attract people to 
stay and if we want the graduates out of post-secondary school to 
achieve their dreams, we will have to look at how we tax people. 
I want to emphasize that because I do not believe it is said 
often enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other half of the equation is that we have to be innovative. 
We often hear about bill 11.  The New Democratic Party motion, in 
particular where it says “we have grave reservations about 
investing public funds in private for profit facilities”, are 
words it likes to use to try to raise the hair on the back of 
people's necks.  It talks about profits and corporations making 
money.  I absolutely believe that we have to look at what is 
being done in Alberta before we blatantly criticize it.  At least 
Alberta is trying to be innovative.

The border very accessible to people across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The status quo is not working.  I know my colleague from Okotoks 
is listening with interest to this and feels very passionate 
about this subject. I am no expert in this, but maybe the private 
sector could do a better job in some parts of our public system. 
For example, with MRIs and CAT scans, maybe there are places 
where clinics could be set up that could do a better job at 
delivering these services.  This would reduce the waiting lists 
across the country.  I do not know, but we have to be open to 
looking at these ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to be able to deliver health care to an aging 
population, we need to ensure that we receive the very best value 
for our health care dollars.  I do not know the actual number, 
but I think we spend something in the magnitude of $90 billion on 
health care globally across the country.  That is a number that 
we cannot even wrap our heads around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we getting $90 billion worth of health care?  The people in 
my constituency would argue that they are not.  I am going to a 
meeting on Saturday when I go home because people are really 
upset about the emergency ward being shut down at the Saanich 
Peninsula Hospital.  They are shutting down one of two ICU level 
two pediatric units in British Columbia.  All of them will now 
have to go over to the children's hospital in Vancouver.  When we 
start to withdraw our services in various areas that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally will be voting against this motion because I think 
we need to be innovative when we look at how we deliver health 
care.  We have to be open to new ideas.  They may not work but we 
need to know that and we need to let the rest of the provinces 
learn from that.  Let us try new things.  Let us collectively 
collect all of that information.  If we need to open the Canada 
Health Act, let us make it better and stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, we need to look at the economics of this.  We 
need to attract investors from all sectors.  We need to reduce 
taxes so people will want to stay in the country. It has been 
proven in every single jurisdiction, whether it is Hong Kong, 
Ireland, Ontario or Alberta, that when taxes are cut government 
revenues go up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make Canada number one.  We can be better than the United 
States.  We can be the best.  We need that economic wealth if we 
want to sustain the health care that Canadians take so much pride 
in.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a couple of questions for the member of the 
Canadian Alliance Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his comments he implied that the words that we were using 
in this motion, private for profit, were there simply to raise 
the hairs on the backs of people.  I want to tell the hon. member 
that the words in this motion are an accurate depiction of 
reality. 
The reason this motion is here today is to make a deliberation 
and a determination about where we want to go with our health 
care system.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat through question period today and heard over and over 
again from members of the Reform Party about how offended they 
were regarding breaches in privacy legislation and about their 
demands to change the law to ensure that fundamental rights are 
not violated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to something as fundamental as the right of 
Canadian citizens to quality health care, why does the member's 
party not believe it is important enough to stand up for?  Why is 
that party prepared to support the Liberals in a most passive, 
inactive response to a fundamental shift in our health care 
system?  Why would that party endorse any system that ensures 
different treatment depending on ability to pay? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, I want to remind the 
member, in case she has forgotten, that we are the Canadian 
Alliance and we are very proud of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, why are we staying on the HRDC issue?  I remind the 
member that this government gave more money in this fiscal year 
to grants and contributions under HRDC than it gave to health 
care.   That is why we are questioning it.  We do not believe in 
that program and we think we need to look at it again and 
redirect money into core programs, such as health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do I believe a private for profit health care system is 
inflammatory?  Yes.  We have specialists in the public health 
care system who get paid very well, as they should.  If they can 
also earn a living in a private setting and do just as good a 
job, then we should be open to that.  I believe in my heart that 
the status quo is not going to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us listen to the people who want to try new ideas.  This is 
not about politics, this is about something that is very dear to 
Canadians.  We have to be open to new ideas.  We have to look at 
how we deliver health care.  We have to make sure we can afford 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all respect to the member, the only thing I hear is that we 
should raise taxes, which I do not agree with.  The NDP believes 
Canadians should be taxed more.  Since I have belonged to the 
Canadian Alliance, formerly the Reform Party of Canada, nobody 
has ever once suggested that health care should not be available 
to every single Canadian.  It should be available to every single 
Canadian regardless of their ability to pay.  We in this party 
believe in that principle and we will fight for it. However, we 
will not have that if we are not open to new ideas, not willing 
to try new things and if we do not recognize that we have to have 
the economic prosperity to deliver those programs. If we stay on 
our present course, public health care will no longer be 
available.  That is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of health care is something Canadians take seriously. 
Let us look at it, cut out all the politics and work together to 
find solutions instead of playing politics with this issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to intervene in this debate which has given us 
the opportunity across party lines to examine the Canada Health 
Act and the fundamental principles of which our system of social 
insurance and health is based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own constituents have made it very clear to me, and I have 
communicated their views to the Prime Minister and the 
government, that as we attain our budgetary surplus, as we have 
done in the last three years, 50% of the surplus should be used 
to reduce taxes and amortize the external public debt and 50% 
should be used in priority areas, such as advanced education, 
research and health and health insurance.  Those principles have 
been accepted by the present government and they are the hallmark 
of the present budget and the present administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many on this side of the House would take credit for the health 
care system and the work of Paul Martin Sr., the distinguished 
minister of health of some years ago, in the establishment of the 
Canada Health Act and the establishment of the five fundamental 
principles on which it is based:  universality, 
comprehensiveness, accessibility, portability and public 
administration. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us is very specific and it has been given an 
even more specific association with the reproaches to the 
Minister of Health that he has not been combative enough, that he 
has not gone mounted on a charger against the enemy, sword in 
hand, and put them to flight.  This minister is known for his 
quiet judgment and the use, as many skilled appellate lawyers 
like himself have, of the velvet hand in the iron glove, or 
reversing it if hon. members wish, the iron hand in the velvet 
glove.  In other words, economy in the use of power, but use 
power when one has to.  It is reproaching the minister for being 
something that he is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our preference is co-operative federalism.  We are often 
reproached for not being co-operative enough.  It is interesting, 
from one of the parties in opposition, to have the reproach that 
we are not aggressive enough and we should be more so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been trying to have a dialogue with provinces over a 
period of years; not always a happy situation.  Some provinces, 
given money for education purposes, have used the moneys to build 
highways into the never never land.  We do not like that and in 
those cases we are forced to take action of a corrective nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to health care and health services, it has been 
suggested to us that we are neglecting certain legal principles. 
It has been said that we should get a reference to the supreme 
court.  That is a misunderstanding of the nature of the supreme 
court reference.  The supreme court reference is always on a 
hypothetical question.  It is always on an abstract question.  It 
is not and cannot be a substitute for a case controversy, even an 
anticipatory case controversy, and I think the minister, as an 
excellent lawyer, rightly rejected that approach and rightly 
rejected the possibility of a situation where the supreme court 
would rule against us, saying that it would not exercise 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally, however, the suggestions for disallowance of a 
provincial bill, bill 11, ignore the fact of the evolution of our 
constitutional system.  The power of disallowance has not been 
used in half a century.  In fact, I remember as a private citizen 
giving advice to a prime minister 30 years ago that the power was 
dead and that there were other remedies, and that it would be a 
constitutional voie de fait, a constitutional tort, in effect, to 
try to revive it at this stage.  That is not our way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do, however, have ample powers under the Canada Health Act to 
take corrective legislation if and when that should come to be 
demonstrated as necessary.  But the demonstration, the prior fact 
that it is demonstrated as necessary, has to be properly proven 
and properly established for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are problems that I will take the opportunity of referring 
to, legal problems, and I would hope that these would be 
discussed by the Minister of Health with his provincial 
counterparts.  One of these is simply that if private health 
facilities are allowed on a commercial basis, then under the 
provisions of NAFTA it is potentially open on a legal ground for 
foreign, financially based private institutions—I guess they are 
always financially based—from abroad, from the signatories to 
NAFTA, to enter Canada on a competitive basis.  Some would say in 
the spirit of the market economy, what is wrong with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will communicate to hon. members, nevertheless, reservations 
communicated to me by the board of one of our great hospitals in 
Vancouver—and the boards include many people with skilled 
knowledge of NAFTA—that we could see a situation of selective 
competition by specialist foreign—that is, U.S.—institutions 
with existing Canadian all-purpose hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the city of Vancouver, one such hospital I have been 
associated with, St. Paul's, right in the heart of the city, 
performs the most advanced style of research and corrective 
medicine in those areas at the frontiers of medical knowledge. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That hospital is also downtown, so it deals, particularly every 
Friday and Saturday night, with emergency cases:  hit and run 
accidents, incidents in bars, cases of drug overdose.  It is 
pointed out to me that in terms of quantifying and costing the 
hospital administration, those are cases literally handled at a 
severe loss in medical terms.  They are balanced, however, by the 
more specialized type of work this hospital does for which 
higher, offsetting compensation is available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That concern has been expressed to me and I think it is a 
serious concern, one which warrants conversations between the 
Minister of Health and his counterparts in the provinces, and 
this would include the province of Alberta.  I can see solutions 
here, but it would be premature, I think, to get into these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act as it stands has opportunities for the federal 
government, constructively and pragmatically, to talk with the 
provinces in the spirit of co-operative federalism to see if 
differences can be ironed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some principles that go beyond the five principles of 
the Canada Health Act that I have already adverted to, and it is 
perhaps worth referring to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We make full cash contributions to the provinces on the 
principle of good faith, but on a basis of specified conditions, 
and I will simply recite them for the record:  no extra billing 
by medical practitioners or dentists for insured health services, 
no user charges, and reporting at the times and in the manner 
prescribed in the regulations.  These are very basic conditions. 
If they are not complied with, the precedent exists, and it has 
been used, to cut back, or to indicate that one is prepared to 
cut back on the transferring of funds to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is enough in many cases to indicate that the power is there. 
It is certainly premature and not good federalism to apply the 
remedies before the actual case of conflict exists beyond the 
point where it can be settled by negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attitude indicated by the Minister of Health is simply this. 
On his legal advice he was satisfied that he had no grounds 
constitutionally for challenging the specific bill, the Alberta 
bill 11, at this stage.  This is not to say, though, that at a 
future stage, on particular facts, it could not arise on 
constitutional grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More importantly, however, if breaches did occur, and one was 
satisfied that they occurred through an exercise of ill faith or 
a lack of appreciation and respect for the principles of 
co-operative federalism, then the machinery could be set in 
motion of corrective legislation by the federal parliament, or 
the use of the full discretionary power that remains in the 
federal government to withhold, to reduce or to block altogether 
the transfer of funds to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say, in this context, that there are extremely positive 
initiatives which flow from the emphasis that my constituents and 
I gave, and no doubt other people in the government caucus, and I 
am sure other members on the other side of the House, to the 
emphasis on spending of surplus constructively in subsidizing 
medical research and services.  The present budget provides $2.5 
billion additional to the Canada health and social transfer.  It 
is a 25% increase over the last two years alone.  There is a 
further cash component that will reach $15.5 billion in each of 
the next four years, and it will continue to grow as the economy 
increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome, on the government side, the support given by all 
parties in opposition for spending our money on medical research. 
The amount of investment in medical research is simply 
remarkable, and I would say to members on the other side of the 
House that the concentration on the frontiers research in 
medicine in western Canada is truly remarkable.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take great pride in the concentration in British Columbia, but 
it does extend to other provinces.  That is reflected in the 
extra funding under other areas of the budget for research, for 
fundamental research in medicine, for the creation of the 
millennial professorships which will allow us to arrest the brain 
drain of our leading medical researchers who have been going to 
the United States.  There are already very welcome signs for 
people who could quadruple their salaries in the United States by 
moving there that they are satisfied with the relatively modest 
increases in their stipendiary under the millennial professorship 
plan and they intend to remain here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This joins the increase in cash transfer payments and the 
commitment that we have made and the minister in particular. 
This is a man who relies on friendly persuasion, but as an 
experienced lawyer well recognizes that a certain element of 
power can be used, if it should be, but it should not be 
escalated or opted for in too quick a fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is our position.  At the present stage we are monitoring 
the situation in relation to the province of Alberta, which has 
been specifically raised with us.  We will seek to work with the 
province of Alberta.  If we find that actions taken are 
incompatible with the Canada Health Act we will move at the 
appropriate time.  But we will continue to discuss.  We will 
bring, in particular to the attention of the province of Alberta 
and its health minister, the fears that we have under NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very sorry to see an institution like St. Paul's have 
its frontiers research experience and expertise drained away by 
competition from a sort of single issue specialist institution 
from another country.  I think that any institutions coming in 
would be expected to play their part in carrying on what might be 
called the ordinary, tedious, but so vital a part of hospital 
administration's work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the message from the minister.  He will not engage in an 
unnecessary war with the provinces.  He is determined to maintain 
the five fundamental principles of the Canada Health Act.  He is 
determined to see that there will be full co-operation by the 
provinces in the spirit of that, but he will look to ways of 
working with them to effectuate that purpose. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Vancouver Quadra lives fairly close to a 
private clinic called the Cambie Clinic.  This clinic is unable 
to look after individuals from British Columbia.  It is illegal 
for them to enter the door.  But this clinic can look after 
people from the U.S., from Asia, from Alberta, people who come 
from outside B.C.'s boundaries.  However, those who are Workers' 
Compensation Board patients and those who have become sick 
through the armed forces or the RCMP have access to that private 
clinic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this clinic cause any anxiety to the member opposite? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
that question.  This is the sort of issue that I would expect, in 
the spirit of co-operative federalism, will be part of the 
ongoing discussion between the federal government and the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the specific province that has been discussed, the province 
of Alberta, our big fear is that it will possibly lead to a two 
tier system of medicine in which the financially privileged will 
get extra and prior benefits to others.  I think that the debate 
would become simpler if it could be established that such a 
danger did not exist, but we have to work on the assumption that 
the principle of fundamental equality of access and of treatment 
is the bedrock principle of the Canada Health Act.  On specific 
cases, just as I mentioned with the NAFTA situation, I would 
myself look for further discussion.  But we cannot change that 
bedrock principle.  It is fundamental to us and fundamental to 
the Minister of Health. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am tempted to put a rather rhetorical question to 
the member, having listened to his very thoughtful remarks, and 
ask whether Liberal members of parliament were put through a 
workshop before this debate where they were all trained to 
express grave concern and then make excuses for the inaction of 
their government.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fine for us to call for co-operative, thoughtful 
approaches at the federal-provincial level, but are we really 
prepared to forsake medicare in the interest of keeping peace at 
the federal-provincial table no matter what the consequences? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If in fact we could believe for one minute that the member's 
government would be prepared to act immediately upon a violation 
of the Canada Health Act given bill 11, how can we wait for one 
second knowing the consequences under NAFTA?  Is it not better to 
be safe than sorry?  Is it not better to take every precaution 
now and amend the act so that there is no possibility of this 
bill opening the door so that multinational American corporations 
are able to enter our health care sector in Canada and provide 
hospital services? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I advise the hon. member 
that if one expects an immediate decision from NAFTA one may be 
very disappointed.  These are lengthy labyrinthine processes. The 
issue was raised with me because the answers require extensive 
research and my opinion was asked.  I simply said that there will 
be time, but it is a matter that we need to discuss with the 
provinces and to point out to the premier of Alberta that this is 
a matter of concern.  If the issue would arise as a practical 
matter, there are intermediate legal steps that we could take to 
block any action, and we would take them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important not to jump into a case-controversy 
situation before it exists.  That is why I stress the necessity 
for study and caution before acting.  As far as approaches in 
this government are concerned, my constituency has a very large 
number of medical practitioners, professors of medicine and 
others.  They have been educating me in their discipline, which I 
admire and respect.  It is part of my response to them that I 
have campaigned for the last three or four years to establish the 
centres for innovation, those special centres for medical 
research that are parts of the last two, three, four federal 
budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of my colleagues are getting the message, just as I think 
every member on the other side of the House is getting the 
message that the principle of universality of access to medical 
care is fundamental to Canadians.  If it is threatened in any way 
in the interstices of federal-provincial relations, we will come 
down on the federal side.  If there is no threat or if the 
actions of the provinces can be reconciled with those principles, 
we would be in my view ignoring our responsibilities as part of 
the federal system if we put it in issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As things stand we have full powers.  We have not at the present 
time on the legal advice given to the Minister of Justice found a 
case warranting action of a punitive nature against a province. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for the member 
for Vancouver Quadra, but in a province like Nova Scotia, for 
example, we have a critical shortage right now of nurses and 
doctors.  There is no light at the end of the tunnel that this 
situation will improve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member for Vancouver Quadra who is a representative of 
the Government of Canada what his government will do to address 
the very serious situation of the shortage of nurses and doctors 
not only in Atlantic Canada but in more rural parts of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a very crucial 
because one of the facts of life one discovers on talking to 
medical deans and deans of nursing schools is that a very large 
number of our graduates of nursing schools go on to the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one experiences any of our hospitals one will know a good 
proportion of the staff is immigrants from other countries. 
Solutions there will require larger solutions to the brain drain 
problem. 
Part of that is bound up with the principle of reducing taxes 
which is, as I have said, part of the policies my constituents 
have communicated.  We have 50% of the budget surplus going into 
tax reduction and amortization of the external debt.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have looked at the issue of subsidizing medical and nursing 
schools by means of scholarships and the like.  We still face the 
problem that the salary is too low.  We have to get more money 
into the hospitals.  Then we are getting into provincial 
jurisdiction.  We may have to move on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of us have said what a pity the constitution was not 
written in 1967.  We would have given advanced research and 
perhaps advanced education to the federal government.  Then 
somebody reminded me that in 1864 universities belonged to the 
federal government.  It was a vestige of royal power.  It was 
after a whiskey laden voyage around Cape Breton and the like that 
federal representatives dropped higher education into the 
provincial area of responsibility in 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There, though, we are dealing with problems on which the 
provinces must move, but I think proposals for ways in which the 
federal government can help will be received.  I take that as the 
thrust of the hon. member's question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, before I start on this very 
important issue, I just want to say that I could not help but 
notice what a great place the House of Commons is for our pages 
who come from all parts of the country to work and use up their 
first year of university education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is doubly exciting to know that one of those pages is with us 
today in the capacity of our <I>Hansard</I> concerns.  It is 
wonderful to see them use the experience they gain as pages in 
the House to secure gainful employment in the House of Commons in 
other capacities.  It is wonderful to see.  It is a great 
improvement for our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking about young people and what we hope to give them in the 
future, we in the New Democratic Party hold health care as the 
primary issue.  It is the core of what we do in most cases. It is 
the aspect of why people like Tommy Douglas, M. J. Coldwell and 
many others brought the issue to the forefront time and time 
again.  I also wish to say that I will be splitting my time with 
the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had mentioned to the member for Vancouver Quadra that in Nova 
Scotia we have a critical shortage of doctors.  We also have a 
critical shortage of nurses.  There is a lack of dollars in what 
the federal government is transferring to the province.  The 
provincial Conservative Party said during its last campaign that 
health care would not be reduced in any way, shape and form. Then 
it took $51 million from health care in the recent provincial 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That instils fear in the people in rural parts of my riding. 
Indeed that is the case in all of Atlantic Canada and in Nova 
Scotia especially.  It instils fear in seniors, people of fixed 
incomes and single mothers with children.  They wonder what will 
happen to them if they become seriously ill.  Will the hospital 
remain open?  Will there be an ambulance for them?  Will they be 
able to afford the so-called extra user fees that are being 
charged? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now pharmacare for seniors in Nova Scotia has gone up 
another $160 per person.  They simply cannot afford that.  Any 
government, municipal, provincial or federal, should not balance 
its books on the backs of our most vulnerable people, our 
seniors. In many cases they are veterans who fought overseas and 
lost their brothers and sisters.  Many of them raised their 
families during the depression, during war and during the 
post-war eras as well.  It is absolutely unacceptable for 
governments to treat them that way in their golden years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our seniors are our knowledge base.  We talk about a knowledge 
based economy.  Our seniors have more history and more knowledge 
than we could ever care to think about.  For governments to treat 
them as a cash cow on which to balance their books is simply 
unacceptable.  There are many other avenues on which to balance 
the books without taking it out on our seniors, especially those 
in the beautiful province of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the hospitals right now, the stress within hospitals 
is phenomenal.  In the news today the husband of a personal 
friend of mine required bypass surgery. 
He went to the hospital the other day and waited seven hours for 
his surgery.  He was told at the last minute that his surgery had 
been cancelled and he would have to come back another day.  This 
is the type of health care we are giving people in Nova Scotia. 
This man happens to be 63 years old.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we imagine the confidence the youth of the country would 
have in the health care system as they go through life after 
reading stories like this one?  It is sometimes amazing and 
sometimes not very surprising at all why some people choose 
greener pastures in other parts of the world when they leave 
Canada.  We in the House all say that Canada is the number one 
country in the world.  One of the reasons for saying that is our 
health care system or our medicare system.  It is absolutely 
unacceptable that governments at all levels in all provinces have 
been chipping away at that most basic and fundamental foundation 
by which we define ourselves as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other hon. members have mentioned that it is time for the 
Minister of Health, along with all premiers of other provinces, 
territorial leaders and aboriginal leaders, to get together in a 
health care summit to start defining the health care of the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In poll after poll the people of Canada have demanded through 
their tax dollars a publicly funded not for profit health care 
system.  This is what Canadians want.  This is what they are 
saying loud and clear.  It is not very difficult.  They are 
asking for a publicly funded not for profit health care system to 
be available for everybody from coast to coast to coast, no 
matter what their income and where they live.  In the unlikely 
event that they require emergency health care, long term health 
care, or any health care under any circumstance, they want the 
service to be there for them.  Right now many Canadians are 
losing trust and faith in the system.  It is absolutely 
unacceptable that we as members of parliament, the leaders of the 
country, are saying to them that we really do not know the future 
of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always like to recite the story of when Tommy Douglas first 
introduced health care.  He was hung in effigy by doctors in 
Saskatchewan.  He was considered Satan.  They asked how he could 
take away the right to earn dollars from medicine and socialize 
medicine, how he could possibly think like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many New Democrat members of parliament were at the Canadian 
Medical Association awards dinner the year before last when Tommy 
Douglas was posthumously inducted to the Canadian Medical 
Association Hall of Fame.  This just showed how ahead of the 
times he was.  He personally fought battles so that the 
experiences he had would not happen to any child in the country. 
Our party and indeed all Canadians owe Mr. Douglas, Mr. Coldwell 
and many others in the movement a sincere debt of gratitude. 
Without them we probably would not be having this debate today 
and we would probably be into the American style right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable that many groups would love to see a two tier 
system.  Insurance companies would love it.  American 
multinational corporations would love it.  Health care spending 
is anywhere from $40 billion to $90 billion.  The figures bounce 
around a lot.  Many private businesses would love to get their 
hands on that.  The fact is that it would place a tremendous 
burden on those Canadians who cannot afford it, those Canadians 
who are on fixed incomes, and those Canadians who do not have the 
wherewithal to compete like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should remind the House that according to the latest 
statistics from the United States 43 million Americans have no 
access to health care services, a land that calls itself the land 
of the great, the home of the brave, the land of great democracy. 
I would hate to be in the House years from now saying that three 
million Canadians have no access to health care. 
That would be a disgraceful thing to have to say.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is why the New Democrats have brought forth this motion 
today, so we can stress to the public and fellow members of 
parliament from all parties the seriousness of this issue.  We 
cannot allow health care to be eroded any more than it has now. 
We have to reinvest in health care and understand that it is the 
core public concern today.  Everyone talks about health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all governments at all levels to sit back and say that they 
will think about it and that they are gravely concerned about it 
is absolutely unacceptable.  We have to put those words into 
action. Part of that action starts with this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members of parliament to think deeply, to look 
into their hearts and talk to their constituents.  See what they 
say about this motion and what they are saying about health care. 
I am sure they would find that the majority of people in their 
ridings agree with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members themselves probably would agree as well, if they would 
get away from the politics of it and understand what defines us 
as Canadians. Members should forget about being Liberal, Canadian 
Alliance, Bloc Quebecois, Tory or New Democrat and think in terms 
of being fellow Canadians, and to know that no matter where they 
go in the country if they become ill they will have the best 
quality health care possible. People should not have to go into a 
hospital wondering whether they have enough money for a 
particular procedure.  That would be unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I can do one thing in this House of Commons as a member of 
parliament for my own two children, it is to stand and fight for 
the number one concern of Canadians, which is health care.  That 
is why I am standing today on this very important subject. I want 
my children to have the same access to health care that I had 
when I broke my leg, when I had my appendix out, when I had my 
tonsils out, when I fell out of a tree, landed on a fence and 
stayed for a week at the Vancouver children's hospital back in 
the 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had access in all those instances. My parents had nine 
children and ran a group home for over 400 children.  All those 
kids had access to health care as well. We have to be able to say 
that 20 or 30 years from now the children of tomorrow will have 
the same quality access I had when I was a young man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House for the opportunity to speak to this very 
important motion.  I literally beg all members of parliament from 
all parties to seriously consider this motion and to support the 
New Democrats on this one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I had an opportunity to ask the member from Vancouver 
what he thought of a private facility in Vancouver.  Let me take 
the opportunity to ask the member from Nova Scotia what he thinks 
of the Wolfville hospital in Nova Scotia.  That hospital was 
threatened with closure and the Wolfville citizens said, “You 
are not closing down our hospital”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what they did.  They said they would disregard some of 
the rules and regulations and charge people for some things such 
as syringes when they go to emergency.  That is against the 
Canada Health Act according to the rules.  That is a user fee. 
However, the people of Wolfville said their hospital was more 
important than some rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member from Nova Scotia say to the citizens of 
Wolfville who valued their hospital more than the rules? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member, 
who himself is a physician, for his question.  Unfortunately I do 
not know about the situation at Wolfville at all.  It is the 
first I have heard of it and I apologize for not knowing about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will relate an experience that I do know.  Dr. Herb Dickieson, 
who is the leader of the Prince Edward Island New Democrats, was 
elected in 1995 because he stood on the principle that he did not 
want his O'Leary hospital closed.  At that time the government of 
the day in Prince Edward Island was going to shut it down.  He 
fought along with the citizens of that area to keep that hospital 
open. I am not aware of what he did in terms of funding in order 
to keep the hospital open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only say to the people of Wolfville that I would assume, 
and I do not know this for sure, that they probably would not 
have had to go to the user fee aspect if all governments had 
respected and honoured the commitment of dollars to that hospital 
and had not put those people in that situation in the first 
place. Desperate times call for desperate measures.  I am sure 
they do not like charging user fees for other things as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In retrospect, I would have to say that without knowing the 
incident, those people did what they felt they had to do and 
there is not much I can say about it.  I wish them well in their 
endeavours but the fact is, if provincial and federal governments 
did not download and shirk their responsibilities, the people 
probably would not have faced that situation in the first place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today's debate is a very important one in terms of the 
future of health care in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from Regina.  Regina was the birthplace of public health 
care in the country many years ago. It really started with the 
CCF in the election of 1944.  It was after the Great Depression 
and there had not been an election since 1938 in the province. 
The previous Liberal government had gone on for six years during 
the war without an election campaign.  When the campaign came, 
Tommy Douglas and the CCF were swept to power.  One of the 
promises they made to the people of that province was for health 
care and hospitalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those days there was not any thought at all of the federal 
government cost sharing health care.  Under our constitution, 
health care comes under the jurisdiction of the provinces and the 
federal government gets involved through the use of the spending 
power, but it was a long time before those discussions were held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CCF came to power in that small province of about one 
million people.  They had come through the Great Depression and a 
tremendous dust bowl in terms of drought.  There was bankruptcy 
such that the province was almost foreclosed upon by the bankers. 
Despite that, three or four years after it came to power, the 
CCF set up the first hospitalization plan anywhere in North 
America.  That was about 1948. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the years went on, it became more and more popular and the 
idea caught on around the country that public health care was 
extremely important.  By the time the CCF government had improved 
and strengthened the economy with balanced budgets and so on, it 
made a commitment.  In 1960 with Tommy Douglas as premier, it 
promised it would bring in North America's first public medicare 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Saskatchewan re-elected Tommy Douglas and the CCF 
and they had a mandate to bring in public health care.  Tommy 
Douglas resigned about a year later to become the leader of the 
federal New Democratic Party, but the minister of education, Mr. 
Woodrow Lloyd, became premier.  It was Mr. Lloyd who was premier 
at the time medicare became a reality in the province of 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was 14 or 15 years old at the time and just going into high 
school.  I remember the summer of 1961 or 1962 when health care 
came in.  There was a doctors' strike against what they called 
the socialistic move to intervene in the marketplace in terms of 
health care.  The opposition of course was the Liberal Party but 
it was a very conservative Liberal Party, quite similar to what 
is called the Canadian Alliance today or the Reform Party.  It 
opposed this as a tremendous infringement on the freedom of 
Saskatchewan people and predicted that it would spread across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The doctors' strike went on for about 28 days and created a 
great deal of emotion.  There were many demonstrations and a lot 
of struggle and debate in the province, but the provincial 
government prevailed.  I remember very well seeing a picture of 
the leader of the opposition, because the legislature was not in 
session in the summer, going to the legislative chamber and 
demanding that the speaker call a special session to deal with 
the doctors' strike.  Of course it did not happen, but I still 
remember the picture of him kicking the door of the Saskatchewan 
legislature.  He had his foot up in the air and he was kicking 
the door.  That snapshot of him went right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people prevailed and the CCF government of Woodrow Lloyd 
prevailed.  In 1961 and 1962 we had our first ever medicare 
system anywhere in the country, financed entirely by the people 
of the province of Saskatchewan as the federal government was not 
involved in any way in a cost sharing program in those days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years later the federal government established the Hall 
commission with Justice Emmett Hall of the supreme court. 
He looked at the idea of a national health care program and 
federal funding for health care along with the provinces in a 
co-funding operation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1967, centennial year, I think Lester Pearson was Prime 
Minister at the time and the health minister was Paul Martin Sr., 
the federal government finally brought in a national health care 
program modelled on the prototype in the province of 
Saskatchewan.  The agreement was that the federal government 
would cost share with the provinces 50% of the costs for health 
care. In other words for every dollar put up by the province of 
Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, or British Columbia the federal 
government would put up a dollar as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the original negotiations the federal government was not 
going to be that benevolent or generous. But guess what, it was 
an Ontario premier in those days as well, and the Government of 
Ontario under Robarts was threatening not to participate in the 
national health care program.  When the federal government 
decided to put up 50% of the costs, the carrot was so big that 
even Ontario with its wealth in those days decided it could not 
afford not to participate and became part of the national health 
care program we know today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things went pretty smoothly for a number of years.  Then in the 
1970s if I recall—I was a member of parliament by that time 
being elected in 1968—the federal government of Pierre Trudeau 
brought in a bill that untied the federal contribution from going 
directly to health care in terms of the transfers to the 
provinces.  I remember Tommy Douglas sat roughly where the 
Conservative Party is sitting today at the far end of the 
Chamber.  He stood up and said that if we untied the federal 
contribution to health care, that which goes directly to health 
care, the day would come when the federal government involvement 
would lessen gradually and gradually and we would have a crisis 
in the funding of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember him speaking in Winnipeg in about 1981 or 1982 and 
giving the same warning in front of a huge crowd at a national 
convention.  I remember him saying that people assume that health 
care is here to stay.  We assume it is here.  It is a good plan. 
We assume it is here forever but some day someone is going to try 
to take it away and that day is not too far down the road. How 
true that was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to sit back in those days and predict who would try to 
do it, I do not think I would have predicted it would be a 
Liberal government that would get us into a health care crisis. 
However it was the Liberal government, the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Finance and their famous budget in 1995 that had the 
most radical cutbacks in social programs and health care this 
country has ever seen at any level of jurisdiction in the history 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look across the way at the member from New Brunswick, the 
minister in charge of homelessness, the Minister of Labour.  I 
know her background in activism.  I sometimes wonder how she can 
sit in that government and support it after these tremendous 
conservative cutbacks that Brian Mulroney would not have even 
contemplated in his most conservative days when he was Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the legacy of the Liberal Party that sits across the 
way.  Now we are in a crisis.  We are in a crisis where some 
provinces, such as Alberta, are getting into the business of two 
tier medicine and looking at privatizing part of the medical 
system, allowing people to get back into health care for a 
profit. If we go down that steep and slippery road, the time will 
come when health care will be destroyed.  We will have two 
systems in this country, one for the rich who can afford to buy 
the extras, jump the queues, get health care, and one for the 
poor who have to line up at the doors of public care 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason public health care started in the first place was so 
that each and every Canadian citizen, regardless of wealth, 
regardless of income, regardless of region would have equal 
access to a public health care system.  That is the kind of 
system we are going to have to keep in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying something that makes it even more sad in 
my opinion.  I picked up this morning's newspaper and the 
headline was, “Federal surplus is higher by $11 billion”.  The 
federal surplus is $11 billion higher for the year 1999-2000 than 
was predicted in the budget last February.  In other words the 
federal surplus will be $14.9 billion instead of the predicted 
$3.9 billion, an extra $11 billion.  A lot of that extra $11 
billion could have been spent on health care in terms of helping 
the crisis from one end of the country to the other.

deficit.  It is not as if we cannot afford to do this.  The money 
is there.  What we are lacking is the political will.  That is 
why we tabled this motion in the House today to try to instigate 
a great national debate, to say “Health care is the most 
important priority in the country.  It is about time we reinvest 
in social programs, starting with health care”.  The money is 
there.  Let us use the people's money to invest in a good health 
care system for the people of this country for our future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member for his participation in 
this debate, for his words and the actions of his party in 
bringing this debate forward.  It is very timely and very useful 
that we embark on this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank him for the feint praise that he heaped upon the 
Progressive Conservative Party, although I believe it should be 
real praise when one compares the record of that government to 
the current government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully because I, like all members of the 
House of Commons and the Senate, am extremely concerned about 
what is taking place.  One only has to visit our local hospitals, 
and I have, the Aberdeen Hospital in New Glasgow, St. Martha's in 
Antigonish and other health clinics, to know the effect that is 
being felt at this time as a result of the drastic cutbacks that 
have been downloaded to the provinces as a result of this 
government's actions.  It is, as the previous speaker has 
indicated, very stark when one considers that this surplus 
continues to grow while the provinces are crying out for 
reinvestment in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fine to engage in this debate and to talk about what is 
wrong with the system, but what seems to be missing is:  What are 
some positive initiatives that we can take? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party and the hon. member for New 
Brunswick Southwest, who is our health critic, have put forward 
some positive ideas.  He talked first and foremost about the 
resources that need to be put back in, putting them back to 1993 
levels.  He also talked about convening a first ministers' 
conference with premiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What positive initiatives are the hon. member and his party 
putting forward as to how we could fix the crisis in health care? 
We could talk about it until the cows come home, but what is he 
presenting as a positive initiative that would work to move the 
yardstick forward in this area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have a five point 
plan, which starts with more cash from the federal government. 
That is what I spoke about today.  The federal government is 
putting in about 12 cents or 13 cents on the dollar.  It used to 
be 50 cents on the dollar and we have to start moving back toward 
that level of contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  You know that is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  The member across the way is now 
trying to interject.  He is saying that it is untrue.  It is 12 
cents or 13 cents on the dollar, depending on the province. 
Those are well documented facts.  The only people who dispute 
them are some Liberal members of the House of Commons.  If we 
look at Statistics Canada, that is the kind of information we 
get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other things we are talking about are home care and 
pharmacare, as well as amending the Canada Health Act to make 
sure that bill 11 in Alberta does not pass without the Government 
of Alberta being penalized.  Those are three or four of the 
points that we are talking about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the member's nice, historical overview of health 
care.  He mentioned Justice Emmett Hall.  It is interesting to 
note that Justice Emmett Hall's son became an orthopaedic surgeon 
and was so frustrated with the Canadian situation and the 
technology that we have in Canada that he left.  He has abandoned 
the country of his dad and the country that trained him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I try to go to the home community of each speaker on this issue 
and ask a question about what is going on.  I lived in 
Regina—Qu'Appelle as a young man and I have a couple of 
colleagues who still practise there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member think, when there is a shortage of capital 
in his community, of a foundation that is set up to raise money 
for those nasty for profit corporations?  It raises money for 
MRIs and for equipment that is not available in any other 
connection.  Those foundations are set up literally across the 
country to raise capital.  What does he think of those dollars 
from those dirty, for profit corporations?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that 
people have to do this.  The money is in the federal treasury. 
There should be more money put into transfers from the federal 
government.  The surplus is now $11 billion more than it was 
thought to be only a few months ago.  The federal government 
should be putting up its fair share of the money.  If that were 
to happen, then private fundraising would not be required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also say to the member that Saskatchewan is one of the few 
provinces which backfilled the drop in federal contributions 
dollar for dollar.  That is actually quite a feat for a small 
province which does not have a big treasury like Alberta or 
Ontario.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be splitting my time with my colleague from Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to participate in today's debate concerning the 
Canada Health Act and to deal with the issue of enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal health minister is responsible for monitoring 
provincial and territorial health systems to ensure that they 
adhere to the criteria and conditions of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's publicly funded health care system is a partnership. 
In terms of the federal government, Health Canada is responsible 
for the administration of the Canada Health Act, while the 
provinces and the territories are responsible for the 
organization and the delivery of health care services in their 
respective jurisdictions.  This shared role requires us to work 
in close co-operation with one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act contains nine requirements that the 
provinces must fulfil to receive their full share of federal 
funds, which are provided to the provinces and territories in the 
form of tax points and cash under the CHST.  These include the 
five program criteria of public administration, 
comprehensiveness, universality, portability and accessibility, 
which apply to insured health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the five criteria, there are two conditions of 
the act, information and recognition, which apply to not only 
insured health services, but also extended health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members may know, insured health services are medically 
necessary hospital and physician services.  Extended health care 
services are nursing home intermediate care services, adult 
residential care services, home care services and ambulatory care 
services.  Finally, there are the extra billing and user charge 
provisions, which only apply to insured health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act provides sufficient flexibility for the 
provinces and territories to restructure their health care 
systems so that they continue to respond to the individual needs 
of their populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to Canada's public health care system can occur without 
violating the principles of the Canada Health Act.  We all know 
that the time has come for a national effort to renew and 
strengthen medicare.  All governments believe that the status quo 
is no longer an option.  The changes required can and should 
occur within our public health care system.  The principles of 
the Canada Health Act are broad and flexible enough to allow for 
innovation while building on the strengths of our single payer 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's commitment to maintaining the 
principles of the act is to ensure that the integrity of one of 
the best health care systems in the world is not jeopardized and 
that Canadians continue to have access to a comprehensive range 
of medically necessary services on the basis of their need, not 
on their ability to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many potential issues of non-compliance with the Canada Health 
Act criteria or conditions over the years have been resolved 
without resorting to CHA penalties.  In these instances, 
discussion and negotiation at the official level were 
instrumental in bringing these matters to a satisfactory 
conclusion.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event that discussions and negotiations between the 
federal and provincial officials prove ineffective in reaching a 
resolution, the Canada Health Act provides a process by which 
suspected violations can be investigated and resolved, or indeed 
penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal health minister receives information and is of 
the opinion that there is a suspected violation of the act, the 
minister must undertake consultations with provincial and 
territorial counterparts.  Only after these consultations does 
the minister proceed to invoke the penalty provisions of the act, 
if the facts of the matter under investigation confirm that a CHA 
violation has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canada Health Act penalties for violations of the 
criteria and conditions are financial.  The government uses moral 
suasion and financial penalties under the CHST to persuade the 
provinces and territories to take corrective action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government is prepared to act if there are violations, 
let me reiterate that it is always our hope that we do not reach 
that point, that issues of potential non-compliance can be 
resolved through discussions and negotiations, without resorting 
to penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are broad, fundamental challenges which are facing the 
health care system in Canada.  The federal government is 
committed to working with the provinces and the territories to 
meet these challenges.  We would always prefer to build on the 
co-operative relationship we have shared with provinces and 
territories over the years, and to build on the creativity and 
innovation which created our public health care system that is 
the envy of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the auditor general's concerns about Health 
Canada's capacity to enforce its responsibilities vis-à-vis the 
Canada Health Act, the federal minister made a statement to the 
House of Commons on Thursday, May 11, announcing a budget 
increase of $4 million to the existing $1.5 million for the 
Canada Health Act division.  This will allow for an increased 
enforcement capacity to monitor and assess compliance with the 
act across Canada, as well as to investigate potential 
non-compliance issues on a proactive basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the announcement of the realignment of the 
administration of activities at Health Canada on April 17 will 
strengthen the department's regional presence and increase the 
policy and analysis capability in the regions to strengthen 
Health Canada's ability to monitor Canada Health Act compliance 
on the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information is an essential tool for the federal government in 
administering the Canada Health Act.  To that end, Health Canada 
is developing an improved information gathering framework that 
will assist the federal government in improving its monitoring, 
assessment and reporting of provincial and territorial compliance 
with the criteria and conditions of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada's response to the auditor general's report, and to 
Alberta's bill 11, will result in the development of a process 
which will ensure a comprehensive and fair approach to the 
administration of the Canada Health Act.  This new approach will 
take time to implement and requires the support of our provincial 
partners.  This is why the government is working closely and 
collaboratively with the provinces and territories on all the 
issues related to the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is to ensure that the underlying principles of our 
health care system are protected for the benefit of all 
Canadians.  By working with the provinces we are putting a much 
needed emphasis on making the co-operation and administration of 
our cherished, publicly financed health care system more 
transparent and accountable to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to reaffirm the government's commitment to 
working with the provinces and territories to ensure compliance 
with the principles and conditions of the Canada Health Act.  The 
changes that are needed to see us into the 21st century are 
possible within the public health care system, and are fully 
consistent with and supportive of the principles of the Canada 
Health Act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we heard a great deal from the Liberal member about 
plans by the government to enforce the Canada Health Act.  This 
is of course used as an excuse for its inaction on bill 11. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member is quite simple.  All the enforcement 
officers in the world will not mean anything if there is nothing 
left to enforce.  A million medicare cops will not do anything if 
the bill and the consequences under NAFTA are allowed to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member not see the importance today of amending the 
Canada Health Act to ensure that there is absolutely no 
possibility of private for profit hospitals being allowed to be 
included as part of our health care system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I outlined very clearly 
the process by which the federal government would respond if 
there were a violation of the Canada Health Act.  Having the 
appropriate information and the proper monitoring is critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out to my hon. colleague one of the difficulties we 
have.  Earlier she talked about the fact the we as a federal 
government gave about 11 cents to 13 cents to the provinces. 
Again I want to correct that.  It is about 33 cents to 34 cents 
in cash and tax points.  I heard some provincial members say that 
they do not recognize tax points.  If that is the case we should 
simply take them back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to my colleague, one way to add to the accountability 
of provinces that are responsible for the administration of 
health care is to add two new principles: accountability and 
transparency.  If the provinces do not feel that the tax points 
are of much use to them, maybe the federal government should take 
them back and go back to silos.  My hon. colleague from Regina 
Qu'Appelle mentioned the fact that we had gone to the CHST.  I 
would suggest to him that maybe we should go back to silos and 
say that this is for health; this is for post-secondary 
education; and this is for social services.  This would put the 
onus back on the provinces where it belongs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of accountability, when we transfer money to the 
provinces we have no idea what they do with it.  Coming from the 
province of Ontario I can point out very clearly that the 
province is sitting on half a billion dollars.  At this point it 
has the ability to provide for tax cuts, but it does not seem to 
be able to provide for the administration of hospitals, which is 
in its jurisdiction.  Those are two principles that my hon. 
colleague might think about in this debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if I am correct, I should remind the member that the 
change to the CHST was made under his government.  We know that 
is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member admit that lack of funding is the cause of the 
problem we are seeing in health care right now?  Every province 
is asking for health care funding to be restored to the 1993-94 
level.  Why is the member's government not restoring it so we can 
stop the privatization of our health care?  I did a survey in my 
riding— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry to 
interrupt but the member's time has expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I point out to my 
colleague that last year the government restored $11.5 billion in 
health care transfer payments.  It was the largest amount of 
money that any government put into the health care system.  Again 
this year we put in $2.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have provinces crying for money at the same time as they are 
giving tax cuts.  The Ontario government will mail every taxpayer 
in that province a $200 cheque.  That is $1 billion.  If it can 
afford those kind of tax cuts while sitting on half a billion 
dollars, it cannot cry wolf too often as it has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe my colleague might ask her kissing cousins in Ontario, 
although I am not too sure how close they are in terms of kissing 
any more, what is going on.  How can it afford tax cuts but not 
afford to restore health care which according to her is a 
priority under its watch?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
while my colleague was attempting in a very articulate manner to 
answer the question we could hear cat calls coming across 
indicating that it was not enough.  That is the mantra of the 
NDP.  Perhaps that member should cross back into the NDP fold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  No, no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  He does not want her.  I can 
understand.  This is an interesting situation.  I thank the NDP 
for putting the motion forward today.  We owe it to all of our 
constituents to talk about the issue of health care, the issue of 
bill 11, the issue of whether or not it is enough, the issue of 
the tax points and the issue of cash transfers.  It is very 
confusing.  All my constituents want us to do is to fix the darn 
system.  They do not care much about who is responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the difficulty, however, is that we have this convoluted 
mechanism called Canada whereby we have entered into agreements. 
Members opposite know full well that the federal government's 
role is to collect revenue from around the country and 
redistribute it to the provinces for various services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not allowed to deal directly under the terms of the 
constitution and the agreement.  It is up to us to provide a 
certain floor, ceiling or whatever.  It is clearly up to the 
provincial governments to deliver the health care services to the 
people.  All we need do to find out the difficulties is to have a 
loved one who is involved in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I am here most of the time, my wife and I, and my wife 
particularly, are going through the terrible experience of having 
a family member with a serious illness who is in and out of 
hospital.  She is phoning 911 at three o'clock in the morning and 
frantically going to the hospital where she is being kept for two 
or three days and then discharged back into her home.  Then it is 
911 again and the ambulance costs.  I am talking about this 
occurrence happening five or six times a month every month for 
the last several months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tried to find out how we can put her into some kind of a 
care facility to ensure that someone is available to take care of 
her and can react to it.  The waiting lists are incredible.  We 
are talking years, unless one is in a position to do what the 
former Reform Party and current CA would have us do, that is 
simply privatize it all.  Then if one has the money the waiting 
list disappears.  We do not believe in that.  I think this debate 
is all about a vision for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democrats should always be congratulated for the 
leadership that some of their former leaders, Tommy Douglas and 
others, showed in bringing into Saskatchewan and then on to the 
national stage the necessity for a health care system based on 
the five principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is universality, which means that it is available 
to all regardless of financial status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is accessibility, which means that we should be able 
within any kind of reasonable timeframe to access whatever health 
care is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is comprehensiveness, an issue that I think the 
provinces are flirting with, never mind bill 11.  When they start 
deregulating and decommissioning certain health care services 
from OHIP, in the case of Ontario, and start saying they will not 
pay for certain services, in essence they are flirting with 
damaging the comprehensiveness of the system.  That is an issue I 
have not heard members talk about today.  I think it is something 
we need to watch very carefully.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth is portability, the ability for a Canadian from 
British Columbia, Nova Scotia or Ontario to access a 
comprehensive health care plan right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth and final one is administration.  What is the issue 
there?  The issue is that if we do what some would do, if we do 
what Tom Long, the former leader of the former Reform Party and 
the former treasurer of Alberta who is a member of the former 
Reform Party, public administration goes out the window.  I am 
sure hon. members get my point in using the word former. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that important?  Canadians know that there must be a 
sense of control in costs and in what kind of health care is 
being provided.  If it is turned over to the private sector in a 
for profit scenario, I think we lose that control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about another issue.  The New Democrats should be 
particularly interested in this one.  There is a health clinic in 
my home of Sault Ste. Marie.  It is a health clinic that operates 
on a capitation system.  In a city of 80,000 with two hospitals 
there is also a health clinic.  Capitation means it submits a 
roster, a list of the members of the health clinic, to the 
provincial government and the provincial government gives the 
clinic a cheque.  It does not operate on the OHIP principle.  It 
operates under capitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who do we think built it?  It was not the government.  I can 
tell hon. members that no provincial or federal money was put 
into the health clinic in Sault Ste. Marie.  It was built by the 
private sector, except that the private sector in this case 
happened to be the United Steelworkers of America.  It was built 
by the union.  It was built with its funds, with its membership 
money. It was done in the fifties and it was great.  The reason I 
know a bit about it is that my dad was the national director of 
the union at the time it was built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I often quote a man named Johnny Barker in Sault Ste. Marie who 
was a great union leader.  He had one of the greatest lines that 
I like to tell NDP members they should remember.  Johnny Barker 
once said “Don't let your bleeding heart run away with your 
bloody head”.  It is a terrific quote and NDP members should 
think about it more often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Johnny Barker and my dad built the health clinic in the Soo. 
Some say it was a fight between Sault Ste. Marie and Hamilton. 
The reason it went to the Soo, they tell me, is that dad and 
Johnny Barker used to get together and drink the odd glass of 
pop.  They got to be great buddies and they decided the clinic 
should go to the Soo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who knows what the reason was?  However, do members know why it 
was so effective?  It was because there was a large membership, 
which tragically does not exist there any more, that worked at 
the steel plant.  There was a local community that could be 
harnessed.  There was a membership that could be developed and 
brought in for health care services, and it worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tried to promote this idea in other communities.  I went 
to the Chinguacousy Health Board in the city of Brampton when I 
was in the provincial house and suggested that it take a look at 
the model in the Soo.  It is a terrific concept.  It involves the 
community.  It makes sure that health care is delivered. It was 
built with private dollars.  It is operated on a not for profit 
basis and it truly works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of just putting their blinkers on and saying that under 
no circumstances will they look at anything, perhaps members of 
the NDP should take a look at what happened in Sault Ste. Marie. 
That clinic, which was built with union money, could be a model 
for many different communities around the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Chinguacousy I thought it made sense to get the 
CAW and Chrysler involved.  Again a certain membership or a group 
of people could be identified to be involved.  Perhaps the region 
of Peel could have been involved. Unfortunately it did not happen 
because people still had the grandiose idea that great new 
hospitals would be built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a wonderful hospital in my riding, the Credit Valley 
Hospital.  We call it the Credit Valley Hilton.  Those days are 
over. 
We will not be building those kinds of facilities any more.  We 
have to find new ways of delivering both in terms of medical 
services and in terms of the facilities in which they get 
delivered.  We have to find new ways of doing it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of just fearmongering and pretending that none of this 
should be talked about, and that we should just amend the Canada 
Health Act and punish people, we need to look at news ways and 
new alternatives.  They exist.  I invite the NDP members to check 
the record, talk to the steelworkers and check out the operation 
in the Sault.  I think they will find it is good advice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, knowing the member's background and his affinity to the 
labour movement many years ago, is he not embarrassed about 
sitting in a caucus that is led by a government that has 
instigated the largest cutbacks in the history of our country in 
terms of social programs and health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1995 budget of the Minister of Finance was the most 
draconian budget in terms of cutbacks in the history of our 
country.  This government almost makes Brian Mulroney look like a 
raving socialist in comparison, in terms of funding for social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member can tell the House whether or not he 
has lobbied the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister to 
reverse their ways, to mend their ways and to open up the public 
purse and make sure there is more money going into health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he saw the statement yesterday as well that the surplus 
is now $11 billion more than the government thought it was going 
to be.  It is $14.9 billion instead of $3.9 billion.  The money 
is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has this member done to lobby the Minister of Finance and 
the Prime Minister, or is he part of this great conservative 
trend in the Liberal Party that makes Brian Mulroney look like a 
compassionate socialist? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am probably what one 
would call a right wing Liberal.  I make no apologies for that. 
In fact, not only am I not embarrassed, I am proud of a 
government that wiped out a $42 billion deficit and put this 
country into a sound financial position so that we can in fact 
deal with the problems in health care.  Believe me, we will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am used to getting misrepresentation from some members 
opposite in the official opposition, but it disturbs me when a 
man of the quality of the member from Regina stands here and says 
something that he knows is patently false.  To say that this 
government's transfer for health care is 13 cents is just not 
true.  The member knows that in 1977 the federal government 
reduced its share of the tax base and gave the power to tax for 
that reduction directly to the provinces.  They are called tax 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that when we combine cash and tax points the 
amount being transferred is 33 cents.  He says that it used to 50 
cents.  It was when it started.  It was reduced because the 
provinces increased the number of items being covered down to 41 
cents.  The real truth here, and let us not play too much with 
numbers, is that it has gone from 41% down to 33%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, that needs to be increased.  There is no question about it. 
We will work with the provinces.  The one thing I can say is that 
this government is not about to hand blank cheques to Mike Harris 
and Ralph Klein so they can turn around and give 30% tax cuts to 
their wealthy friends without putting that money into health 
care.  We are going to make sure it goes where it is needed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is certainly a pleasure to rise and speak to this motion 
today.  I find the motion takes a strange direction.  Rather than 
have a negative approach, why do we not have a positive approach? 
Why do we not say what we can do and not what we cannot do?  Why 
do we not say what we need is to replenish the health care system 
back to where it was in 1994, or 1995 at least, rather than where 
it is now, where there is such a crisis in health care and no one 
knows whether they can get a doctor, whether the doctor who comes 
to their community is going to stay, whether he is going to leave 
and what is going to happen?  It is the same with nurses and all 
other health care workers.  It is a crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anyone thinks health care it is not in a crisis they are 
certainly operating under false pretences.  It is clear to all of 
us.  It is certainly clear in my riding where a site was prepared 
and the foundation laid for a new hospital years ago.  They have 
been gathering information and money for seven years and are 
still in the planning stages for this hospital.  We are still 
having trouble putting it together because of the reduction in 
transfers for health care funding from the federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government unilaterally began cutting health care 
funds when it was the number one issue.  Health care is the one 
thing that ties the whole country together. Every region, every 
province and every culture depends on our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been proud of our health care system in Canada.  It has 
been the model that many countries have used as the example upon 
which to build their health care systems.  Then the Liberal 
government, which has always prided itself on having a social 
interest and a social conscience, just sucks the system dry. It 
has reduced funding steadily year after year and then makes these 
tiny, insignificant motions to try to pretend it has put money 
back into health care.  However, it has not fooled anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers have not been fooled.  They are all calling for 
health care to be the number one issue for the federal government 
to address.  Every community is asking the federal government to 
re-invest in health care and to work with the health communities 
to come up with a better system to resolve the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens when the federal government withdraws its funding? 
The provinces then have to explore other areas.  They have to 
experiment.  They have to become innovative.  If the funding was 
back at former levels, the province of Alberta would have no need 
to do what it has done, and other provinces would have no need to 
explore the other innovative angles and efforts they are trying 
to experiment with now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a rural area in Nova Scotia that has a lot of small 
communities.  We used to have several hospitals in my riding but 
they have continually been reduced.  They have been turned into 
clinics, into senior citizens' homes or into something like that. 
Meanwhile, these communities are losing their health care system. 
When a community loses a hospital or a health care facility, or 
when a facility deteriorates and does not maintain its standards 
because it has no money, then the doctors leave. It is very 
important for doctors to maintain their practice and to have the 
ability update their technical knowledge and training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is a work in progress.  A doctor never finishes 
training in health care, especially with the recent developments 
in technology, genetics, health care, medications and treatments. 
Today doctors have to maintain their ability to compete by 
continuing their education and everything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The doctors in my riding are faced with obsolete hospitals and 
equipment.  The money is not there for the new technology and new 
equipment that is need to treat the patients and for the doctors 
to continue their training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The waiting lists are incredible.  A short time ago I visited 
one of the main hospitals in my riding.  The hallways were filled 
with patients in beds waiting to get a room or just to get into 
the hospital.  The waiting room was full of patients who could 
not get a doctor.  When they did get a doctor he or she was a 
stranger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For decades people had family doctors who they could become 
familiar with, get to know, feel comfortable with and trust. 
Health care is a very personal thing.  Today people do not know 
their doctors because the doctors change so fast.  When the 
doctors realize that the workload is too much and the 
responsibility too great they pack up and go somewhere else. They 
go wherever there is more money, less work, less hours, more 
people to share the burden and a much higher quality of life for 
doctors.   We lose our health care workers.  We lose our nurses. 
What I primarily run into is the loss of doctors, the turn over 
in doctors and the shortage of doctors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my job as a member of parliament, I deal a lot with Canada 
pension clients, Canada pension disabled clients, worker's 
compensation victims and people who need but cannot access the 
health care system.  They cannot get the help from the doctors 
because the doctors do not have the time to deal with these 
issues.  If it is not an urgent issue, the doctors will not deal 
with it.  They deal with the patients who need help right away. 
Meanwhile, these people who are disabled and are applying for 
disability, or need help in worker's compensation or need 
specialists to qualify for pensions to which they are entitled, 
cannot get support from the health care industry because they are 
just too busy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I talked to a person who had a bad accident. The 
person is totally disabled with broken bones and organs that are 
damaged. 
He cannot get his doctor to write a report because the doctor is 
just too busy dealing with people who need care right now. I have 
asked the doctor on two occasions to write us a report.  I do not 
tell him what to say, but we need a report from the doctor and we 
cannot get it.  That goes on and on.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Just when patients get to know their family doctor, the doctor 
changes or moves.  This creates a lot of stress for people, 
especially seniors and disabled people who have effectively 
educated their doctor about their problems, their ailments, their 
lifestyle and their situation, and then they have start all over 
again.  When it happens again and again it becomes even more 
stressful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we can say about this motion is that it should be a motion 
to restore health care funding.  That is the solution.  Yes, 
other changes are needed but they are not going happen without 
the money to back up the innovative ideas that are necessary. 
There is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all boils down to the fact that the government has reduced 
the funding to the provinces and then tells the provinces that 
they have to honour the Canada Health Act but does not give the 
leadership nor the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many months, years and times has the issue of health care 
been brought up in the House of Commons?  The Minister of Health 
continues to say that they are working on a plan and that they 
need ideas and leadership.  The ideas and the leadership are 
supposed to come from the government. It blames everybody else 
for the problem but itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that the problem starts right over 
there with the Department of Health and the Minister of Health 
because they will not make the commitment to health care, which 
we have always had in this country, to maintain the health care 
system of which we have been so proud for so many years.  It is 
not complicated.  All the government has to do is to restore the 
funding to 1993-94 levels and most of these problems will go 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not disagree that health care is changing really fast. 
Technology, medications and treatments are changing at lightning 
speed and they have to be baked into this whole process, but 
without the money that will never happen.  Until the government 
makes a fundamental decision to re-fund health care, all these 
ideas that the minister speculates about will never see the light 
of day without the funding, the research, the development, the 
technology and the tools to work with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are siding with the premiers of all the provinces.  I do not 
remember this ever happening before, but all the provinces have 
now united in one stand and are demanding that the federal 
government restore the money to health care that it has taken 
away over the years.  I have never seen this happen on any other 
issue, not immigration, not transportation, not anything except 
health care.  The federal government should listen to the 
premiers and respect what they are saying because it is actually 
the provinces that deliver the health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces and the provincial ministers of health understand 
the problem and they know what the solutions are.  They are 
calling on the federal government to restore health care funding. 
It is not complicated.  They are on the front lines of this 
whole debate.  They know what the problem is and they know how to 
solve it.  They have spoken very clearly with one voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just hope that the federal Liberal government will get the 
message to stop stalling and to do something.  Day after day, 
week after week, month after month, year after year there are two 
issues in the House that get stalled, one is the health care 
issue and the other is the helicopter issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again the federal government says that it is 
developing a plan and exploring the options.  The Minister of 
National Defence has now said that the file is moving.  Is that 
not what he has said? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  A top priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  The minister said that the helicopter 
situation is a top priority.  I think he is now saying that the 
file is moving.  Well, it is moving awfully slowly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same with the health care file.  The government talks 
about solving the health care problem but it does absolutely zero 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is simple:  Just listen to the premiers of all 
parties in all the provinces because they are the frontline 
people.  They are the ones who have to deal with the actual 
health care system.  It is a simple as that.  If it would just do 
that, the problem would be solved.  Mr. Speaker, I am depending 
on you to tell them to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
quite interested to listen to the member, a fellow Nova Scotian, 
who spoke about some of the health care problems which we 
experience in the province of Nova Scotia. He certainly outlined 
many of them well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke about the waiting lists in hospitals and delays because 
of the lack of funding in the health care system.  Those 
illustrations support the motion we put forward because we are 
suggesting that public funds not be allowed to move out into the 
private realm and the for profit hospitals.  Public funds should 
be maintained within the public system.  We should strengthen, 
maintain and keep this system of publicly funded health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested in hearing the hon. member's views on 
another aspect of health care which is very important to this 
entire picture of the health care system.  That is the issue of 
pharmacare, one thing which we feel is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have witnessed it in my province and many seniors have spoken 
to me that quite often they need certain medications but cannot 
afford them because of their fixed incomes.  Sometimes they 
either go without their medication or stretch it out in a way 
that is unrealistic according to how it has been prescribed.  If 
they are supposed to take it three times a day, perhaps they will 
end up taking it once a week.  They figure they can make the 
prescriptions last longer because they just cannot afford their 
medication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the hon. member has any comments on that 
aspect of the health care system.  There is a need for the 
government to put funding into a national pharmacare system to 
aid our seniors who have given so much of their lives to our 
communities.  It is time that we helped them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, in our province the provincial government has 
moved to the extent that it costs the seniors more for their 
pharmacare program.  It has increased the amount that the seniors 
have to contribute to the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member comment on that aspect of the health care 
system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member does make an 
excellent point. Our party's main point is there has to be a 
stable funding program on a long term basis, a program which will 
allow the departments of health in the provinces to have a long 
term plan. This is not an industry or a business that can have a 
six month plan or even a five year plan.  The planning has to go 
much further than that.  To do that the government has to provide 
stable funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the pharmacare issue, the member brought up a really good 
point.  Let me read from the Liberal red book two of 1997.  “The 
Liberal government endorses pharmacare as a long term national 
objective”.  I am sure the hon. member will be pleased to hear 
that. It goes on to say, “Some provinces are already developing 
a system of drug care.  We will work with our provincial partners 
to ensure that all Canadians have access to medically necessary 
drugs within the public health care system”.   The hon. member's 
problem will be solved because surely the Liberals will honour 
all their promises in the red book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say, “The federal government has a role to play 
in bringing together its provincial and territorial partners”. 
This is strange because it refused to meet with its provincial 
and territorial partners on the health care issue, but if it says 
so in the red book, it must be true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Like the GST promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  What else does it say?  It is full of 
good promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“A new Liberal government will pursue a strategy, together with 
representatives of provincial and territorial governments”—why 
does it not do that—“health care service providers, private 
payers”—private payers, is that not interesting—“and 
consumers to address the fact that drugs have become an essential 
component of health care.  We will develop with these groups a 
timetable and fiscal framework for the implementation of 
universal public coverage for medically necessary prescription 
drugs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to put that on the record for the member.  It 
answers his question.  It is right in the red book, so surely the 
Liberals are going to develop a pharmacare program.  The hon. 
member from Nova Scotia can sleep well tonight.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very delighted to rise in this debate because I 
have wanted to have my say about the problems with health care 
financing for some time.  I think the debate has been skewed in 
the wrong direction.  It is not a matter of giving more money to 
medicare, it is a matter of greater accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that my NDP colleagues are leaving the Chamber now as I 
begin a speech.  They really ought to listen to it because it is 
not just a matter of throwing money at issues, it is a matter of 
creating the climate of transparency in corporations that deliver 
the health services to ensure that the money is adequately spent. 
What I am alluding to is the fact that hospitals around the 
country are some of the greatest users of taxpayers' money, 
something in the order of $30 billion to $40 billion a year. They 
are the prime deliverers of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that hospitals are charities and charities are 
not governed by any meaningful legislation which requires them to 
meet the standards of corporate governance, standards of 
transparency.  The result is that across the country we will find 
hospitals that vary in the quality of their financial 
administration and their ability to efficiently deliver health 
services. We are talking about billions of dollars of waste 
because we cannot see whether the hospitals are spending the 
money effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened with the cutbacks in health care, whether the 
cutbacks were done by the federal government or the cutbacks were 
done by the provincial governments during the mid-1990s, is a 
cutting off of the services rather than cutting back the 
administration.  This was a phenomenon that occurred in the 
United Kingdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Kingdom went through a similar period when it tried 
to rein in the high costs of medicare.  The British government 
cut back investments in its hospitals and what happened was an 
enormous cutback in nurses and nursing staff and of course the 
administrators remained.  The Tony Blair government learned its 
lesson and in fact it is restoring many of the service personnel 
and cutting back on the administrators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you might ask what is he really talking about? Does 
he have any real examples?  We do not have to go very far in my 
community to discover a real example of waste in the delivery of 
hospital services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next to my own riding is the Hamilton Health Sciences 
Corporation which last year posted a $40 million deficit.  This 
coming year it is expected to post a $90 million deficit.  Mr. 
Speaker, it has something very much to do with the failure of the 
board of governors or the failure of the hospital management to 
adequately inform the board of governors on the needs of that 
hospital and the proper functioning of that hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, Mr. Speaker, there was a scandal not very many years ago 
at the hospital. The chief director was brought in at a huge 
salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  They are all getting huge salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Oh, yes.  Her salary was something like 
$400,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is, after a couple of years it was decided that she 
was not an efficient chief executive officer so the hospital let 
her go.  It gave her a $1.8 million golden handshake.  It 
absorbed in one fell swoop all the money that had been raised by 
the various hospital association charitable foundations.  They 
are out there doing telethons raising money to try to buy x-ray 
machines and that kind of thing and that money goes to a golden 
handshake for an executive it is trying to unload. It is the same 
situation around the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, in a recent article from my local newspaper it is 
suggesting that not only is the Hamilton Health Sciences 
Corporation in difficulty, but other hospitals are in trouble. 
The London Health Sciences Centre in 1999 ran an $18 million 
deficit. Mount Sinai and Mississauga Trillium hospitals were in 
an $11 million deficit and the Cardiff Valley hospital was at a 
$10 million deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may say that the problem is simply that they have a 
greater demand than they have the money to meet it. That is 
possible, but other hospitals around the country do run within 
their means.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So long as we cannot be sure, so long as we do not have the 
ability to thoroughly examine the decisions made by a 
corporation, made by a hospital or any kind of social services 
institute, so long as we do not have the opportunity to examine 
how they are making those decisions, we cannot be sure that they 
are running efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed on a smaller scale, in Hamilton there was a classic 
instance that was the joke of all the social services providers a 
few years ago.  If you recall, Mr. Speaker, the Harris government 
came in and said it was going to cut 20% off the bottom line of 
all the social services organizations that were receiving Ontario 
provincial funds.  An organization in my riding absorbed that 20% 
cut by eliminating all the service staff and just retaining the 
administrators and it continued to function without delivering 
any services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is when we talk about cuts to health care we have to 
remember that we cannot do cuts to health care until we create 
the efficiencies.  The reality is if an organization, whether it 
is a corporation or a non-profit organization or a charity, is 
running really inefficiently and we compare it against an 
organization that is running very efficiently and we cut 20%, the 
efficient organization is hurt and the inefficient organization 
is not touched, no problem, because it can absorb the cutback in 
its inefficiencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the situation. We have done nothing as the federal 
government and we have done nothing as the provincial government 
to correct problem.  What we need to do is we need to have a 
debate here not about whether we should restore funding to health 
care, we should have a debate about how we can make health care 
delivery more transparent, how we can make it more accountable, 
how we can make sure that those executive officers are reporting 
correctly to their boards of governors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have known, and other members in this House will have had the 
experience as well, instances where politicians—oh, that word 
politicians—have been on the boards of directors of hospitals in 
their communities and they have not been able to get the salaries 
of their chief officers.  They cannot get the information.  They 
are told, “No, you cannot have that sort of information.  That 
is confidential”.  The difficulty as the situation sits right 
now is that every hospital and other charitable organizations 
that deliver social services are only as responsible as their 
letters patent that were originally formulated for them, and only 
as responsible as their boards of directors show due diligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the sad things about social services and charities that 
deliver social or medical services is that too often what happens 
is people get on the board of directors in order to have a 
credential or in order to have a place in society so that when 
they are at cocktail parties they can show what grand 
contributors they are to the community because they are on the 
cancer society or a hospital board or whatever you will, Mr. 
Speaker.  But too often these people do not do the due diligence 
and they leave it to their executive officers and those executive 
officers are not of the very finest quality.  We the public have 
no guarantee that our taxpayers' money is going to be spent 
efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There we have it, Mr. Speaker.  It is so simple.  Why can we not 
just do something in this legislature?  I have to say I have been 
struggling with this issue about bringing transparency and 
accountability to not for profit organizations for four years no, 
maybe five years, and so far we have not come to grips with it. 
So far, although I will admit I have had some, shall we say, 
warmth of response from cabinet, still there has not been a 
commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is saddest of all is the fact that the very conservative 
government that we see in Ontario and elsewhere in the country 
but let us take Ontario as the example, is always saying that we 
must cut taxes, we must cut spending, we must be efficient.  That 
is not the government that is demanding transparency of the very 
institutions that are absolutely swallowing up money right, left 
and centre and not giving us a guarantee that money is being used 
effectively.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, it is something that we as a House should certainly 
address.  We should try to look at the problem of bringing 
charitable organizations to account, particularly hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a tradition, through the 1970s and especially the 
1980s and early 1990s, that when we have a problem in society or 
a problem where people are not getting the care they deserve—and 
it is a serious problem, I will not argue that—we seem to think 
that it can be answered by simply throwing more money at it.  I 
think the government has seen only too well, particularly in the 
case of the money that went to the Atlantic provinces to help the 
situation when the cod moratorium took effect, a clear example of 
where it was very difficult to simply fire money at a problem and 
solve it.  The analogy to the health care delivery systems is 
apt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really care about Canadians who are in need and who are 
not getting the services from the health system that they need, 
then we as a parliament should be moving as quickly as possible 
to create legislation that brings charities and non-profit 
organizations under the same level of transparency that now 
exists for for profit corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the members opposite do not realize this, but the 
Canada Corporations Act, under which many hospitals and other 
charitable organizations are incorporated, provides standards of 
corporate governance only for for profit organizations.  It 
provides standards of transparency only for for profit 
enterprises.  It specifically excludes from those requirements 
non-profit organizations.  We have a situation in which a large 
hospital, which may be spending billions of dollars, literally, 
does not come under the same type of minimum regulations or 
minimum requirements for transparency and governance that is 
required of a for profit corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask you, Mr. Speaker, at the very minimum, let us bring 
non-profit organizations and charities under the Canada 
Corporations Act when they incorporate so that they at least have 
a minimum level of transparency, accountability and standards of 
governance.  At least let us do that.  We would save billions. 
The federal government would not have to add to the transfers for 
health care, the provincial governments would save money and all 
Canadians would benefit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened carefully to my colleague's remarks.  I find it quite 
interesting that CEOs of major urban hospitals, particularly in 
the Greater Toronto Area, are paid amounts of money that are 
really quite surprising.  They are paid $400,000 to $600,000, 
which is four to six times the amount of money that CEOs of 
entire municipalities are paid.  I think his point about 
transparency and the need to look at it is well taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little concerned, however, about the comment that could 
be taken as castigating all volunteers.  It is my view that many 
of the people who sit on hospital and charitable boards, as well 
as those who work in the community, do so out of dedication and 
commitment to the community, not simply so they can talk about it 
at cocktail parties.  Would the member agree with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is right.  It is 
always dangerous to make sweeping statements.  There are a great 
many volunteers in all types of social and medical service 
delivery charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that hospitals have under their control enormous 
amounts of money.  I think the thing we have to be concerned 
about is that people who volunteer for these boards must remember 
that when they volunteer for them they are shouldering a very 
high responsibility.  I would suggest, with great respect to the 
many people who do volunteer for such organizations, that they 
should not volunteer unless they are prepared to make the 
commitment and to put real energy into it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of the coin—and I think this is where there 
is a fundamental problem—too often people get on these boards 
with only the very best of intentions, but they do not bring to 
the job the kind of cynical rigour that is sometimes needed by 
the boards of directors of large corporations which are managing 
huge amounts of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to change the Canada Corporations Act.  We need to set 
standards for the boards of directors to ensure that they will 
understand very clearly what their responsibilities are and 
realize that if they take on that appointment they do so with the 
full knowledge that they have a responsibility that is exactly 
equivalent to, say, running the Steel Company of Canada, or 
Dofasco, or any other large corporation, and perhaps even more 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of organizations that deliver our medical 
services—and we all need and cherish the ability to have free 
services for all Canadians—this is a heavy responsibility and 
one which people who serve on these boards of directors can never 
take lightly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
no amount of speech-making about the faults of others, whether 
they be hospital executives, hospital management or provincial 
governments, such as we have heard from the Liberal member who 
just spoke, can absolve this federal government of the fact that 
it was responsible for the single most massive reduction in 
federal transfer payments to the provinces for health care that 
this country has ever seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the root of all evil.  The lack of that money is the 
root of all evil when it comes to our health care system.  It is 
what has put hospitals, emergency wards and other health care 
facilities in this country in the situation they are in today. 
It is what has set up premiers like Mike Harris and Ralph Klein, 
who, for ideological purposes, would like to privatize our health 
care system.  They are using the federal reductions as a cover 
for their philosophical agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The massive reduction in 1995 came on top of a systematic 
withdrawal of the federal government from funding for medicare 
that began in 1982 under a Liberal government.  It was under one 
of the budgets of Allan MacEachen in which the first unilateral 
withdrawal of funding took place, and the first shattering of the 
federal/provincial fiscal partnership that medicare represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From then on, every single federal government has proceeded to 
unilaterally withdraw more and more money from medicare, 
particularly in 1995, the crowning glory of cutbacks that the 
current Minister of Finance brought in, until we arrived at a 
point where the federal government now feels that it does not 
have the moral authority to act, even when a province like 
Alberta has done something which is so clearly a threat to the 
spirit and the future and the practice of medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does it feel it does not have that moral authority?  Because 
of that systematic reduction, culminating in 1995, which puts the 
Minister of Health in the pathetic position of only being able to 
say to himself—and here we perhaps give him more credit than he 
is due—that he might want to act but he feels he cannot because 
the federal government has ruled itself out by being a government 
that only contributes somewhere between 8 or 13 or 15 cents on 
the dollar, depending on whose figures are believed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time, in 1984, in the context of a previous threat 
to medicare that developed through the proliferation of extra 
billing by doctors and the charging of user fees by provinces, 
when a previous Liberal government and a previous Liberal health 
minister, Monique Bégin, was able to act.  Though it took a while 
to make them act.  It took a lot of pressuring by the NDP at that 
time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a bit of a rerun for those of us who were there at 
that time.  The NDP pushed the Liberal government to do something 
about health care.  The Tories at that time were silent, in the 
same way that the Tories and the Canadian Alliance members are 
silent today with respect to protecting our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least the minister of health at that time eventually acted 
and brought in amendments to the legislation that governed 
medicare in the country.  It was not always called the Canada 
Health Act.  It was the medicare act and there was another act. 
Those two acts were brought together and made into the Canada 
Health Act, which provided penalties for provinces that allowed 
the things which the federal government saw to be a threat to 
medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has admitted that what is going on in Alberta is 
a threat to medicare.  The difference is that this time we have a 
Liberal government that does not have the political courage, the 
political will, or whatever we want to call it, to act in a way 
that previous government did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the history of medicare is written, and when the eulogy for 
medicare is given some day, we hope not, but if it is ever given, 
they will point to this parliament, this Minister of Health and 
this Liberal government as the one federal government that not 
only should have done something about bill 11, but should never 
have done what it did in 1995, which created the context for bill 
11 and all the other attacks on medicare that we have seen since 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this really a surprise?  The Liberals like to take credit for 
medicare, but maybe they will not be so high and mighty about 
medicare from here on in because let us remember that they really 
only act when they perceive that they have to act.  Only in this 
case they have even lacked the will to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring of course to the fact that the Liberals first 
promised medicare in 1919 to the people of Canada.  When did they 
deliver?  It was 1967.  There is always a bit of lead time with 
Liberal promises.  If we calculate the time between 1919 and 1967 
we could figure out when those promises about pharmacare and home 
care will be lived up to.  We just have to calculate the lead 
time that always exists between Liberal promises and delivery. 
Of course, some things are never delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see here is part of a larger pattern that I do not have 
time to go into, unfortunately.  However, medicare is one of the 
things that people value.  It is on a list of things that have 
been under attack by the government.  I think of medicare, the 
CBC, the CNR and Air Canada.  I think of a lot of different 
public sector institutions, things that we have done through the 
agency of government, through the agency of public ownership. 
These things have been systematically undermined and destroyed by 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent days we have seen the reticence on the front benches 
to act with respect to the CBC.  We see a lack of will when it 
comes to medicare.  The government already sold out the CNR a 
long time ago, in one of the greatest acts of quizzling economics 
I have ever seen, and it finished the job on Air Canada that the 
Tories started.  It has allowed the whole country to be bought up 
week after week by foreign corporations.  It is not a record of 
which I would be very proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all the great cheering that goes on in question period 
whenever a Liberal cabinet minister gets up to deliver one of 
those—I am not sure what to call it.  I am trying to think of 
something polite.  I certainly would not call it an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was astounded at the member who spoke before me, albeit he 
pointed to some legitimate problems that exist with respect to 
how hospitals are run and the way some provinces behave. 
However, the way the federal government acted in 1995, the way it 
has continued to act now that we have a surplus by not restoring 
full federal funding to medicare, and the way the Minister of 
Health has refused to act decisively with respect to bill 11 all 
adds up to a strong condemnation of the Liberal government with 
respect to health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All we have asked in this motion is for the government to do 
what is its responsibility to do with respect to medicare and 
what is within its constitutional jurisdiction.  It can put 
conditions on the spending of its own money.  It can say to the 
province of Alberta that it will not transfer money to that 
province if it allows for profit hospitals to provide insured 
services.  It is within the power of the federal government to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say that it is against the spirit and the intent of medicare 
and of the Canada Health Act.  If the Minister of Health does not 
agree with us about the current act, he should do what we have 
asked him to do today and change it, change the Canada Health Act 
as former ministers of health have done and create an entirely 
different situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know when we are getting to the Minister of Health because he 
gets up and says that we do not have any ideas and that we are 
not putting forth any suggestions.  We have put forward 
suggestions with respect to restoring federal funding so he has 
the moral authority to act and also with respect to innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years we have been talking in this place about how medicare 
was only the first step and that the next step was to develop a 
more preventive, community oriented model.  Now we have suggested 
dealing with problems with respect to high drug prices and the 
provision of pharmacare and home care.  I am just getting started 
on the way the Liberals sold out the low cost of drugs with

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should work 
towards incorporating a measure of proportional representation in 
the federal electoral system, making use of a framework which 
includes: (a) a report on proportional representation prepared by 
an all-party committee after extensive public hearings; (b) a 
referendum to be held on this issue where the question shall be 
whether electors favour replacing the present system with a 
system proposed by the committee as concurred in by the House;

House as a private member, asking that the House conduct a study 
in a parliamentary committee of the idea of incorporating a 
measure of proportional representation into our electoral system; 
that a committee look at the various models which might be 
appropriate for the country; and that, if the House adopts one of 
these models, we put that model to the people of the country in a 
referendum at or around the time of the next federal election 
campaign.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do this realizing that this issue has hardly ever been 
discussed in the Parliament of Canada.  The last time there was a 
private member's motion on the whole idea of changing our 
electoral system and bringing in a measure of proportional 
representation was back in 1979 when then Liberal member Jean-Luc 
Pepin proposed a non-votable motion that was debated by the 
House.  The last time parliament actually voted on the idea of 
proportional representation was back in 1923.  That was a long 
time ago so I think the time has come now for a debate on whether 
or not we should look at changing our electoral system. 
Parliament was strangely silent on the issue for most of the last 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that one of the great issues of the next few 
years will be the issue of governance or democracy, how we govern 
ourselves as a people, how we organize our society, how we 
organize our institutions.  We talk about governance.  We talk 
about democracy.  We talk about an electoral system.  We talk 
about the empowerment of people to make sure that they have a say 
over what kind of government, what kind of society and what kind 
of institutions they want to evolve in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have to take a serious look at changing our system. 
Most Canadians do not realize that we are one of only three 
countries in the world with more than eight million people that 
has a democratic system which does not have some measure of 
proportional representation.  The other countries are the United 
States and India.  The world has passed us by in terms of 
evolving an electoral system that reflects more accurately what 
the people want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the mother of parliaments, the British parliament, 
current Prime Minister Tony Blair in his policy of devolution of 
powers created a Scottish parliament where some people are 
elected through a measure of PR.  It is the same in the Welsh 
parliament.  As a matter of fact in the British Isles all members 
of parliament who go to the European parliament from Great 
Britain are elected strictly by proportional representation and 
the Jenkins committee has recommended PR in England, which I 
predict will happen in the election after next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being left behind by modern democracies in the world 
along with the United States and India by using the old first 
past the post system designed for a two party system.  We have 
left that behind us about 50 or 60 years ago with a multiparty 
system that creates tremendous distortions in terms of the 
representation in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very well when I was first elected back in 1968. 
There was excitement in the air.  People were engaging in 
politics.  People were involved in campaigns and fully 80% of the 
people in that election campaign cast a ballot.  It was common in 
those days that 80% or more of the people would participate in 
federal campaigns and in provincial campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last campaign in June 1997 the turnout was 67% of the 
polls. The turnout has been plummeting in every province in the 
last 25 or 30 years.  The reason for it is that people feel 
alienated from the political process.  They feel politicians do 
not listen to them, that politicians do not reflect what they 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is truth in that and that is one reason people do not 
participate in the political system.  I submit that we are 
sleepwalking to a crisis in democracy.  If we do not look at 
changing the system to have it more reflective, we will have a 
real crisis in a few years time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a look now at how distorted the present electoral 
system is.  I will use the last election campaign.  In 1997 the 
Liberal Party received 38% of the vote.  It got a solid majority 
that could constitutionally run the country for five years in a 
system that concentrates a lot of power in the hands of the Prime 
Minister's Office and the Privy Council Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the opposition side.  We have two parties that 
got around 19% of the vote, the Reform Party and the Conservative 
Party.  The Conservative Party got 19 seats and the Reform Party 
got 60 seats, with the same number of Canadians voting for each 
of those two political parties.  Each of the NDP and the Bloc 
Quebecois got 11% of the vote.  The Bloc Quebecois got 44 seats 
and the NDP got 21 seats, with the same number of Canadians 
casting a ballot for each of the political parties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a House of Commons that does not reflect or mirror how 
the people of the country voted three years ago.  When people 
turn on their television sets and see a debate in the House of 
Commons, parliament does not reflect or mirror the composition of 
the electorate that voted for us in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, we are one of only three countries in the world with 
a population of over eight million people which does not have a 
measure of proportional representation in the electoral system. 
That will have to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the history of our country back in 1921.  We have 
had many majority governments elected over the years but only 
four of them were elected by a majority of the people.  Except 
for John Diefenbaker in 1958, Mackenzie King in 1945 and Brian 
Mulroney who had almost 50% of the noes in 1984, all other 
majorities have been elected by a minority, which means that a 
minority of the people are governing and ruling a majority of 
people.  That leads to all kinds of alienation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result many issues in the country are now realities that 
would not have been realities if we had proportional 
representation.  I will name but a couple.  I remember the 1988 
election campaign.  We had two parties, the Liberal Party and the 
New Democratic Party, campaigning against the free trade 
agreement with the United States.  Between the Liberals and the 
NDP, the two parties together picked up around 56% or 57% of the 
vote.  That was reflective of the opinion polls which said that 
the overwhelming majority of the people did not like the free 
trade deal with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brian Mulroney and the Conservatives got 42% of the vote.  They 
won a big majority.  Free trade went through and it changed the 
country forever.  It was the same with the GST.  There have been 
many such distortions over the years despite the fact that the 
majority of people voted against the party that was advocating a 
particular policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have another distortion.  For example, at the provincial 
level today two provinces have a majority one party government: 
British Columbia and Quebec.  The leading opposition party 
received more votes than the governing party that by itself forms 
a majority.  We have those kinds of distortions in the electoral 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we need change.  The motion today is saying that we 
should strike a parliamentary committee to look at the ways of 
incorporating a measure of proportional representation into our 
system.  The motion is very deliberate in saying that we should 
set up a committee to study the ways of incorporating a measure 
of PR into the system or, in other words, mix some PR into the 
system.  There are many examples of this in New Zealand, Germany 
and other countries.  We have the Welsh example and the Scottish 
example.  There are many other examples in the world where we 
have a measure of PR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been studies in this country which have talked about 
a top-up of 20 members, 30 members, one-third of the members, 
one-half of the members, or a quarter of the members being 
elected according to the proportion of votes that a party 
receives.  If at the end of the process a party receives 30% of 
the votes, say in the province of Quebec, that party should get 
roughly 30% of the members in the House of Commons from the 
province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have great regional distortions today.  I look across the way 
and I see three of my friends from the Liberal Party in Ontario. 
In Ontario in the last campaign 101 members of the 103 are 
Liberals.  We would say that everyone in Ontario is a Liberal, 
but if we look at the results in Ontario the Liberals are members 
of a minority party in Ontario, receiving slightly over 49% of 
the vote.  The majority of Ontarians voted for the NDP, the 
Reform Party, the Conservative Party and for independents. Almost 
51% of Ontario residents voted that way yet only 2 of the 103 
members from Ontario represent members who are now sitting in 
opposition in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that fosters good nation building or a good 
vision of what the country should be.  It has created great 
balkanization and great regionalism in the country.  If we can 
bulk up with heavy votes in certain regions we can do well, but 
if the vote is scattered across the country we do not do anywhere 
near as well.  I think it has created all kinds of regional 
tensions.

way, including my friend from Hamilton who is opposed to the idea

That is why I want a parliamentary committee to look at what 
models may be appropriate to our unique federation.  Then take 
that model back to the House of Commons.  If it is approved by 
the House of Commons, then go to the people in a referendum and 
let the people decide whether they want the status quo or a new 
model of proportional representation. What could be more 
democratic than that in terms of a process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to my Liberal friends across the way to give this 
process a chance.  Let us have a discussion for the first time in 
the history of our country since 1923 as to whether or not we 
should modernize our electoral system and whether or not we 
should engage people and empower people in a system that is much 
more relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to regionalism.  Imagine an election where we had a measure 
of proportional representation.  Proportional representation 
would force all the parties in the country to have a national 
vision about Canada.  If they did not have a national vision they 
would not receive votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would force us in the NDP to look more seriously at Quebec 
and its uniqueness and distinctiveness.  In the same way, 
Canadian Alliance would look at Quebec and its uniqueness and 
distinctiveness.  It would force the Liberal Party to take the 
crisis of Saskatchewan and Manitoba farmers more seriously.   As 
a matter of fact, part of the frustration was when farmers from 
our province came here to lobby, when they asked why the 
government would not take them more seriously the answer was it 
only has one seat in Saskatchewan anyway, so what does it matter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had PR, a vote in Kamsack, Saskatchewan would be worth as 
much as a vote in Trinity—Spadina.  It would force all parties 
to take all parts of the country equally seriously in terms of a 
national vision as to where they want the country to go.  A dream 
people have, is that we have national parties that would knit the 
country together to unite it.  PR would probably be the greatest 
step toward national unity we could possibly dream of in terms of 
the future of our country.  I recommend that people think about 
that as we go on with the debate over the next few weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing is the empowerment of people.  If we look at 
federal and provincial campaigns, the majority of people vote for 
losers.  How many times have we heard, “Well, I vote for losers. 
My person did not win.  My woman did not win.  My man did not 
win. My candidate did not win. I wasted my vote.  I voted for a 
loser”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the majority of people in the last campaign voted for 
losers.  The majority of people in my riding voted for losers.  I 
got 43% of the vote. Fifty-seven percent of the people voted for 
other parties.  Even in ridings where people had a majority, such 
as yours, Mr. Speaker, I suspect 40% to 45% of the people in your 
riding voted for losers.  They feel they waste their vote so why 
should they engage themselves in the process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under proportional representation no one votes for a loser. 
Everyone is a winner.  Every single vote counts.  Every single 
vote has weight in the Parliament of Canada. When we turn on our 
televisions the day after the election, our vote will count no 
matter where we are in the country, because our vote will be 
going to a certain political party that will get a certain number 
of members in the House of Commons in accordance with the vote 
for that party.  That is what almost every country in the world 
does.  It means we could vote Reform in Newfoundland, it means we 
could vote NDP in Alberta, it means we could vote Liberal in 
rural Saskatchewan and our vote would still count. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our point of view would still count. Our point of view would 
still be important not just on election day but for four years. 
Our vote would count for four years each and every single day as 
we empower a member of parliament to speak on our behalf because 
our vote is reflected in the House of Commons for four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would do something else that is extremely radical, so radical 
for our system that maybe it is heresy.  It would force 
politicians to work together.  We could not harangue each other 
all the time. We would have to work together.  We would have to 
form coalitions and work together like they do in most countries 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the second world war Germany has never had a majority 
government by one party.  There has always been a working 
coalition, Social Democrats, Christian Democrats, the Liberal 
equivalent in that country, and so on. 
It is the same in most Scandinavian countries, France and many 
other countries around the world.  It would force politicians to 
form a consensus in terms of what we want to do and where we want 
to go.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>PR in Canada would radically change voting patterns. How many 
times have we heard people say, “I would vote for your party but 
you cannot win”.  I have a friend who has voted for a party that 
he does not like for the last 20 years in every single federal 
election campaign.  He votes for that party because he is trying 
to keep out another party he likes even less.  For the last 20 
years he has not voted for the party of which he is a card 
carrying member.  Under PR he could vote for the party of his 
preference because his vote would count. We might see a radical 
change in voting patterns because we would not have such a thing 
as strategic voting. A vote would count no matter who an 
individual voted for. That is another reason we should look at PR 
in terms of empowering people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of my arguments in favour of proportional 
representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people may ask would proportional representation not create 
all kinds of fringe groups and all kinds of instability and 
uncertainty?  I want to respond to a couple of those questions. I 
think they are myths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In almost every country in the world where there is proportional 
representation there is a threshold above which parties must 
achieve votes before they are represented in parliament.  In some 
countries that threshold is 3%, some countries 4% and some 
countries 5%. That is something we could look at as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other people may ask if it would not create a great deal of 
instability.  We have more instability now because we are a first 
past the post system.  With a minor change in the votes we create 
great U-turns in terms of policy. Free trade is a good example of 
that.  I think with proportional representation where all parties 
were represented in the governing process there would be more 
gradualism in terms of policy changes and more stability in terms 
of the direction of the country because a consensus representing 
the people at all times would be needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other criticisms of the PR system that 
some people have, but my time is coming to a close. I say to my 
colleagues that in private members' hour we have a chance to 
debate and vote on something that might be done outside the 
constraints of the party whips. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to all members of the Bloc Quebecois. René Lévesque 
spoke very passionately about proportional representation.  Many 
people in the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc spoke about PR.  I say 
to them that my motion does not define a particular method of PR. 
My motion deals with a process that will lead us to an 
appropriate model of PR for Canada which could be good for the 
Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the Reform Party, now the Canadian Alliance, that many 
of its people were among the first to advocate proportional 
representation in this country, including the member from 
Vancouver who is about to speak.  This system could also be 
helpful to get their ideas in a permanent mix in the country. The 
same thing is true of our party in terms of being social 
democrats.  It could be a system for the Conservative Party which 
is really underrepresented now because of our first past the post 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal in particular to the government.  The first past the 
post system works very well for the government in power just 
because of the mathematics.  I say to the government across the 
way that the day will come when it will not be in power.  I would 
like the government members to think about that because when they 
are sitting on the opposition benches, when they get a lot more 
votes than seats in the House, then maybe the idea of doing what 
almost every other country in the world has done, having a 
measure of PR in our electoral system, will look a lot more 
appealing to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember sitting on this side of the House and seeing the huge 
Conservative majority of Brian Mulroney with 211 seats. Suddenly 
in a few short years that majority disappeared.  I was very 
pleased to have heard many Conservatives talking about PR at 
their convention recently.  I am talking of individuals such as 
Hugh Segal and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the House to take my motion seriously and look at 
changing our electoral system to make it more democratic.  Let us 
make sure it is a system where no vote is wasted, where people 
are empowered and the Parliament of Canada will truly reflect the 
way the people vote.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle for an excellent and informative speech and 
for taking the initiative to bring this matter to the House of 
Commons.  I also extend my thanks to members present who 
permitted me to speak in this order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion as set out calls upon the government and all members 
of parliament to embark on what would be a very historic and 
important journey.  That is to examine our federal electoral 
system making use of a report on proportional representation that 
would come about as a result of participation of an all party 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know, Mr. Speaker, that you personally and many others 
followed with great interest the proceedings of the Progressive 
Conservative Party's policy conference which took place last 
weekend in Quebec city.  I note the acknowledgement by the hon. 
member for Regina—Qu'Appelle.  He would know that over 1,200 
delegates participated in that exercise.  They debated and voted 
on a number of policy issues, including this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of proportional representation, although judgment was 
reserved as to how we would proceed in the future, was a topic of 
great interest and participation by delegates.  It signals the 
fact that this is a very important issue on the public's mind. It 
is something on which we should not close the options when it 
comes to this discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording of the current motion troubles me somewhat in the 
sense that it calls upon the government to embark on a referendum 
process.  Do not get me wrong.  The Progressive Conservative 
Party has never shied away from national referendums and can lay 
claim to having been one of the national governments that ever 
openly participated in national referendums in a tangible way. 
It is a party that has done this and it continues to look at this 
type of participation in our democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty with the motion as framed is that it would be 
virtually impossible to carry it out within the timeframe we have 
to work in.  The next general election is very likely less than 
one year away.  It would be virtually impossible and highly 
dubious that the machinery which would be necessary to put it in 
place could be implemented.  I do not say that with any false 
premise.  I believe that this exercise is extremely fruitful and 
one which again I congratulate the member for having the impetus 
to bring forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech the member mentioned the fact that it has led to 
certain policies.  He mentioned the GST and free trade. The 
government when in opposition chastised and said the sky would 
fall if the country were to embark on these.  We know it has 
embraced, expanded and called these same Conservative policies 
its own.  This type of duplicitous reaction and approach is what 
has added greatly to much of the cynicism that exists not only 
about our electoral system but about politics in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are looking for and what is underlying this type of 
debate is the issue of relevancy in people's lives and the 
legitimacy of government in the undertakings which Canadians 
participate in on a daily basis.  In a sense it is a very 
interesting scenario in that I know the hon. member was also 
present in the fall last year when we had a conference in which 
you, Mr. Speaker, were very much a participant and a chair with 
respect to citizen empowerment.  And I openly thank you for that, 
Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the exercise we are partaking in today is 
something that furthers the debate.  It brings about hope for the 
achievement of some relevance and an achievement of a system that 
would be far more representative of Canadians' interest, their 
participation and their ability to hold government and elected 
members accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that conference much was discussed in a very positive light 
about a system of proportional representation.  As you will 
recall, Mr. Speaker, we discussed other countries that have 
embarked on such systems.  There is much to be learned from 
examining those other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to have a very healthy degree of caution as well when we 
go into this debate.  There is no panacea.  There is no one 
system or one magic bullet when it comes to changing a system 
which will ensure that it actually will improve what we have in 
the country today.  The hon. member quite fairly indicated in his 
remarks that there is no one answer.  However, the exercise of 
looking for that answer is what we should all be doing today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that reservation I say that we must proceed with caution. 
When we are talking about fundamental changes to our democratic 
process this must be ever present in our minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that reservation it is fair to say that there are a broad 
number of academics and members of parliament present, who I 
expect we will hear from, who are very interested in this idea of 
empowerment and, by extension, citizens being empowered in a 
system of second round run-off elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to see the electoral process being mirrored in 
some leadership races.  That is something as well that can stand 
as a benchmark and stand as a precedent as we proceed in this 
exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This run-off type of system would result in every member of the 
House being mandated to achieve at least a 50% threshold in the 
electoral district for which they were running. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House calls for a statement of the opinion 
of the House as to actions that the government should take.  We 
all know that the government could and likely will ignore this 
resolution.  However, governments generally, in fairness, are 
very reluctant to embark or change a system that propels them 
into office and gives them a docile backbench.  That is very much 
implicit in this debate as well, because it is not only members 
of the opposition but very much members of the government who are 
forced to clam up and bow down to a very centralized and very 
powerful executive branch of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is even more unlikely, I suggest, that the current Prime 
Minister, in the dying days of his administration, would launch 
into such a vigorous reform of the electoral system.  This Prime 
Minister is too comfortable and complacent with a system that has 
propelled him to office, and he knows that he has never been an 
innovator or very willing to embark upon new ideas.  That is 
demonstrated, as I indicated earlier, by the policy approach 
which this government has taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is at the head of a very powerful executive 
dictatorship.  I do not use that word lightly, but that is the 
acknowledgement and that is very much the undertone of many 
academics who have been looking at this exact issue.  There are 
no effective checks or balances in the current system.  As 
Professor Donald Savoie described in his very important book 
<I>Governing from the Centre</I>, the Prime Minister is no longer 
first among equals, he is an all powerful individual.  Even 
ministers in this government who wield a great deal of power are 
toiling in the shadow of the Prime Minister's senior staff. There 
is ample evidence of this outlined in Professor Savoie's work. 
The real power brokers are Eddie and Jean, not Paul and Allan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regionalism, which was touched upon by the hon. member, has also 
been exacerbated by our current system.  I would suggest that 
this is very much a motivating and propelling force for us to 
look at the system we are currently saddled with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to belittle anyone personally; it is to set out a 
problem that exists and that very much weakens parliament in its 
ability to be effective and accountable.  Accountability is 
something that we have to be conscious of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the remedies that is put forward by many as leading to a 
stronger parliament, and one that I must acknowledge, is that if 
we abandon the parliamentary form of governance we must be 
prepared very quickly to move into a new and effective 
replacement.  The proponents of proportional representation argue 
that members of parliament with the support of 50% plus one have 
the ability to enhance the mandate from their community and this 
would very much further embolden and empower the member who was 
elected.  I agree with that sentiment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would that human condition be that simple.  We know that is not 
the case, for party machinery will always play a role in our 
electoral process.  Party leaders will always wield tools.  We 
have seen instances in the very recent past where the government, 
without having a nomination process, simply appointed candidates. 
The current government has embarked on that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any examination of this subject needs to pay particular 
attention and detail to the proponents of a new electoral law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an important example of small changes to the system 
having important effects on the balance of power.  When public 
financing became very much a part of the electoral system, a 
provision was inserted to require the leader of a party to sign 
the electoral papers of every candidate.  The supposed purpose 
was to ensure, dare I say the word, clarity in who was to be the 
official party candidate, since public money would flow to that 
person's and that party's electoral machinery.  This was 
seemingly an insignificant detail at the time, but the devil is 
in the detail and that is why I say we have to go forward with 
caution.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That procedure has led to a process which allows the government, 
or any party for that matter, to simply appoint candidates as 
opposed to having an electoral run-off system through a 
nomination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sort of backroom bludgeoning, I suggest, will continue to 
occur with proportional representation unless we have some 
defining guidelines.  Change is fine.  However, it should not be 
taken lightly and not embarked upon simply for the sake of 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged by the hon. member's initiative.  I support him 
in what he is trying to do.  We have reached a threshold of 
dissatisfaction and we must go forward from here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are very proud of the fact that they have one of the 
most stable and democratic political systems in the world.  It 
has made Canada a model for many other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not something that just happened by accident.  We are 
the beneficiaries today of what our ancestors have provided and 
what political leaders over the last century and a half have 
handed down to us.  However, even the best system in the world 
will have its critics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is natural that from time to time members of parliament and 
others interested in the political process will come forward with 
suggestions for improving our system, which in this case is our 
system of election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's private member's motion is an example of this, with its 
call for the introduction of a new electoral system, 
incorporating a measure of proportional representation.  If I 
may, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss some of the 
aspects of the motion, how it might impact Canadians and why in 
the view of some it may represent a risky gamble for Canadians, 
which I maintain might not be warranted under present 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, it is important to note that proportional 
representation is not a new idea.  It has been tried in a number 
of forms in a number of countries all around the world, with 
varying degrees of success.  Currently it is used in one form or 
another in many countries, notably Germany, Israel, Ireland and 
New Zealand.  I understand that it was used in France, but it has 
now been substantially abandoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle indicated that we are one of 
only three countries in the world which does not use proportional 
representation.  I did not quite understand that.  If we include 
the U.S.A.—and I do not recall what the other country was— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  India. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  India. Within the last couple of months I was 
over at Westminster in the United Kingdom.  The last time I 
looked, they do not use proportional representation.  Some 
British members of parliament and I discussed the issue when I 
was over there.  Notwithstanding that the party in power had held 
out the possibility of increased proportional representation, I 
did detect a drawing back from that in the British House of 
Commons.  They were looking at it carefully, and it is not 
everything that its advocates make it out to be.  There are some 
pluses, to be sure, and there are minuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While all of these systems are called proportional 
representation, they often vary enormously and use different 
approaches, such as the following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have preferential ballots where voters rank candidates in 
order of preference, with votes for low-polling candidates being 
transferred to the remaining candidates, according to voter 
preference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are pure proportional representation systems where the 
entire country is treated as one constituency, with members being 
selected from party lists based on the percentage of the popular 
vote received by the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are mixed systems where some members are chosen on the 
basis of first past the post, while others are chosen from party 
lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While proponents of the system claim it leads to better 
representation, particularly of minorities, minority interests 
and regions, with a higher voter turnout, the experience of those 
countries currently using proportional representation suggests 
that there may be some potential negative impacts as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, it could lead to a splintering of political 
interests in parties and therefore lead to more minority 
governments.  It could make governing more difficult.  It could 
increase political instability.  It could force parties to engage 
in lengthy political deal-making in order to cobble together 
coalitions involving very different interests.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will say that process is actually quite democratic and 
representative but there are two sides to the coin and there is 
more than one view of this.  As well, small one issue parties can 
sometimes find themselves in the position of being kingmaker 
which may allow them to force their own narrow agendas onto the 
nation as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proportional representation sometimes can give a voice to 
extremist groups who would have been shut out in a first past the 
post system.  Examples of such situations can easily come to 
mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some countries have also found that proportional representation 
can exacerbate regional differences and cleavages within a 
society and can make it more difficult to reach a national 
consensus on some important issues.  That is an important issue 
for a country as vast and as regionally segmented as Canada is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries have found that the use of party lists in 
selecting members of legislatures can strengthen the power of 
those party insiders responsible for deciding who will be on the 
list and in what order of precedence.  I also as a member of 
parliament representing a constituency am curious as to what the 
balance would be, for example if I would continue to represent a 
constituency but those selected from a party list would not have 
that responsibility at all.  They would not have the constituency 
responsibility, something to which all members of the House pay 
considerable attention and devote considerable resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just a few of the issues, some say problems, that we 
would encounter in moving toward a system of proportional 
representation.  There are some other problems that might be 
specific to Canada.  We have benefited in the past from an 
electoral system that allows for the diversity of our peoples to 
be drawn together in a parliament where there is a reasonable 
likelihood of a majority government.  Minority governments might 
not so easily maintain our focus and our unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition it could under certain models involve a change. 
These changes could involve changes to our constitution, and this 
is a particular policy envelope that I am not convinced Canadians 
would want to open at this particular time.  A referendum on the 
issue could also prove divisive judging from recent past 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, one of the strengths of our electoral system is that 
Canadians are represented at the constituency level by members of 
parliament.  All of us here do represent constituencies and that 
is a real strength for the House, something that might be—I am 
not saying would be lost—but could be lost if we are selecting 
MPs simply from party lists without reference to particular 
constituencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, I am not inclined to support the motion in 
its whole.  However, if there is a broad interest among members 
to pursue the issue of proportional representation, and I know 
there are members on both sides of the House who do have a real 
interest in this, the House could ask a committee of the House to 
look at this.  I suggest the Standing Committee for Procedure and 
House Affairs as one possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of that committee discussed the issue in the course of 
their 1998 review of electoral issues.  There may be merit in 
further study.  Such a review would provide us with information 
on the strengths and weaknesses of proportional representation, 
in international experience and the implications it could have in 
the Canadian context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to sincerely commend the hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle for his commitment to improving Canada's 
electoral system and for bringing this important issue to the 
House.  I do not know what members will do with the issue in 
terms of the actual motion.  I am certain that somewhere in the 
future there is a further study envelope of proportional 
representation to see how it might be adapted or used in Canada, 
and if there is a substantial consensus that would develop to do 
that in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to start by saying to the member for the 
government side who just said that referenda are divisive, what 
could be more divisive than a government with 100% of the power 
with only 38% of the vote ramming its agenda down the throats of 
the people? 
Referenda are never divisive because people have the discussion 
and they all accept the democratic outcome.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I would also like to congratulate the 
hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle for bringing this issue before 
the House.  However, I would say to him right at the beginning 
that it is highly unlikely, as I think he realizes, that the 
government would do anything with the motion, mainly because the 
history of changes to electoral systems indicates that the these 
things happen only during a time of crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned that Germany, for example, since the war has a 
different system.  He mentioned the Scottish system.  Obviously a 
big change there allowed that new system to be introduced.  In 
New Zealand, an example I know a lot about, it only happened 
because of the crisis in the financial system there which caused 
a huge reorganization of government.  That was what led to the 
change to MMP down there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing I can think of that would happen in Canada which 
would cause such an upheaval would be a Quebec separation, for 
example.  It would cause such a disruption to our electoral 
system that it would probably result in some serious looking at 
some other systems.  That would be a terrible way for us to get 
to that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In talking about the motion before us it is flattering in the 
way that the motion is very similar or very close to Canadian 
Alliance policy, formerly Reform Party policy.  The policy of the 
Reform Party, as I said, is very similar except that we would put 
the referendum or the decision-making to the people of Canada. 
Instead of a committee of the House looking at the alternatives 
and saying this is the one it favours and then asking the people 
of Canada in a referendum if this is what they want, we would 
take the decision-making fully 100% to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we reached that position within the Reform Party and 
now the Canadian Alliance is that we had many people who brought 
resolutions to our party conventions promoting one form of 
proportional representation or another.  Whether it be straight 
proportional or the single transferable ballot, there are many 
different versions.  The people who brought these motions forward 
were very firmly wedded to their particular form of proportional 
representation.  It was very difficult to have any sort of 
meaningful debate on the floor of conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We set up a task force to look at the alternatives.  We had all 
the people with the different forms of proportional 
representation come before the task force to promote their views. 
We concluded that we would have to adopt a system similar to the 
one used in New Zealand to reach the consensus there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of choosing one of the forms of proportional 
representation being promoted by our members, we would give the 
job to Elections Canada to conduct an education process for the 
people of Canada across the country from coast to coast to coast 
for about a year, informing them how the different forms of 
proportional representation worked.  Then we would have a 
referendum, first to find out if people wanted to change the 
system based on the information they had.  If they did, we would 
have a second vote to indicate which form they would choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what happened in the New Zealand case.  I would 
like to go into a bit more information about the choices given to 
the people in New Zealand.  Incidentally I should mention an 
interesting spinoff effect of what happened in New Zealand.  The 
voters in New Zealand chose mixed member proportional, a system 
where the house is divided in two. Half of the members are 
elected under the first past the post system that we have in 
Canada.  The other half are selected from a list based upon the 
proportion of vote received by each of the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In New Zealand the parties have to get 5% in order to get any 
members into the house.  In the last two elections in New Zealand 
there have been 30 or more parties on the ballot, but only four 
or five have managed to get into that grouping above 5% to 
actually get members in the house.  The interesting side bar 
spinoff that has occurred is that with mixed member proportional 
some of the members in the house do not actually represent 
ridings because they are selected from the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would we address them in the House?  We could not say the 
member for Regina—Qu'Appelle because if he is a list MP he would 
not necessarily represent a riding.  They had to change the 
standing orders in New Zealand to refer to members by their 
names.  It really begs the question why we have to refer to one 
another by our ridings in the House?  There was no good reason to 
retain that rule in New Zealand and they scrapped it.  Everybody 
calls one another by their names now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have pages in front of me from the documentation that was sent 
to every voter in New Zealand in order to have the discussion 
take place over a 12 months period.  The booklet described the 
various forms of proportional representation that could be 
selected by the voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Straight proportional is where everyone is elected on the basis 
of the proportion of the vote from lists that are provided by the 
parties.  Then we have the supplementary member system under 
which most of the members, perhaps about four-fifths, are still 
elected on first past the post and about one-fifth or one-quarter 
of the total would be elected based on the proportion of the 
overall share of the votes.  It can be a very complicated system 
in terms of allocating the votes to the parties, because how do 
they decide who will be on the list of members who get elected 
under the proportional system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned by the government representative there are 
different ways of doing that.  Sometimes it is a party list 
selected by the party brass, for want of a better word. Sometimes 
it is more democratically selected, perhaps by members of the 
party going through some sort of nomination process to get people 
on the list.  A third way would be for people to argue in 
elections in an open nomination process pretty much like the 
first past the post system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the supplementary member system usually there is very 
small representation from the smaller parties so they still tend 
to get a dominant larger party in the house.  That was not the 
system that the New Zealand people chose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the preferential voting system which is not truly 
proportional but ensures that the winning candidates get more 
than 50% of the vote.  The person marking the ballot would mark 
their first, second, third and fourth choices.  When they count 
all the first choices on the ballot, if the candidate who is in 
the lead does not get over 50% then the candidate receiving the 
bottom number of votes gets knocked off.  Then all the second 
choices from those ballots get added in, counted again, to see 
whether one of the candidates gets more than 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are complicated ways of doing things but they are a little 
more democratic than what we have.  I mentioned that was used in 
Australia.  That system is also used in the Canadian Alliance, 
formerly the Reform Party, to select the national counsellors who 
run our party between elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another system that is pretty complicated is the single 
transferable vote system.  It is very similar to the preferential 
voting system but it involves having numbers of members 
representing one riding.  It could be anything from three to 
seven members in one riding.  It is used in Tasmania.  Whilst I 
cannot show the House the examples I have here from the Tasmanian 
elections, it does allow a variety of smaller parties to get 
involved in the house itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the mixed member proportional system which I 
mentioned was finally chosen in New Zealand.  The party list 
system there is actually chosen by the party brass because it 
really wants the opportunity to ensure that it has skilled people 
selected to come into the house.  For example, my colleague who 
was here in the last parliament, Herb Grubel, the member for West 
Vancouver, is a very accomplished economist.  He might, for 
example, be put on a list so that a party would make sure that it 
had those sorts of skilled people brought into the house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the bottom line here is whether or not I would recommend 
to my colleagues that they support the motion presently before 
us.  I pointed out that the one flaw perhaps is that the decision 
on the type of system would be made by the committee and it would 
only be the final decision given to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in reading the motion carefully I get the impression 
that there might be enough flexibility at committee to actually 
manipulate that a bit and for the committee to recommend what I 
am talking about, which would be that we cannot quite make up our 
minds which would be the best, that there are so many good 
advantages we want to put the whole package to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that basis I am certainly recommending support of the motion. 
I will be supporting it myself.  In conclusion, once again I say 
congratulations to the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle for bringing 
this important subject to the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise to speak today in the debate on Motion 
No. M-155, introduced by my NDP colleague, the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am grateful to him for this motion, since it gives us the 
opportunity to debate an important question that I will look at 
from three angles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, can democracy be improved?  Second, is the electoral 
process a component of democracy?  Third, could proportional 
representation serve to improve democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will have understood the importance of this debate, 
since it involves thinking about parliament as the favoured 
place of the democratic expression of a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my first question, “can democracy be improved”, I have no 
hesitation in answering yes.  Our electoral system is of course 
democratic.  However, it is not perfect, since it promotes the 
hegemony of the majority party.  I must quote a 19th century 
author who wrote “Truth, laws, rights and justice depend on 40 
rumps that rise among 22 that remain seated”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many governments have been elected and will be again, even 
though a strong majority of electors do not want them elected? 
In the present system, the person getting the most votes is the 
person elected, and the party with the most seats forms the 
government. 
Tough luck for the tens of thousands of voters who have no voice 
in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone remembers the 1993 federal election, which robbed the 
Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party of party 
standing in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my second question, “is the electoral process a component of 
democracy”, I answer yes as well, since it enables the public to 
choose the person best able, in their opinion, to represent 
them.  If they are wrong in their choice, they will try to 
correct their fire a few years later in another election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last question focuses on the value of proportional 
representation as an instrument likely to improve democracy.  To 
this question, I answer yes, but on certain conditions. 
But before briefly describing those conditions, I would like to 
give a few figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A UN study listed 174 countries according to their degree of 
human development.  Of the 64 countries said to meet the criteria 
for superior human development, 34, or just over 50%, have a 
proportional representation system.  The percentage drops to 
33.5% for the group of countries considered to have an average 
level of human development, while in the last group of countries 
only one in four has proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the more developed a country is, the greater the 
likelihood of proportional representation.  In fact, of the 174 
countries, 66 elect their parliament proportionally—the less 
developed a country is, the less this is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it might also interest the House to know that, of the 
222 political systems listed in 1997 by the International 
Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, only 64 elected 
their parliament using a first-past-the-post system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A hard look at other countries obviously requires that some 
serious thought be given to this topic, since fewer than 30% of 
them elect their parliament based on the number of votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is proportional representation a panacea for democracy?  What 
are its advantages and its disadvantages? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In <I>Esprit des lois</I>, Montesquieu wrote “The love of democracy 
is the love of equality”.  A century later, in his <I>Du Contrat 
Social</I>, Jean-Jacques Rousseau associated the notions of liberty 
and equality, saying “If we seek to find precisely what 
comprises the greatest good of all, that which must be the goal 
of any system of legislation, it will be found that this can be 
reduced to two principal objects: liberty and equality. Liberty, 
because any individual dependency takes away an equivalent amount 
from the strength of the body of the state; equality because 
liberty cannot exist without it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proportional representation seems to work in favour of a better 
women's representation in parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot be mere happenstance that, if any country has more 
than 20% of women MPs, it is one which uses proportional 
representation.  In Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, the 
proportion of women varies between 33% and 40%, while it is a 
mere 12% in the United States.  The same conclusions apply to the 
figures for minority groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other interesting element.  The rate of popular 
participation is also higher, no doubt because the individual 
citizen has the assurance that his vote will be worthwhile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the single constituency single ballot system, known as 
first-past-the-post system, promotes government stability, one of 
the disadvantages of proportional representation is, no doubt, 
the instability it can generate, with all the political, 
economic and social consequences that may follow.  This 
disadvantage is not insignificant.  It does not take much 
imagination to see that a parliament with 30 parties sitting in 
it could, at times, be a bit of a circus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another not insignificant aspect is the lessened importance of 
the elected representative's link to his riding.  We all know 
people who vote for the man, as we say.  In my case, they vote 
for the woman.  It is the candidate's personality that, for some 
voters, makes all the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a proportional vote, the party's program takes precedence. 
It is easy for voters to believe that the person elected from 
their riding will represent their party rather than themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois considers it worthwhile to hold a serious 
debate on the various types of voting, including proportional 
representation.  One element seems fundamental, however, and 
that is recognition in the debate of Quebec's uniqueness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, the Bloc Quebecois has been a federal party devoted 
to the interests of Quebec.  We are the first case, but who here 
can say that our situation will always be unique, a sort of 
artifice without real importance?  Everyone knows how interests 
differ from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advantage of proportional representation is to give the 
difference a fair place.  Because we rightly consider that our 
difference as a people warrants respect in the electoral 
process, I move:

“proportional” wherever it appears in the motion, the words “by

resembling the portrait Jules Romain painted of it:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak to the House today on the issue of newspaper 
concentration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 15 of this year, based on a query by the House 
leader of the New Democratic Party, the Prime Minister said that 
the government would study the concentration of newspaper 
ownership in response to Thomson's announcement that it would 
sell off most of its newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 1, given that Hollinger announced that over 300 community 
papers and over 50 daily papers would be up for sale, I asked the 
Prime Minister what the progress of his study was.  I was stunned 
to hear him say at that point that he really saw no need 
whatsoever for a study any longer because it seemed that the 
problem had cured itself.  He said that if Mr. Black was selling 
his papers, someone else would buy them and there would be less 
concentration rather than more.  The Prime Minister said that it 
would be better to wait and see what Thomson will do with his 
newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the government abandon its wait and see 
policy on newspaper concentration and act now to re-establish a 
healthy environment for Canadian and community owned newspapers. 
I want to tell the Prime Minister that there are alternatives to 
his wait and see policy but they have to happen quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I had the great pleasure of hearing Tom Kent present 
to the industry committee an ongoing review of the Competition 
Act.  Mr. Kent headed the royal commission in 1980 which 
recommended legislation to curb media concentration.  That was 20 
years ago.  He said then and says now that the reason newspaper 
concentration is dangerous to democracy is, quite simply, that 
owners choose the viewpoint that rules their papers, that they in 
fact are the ideological masters of their papers.  This is fine 
if there are dozens or hundreds of owners running hundreds of 
newspapers, a wide teaming forum of diverse views, but that is 
not the case in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have instead a spectacle of very few owners in control of all 
the papers.  Two companies, Hollinger and Thomson, have a 
stranglehold on newspaper ownership, both weekly and daily.  Lo 
and behold, something happened.  We are not exactly sure what but 
some kind of economic force has intervened and newspapers are 
once again on the block and up for sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to join with Mr. Kent and urge the Competition 
Bureau and the government to do something ambitious right now. 
The government should amend the Competition Act to allow the 
review of any purchase that would give a buyer more than 10% of 
the Canadian circulation of a newspaper owned either in English 
or French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the government to create tax incentives that will 
assist community groups, institutions, co-ops and groups of 
investors to reinvest and rebuild community ownership of our 
means of expression, rebuild the diversity of opinion which is in 
fact democracy's oxygen and what we need to have a healthy 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government and the Prime Minister to make the 
necessary changes in the Competition Act during this very brief 
window of time that it has to actually cause some real change in 
the balance of ownership in our newspapers.  I strongly recommend 
that the government act quickly so that we can re-establish a 
balance of diverse opinions in Canada.

there has been some kind of glitch in the proceedings.  I believe 
on April 4 the member opposite asked a question about proposed 
telephone rate increases, and subsequent to that, I believe she 
asked a question about the consolidation of newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in being drawn for a late show tonight, the question 
that was drawn was her April 4 question which had to do with 
telephone rate increases not newspapers.  Am I correct, Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The parliamentary 
secretary is quite correct.  If she would like she can respond to 
the telephone request and when the other comes up she can respond 
to it then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to assure the 
member that affordable telecommunications services to Canadians 
in both rural and urban areas across Canada is a fundamental 
policy objective of the Telecommunications Act and it is key to 
the government's program called Connecting Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC has taken a number of initiatives to ensure that 
Canadians have access to a affordable, high quality 
telecommunication service, including an explicit subsidy from 
long distance carriers to support local telephone service which 
particularly benefits high cost rural and remote areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC has mandated that the level of basic telephone service 
generally available in urban areas must be provided in rural and 
remote areas.  The CRTC has ordered the incumbent telephone 
companies to file service improvement plans to provide this level 
of service in those few areas where it is not available.  This 
will mean significant investments by the telephone companies. 
However, in the end it will eliminate party lines and ensure that 
all Canadians can have access to the Internet without paying long 
distance charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until 2002 the CRTC has capped annual price increases for 
residential service.  Increases in residential rates are limited 
to inflation on average, with a maximum allowable increase of 10% 
on any particular local rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this price cap regulation, the telephone companies must 
file with the CRTC annual proposals for price changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the telephone companies are proposing increases to be 
brought in over two years.  In some cases, the companies are 
seeking approval for the maximum allowable increases in areas 
where the disparity between the cost of providing service and the 
price of service is the greatest.  In Bell's territory, for 
example, most rural customers pay less for telephone service than 
urban customers even though the cost of providing them service is 
higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth noting that, according to the OECD, Canadians

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am always delighted to address the House on behalf of my 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 8, 2000, I put a question to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. I submitted to the minister that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the counties of Albert, Petitcodiac, Hillsborough and Salisbury, 
are part of an urban economic zone, when they are in fact rural 
communities with high rates of unemployment. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister to tell the House when she was going to 
begin the consultation process. I also reminded the minister 
that workers needed an answer before next fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under subsection 18(2) of the EI Regulations, employment 
insurance regions must be reviewed at least every five years. 
Finally, this week, consultations began. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very happy to see that Hopewell Cape, Alma, 
Riverside-Albert, Fundy, Salisbury and Petitcodiac had been 
included in the new rural zone.  I will explain why this move was 
so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the House the example of Alma, which has Fundy 
National Park, and Kent county, which has Kouchibouguac National 
Park.  The employees at Fundy National Park, who were doing the 
same work as those at Kouchibouguac National Park, needed 655 
hours to qualify for employment insurance with a duration of 
about 15 weeks, while workers at Kouchibouguac National Park 
needed only 420 hours for a maximum of 32 weeks.  That created 
quite an injustice between the communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately this spring people working in Albert county, 
Hillsborough, Petitcodiac and Salisbury, which were zoned in with 
urban regions, went four months without income because of the 
1996 legislation which shortened the period.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the government for correcting some of this 
injustice.  We have to thank it when it does something good and I 
did see something good happen this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, two communities were excluded from the rural zone in my 
riding.  That is going to cause these communities quite a lot of 
hardship. The two communities that have been excluded are Elgin 
and Hillsborough.  We have statistics from 1996 which show that 
those communities were at 17.8% unemployment.  I strongly 
recommend to the minister that these two communities be taken 
into consideration during the consultation.  Both Elgin and 
Hillsborough have very high rates of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if it stays as proposed, workers from Hillsborough 
and Elgin will be working in Hopewell Cape.  Working side by side 
in the same industry, one worker will need 420 hours to qualify 
for maybe a period of 32 weeks, while the other worker working 
next to him or her will need over 600 hours to qualify for maybe 
a period of 15 weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government is on the right track in solving the 
injustice created by the economic zones that we had before.  It 
now has a chance to make it fully correct and just for everyone. 
I certainly hope that the minister will take my recommendations. 
I am sure the mayors and community leaders are going to be 
putting forth recommendations also that those communities be 
included in the rural zone where they should be.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the 
member has noted, a review of the employment insurance economic 
boundaries is now under way.  These reviews as set out in the 
regulations must be conducted every five years.  They are 
conducted because just as the national unemployment rate changes 
over time, local and regional unemployment rates also change. We 
need to ensure that the system reflects local unemployment rates 
and remains fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These boundaries are set out fairly and are based on four 
factors: the urban-rural split as in the case of the member's 
riding; the homogeneity of the labour market; the geography; and 
the reliability of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have issued a proposal for public comment.  The member has 
suggested that part of her riding is happy with that and part of 
it is not so pleased.  We have put that notice in the <I>Canada 
Gazette</I> starting May 13.  The opportunity for the member and 
the public to comment will last for 30 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI commission has reviewed the economic zones and members of 
parliament of all parties have now been briefed on the proposed 
changes.  The commission has every intention of having the review 
finalized by the summer of this year.  I encourage the member 
opposite and her constituents to put their views forward within 
the 30 day period.  I am sure they will be taken into 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>   The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 
a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.47 p.m.)
