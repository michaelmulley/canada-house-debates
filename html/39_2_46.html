    </p><a name="Para886057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is even possible to imagine the scope of the disaster, the cyclone destroyed 500,000 homes. Whole villages disappeared under the flooding. It is estimated that 40% of the victims were children and that many of the surviving children are now orphans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886058"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large Bangladeshi community here in Canada. Members of the community are mourning their losses and working hard to raise funds themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date Canada has only contributed $3 million to the recovery effort. Given the scope of the disaster, more money is needed. This petition calls upon the government to do more. It is signed by several hundred citizens and was collected through the hard work of Marilyn Churley. I urge the government to give consideration to this petition.</div>

    </p><a name="Para886066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am applying for an emergency debate and appealing to you because of the very grave situation in my community, Vancouver East, particularly in the downtown east side, where recent reports showed a very deepening crisis, an alarming situation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HIV infection rate for aboriginal people is twice the rate of the infection rate for non-aboriginal people, which in that community is already much higher than where it is elsewhere in the population. We are facing a very severe health crisis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen no response from the government and no action. There are aboriginal people who are living in very desperate situations, who are living in poverty. I do think that this is very noteworthy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is something that we should be deeply concerned about, that we should be debating, and we should be taking action. We should be calling on the government to respond to this emergency in the downtown east side that is affecting the lives of so many people. Many lives have already been lost to this crisis of HIV-AIDS, particularly among injection drug users. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put forward my application on that basis, but I would like to make one additional point. As you know, Mr. Speaker, there have been a number of requests for emergency debates that you have not approved based on your interpretation of the Standing Order and you know that we have tried valiantly to have take note debates as well. In fact, the government has not been forthcoming on that matter. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not had take note debates for over a year. This is a lost opportunity for members of Parliament to have a thorough debate in the House on subjects that are of concern to local communities or of national concern. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that we have the avenue of emergency debates that seems to have been cut off and now we have the avenue of take note debates that has been cut off arbitrarily by the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that this has left us in a very difficult situation where our ability to bring forward issues and express points of view, and to draw attention to some of these situations, such as the forestry industry and what is happening in local communities, and the impact of lost jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my colleagues also brought forward an application dealing with emergency services for aboriginal people on reserve. So, all of these issues, I do believe warrant attention. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this particular issue today concerning HIV-AIDS among aboriginal people, I do believe that this is something that the House should debate forthwith.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Speaker, I would ask for your consideration of this and I would ask you to consider the broader context in which we find our ourselves and respect the will, I think, of Parliament to make sure that these issues are addressed and we have an opportunity to bring this forward, to press the government, and to make our points of view known.</div>

    </p><a name="Para886088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will begin by thanking the groups that came forward, the individuals and the businesses in Canada that came forward and made their presentations to the finance committee for our prebudget consultation. Quite frankly, the quality of the presentations made before the finance committee this year were outstanding and that is reflected in the report that has been put forward by the Standing Committee on Finance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also state that while our party, the Conservative Party, is largely supportive of the recommendations made in the prebudget consultation document, there are certain aspects of the prebudget consultation document that we did not agree with, so we did prepare a supplementary report that is also within the prebudget consultation, which clearly outlines the direction that our government sees for Canada moving forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I speak about the direction of Canada moving forward, I thought it would be fitting to begin today's debate by again outlining Advantage Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government came forward with Advantage Canada in November 2006. It was presented by the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78379,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78379&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Whitby—Oshawa</A>, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A>. He came forward and submitted a blueprint for Canada's economy moving forward and for Canada as a whole. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was something that has not been done before. In fact, often in days past, governments would come out with budgets and there would be an awful lot of surprises. Canadians did not know what the direction of government was and business could not count on what the future direction of government would be. With Advantage Canada, the government sought to provide a level of confidence and to provide business with a good road map to where the government was going.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886093"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I thought that the best way to start would be to outline and to remind the members of the House what Advantage Canada spoke of.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advantage Canada was focused on creating five Canadian advantages that would help improve the quality of life and help Canada succeed on the world stage. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a tax advantage, which spoke of reducing taxes for all Canadians and establishing the lowest tax rate on business in the G-7.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also spoke of Canada's fiscal advantage and eliminating the government's total net debt in less than a generation. We spoke at the time of 2021 and I believe we are actually ahead of that target.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spoke of the entrepreneurial advantage. We wanted to reduce regulation and red tape and lower taxes to unlock business investment and try to build a more competitive business environment so that our small businesses could succeed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spoke of the knowledge advantage that we wanted to build in Canada to create the best educated, most skilled and most flexible workforce. We are already seeing the results of this. A statistic released this morning said that university enrolment in Canada is up by almost 23%. In fact, it is up by 25% for women and 21% for men. These are real successes for the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also spoke of the infrastructure advantage, whereby we will work to create a modern, world-class economic infrastructure that helps ensure growth and helps ensure prosperity so that Canadians can have a better life.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, to support these advantages, we had principles, and that is very important. What were the principles that were going to guide Advantage Canada? The first principle was to focus government, and I cannot emphasize how important that is. The government remains focused on what it does best. It is responsible in spending, efficient in its operation, effective in its results and accountable to the taxpayers. This is a principle, quite frankly, that all governments should aspire to, but which our government holds very dear and very close to its heart.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to create new opportunities and choices for people. When we speak of that, we want government to create incentives for people to excel right here at home. We want to reduce taxes and invest in education. These are the principles that the Conservative Party holds very dear. We want to invest for sustainable growth.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020">(1020)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para886102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about investing for sustainable growth, we are not talking about one time ad hoc payments that pick winners and losers. We are talking about fixing the fundamental flaws in the economy and setting the environment right so that all businesses can flourish and prosper, which creates more employment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing results of this already. We know that in the month of December a record number of Canadians were employed, 17 million. That has never happened before in this country. The government has created almost 700,000 jobs in two years. That is an incredible record and Advantage Canada is the blueprint by which we have set that underway.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following up on Advantage Canada, we had budget 2007 which made a significant number of investments that were important to Canadians. I believe the record of budget 2007 speaks for itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it would be fitting to remind Canadians what budget 2007 accomplished: $39 billion over seven years to restore the fiscal balance. I am from Ontario. The province of Ontario received $3.8 billion this year in the fiscal balance transfer, plus per capita transfers for things like post-secondary education where we increased that budget by 40%, plus provided per capita spending.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did the Premier of Ontario have to say about budget 2007? Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty is claiming a hat trick of significant victories. On March 21, 2007, in the aftermath of the federal budget, he stated, “Ontario has scored three significant victories when it comes to our fight for fairness. This federal budget represents real progress for Ontarians”. I am proud of that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came here to Ottawa to fight for real progress and fairness for Ontario and for Peterborough but also to fight for fairness right across the country because, ultimately, as federal politicians we should strive for a government that does not discriminate between regions and that views and respects all Canadians equally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886108"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could speak to the budget for hours but I have requested that my time be reduced to 10 minutes so I can share my time with my colleagues who are also very proud of the government's economic record.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to talk about the economic statement. Perhaps one of the most interesting things that I read following the economic statement was written by Sheila Copps, a former Liberal member, when she said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former minister, Sheila Copps, was very proud of the government's decision to reduce the GST and reduce the tax burden on Canadians. I think that is tremendous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jayson Myers, of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, came forward and called the tax cuts in the economic and fiscal update very important. He said:</div>

Of course, when one lives in a glass house, one does not cast stones. The Liberal government had a 14% spending increase in its final year in government. Of course, it was trying to buy votes but the voters in Canada did not fall for that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly proud of this government because we effectively cut taxes over the next five years by $200 billion and we have made key investments. We have also addressed the fiscal balance question in Canada.</div>

Many of the Bloc Québécois recommendations were included in the report. For example, there is the introduction of initiatives to help workers affected by the crisis in the manufacturing and forestry industries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee members acknowledged that $1 billion was needed for the forestry industry alone and that $1.5 billion was needed for refundable contributions for manufacturing industries that wanted to invest in new equipment. They also acknowledged that the portion of gasoline tax revenues to be shared with municipalities should be increased to 5¢ a litre as soon as possible to stimulate local economies. These proposals were made by the Bloc Québécois, and I am very happy that the committee accepted them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question for my colleague.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886136"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These recommendations go further than the ones the Conservative Party refused this week in the House, when we passed a motion calling for the implementation of all the tax measures recommended by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for the manufacturing sector. We had a vote and the House adopted the motion, but the Conservatives were opposed to it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886137"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Conservatives on the committee agreed to include this in the report, can they promise to persuade their colleagues to see this through to the end and, as they did in the case of the $1 billion trust, admit that they do not need to tie this to a vote on the budget?</div>
    </p><a name="Para886138"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can they ensure that the entire caucus has changed its mind since yesterday and will go along with the Conservatives who make up most of the committee, in order to finally support these measures, which address the urgent needs in the manufacturing and forestry industries?</div>

    </p><a name="Para886142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to spend a few minutes giving a bit of an overview for the Canadian public on the actual process. I will talk a little about the report, some of its recommendations and what that means to Burlington. I will wrap up with where I think we are making progress as a government from a financial point of view and where we can continue to bring value for money to Canadian taxpayers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, for those who do not know, the budget process has a number of facets to it. As members of the finance committee, we have the opportunity to meet Canadians from across the country to talk about what they would like to see in future budgets. This process started back in the summertime with a plan to have a more focused approach to how we deal with prebudget consultation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a theme, which was what people would do to the tax system in this country to ensure our prosperity in the future. That is the theme which we asked people to present on to us. Not everybody followed that theme. Others decided to come and see us, as they have done in the past, to talk about spending they wanted for their own particular needs. However, the vast majority of presenters came to see us with that theme in mind and did an excellent job in presenting their views of how the country's tax system could be improved to help improve both our prosperity as a people and our position in the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did engage the public. Hundreds of people came to see us across the country and hundreds of people came to Ottawa to talk to us about their goals and their desires for the 2008 budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members of the committee, we were able to ask questions of those individuals. We saw submissions from every single group that came to see us. For those whom we were not able to satisfy by giving them their few minutes in front of us so that we could get answers to questions, we asked them to make a written submission to us. We all received copies so that all were able to read those submissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886147"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members of the finance committee, we worked together with colleagues from other parties in discussing the issues and coming up with what we think is the right direction to follow.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886148"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, and everybody in this House has this opportunity, individual groups and organizations came to see me as a regular member of Parliament to talk about what is important to them and what could be incorporated into a budget to help their causes and this country. As an individual member of Parliament, I had numerous people come to see me, numerous delegations, to talk about their views on how we should proceed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886149"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theme in terms of the tax system was overtaken a bit by the issue of the rising dollar. As the dollar was rising in the fall, we had a specific set of meetings about that, its effect on our economy and what the Government of Canada could do in that arena. I think they were very effective meetings. We had some excellent presentations on what we as a government can and cannot do in terms of interference. We heard from a variety of presenters, including representatives from the Bank of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The areas that we talked about were very wide-ranging. We talked about personal taxes, the tax rates that individuals pay. We talked about what we could do for the unemployed. We talked about what we could do for seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education was a theme that people came to see us about, both those who provide education from the university side of things and those who are recipients of education in the post-secondary area, including a number of student groups.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We talked about corporate taxes and what we could for corporate taxes. We talked about what we could do in terms of research and assistance for organizations that are trying to be the best they can be, to be leading edge in terms of their development and their research and product development. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also talked about the capital cost allowance and where it should go, and about the role of manufacturing, as in the report that was supported by this House and by all parties in this House at committee. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked about housing and infrastructure and the federal government's involvement in infrastructure and where we should be going with that.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035">(1035)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para886155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also had a fairly extensive discussion on the role of charities and volunteering and giving in this country. It was very interesting. Just so members know, we had numerous presenters tell us that the change made by the finance minister to allow for stocks and bonds to be used for charity donations made a significant impact on the work that those charities are able to do. They were able to gather more money, a tremendous amount, and particularly in the case of the health care sector for our hospitals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our report is broken down into three areas. There is an introduction on the overall economics of what is happening in this country. There is a very good review of the testimony we heard in a summary of the individuals and organizations appearing before the committee to talk about what their issues were, how they would address those issues, what their goals and expectations were or what suggestions they had for the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a section on recommendations. To be fair, there was to be section on what we in the committee believe should happen, but I thought it would be more appropriate to deal with what we heard and as a committee deal with the recommendations directly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be frank, I believe there were about 52 recommendations that came brought forward from the different parties and the organizations we heard from. They were condensed into this report and discussed by committee. In actual fact, there was quite a bit of unanimity and support from at least the majority of the parties on a number of issues. I would say that on probably 30 of the 52 issues, committee members agreed, and that went into the report. That is a significant amount.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it was my suggestion that in addition to the main body of the report every party have a report of the supplementary issues they would like dealt with. They are not minority reports. We often hear from opposition members that we are here to make this place work, and in this particular case I think having supplementary reports instead of minority reports is more appropriate when it comes to our prebudget consultation. We all have different approaches to the same problem. All members were able to put them forward in this report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report contains a number of recommendations. To be frank with members and the public, not every member in every caucus agreed. The Conservative members did not always agree. The Liberal members did not always agree. The discussion was very good and we have put a number of items forward. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, I would like to highlight a couple of items that I was very keen on putting forward and that made it into the report. There are two things that I will talk about up front.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886162"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a discussion of the LEED program, the leadership in energy and environmental design program, for green federal buildings. I know that it does not sound like much, but I think it is important. We heard from some delegations about this program. They said that it is the role of the federal government to make sure that we do what we can for the environment in our own federal buildings. We heard that there has to be a program which will help to make sure that when new buildings are developed or redeveloped there is the ability to make them as environmentally sensitive as possible. This is a start. I look forward to seeing if the finance minister heeds our advice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area I put forward was a children's health initiative. I think there is some opportunity in this country to focus on research on children's health. I put forward as one of my recommendations, which also made the report, the possibility of a fund designated for children's health. Canada is a world leader in the field of research in juvenile diabetes and it is an area that I think Canada should be pursuing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report contains a number of recommendations that are important to Burlington, such as improved charity donation review, post-secondary education funding for those furthering their education, and an improvement in the GIS system, where we are recommending that people should be able to earn more money before the clawback starts. There also are other recommendations.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040">(1040)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para886165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 30 seconds I have left, I want to comment on one other item. The other side of spending is expenditure control. I want to be clear for the House and the people of Canada that in 2006 with Advantage Canada we started to implement the expenditure management system. Finally we are looking at programs in a four year cycle. If they are meeting their objectives, great, but if they are not, we need to review whether we are going to continue to fund them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are using taxpayers' money. We have to make sure that we are getting value for the dollars being spent. If we are not, we must have the ability to move those moneys to a different, more productive program or to a different program altogether. We need to have the courage to make--</div>

I do not approve of most of what was said. The only thing I completely agree with in these last two speeches, was the bit about “blah, blah, blah”. That pretty much sums up what was said. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of talk of tax cuts as a way to get our economy moving and to help out the manufacturing and forestry industries, which are experiencing difficulties. As the member who just spoke knows very well, companies that are experiencing difficulties do not pay taxes, so tax cuts do nothing to help them get through the crisis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the $1 billion aid plan announced by the government will help communities find other jobs, but will not help save existing jobs. Moreover, this aid plan does not target the problem areas. Quebec and Ontario are the hardest hit, but the aid will be allocated on a per capita basis, so more will be handed out in Alberta, which is not experiencing a manufacturing crisis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886172"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like my colleague to take a look at the past. During the mad cow crisis, aid went primarily to beef-producing provinces. It made sense, at the time, to send aid money to the provinces where the mad cow crisis was causing difficulties. If he sees nothing wrong with that, would he not agree, then, that this is the same thing and that the aid should essentially be given to the provinces hurt by the manufacturing crisis?</div>

We sort of miss the member from the Bloc getting his picture taken and being very excited about his travels with the finance committee across this country. He was a very proud Canadian at the time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886174"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue the Bloc member brought up was whether the money basically should only go to Quebec, or that at the end of the day, that is what the Bloc would like. Of the $1 billion community reinvestment fund that we just put forward through the House and which now is getting through the Senate, hopefully, that money is being spent across the country. We make no apologies for that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886175"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issues in terms of manufacturing and some communities that are suffering due to the economic issues they are facing is not an issue just in certain parts of this country. It is happening across the country. To be fair to all parts of the country, to all Canadians and to all communities, we believe that the $1 billion community trust fund that we have set out should be shared equally by all Canadians because all Canadians are paying for that fund. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886176"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That money will be disbursed to the provinces that have those issues. They will gear the money to the locations that are suffering most, whether it is in manufacturing or forestry, but it is not just a Quebec issue. It is a Canadian issue and that is why our $1 billion dollar trust fund is designed to help all Canadians.</div>

    </p><a name="Para886182"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get the facts laid out today. Our government will invest more in affordable housing this year than any federal government in history.

We are making a difference in the issue. </div>

I would also like to thank those who made written submissions, as well as the clerk and her assistants for their excellent work. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para886185"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I even thank fellow MPs from opposition parties for what was generally a cooperative effort, even though we did not agree on every point, as was evident from our various minority reports.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Conservatives came to power two years ago, they inherited the strongest fiscal position, the strongest employment growth of any G-7 country. Therefore, it was really up to them. They had the opportunity, based on very large surpluses, to make wise investments, smart tax cuts so as to better position our country in terms of productivity and in being prepared to face the times of greater economic uncertainty, in which we now find ourselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886187"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burden of my remarks is that they have failed to make these wise investments and these intelligent tax cuts. Now when we are at a time of great economic uncertainty, potentially in recession, we find our fiscal cupboard is bare. We find ourselves much less able to face the future with confidence than had the government managed our economy in an effective and efficient way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886188"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just say a few words about the overall economic situation in which we find ourselves. Clearly, the major global problems have begun in the United States, which is truly in the eye of the storm, but Canada is not immune. We see this from the fact that the Bank of Canada has substantially reduced its growth forecast for this year, indeed to less than 1% for the first quarter of this year. Jobs actually dropped significantly in the month of December. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886189"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, government's claim that employment is at an all time high is simply wrong arithmetically. Jobs came down last month by 51,000 in terms of the private sector and some 17,000 total jobs. Some sectors have been particularly hard hit. Manufacturing has lost more than 130,000 jobs in the last year. According to one of our witnesses at the finance committee, Jim Stanford, he expects that if the dollar stays at or near parity, we could face another 300,000 job losses in manufacturing over the next two to four years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886190"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it in a nutshell, one of Canada's better respected economists has summed up by saying that the odds of a recession in the United States and Ontario are approximately fifty-fifty. The odds of a recession in Canada as a whole are approximately one in four.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886191"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That underlines the really tight connection between Ontario and the United States, with 90% or so of Ontario exports destined to the U.S. Therefore, the uncertainties in which the whole country finds itself are concentrated here in the province of Ontario.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886192"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with the question of spending. Perhaps uncharacteristically the Conservative government has been the biggest spending government in living memory. This is not just myself saying this. Take normally small-c conservative individuals like Andrew Coyne, who writes for the <i>National Post</i> and John Williamson, head of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. Both these gentlemen have taken the government to task for going on a big spending spree.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886193"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This comes through if we look at the numbers. If we compare total program spending over the two years of the Conservative government versus the whole Liberal time in government, or just the Liberal time in government since we balanced the budget, we find the rate of growth of spending substantially higher in the last two years than in the Liberal years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886194"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is particularly the case if we limit our consideration to money spent by the federal government itself rather than monies transferred to individuals or other levels of government. The federal government's own spending in the two years of government has been up by an almost unbelievable 18%, which is an average of 8.6% per year. This is very substantially higher than spending increases during the Liberal period.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055">(1055)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para886195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As confirmed by Andrew Coyne and by John Williamson and as confirmed by the statistics, this has been a big spending government when times were good. Its first two years in government, until recently, were periods of strong economic growth globally and inherited from the previous government. It spent like drunken sailors during good times, leaving the cupboard largely bare now that we are entering uncertain times. I submit, from the point of view of basic economic management, this is an incompetent way to run a fiscal policy and a government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the ledger is tax. The Conservatives spent like crazy during good times, now we have taxes on the other side. Essentially they have undertaken four tax measures, one with which we agree. Indeed, the Leader of the Liberal Party, before the Conservative economic statement, called for deeper corporate tax cuts to increase the productivity and competitiveness of the Canadian economic and partly to offset the fact that Canada no longer had an competitive advantage to a weak currency. We needed to create a new Canadian advantage through a corporate tax rate substantially lower than the United States. The government has followed our suggestion, so we do not really have any complaints in that domain. However, that is where our agreement ends. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second item of taxation done by the Conservatives was this. Within a few months of coming to office, they raised personal income tax rates on the lowest income Canadians. They raised it from 15% to 15.5%. Then, in a great sweep of victory, they brought it back to 15% from 15.5% and claimed huge credit for cutting taxes, whereas in reality they raised the tax for one year to 15.5% and then brought it down to 15%. We do not object to them bringing it back to 15%, but we do criticize them for raising that tax for one year a year earlier.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886198"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third thing the Conservatives did was spend a huge amount of money to lower the GST by two points. There is hardly an economist on the planet who would agree that was the wisest way to cut taxes. I will simply quote former Conservative cabinet minister, Perrin Beatty, now the president of the Chamber of Commerce, who said:</div>
    </p><a name="Para886199"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Knocking another point off the GST may be politically attractive but it does not provide the same incentive for improving our sustained economic performance.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para886200"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Liberals believe in cutting taxes. We are committed to not raising any taxes, including the GST, but we certainly believe it would have been far wiser had the government used that same amount of money for broad based personal income tax cuts rather than for cutting the GST.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth element of the Conservative tax policy is what I would call narrow, politically motivated boutique tax cuts. In other words, if the Conservatives have money available to cut taxes, instead of cutting the taxes of all Canadians, they direct those to narrowly targeted groups like students getting credits for buying text books or young Canadians playing hockey, et cetera.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886202"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have nothing against those groups. In fact I am in favour of them. However, why is it up to government to decide that young hockey players deserve a tax break and young piano players or violin players do not? This is an intrusive kind of tax policy that substitutes government decision making where family decision making is appropriate. We would prefer to have broad based tax cuts rather than narrow, politically directed, intrusive boutique tax cuts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we combine the spending spree during good times with the tax cuts, which are largely incompetent in the sense that at least most economists and I believe most business leaders and most Canadians would have benefited far more from a different pattern of tax cuts, the net effect is that the government's fiscal cupboard is bare just at the moment when the Canadian economy is likely to need a boost.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1100"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100">(1100)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para886204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me end by mentioning the sectors where the Canadian economy definitely does need a boost . Manufacturing, as I said earlier, is at risk of losing hundreds of thousands more jobs. Forestry is on life support. The livestock branch of agriculture is in deep trouble. Tourism is in trouble. All of these sectors are in trouble for a combination of reasons, but principally the very high value of the Canada dollar is hammering them. In addition, a slowing U.S. economy and rising energy costs are creating this perfect storm in which several of Canada's most important sectors are being battered as we speak.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is not prepared to do anything for those sectors. Yes, it has this communities fund, and we on the Liberal side have said we would replicate that, but that does not help protect the jobs in those sectors. That only comes into play after those jobs have been lost. The Conservatives have nothing to directly support the manufacturing industry and those other sectors in their time of need. Whereas we on the Liberal side are not only going to replicate the communities fund, but we also have an additional $1 billion fund dedicated to supporting investment in the manufacturing sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the government is neglecting these critical sectors of the Canadian economy at their moment of greatest need, partly because the Conservatives have overspent in the past. They spent wildly during good times, leaving the fiscal cupboard bare. But there are also their narrow ideological reasons. They adhere to free market principles. The government will not get involved in the manufacturing sector, as the<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> finance minister</A> called it a shell game; this, even though the biggest players, the United States and the European Union, have given massive subsidies to their agricultural and aerospace sectors. The southern state governors are giving massive subsidies to car companies to locate there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a kind of boy scout, narrow ideology, naive point of view that Canada alone can adhere to these market principles while all the players around us are doing otherwise. It is a recipe for job losses, a recipe for not supporting key sectors of the Canadian economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, the government has demonstrated great incompetence in its economic management. I have not had time to mention two of the most incompetent episodes involving income trusts and interest deductibility. Both of those will go down in infamy in terms of incompetence, and in the case of income trusts dishonest economic management, but at the macro level in terms of excessive spending in good times, in terms of an unwise structure of tax cuts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Canada enters this period of economic uncertainty, the government which inherited the most bountiful fiscal surplus two years ago has left the fiscal cupboard virtually bare. It has left the Canadian economy ill-prepared for the economic storms which may lie ahead of us.</div>

    </p><a name="Para886217"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his second question about expenditure review, I was the chair of the expenditure review committee when the Liberals were in government and we found $11 billion of savings over a period of five years. I am philosophically very much in favour of the idea that it is the responsibility of government to continuously shift expenditures out of low priority areas and into high priority areas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble with the Conservative government is that when it did an expenditure review or cut exercise several months ago, it did not look for efficiencies in administration the way we did. The Conservatives made cuts directed at the most vulnerable in Canadian society. They cut women's groups. They cut literacy. They cut museums. They cut not that much money compared with the $11 billion, but there was an outcry because these were politically motivated cuts to the most vulnerable in Canadian society, such as the court challenges program which the Conservative Party regarded as their political enemies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Conservative Party comes back with sensible administrative savings of the kind the Liberals discovered, I would be inclined to support them. If they come back with more ideological cuts to the most vulnerable in Canadian society, then I would oppose them with great vigour.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly what the Conservatives voted against the day before yesterday. This House adopted the Standing Committee on Finance's report with the support of the Liberals and the New Democrats. Only the Conservatives opposed it. Now that it has turned up in the common section of the report, we know that the Conservative members of the committee bought into this part.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will my colleague stand with me on this to persuade the Conservative members of the committee to make the Conservative government change its mind on this and move forward? That would make it possible to implement the fiscal recommendations as quickly as possible because the crisis in the manufacturing and forestry sectors is happening now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard to understand why the Conservative government voted against this recommendation on Tuesday, but is supporting it today because it is part of the newly released report. Conservative members went against their government and supported the recommendation. I think they have finally come around to the right position on this issue. Does this mean that we will finally get something done about this?</div>

Let me respond very briefly, first in terms of history and then in terms of the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886231"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The historical record is utterly clear. Whether one is talking about Ontario, and Eves plus the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">minister of finance</A>, or Mulroney in Canada, or Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush, the lesson from history is that it is always the Conservatives or the Republicans who create the big, fat deficits and it is always the Liberals or the Democrats who are left to clean up the ugly Conservative mess. That is history and I do not think that can be disputed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future is a bit harder to predict than the past. Given that the Conservatives inherited such huge surpluses, it would be premature to say that a deficit is imminent, but they are certainly skating closer to the edge than we ever would have. If the economy does weaken, not hugely but a bit more, we could be seeing a Conservative deficit. That would certainly be consistent with history and that would quite likely mean another Conservative deficit left for Liberals to clean up.</div>

First of all, I would like to thank my colleagues from the Standing Committee on Finance, as well as the entire staff that helped us in our work on this. Naturally, dialogue and debate can be intense, since we all have different opinions. In my case, the hon. members for Jeanne-Le Ber and Saint-Maurice—Champlain support me in my committee work as the Bloc Québécois representative. We try to work as a team as much as possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886234"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my first year as finance critic, I addressed the question of budget consultations by first initiating very broad consultations in my riding in August and September 2007. I organized six two-hour public meetings in six different municipalities. I sent a flyer to all households in my riding, urging them to share their opinion with me. We then proceeded with a Quebec-wide consultation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tried to respect these recommendations as much as possible in this report. There are some things that were not supported. Nevertheless, there are other things that the committee agreed to include in the report that I think are very important. I hope the government will also accept them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886236"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recall our six budget priorities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we wanted an aid package to support workers and businesses affected by the manufacturing and forestry crisis—a package worth more than the $1 billion announced, which is clearly not enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also wanted measures to give seniors back their dignity. These measures would make the guaranteed income supplement retroactive and increase it, which would allow seniors at least to live at the poverty line.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also wanted the reinstatement of education and social transfers to 1994–95 levels. Financially, that is where the fiscal imbalance continues to hurt: the problem has not been resolved at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted increased funding for social housing and a reversal of the ideological cuts made by the Conservative government, particularly with regard to women's groups.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886241"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also wanted to see increased funding for culture. We recommended about $400 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to see a 180-degree turn on the environment, where we really need an approach tied to energy savings and sustainable development. This remains an important objective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now examine each of these objectives. One of the Bloc Québécois' recommendations found in the report was to provide $1 billion for just the forestry sector and not for both the forestry and manufacturing sectors. This week, as we had requested, the government agreed to provide that amount without tying it to the budget. It finally accepted our position. It did an about-face and that is just as well because the money will be available more quickly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we were looking for $1 billion for the forestry sector alone. We wanted the government to allocate $1.5 billion in reimbursable contributions to allow companies to purchase new equipment. That was also accepted by the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we wanted to move up to 2008 the transfer of 5¢ of the gasoline tax to municipalities, rather than waiting until 2010 as planned by the government. The objective is to stimulate the economy in this period of economic slowdown where we can sense that the Americans are on the verge of a recession and the Canadian economy is attempting to avoid it. However, it is uncertain whether we will do so given the strong pull of the United States, particularly in the construction sector, which has a significant impact on our manufacturing and forestry industries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the committee recommended injecting $3.5 billion in economic renewal. That is what we called on the federal government to do last fall and to use this year's surplus to do so. The Conservative members from Quebec said that made no sense and that the Bloc Québécois was being irresponsible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois was being irresponsible? Now they should say that the Standing Committee on Finance is being irresponsible, since it is recommending exactly the same thing. The members from Quebec need to understand that and what better way than to join the Standing Committee on Finance. It would be interesting to see them there and to see whether they have anything interesting to say. The Standing Committee on Finance has accepted a constructive Bloc Québécois proposal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, the committee is recommending creating an independent employment insurance fund and to implement an older worker adjustment program. We will have to make sure that it is indeed an income security program when the government implements it. Let us not forget that today's debate is on the prebudget consultations of the Standing Committee on Finance. The government's position may differ. We still need to get the government to make commitments in the budget. However, having the majority of the Standing Committee on Finance recommend a Bloc proposal is already a big step.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1120"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120">(1120)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para886249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the government will follow through on this report. We would like to see it move forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find it regrettable, however, that the committee rejected the Bloc Québécois proposal to use the surplus from the independent fund to enhance the system. We know that our seasonal workers are currently subject to four or five pilot projects under a section of the Employment Insurance Act. These projects are still not enshrined in the legislation and they expire after six months or two years. They constantly have to be renewed, which is very complicated and causes insecurity among our seasonal workers and our seasonal industries. We wanted to see this situation corrected immediately, but it is not in the report and we will continue to fight for it. Although the Committee supported the Bloc Québécois’ demand to create an independent Employment Insurance fund to end government pillaging, it refused to enhance the program, as I have just explained.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They also refused to put $500 million back into Technology Partnerships Canada, telling us that after that program was eliminated, money was injected into the aeronautics industry. That is fine, but there are industries other than aeronautics that also benefited from that program. For example, in my riding, there is a company that has, on three occasions, received substantial amounts of money that it used to create hundreds of jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technology Partnerships Canada was condemned by the Conservatives. There may have been a few small problems, but they threw the baby out with the bathwater. It was a worthwhile program, and it would be appropriate to use it during these times when companies must innovate and invest in research and development and our regions must be strengthened. It is a useful and effective tool. It would have been appropriate to continue making it available, but it was not approved by a majority of the committee. The Bloc is not satisfied. We express our displeasure and will continue to fight for this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is another very important recommendation by the Bloc in the report. It relates to retroactive payment of the guaranteed income supplement, in an amount estimated at $3 billion. At present, in the legislation, when someone becomes eligible for the guaranteed income supplement and realizes that he or she should have been receiving it in the past, the person is given a maximum of 11 months of retroactive payments. Often, however, these are older people who have very little income and who should have been eligible for it for three, four or six years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The typical case is usually someone whose spouse handled the money and who has been widowed and did not start the process to get the payments. Guaranteed income supplement payments did not start automatically and people had to take some action in order to get it. It was determined that over 200,000 Canadians and 70,000 Quebeckers were in this situation. Marcel Gagnon, a Bloc MP, led a campaign that resulted in some of those people being identified. But the government still refused to make payments retroactive. The Standing Committee on Finance has now agreed to act on that recommendation. We hope that the government will adopt it .</div>
    </p><a name="Para886255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the same line, we would have thought that the committee would agree to recommend that the government increase GIS benefits to reach the poverty line. The committee is preventing the most vulnerable members of our society from getting out of poverty. The guaranteed income supplement is about $110 a month below what is needed for a senior citizen to have the bare necessities. In our budget consultations, we realized that this is an important issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout eastern Quebec, in regional county municipalities where there are the most senior citizens receiving the guaranteed income supplement, that is, in the poorest regional municipalities, only 79% of those people are receiving it. Even in the wealthier regional municipalities, only 52% of senior citizens are receiving it. That means that a lot of people need that income. They cannot make ends meet and so they need support. We would have liked the committee to go that far, but it did not. We will continue to fight for this. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, I hope that the government will fix this situation completely by giving retroactive payments, as the committee recommended, and by providing the maximum that people are entitled to in order to provide them with this minimum of financial security.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to the fiscal imbalance and funding for post-secondary education, the Bloc Québécois hit a wall. None of the other parties thought that funding for post-secondary education should be restored to the 1994-95 levels. That was about $3.5 billion for all of Canada and a bit more than $800 million for Quebec. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We say now in our society that we should invest in innovation, that people should be able to go to school, and that our universities should contribute to research and development. But our universities say they are underfunded. This government measure could have been very helpful. If the federal government is going to claim that its approach is different from that of the former Liberal government, it should follow through and completely eliminate the fiscal imbalance. But it will not do that. The federal government simply will not provide adequate funding for post-secondary education. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886260"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there is a major omission here. This was one of the Bloc’s main conditions and it still seems very pertinent to us. We hope that the current requests from all the universities in Quebec and in Canada, and from the industrial sector as well will bear fruit. Indirectly, adequate funding for our universities helps with the development of new products. This can be done under the heading of business assistance according to our international agreements and is something that is needed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886261"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to turn now to another of the Bloc’s priorities: social housing. At our initiative, the Standing Committee on Finance recommended that the government use the surplus that Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is running to invest in social housing. CMHC has a huge surplus of about a billion dollars. The committee did not put an exact figure on it, but we wanted $1 billion a year to be invested in social housing out of the CMHC surplus in order to create decent, affordable housing and increase the supply. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886262"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we made this investment, we would be killing two birds with one stone, or even three. We would increase the amount of social housing available, we would help cushion the economic slowdown by boosting construction, and we would reduce such phenomena as homelessness. All in all, we would make a major contribution to the fight against poverty. In our view, the Standing Committee on Finance was headed in the right direction in this regard and $1 billion is about the right amount. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were unable in committee, however, to reverse the ideologically motivated cuts to the court challenges program and Status of Women Canada. These cuts are widely condemned by women and progressive people all across Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a lot of work to be done. Groups must be provided with the tools they need. When confronting the machinery of government, it is very difficult to move a case through the system without the kind of funding and support provided by tools like the court challenges program. These are not huge sums of money, but the tool should be reinstated. The Conservatives should do what they did with the income trust issue: recognize that they made a bad call, change their minds and go back to their previous position so that we can get this program back. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another of the six conditions is funding for cultural activities. We are very disappointed that not one initiative to provide funding to cultural activities was included in the prebudget consultation report even though we know that a dollar invested in the cultural sector will provide one of the best possible returns because more jobs are being created in this sector than in just about any other. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find the federal government's indifference to be somewhat worrisome. Numerous cuts to funding programs for museums, the elimination of the public diplomacy program that financed international cultural tours, and the lack of funding for film and television speak volumes about the fact that this government does not really seem to care about culture as a way of promoting Quebec and Canada not only abroad, but also here at home. The government does not recognize the importance of culture to a society like ours.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this report, we are asking the government to change course, reinstate programs to help museums and the public diplomacy program and reinvest in the Canada Council for the Arts' feature film fund and the Canadian television fund. This would cost about $398 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886268"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another of the Bloc Québécois' six conditions has to do with the environment. The Standing Committee on Finance recommended that the government institute a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emission credits. That is interesting. The committee also recommended that the government set up various tax incentives to promote the acquisition of energy efficient transport trucks and adjust the accelerated capital cost allowance on rail equipment to encourage investment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures are interesting, and we hope that the government will implement them. However, we would have liked to see the government adopt our proposal for the establishment of regional, absolute greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, to bring emissions down to 1990 levels, and development of a framework for a carbon exchange mechanism in Montreal. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130">(1130)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para886270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to explain things again to the Conservative government. If only there were strict rules. In fact, investing in the environment sector is becoming more and more profitable. When the rules are confusing, businesses do not benefit. If this recommendation were supported, if the government decided to implement it, there would be a significant impact on the economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about it. There is the whole issue of refundable tax credits for research and development, but there would also be an environmental advantage. Businesses would be more productive if they used less energy, and at the same time, they would be helping to decrease greenhouse gases. There would be an added incentive. I urge the government to move forward on this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is particularly interesting that the Standing Committee on Finance accepted all of these recommendations: $1 billion for the forestry sector alone; $1.5 billion in aid for the industry; and $3 billion for the guaranteed income supplement. These are all measures that have been criticized by the Conservative Quebec members, who called it overspending. Now, it is the position of the Conservative government and the Standing Committee on Finance, which adopted these motions. This means that our figures were not so far-fetched, since they have now been adopted by the Standing Committee on Finance and recommended to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shows that there is a great deal of interest in the work we did and the consultations we held in communities across Quebec and Canada. The bottom line is that the current level of financial assistance for the manufacturing and forestry industries is not enough. The figures prove this. The Standing Committee on Finance has made a practical, positive recommendation in this regard. It is no longer just the position of the Bloc, the NDP, the Liberals or the Conservatives; it is the position of the entire Standing Committee on Finance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> will incorporate these recommendations directly. He can even act on them without delay. Canada has a $10 billion surplus. On March 31, 2008, if this surplus has not been allocated, it will all go to pay down the debt. That would mean that even though the Standing Committee on Finance recognizes that $1 billion is needed for the forestry industry, $1.5 billion for the manufacturing industry and $3.5 billion for the guaranteed income supplement, the government would turn a blind eye and allocate the surplus to the debt and would not address these problems. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we can address them now, before March 31, as we did for the trust. That would enable us to deal with a lot of irritants and emergencies, as the leader of the Bloc Québécois said, in terms of the economy, assistance for workers affected by the economic slowdown and the crises, and equity for seniors who have not received their retroactive guaranteed income supplement payments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886276"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of interesting recommendations in the report. Our six conditions have not been met, but we will keep working on that. We would like the government to take real action soon and move forward. This is the perfect opportunity: the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> is due to meet with the Premier of Quebec shortly. He and the Bloc Québécois, as representatives of the coalition or consensus in Quebec, said that money was needed immediately. The government decided to do an about-face, accept the recommendation and hold a vote on it immediately.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886277"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Premier of Quebec, the Bloc Québécois, the people of Quebec, the labour congresses, the forestry sector and industries are saying that more money is needed. This is what remains to be done. More money must be allocated in the coming days, out of this year's surplus.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886278"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will close there. There many other measures in the budget and, overall, a good number of recommendations by the Bloc Québécois were included. However, some are still missing. We will continue the debate and fight for our proposals. We hope that at budget time, the budget will reflect the consultations that we held with Quebeckers. If the budget does not include what it should, we will vote against it. We are prepared to go to the polls if need be. We have presented what Quebec would like. We now have proof that our numbers have the blessing of the Standing Committee on Finance, which flies in the face of the irresponsible comments made by the Conservative members from Quebec. </div>

I think he is very clear and accurate today that a lot of the issues that the Bloc brought forward during the committee are in the report. We did not agree with all of them, but I think they added quite a bit of value to the discussion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886280"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to clarify one thing before I ask my question. In budget 2006 we talked about housing. Our party provided $1.4 billion and invested in an affordable housing trust, and $270 million in the homelessness partnering strategy. The government put a billion dollars in a partnership agreement with the provinces and the municipalities. So there is money being spent on the homelessness and housing issue. It is up to the provinces and the municipalities to actually implement it and to spend that cash. The federal government has made it available.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886281"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has done other things that we agreed on in terms of the workers income tax benefit. We are looking at trying to improve on that. There have been improvements for seniors and the capital cost allowance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member talked about the surplus. He said that we should spend all of it and too heck with the debt in a sense. Really, is there a surplus if you have a debt? The surplus is a cash surplus in a year. I do not know what the number is off the top of my head, but we have a $450 billion debt. This is a mortgage that my children and your children, my grandchildren and their grandchildren will be paying. There is no such true thing as a surplus, when you have a huge debt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Bloc's position on debt? Why are you so opposed to us paying down--</div>

The response will be quite clear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, out of the $10 billion surplus we will have on March 31, the Bloc thinks that $3 billion should go toward the debt, or roughly 30% of the surplus. The remaining 70% should be allocated to urgent matters. Our country is behaving like a homeowner obsessed with paying down the mortgage as soon as possible, but whose back deck is falling apart. Even Mr. Vaillancourt, the mayor of Laval and spokesperson for the Coalition pour le renouvellement des infrastructures du Québec, used that analogy, but he said it is not the back deck that is in disrepair, but the foundation of the house.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratio of Canada's debt to its gross domestic product has decreased significantly over the past 10 years, to such an extent that we are now the best G-8 country on that score. There is no point in emphasizing that any further when there are urgent needs to address.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc thinks that it would be reasonable to put $3 billion toward the debt this year. That would leave an $8 billion margin for next year. With our proposals, if there is no major economic slowdown, there could be an $8 billion surplus at the end of the year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we are being very responsible. We agree that a portion of it should be invested in paying down the debt. However, in Quebec like everywhere else, problems of fairness need to be resolved, as in the case of the guaranteed income supplement for seniors. For years now, many seniors have not been entitled to their money, to the minimum they need to survive. The government must assume its responsibilities before paying down the debt, especially considering that the plan is doing pretty well. Indeed, our ratio is quickly becoming one of the best. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude on this point. A portion of it must be allocated to the debt, but a large portion must also be used to meet these glaring needs in our society. We hope the upcoming budget will reflect these choices.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of the prebudget report is generally to try to influence the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">finance minister</A> and shape the budget through this report. It is an extensive process that involves a whole variety of things. I wonder whether the hon. member is a bit frustrated by the actions of the government in effectively rendering this report dead on arrival.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there was prorogation. Prorogation essentially took a month out of committee hearings. That is a significant period of time in parliamentary time, as we well know. That took us into October.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then well into October we found out that on October 31 a mini budget was going to be presented. The mini budget basically blew out the fiscal space that existed and the government continued on its wild and crazy spending spree. Essentially, there was no money left over.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of that was that we would not be able to report until this week. As everyone in this chamber knows, the budget is already written. There is nothing left. Even if the government had to hire very expensive speech writers, the budget is already written.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the hon. member would share Dr. Carty's observations, when he was recently fired, one of which was that this government seems to prefer less advice rather than more.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I held very democratic consultations in my riding and then throughout Quebec. The committee made a number of important recommendations.

A budget will be presented in a few weeks and if the government has not heeded the recommendations regarding what our citizens want, it will pay the political price. We, as MPs, are here to represent the population and express their opinions. The Bloc Québécois has announced its proposals in advance for what it wants to see in the budget, in terms of how the surplus is used this year and next year. It has also come up with some very concrete, realistic recommendations. We hope the government will listen to us. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it adopts the same attitude that it has in a number of other matters, it will not listen. Let us recall Afghanistan and the urgent adoption of a recommendation, two years ago, to extend the mission. According to the government, it was urgent and it was the only thing to do even though they could not answer a single question that the then Minister of Defence had asked when he was in opposition with regard to the pertinence of this mission. Had the government taken another position, we would not be in the current situation of not knowing where we are going with Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the government has learned some lessons from this experience. It has been in a minority position for two years. If the Conservatives wish to remain in government, they have to accept what Canadians want, as expressed through their members of Parliament. That is the democratic game as we have played it. We have presented proposals to the House and made recommendations, some of which have been retained by the Standing Committee on Finance. We will continue to debate them. I believe that our fellow citizens want us to have this influence. I believe we will if we continue to act together. When collective recommendations are made on issues, common interests are found.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886302"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, this week, the government party voted against our recommendation to provide tax measures for the manufacturing and forestry sectors. We can see that progress has been made because the Conservative position and what the report contains are not the same. The government will have to consider this. Either the MPs on the Standing Committee on Finance did not represent the government's opinion or the government made a mistake last week and may change its position, just as it reversed its position on the trust.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, it is important that the budget contain elements that will make it a good budget for Quebeckers and for all of Canada. If that is not the case, every one of us must have the courage to rise in this House and vote against the budget if it does not represent what our fellow citizens want in the current situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they truly want—their basic message—is that the government must be proactive. Standing on the sidelines is not acceptable—</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing the result of the enormous amount of work that was carried out across Canada. Individuals and groups were surveyed on the vision they would like to see in the next budget, and the direction they would like our economy to take in the coming years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886308"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked with the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78793,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78793&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Halifax</A> and the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78359,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78359&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Victoria</A> on this. It is an extraordinary opportunity to remind people that the NDP, unlike the Bloc Québécois, represents all of Canada, and has representatives from British Columbia to Nova Scotia. This image of the breadth of the country is important, because people tend to forget that to properly represent the economy, we need a balanced vision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886309"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the main point of my speech today. I want to talk about the work that has been done in recent months to try to rebalance the economy. This can be seen in the New Democratic Party minority report, appended to the committee's report. There are points that we completely disagree with, because of where the Conservative government is currently taking our economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886310"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back, we can see that the end of the second world war marked the start of attempts to build a Canadian economy that still existed two or three years ago, a balanced economy in which forestry and mining were dominant in the primary sector. Our country's natural resources, which are non-renewable in the case of mines and renewable in the case of forests, need to be used sustainably, in a way that respects future generations, which has often not been the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886311"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada also needs a processing sector. Too often in its history, Canada would cut its trees and ship them to other countries, including our neighbour to the south. It would also extract its mineral resources and ship them to other countries for secondary and tertiary processing. This vision also needed to be changed. Canada therefore developed ways of doing secondary and tertiary processing here whenever possible. It did not always do enough of this sort of processing, but things were improving.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Canadian economy was based on a strong service sector centred mainly in Montreal and Toronto at the time. Today, it is unfortunately based less and less in Montreal and more and more in Toronto. Of course, I am speaking as a member from Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once in office, the current government stepped up a process aimed at making Canada a subsidiary of the American economy. I am referring, for example, to a project known as Keystone, which is a way of exporting not only unprocessed crude oil, but also 18,000 jobs to the United States. That is the Conservatives' record.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boom in the oil sector in western Canada has had adverse effects on other segments of the economy. As the oil sector heated up, the value of the Canadian dollar, our loonie, rose to unprecedented levels. This had a direct impact on our manufacturers' export capability. It is a simple equation: the higher the value of our dollar, the harder it is for an American company, for example, to buy goods produced in Canada, because the American company has to pay in Canadian dollars and the Canadian dollar is much stronger than it was not long ago when it was worth much less than the American dollar. As a result, hundreds of thousands of jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jobs have also been lost in the forestry industry for two reasons: first, we have the overheating of the oil industry, which is also affecting the manufacturing industry; and second, we have the softwood lumber agreement with the U.S. under which we handed over $1 billion for no reason. Under NAFTA, we were totally right to do what we did. Unfortunately, our hands were tied. They kept pushing and we foolishly signed. The NDP was opposed to that agreement, while the Bloc was in favour of it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two industries have suffered the consequences greatly: the forestry industry and the manufacturing industry. Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost. That is what we call imbalance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886317"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has this government been able to correct the situation? Not at all. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week—I am not talking about before the holidays, but just last week—the very first question I asked the government was whether, before the budget, it could hand over the $1 billion it promised in the form of a trust.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response from the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78345,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78345&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Pontiac</A> and <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78771,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78771&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</A> was rather shocking. He said, from his seat here in this House, that what I was asking for was impossible because it was an expenditure and it needed to be passed with the budget. According to him, it was impossible to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886320"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened a few days later, this week? Precisely what he said was impossible to do last week. That is the Conservatives' logic when it comes to the economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886321"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a real challenge before us. There are things that Canadians agree on, such as having a public health care system that is accessible, universal and open to everyone. What are the Conservatives doing? They are rendering the system meaningless. The NDP is proud to remind Canadians that it was Tommy Douglas who was the precursor to our health care system. He was a member of the CCF, which became the NDP.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are proud of having a better health care system than the Americans, but we are worried. This system is not adequately funded.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886323"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many things the government can and must do something about, but to which the Conservatives are ideologically opposed, except when they have no choice, as was the case with the $1 billion to help the manufacturing and forestry industries.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para886324"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said at the outset that I would be sharing my time with my <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78793,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78793&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">colleague from Halifax </A> and I propose to do just that now. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind people that the NDP, in the process that led to the budget consultations and all through it, was able to hear from Canadians. In Halifax for example, 15 of the 18 groups that came in were very clear that they shared our vision and not that of the Conservative government. The Conservative government, by favouring the petroleum sector in the west, by giving over supposed tax breaks that are supposed to help the economy, is only helping companies that made profits and paid taxes, so manufacturing and forestry companies that made no profit last year benefited nothing. Who got the money? The big oil companies and the banks. Did they need it? No. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government has been destabilizing what was up until now a very balanced Canadian economy and in a couple of years it has actually made the situation far worse. So much for good fiscal management by Conservatives. It is a little bit like the situation in the United States where the most catastrophic economic times in recent memory are now taking place under the governance of another right winger, George Bush, a good friend of Steve, but we here in Canada are going to stand up and fight for what is right.</div>

    </p><a name="Para886329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois, however, has the advantage of always systematically representing Quebec when it comes to economic issues like those that have arisen in the House. For example, there was a vote on a Bloc Québécois motion proposing that a percentage of the military contracts awarded to Boeing should correspond to the relative size of Quebec's aerospace industry. In other words, over half of the contracts should be awarded exclusively to Quebec, as befits Quebec's presence in the industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, the NDP voted against Quebec. That was a unanimous request, and it had the support of the National Assembly, but the NDP sided with the government on that motion. At the time, the member had not yet been elected to the House. If a vote like that were to come up again and there was a conflict between his party's interests and Quebec's interests, would he vote against his party or against Quebec?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest problem of course is the fact that with its massive tax giveaway to corporations that made huge profits last year, especially the banking and petroleum sectors, the government has compromised the leeway that could have existed in our economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is interesting is that the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A>-- and we should always remind people every time we mention his name that the current Minister of Finance, without any consequence, broke the rules for the attribution of contracts recently--was encouraged by the Liberals. It is always worth reminding people that the Liberals do not believe anything. One morning their leader woke up and said, “We need more tax cuts for businesses”. That gave the opportunity to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> to say in so many words, “I didn't think I would be able to cut so much with regard to corporate taxes. Thanks to the Liberals who are pushing me to cut even more, I am going to give the deepest tax cut in Canadian history to the corporations that made the most profits last year”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague is quite right that the tax cuts the Conservatives gave to the oil companies and to the banks removed a lot of the room to manoeuvre economically in Canada, but not all is lost.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is continuing to destabilize what had been until quite recently quite a balanced economy in Canada by heating up the oil sector even more by giving tax breaks. Of course the government could not be helping the companies that lost money last year because they did not pay taxes, so they did not get a cent from the $14 billion in tax breaks, but individual companies like EnCana got cheques for $50 million, $60 million, $70 million, a little windfall for its buddies in Alberta from the current government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is the vision the Conservatives have of Canada, to throw everything they can at companies that are already making huge profits and destroying the environment in Alberta, they are going to be allowed to do that until the public throws them out.</div>

It is also important to congratulate the voters in Outremont for having chosen this remarkable man, thereby bolstering the progressive forces here in Parliament and opening the door to a progressive course of action for all of Canada.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para886345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy to speak briefly in this budget debate. There is never enough time to address all of the issues of concern, so first of all I want to invite every single Canadian who wants to understand more about the New Democrat vision to acquaint themselves with, to familiarize themselves with, to read the New Democratic Party's supplementary report, to which our finance critic has made reference in his very excellent speech.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What they will see is that not only do we have a fundamentally different set of priorities than this very meanspirited, tight-fisted government, except when it comes to corporations, of course, when it is not tight-fisted in the least, but we have a fundamentally different set of priorities than the so-called Liberal official opposition. I do not know how the Liberals can call themselves the official opposition and again and again abandon their responsibilities in that regard, particularly as it relates to the financial health of the nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First the official opposition does this by goading and egging on the no longer progressive conservative but Conservative government to cut faster and deeper and introduce even greater corporate tax cuts than even the Conservatives had dreamed of, and then, second, the Liberals sit in their seats again and again when it comes to important votes to represent the concerns of Canadians who are not being represented by this government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope people will acquaint themselves with the supplementary report that has been tabled.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me say something in a general way, as was referred to by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',113956,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=113956&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Outremont</A>. I had the privilege to sit in on the finance committee in his stead when the committee visited Nova Scotia. It is literally true that delegation after delegation absolutely disagreed with the priorities of this government and were very clear that what this government had decided to do was reward its corporate friends, the greatest beneficiaries of those deep corporate tax cuts being big oil and big banks, at the expense of the needs of ordinary working people who were desperate to see some reinvestment from that extensive surplus in the things that had been so severely eroded by the Liberals before them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know we hear howling from the Liberal benches that they had this big deficit they had to get rid of, so let us set aside the three years in which the big deficit was the principal preoccupation. Let us talk about the seven years of surplus following.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only did the Liberal government not rebuild and reinvest in the post-secondary education system so our young people could get the education they needed without crippling themselves with debt for life, and not only did it not rebuild the health care system, the Liberal government did not address what is crucial, what is one of the biggest responsibilities of any government in this world today if it is at all serious about a future for the planet and its people: it did not commit the dollars necessary to move us to deliver on our to date completely overlooked commitment to meet our Kyoto targets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, it was reassuring, I have to say, and why am I not surprised, that delegates from all over--and I want to be fair in saying that they were not just from my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78793,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78793&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Halifax</A> but from other parts of the province and from outside of the province--understood exactly what was wrong with the economic so-called update from this government in the fall, in which it gave away the bank so that it would not be able to address the priorities of Canadians. Let me just very briefly quote some of the representatives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representative of the Association of Nova Scotia University Teachers said, and I think very insightfully:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our supplementary report to the finance committee recommendations, we made it very clear that every single cent of the funds that have been in the millennium scholarship fund, and more, need to be reinvested and increased to achieve that aim.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886356"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, a long-serving champion of health and education needs in Nova Scotia, Ian Johnson from the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union, absolutely had it right when he spelled out the need for the government to abandon plans for corporate tax cuts in order to help implement and develop a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy, and when he called, as many others did, on the government to honour the Atlantic accord and stop trying to pretend that it has been fixed, because those funds are desperately needed to meet the needs of ordinary Nova Scotians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were others who championed the cause of those who are the most vulnerable in our society. The director of Feed Nova Scotia, Dianne Swinemar, pleaded for a reversal of the decision in October 2007 to give a $60 billion tax cut and for the understanding that the poorest of the poor have to be the top priority when it comes to the allocation of the nation's resources. Others spoke along the same lines.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886358"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to say that the last word, in a sense, goes to I think one of the biggest champions of health at the community level as well as an anti-poverty advocate, an advocate for affordable housing, Paul O'Hara, from the North End Community and Health Centre, who said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ordinary people all across this country who are suffering because of the series of budget choices that have been very short-sighted and meanspirited, made by the previous Liberal government and followed by this no longer progressive Conservative government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to mention this and I have to say that this is just typical. This morning, just before I came over to the House to participate in this debate, I met with representatives of the Lung Association of Canada. They are doing the kind of work that is being done by NGOs and community agencies all across this country and are pleading for the government to understand how underfunded their important work is in terms of research, policy development and treatment. They pointed out that while the Lung Association gets only 2% of the funds for its work, in terms of health needs it actually represents 6% of the urgent need for attention from the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886363"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are things being done that are progressive, and they are being done in spite of the government. In Nova Scotia today, the NGOs and the health agencies came together with the provincial government, and I want to say good for the government for signing on, under the auspices of the Lung Association, to commit themselves to a national lung health framework. These are the kinds of initiatives that deserve and cry out for funding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886364"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, the Alzheimer's Society was here on Parliament Hill to plead the case of adequate funding for a national Alzheimer's strategy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886365"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summation, what is very distressing is how little the government is in tune with the needs of ordinary, everyday working people and how pathetic it is that the official opposition does not have any more sense of being in tune with those needs. Therefore, I am very pleased to speak in support of the supplementary report submitted by the formidable finance critic of the New Democratic Party to try to get the government back on track with progressive values and progressive initiatives on behalf of Canadians.</div>

    </p><a name="Para886367"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that member and the previous NDP speaker claimed that some of these corporate entities are getting these major tax cuts, but the corporate tax cuts are across the board for all corporations, for all job creating companies. Why is the member so opposed to companies that create jobs for ordinary people? </div>
    </p><a name="Para886368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, is there ever a program not meeting its objectives that the New Democrats would allow to end? Or is every program meeting its objectives? Do those members have any sense of program evaluation? What would they like to do in that area? If the budget comes forward with some concepts on where we should reallocate money, would those members be in favour of that? Is there any program, under any sun, that they disagree with?</div>

The single biggest reason why the Conservative government has done nothing about a national housing program is what the Liberal Party did in office when it eliminated literally the best national housing program in the world, which was introduced between 1972 and 1974--and it is important for people to know their history--because of the pressure of the New Democratic Party in a minority government era. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886379"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Liberals came to power talking about desperate we were for housing and they outlined specific commitments, but from 1993 to 2006 the Liberals did absolutely nothing about putting together a national housing program. I guess we could call it the Liberals letting the Conservative government off the hook.</div>

As the chair of the finance committee, it is interesting to listen to the dialogues of the members.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886381"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go on to what I would like to present, I would like to indicate that I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78637,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78637&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Northumberland—Quinte West</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886382"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to describe to Canadians and to this House exactly the process that we went through to get to where we are today in tabling the report. It was a little bit late and we had to ask for an extension. It should have been done, according to the Standing Orders, in the early part of December. We had to ask for an extension because of the prorogation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886383"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prorogation also added more complications to our ability to travel as much as we wanted to across Canada to listen to people, but we did actually hear 400 different submissions and had 200 presenters before the committee, so it was not that we abbreviated it too much but it certainly was a little different than what was initially laid out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886384"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last June the committee decided it would study taxation, so we requested to have the submissions based on how the ideal tax system in Canada should work and what changes were to be made in that regard. That is what we listened to up until we got back into session and the committee was reconstituted in November. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886385"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the table had shifted somewhat and we had seen some different things happen in the Canadian economy that we wanted to address in our report. Therefore, there was a motion taken in the committee that we would expand our criteria from taxation to look at the higher dollar.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886386"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I get into what I want to talk about with regard to the higher dollar and some of the taxation recommendations that we made, it is important to understand the process of the committee and what we are actually trying to accomplish in the report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886387"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days ago, on Tuesday, we had a delegation of Russian representatives come to our committee and their questions were actually very interesting. They asked us how we have accountability in our political process here in Canada, how we make sure we are getting value for money, and what the committee is trying to do with the prebudget report that would add to that accountability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the kinds of questions they were asking us. They are very good questions and questions that the Canadian public should understand because in the committees, particularly in a minority government where the opposition has the larger number of votes and outnumbers the governing party in the committees, we have to understand that we try to lower the political temperature in the committee meetings so that we can talk collectively about what is in the best interest of Canada because we do not report to a minister or a ministry. We report to this Parliament, to this House, and therefore the report contains recommendations to the government in power with regard to the things that it should do in the best interests of the people of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what we are trying to do in committee. That is what we tried to do in this report. I have heard a lot of the banter back and forth and it seems so political. I am sure people at home are wondering how in the world we came up with any consensus in this report. The reality is we came up with a considerable amount of consensus in the report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886390"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now laying the report at the feet of the government and I want to just read a little bit of some of the backdrop of the Canadian fundamentals that we are living in at the present time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886391"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is in its 16th year of economic expansion, the second longest period in Canadian history. Canada is the fastest growing G-7 country over the past decade in employment and living standards. Canada's job market is the best in a generation. Our unemployment rates are at the lowest in 33 years. The share of adult Canadians working is at a record high. Inflation remains low and stable, the best in the past 15 years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886392"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is emerging as a superpower in energy. We are the largest producer of clean hydroelectric power in the world. We are the second largest in oil reserves next to Saudi Arabia, and arguably we are the largest but we will not get into that. We rank third in global natural resource production. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886393"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is one of the few countries with a public pension system that is financially sustainable,and we are on the best fiscal footing of any of the G-7 nations. All levels of government are in surplus for the first time in 60 years, and we are the only member of the G-7 with a budget surplus and falling debt burden. Since coming into power, this government has created 700,000 new jobs in the past two years.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220">(1220)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para886394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That gives members an idea of what we are now laying before this Parliament as far as recommendations in the upcoming budget, but a fiscal footing that is to be envied by any country in the world. It is important to look at some of the things that we did agree on when we look at the recommendations coming in this report. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can talk about our supplementary reports and I like the words “supplementary reports” because they are not opposition reports. They are really supplement to what we are doing, but the things we do agree on are the basis of this report and are very important for us to consider.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have said we wanted to increase the income threshold to cut personal income taxes. We all agreed on that to make sure the working class would be able to have the appropriate advantages. We all agreed that should take place. We wanted Canadians to withdraw money from their RRSPs to be able to purchase their first homes and to be able to fund their continued education. Those are things that we all agreed on that would be fundamental for enhancing the benefit of all Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing we wanted to do is make sure we get people out of poverty and into the workplace as much as possible. We want to enhance the working tax credit benefit so that there would be no negative incentive for those who are not in the workplace, who are being subsidized, and who are trying get out of that situation and into the workplace.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886398"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to extend the five year capital cost allowance to manufacturers and processing for machinery and equipment. That one comes mainly because of the second priority when we came back in November. We realized that the climate we came into was not only the strong fiscal footing, but it also had something else that was looming that happened in the last five months prior to the committee actually launching into this study. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the massive, unprecedented increase in the value of the Canadian dollar with respect to American currency. It moved up 16% in five months. It went from 94¢ to $1.10 and that had major impacts with regard to manufacturing, the forestry sector, the agriculture sector, tourism and many others.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886400"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to do a quick study on that as well, so we incorporated that into our recommendations. We spent a week or more debating those issues and looking at what we should do with regard to the Canadian dollar in order to help. I believe we have seen the government react more quickly than I have ever seen before because we came up with $1 billion for the forestry and manufacturing sectors for those communities losing these different factories and plants, particularly in the softwood lumber industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886401"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know all about that, by the way. My Bloc colleagues are saying it is all about Quebec which is being hurt more than anywhere else. In forestry, there is not a community in my riding that is not impacted negatively by the forest industry. The forest industry is going through a massive problem with regard to the slowdown in the United States. The demand is down. The high dollar has impacted it very negatively. In my area the pine beetle has impacted the industry even more significantly than both of those. So it is the ultimate storm. I know all about that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886402"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lost a mill in a small community just recently. It has a major impact in the riding. We understand that full well. It is not just in one area of the country, it is the entire country. That is why the acceleration of the capital cost allowance would be very positive. It is one of the things we need to do. We need to do as much as we possibly can to get us through a short time. Before we get too far down on that thought, there is a quote that I would like to read from the president of the Forest Products Association of Canada. He came before the committee and said:</div>
    </p><a name="Para886403"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td><small>The best thing you can do for communities is to create a business climate where people want to invest in Canada...I want to be very clear, though, and this is something where I think there has been misunderstanding: we don't want subsidies. We don't want you to come in and save a mill that's uneconomic. What we want to do is make this a place where mills are economic.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para886404"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the difference and that is what really we need to do, not pick winners and losers but set up a climate where whatever is being created is going to be a winning factor. I could go on in many other things. There are a couple more and I only have a minute. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886405"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to lay out here other things we agreed on for consideration: one is the Olympics. We believed unitedly as a committee that the Olympics are important not only for the pride of our country but to make sure we deal with issues such as childhood obesity and others, and a $30 million investment to the Olympics for the road to excellence is something we all agreed on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886406"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to make sure that we increased the capital cost allowance for the railways to make sure we are competitive on that footing as well.</div>

It is very important that all members read the report. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886408"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say in closing that we did not want to issue a report saying what we believed. We wanted to issue a report saying what we heard and what we recommended. That is why it reads the way it does.</div>

    </p><a name="Para886410"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one thing seems crucial to me: some sort of improvement. A year ago, when the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology was making recommendations for the manufacturing sector, there was unanimity. Several months passed before anyone would even consider implementing those recommendations. Only one of them was retained: a two-year accelerated capital cost allowance. It became clear, especially in the case of pharmaceutical companies and other sectors that have to seek foreign investments, that a five-year guarantee was needed. We hope the minister will follow our recommendation. In fact, I met with the minister yesterday.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886411"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations we all agreed on concerning the manufacturing and forestry sectors advocate some $1 billion for the forestry sector, $1.5 billion for the manufacturing sector and $1 billion for infrastructure.

I have described the problems. I live with this in my riding on a daily basis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have actually done a number of things. There are many things we are recommending, such as what the president of the Forest Products Association of Canada suggested, which is to build a climate where we will have an industry that will succeed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We signed the softwood lumber agreement. Thank goodness the House agreed with the agreement and we have it in place. The agreement is allowing us an opportunity to do more for the industry than ever before. We now have some stability on that side.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we deal with the rising dollar, the slowdown in the United States and the markets? We must make sure that we seize the opportunity of the high dollar with an accelerated five year capital cost allowance, so that the forest industry can bring in equipment and upgrade itself. It must become more efficient. The more efficient these plants are, the more we will be able to compete. We will then build a climate where they will succeed in the long run for Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of simply giving the industry more money, and without setting the climate so it can succeed, is a foolish way to go. The committee understands this. We heard that from many industries. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886417"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we set that climate in place and that does reflect a number of the recommendations that we have in our report. What my friend is suggesting is further to that some actual funding with which I would disagree.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member can think about that. Before he answers, I would like to make a couple of corrections. The member from the Conservatives talked about his party wanting to lower the tone in committees. I think he should go downstairs and talk to the chair of the procedure and House affairs committee. The committee is now filibustering and making the Conservative Party look silly. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78722,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78722&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre</A> is doing the talking.

    </p><a name="Para886420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member also talked about the lowest unemployment rate which is not true. The Liberal finance critic made that clear when he mentioned all the lost jobs within the last few weeks. We totally agree that it is a great move to have the working poor tax incentive. However, it should be reinstated to the level that it was under the Liberals.</div>

When it comes to dealing with the unemployment rates, we have created 700,000 new jobs in a two year period. That record has been unequalled by any government in the past that I know of and in any time period in history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886423"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also see what is coming which is a looming slowdown in the United States as a country because of what is happening in the housing industry there. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886424"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government brought in $60 billion reduction in taxes in our mini budget last fall. This is leadership which has never been seen before by any government in recent history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not go into the filibustering in committees. I try to be as civil as I possibly can, but there is a tremendous amount of dysfunctionality in our committees. It happens in all the committees. It is appalling because members do not really understand that when they are in committee, they should lower the temperature, especially in a minority government and deal with recommendations that can then be brought forward to this House. </div>

    </p><a name="Para886427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the questions asked of me and many parliamentarians is: How much tax relief has the government provided since taking office? I can advise the House that the government believes that Canadians pay too much tax. One of the principal reasons I became involved in the political movement is because I think Canadians are overtaxed, which is why, since coming to office, we have taken action that provides over $41 billion in tax relief to Canadians in over just three years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, the government is committed to providing additional tax relief for Canadians, for individuals to improve the rewards from their working, saving and investing. This commitment is supported by the tax back guarantee. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we heard complaints that we are spending far too much time worrying about the debt. Since taking office, we have reduced our mortgage on each Canadian by over $1,500. That is a significant amount of money in a very short period of time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886430"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tax back guarantee ensures that every time the debt is paid down, Canadians will realize that paying down of the debt by tax savings. That is the interest that Canadians pay, not the government. The government does not have any money. The only money the government has is the money it takes out of the pockets of Canadians, both corporate and personal. We intend to give that back as a direct result of paying down our mortgage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fair to ask what we are doing to ensure that Canada's corporate tax system is competitive with other countries. We recently heard the bantering from the fourth party in the House that by having the lowest corporate tax we somehow are giving favours to people. We are giving favours. We are giving favours to the men and women who will have the jobs that corporate Canada creates. Governments do not create jobs. People and companies create jobs. Small and medium sized businesses create jobs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886432"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are building a tax environment that is internationally competitive and neutral with respect to business investment decisions. We want to encourage companies in the rest of the world to move their corporate headquarters and plants to Canada and create employment here because we will have a competitive tax base, not only for the companies but for the people who work for them. We believe this is crucial for creating the right conditions for business to grow and, more important, prosper.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is committed to an economic plan and it is called Advantage Canada. It will make Canada's overall tax rate on new business investment the lowest, as I previously stated, in the G-7.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886434"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2006, this government has taken a number of actions to enhance business tax competitiveness, including: eliminating the federal capital tax in January 2006; eliminating the corporate surtax for all corporations this year; reducing the corporate statutory income tax rate to 18.5% by 2011 from the 21% in 2007; and providing temporary tax assistance for Canada's manufacturing section.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886435"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are ahead of the curve. We just heard south of the border that its economy is in significant challenge. The President of the United States just announced reductions in tax so that he can stimulate consumer spending. We did that six weeks earlier. We are ahead of the curve. Maybe the people in the United States should call George Bush the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> of their country, which would be a good idea because we are ahead of the curve. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also aligning our capital cost allowance rates with useful life for manufacturing buildings and other assets. As a result of the government's actions and recent provincial initiatives, Canada's overall tax rate on new business investment will fall by 2011 to the second lowest in the G-7 from the third highest. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886437"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an Ontarian, I respectfully suggest to the Premier and Government of Ontario, the province in which I live, to look at what we have done with regard to our corporate tax rate and I encourage Ontario to reduce its current corporate tax rate. I know the province made some progress and I encourage Mr. McGuinty and his government to continue to reduce taxes for corporations and to match the federal government's move in that area. That would go a long way toward ensuring that in Northumberland—Quinte West, and indeed in all of Ontario, we will be as competitive as any of our neighbours to the south.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the key points in budget 2007 proposed significant benefits for low income Canadians, those who need tax reductions the most. That includes the $550 million annually through the working income tax benefit to make work more rewarding for 1.2 million low income individuals and families. This tax plan will remove 230,000 low income taxpayers from the tax rolls. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886439"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We introduced the new registered disability savings plan to improve the financial security and well-being of children with severe disabilities. I met with several constituents in my riding who are worried. They are getting older and they have children and young adults, and getting older adults, suffering from diseases, such as Down's syndrome, and they are worried about what will happen to their children when they are gone. They were most pleased with the 2007 budget when we introduced the registered disability savings plan that would help look after their children when they are no longer here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constituents are also very pleased with the tax measures that build on the tax relief from budget 2006 which removed 655,000 low income Canadians from the federal tax rolls. We also build on support already provided for low income Canadians by the federal government. Those include: $3.7 billion in support for low and modest income Canadians through the goods and services tax credit; $11.7 billion for families with children, including the universal child care benefit, the Canada child tax benefit and the national child benefit of which more than 40% goes to families with less than a $20,000 income; more than $7.4 billion for Canada's low income seniors through the guaranteed income supplement; $1.4 billion to provide basic social development programs for first nations in the areas of federal responsibility; and $3.3 billion to support youth housing and programs for legal aid, immigration and refugee settlement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886441"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk about the reduction of the GST and how it relates to people who do not pay any federal income tax and do not pay any income tax whatsoever. That is the one area that a government can influence the amount of tax Canadians pay.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886442"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the House some time ago, in a debate discussing certain benefits, a member across the way made a remark when I mentioned that when people go to the grocery store they pay GST. He said that we do not pay GST on groceries. I made a challenge when I was on an open line radio show and asked folks, when they came out of the grocery store with their groceries, to look near the bottom of their receipt where it shows the amount paid. I told them that they would see that both GST and PST had been paid. I advised them to look at the difference in savings, the 2% that we would be saving people, and figure out how much that will save them in a year. In itself it may not be a huge amount but in addition to the other tax reductions that we have made for low and medium income families, especially for seniors, I think that adds to the significance of lowering taxes because every cent of tax we do not collect goes into our economy and helps create jobs.</div>

    </p><a name="Para886444"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing I am not sure made it on the list. Right now when people buy a new home, the first section of it does not attract GST but after $350,000 the GST starts to be attracted and then after a certain level it is full GST. Since that has not changed due to inflation in 12 or 13 years, I recommended that we move that amount up. The cost of housing for young families and families moving into their second homes has increased considerably and the thresholds to help people get into their homes need to change. Let us face it. Those GST costs get passed directly to the consumer. The builders do not pay them in the end.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for my colleague is this. Do you think that moving the thresholds, when the GST is attracted to new housing, would be of assistance to the residents in your riding?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will tell members why this government supports education. It is more than just words. There has been a 40% increase in the federal budget toward post-secondary education, one of the largest, if not the largest, increase in post-secondary education in the history of this great dominion. More than that, the government believes it is necessary as we move toward a more knowledge based economy.</div>

    </p><a name="Para886460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I used to sit on the finance committee, I enjoyed travelling the country and going into different communities with my colleagues from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78463,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78463&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Scarborough—Guildwood</A> and <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78387,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78387&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Markham—Unionville</A> and other distinguished members of our party. We would listen to Canadians, hear what they had to say and had an opportunity to put that into a report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the chance last year, although I am not a member of the committee, to sit in on one session held in Halifax, in December, in my home community of Dartmouth—Halifax. I found that very useful too. It is important to hear from Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember being on the finance committee the day after the government announced the cuts back in the fall of 2006. At that point in time, pre-scheduled to meet with us that very day was the Canadian Museums Association. The guy had a presentation to give but he decided not to give it because it was irrelevant. He said that the association had been cut to bone and that it did not make sense. He asked why the government had done that. In our consultations that followed, we heard more and more from people who had their programs cut. Those cuts tell us a lot about the government and its ideological approach.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to focus my comments on areas for which I now have critic responsibility, which is the human resources area. Some of those cuts included, incredibly, literacy. I believe $17.7 million was cut from literacy programs. That is hard to believe. Literacy Nova Scotia puts programs together on bubble gum and toothpicks. It hardly has any money. What little money it had was cut out from underneath.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I received letters from Learners of Nova Scotia. One learner in the riding of Kings—Hants sent me his story. He never had a chance until he hooked in with a literacy group and now his program was in danger of shutting down. Literacy Nova Scotia had no money and could not continue after the cuts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met with the department and the minister at the time. I asked them what they were doing. They told me not to worry about it. Although they had taken $17 million away, they said that they had tens of millions of dollars that would go into literacy. I asked them where it would go and I was told they would let me know.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then asked the literacy groups if they were receiving any money and they told me no. I asked the department where the money had gone. I was told it had gone to two groups, but the rest of the money would be coming. An awful lot of things are coming, and not particularly fast.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently we put a question on the order paper. We asked what the funding was for literacy last year. This is the response we received from the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development. It said, “These amounts of funding were provided to national, provincial and local organizations for literacy in the years as follows: 2005-2006, $33,359,000; 2006-2007, $16,800,000”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is half of what had been given the year before. Where is the money for the literacy groups? It is gone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, $6.5 million was cut from the Canadian volunteerism initiative, the CVI. Its total budget was $7.5 million of which $6.5 million came from the federal government. It chopped it all. The group puts together the infrastructure for volunteering. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not one member in the House of Commons who did not get here because of volunteers. Most of us, on all sides of the House, have been volunteers in many capacities, whether helping the Heart and Stroke Foundation, or the Canadian Cancer Society or maybe simply providing care to loved ones at the end of their lives, or a child who has autism, or a child who has special needs, or an aunt or an uncle who needs help.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we take the volunteerism out of Canada, we collapse. If we take away the support of voluntary caregivers, for example, and let the system provide the nursing care and the respite care, the full care, the system will be bankrupt virtually overnight. There is not an area in Canadian society where we cannot look to and say that it relies on volunteers. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was president in Nova Scotia of the Heart and Stroke Foundation. I believe we had 16 paid staff, but thousands of unpaid staff who went knocking on doors on cold February days. Some are out there now, knocking on doors to raise money for the Heart and Stroke Foundation. Six and half million measly dollars was cut by the government. It is shameful. It is unacceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recently had an opportunity in my riding. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78686,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78686&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">York Centre</A> was touring Canada. He calls it, “It takes the country to fight poverty”. He came to my riding. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78801,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78801&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Halifax West</A> and I co-hosted a meeting in a church basement, expecting some people to come out to talk about poverty. Three hundred people turned out to talk about poverty and to talk about our leader, the leader of the Liberal Party, who came out with his 30:50 plan to tackle poverty, to reduce the number of Canadians living below the poverty line by at least 30% and cut in half the number of children living in poverty over five years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poverty is not a vote getter. People who really live in poverty need help the most. The Metro Turning Point Shelter In my community has 60 beds that are full every night. Men come in between 7 o'clock and 11 o'clock in the evening. They sleep in one room in beds that were surplus from a prison, I believe. Eighty per cent of them either have mental health or addiction issues. Imagine what it is like to sleep in that room.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning they get up at 7 o'clock and go to Hope Cottage, which is a multi-denominational church that sponsors a food bank. They go there for their food and they spend their days in the street.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the younger ones may be involved with Phoenix Youth Programs, which deals with troubled young citizens who have issues with mental health and many of them with addictions. The coalition on homelessness does what it can to support the people who do this, the Canadian Mental Association. However, one thing about those folks is they do not generally vote because they spend their time trying to live.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of a national party, who has the opportunity to form a government, has said that he will draw a line in the sand and cut poverty by 30% and child poverty by 50% over five years. People have talked about poverty for many years. Some things that have come along, like the child tax benefit, have made a difference. For a leader to stand up and say that he will stake his government on hitting these goals is pretty inspiring for these people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked to a couple of people. One came to me afterwards and said that he had worked against me the first time I ran. He worked with the NDP. However, he now is working for the Liberal Party because the NDP are not doing this kind of thing in our community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody else asked to speak to the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78686,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78686&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">York Centre</A> after the meeting. The person never believed the Liberals could take a big bite out of poverty, that we could have a national early learning and child care plan either, but the Liberal party gave it to the people and because of that, the person was with us. That is pretty powerful stuff. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Liberal Party has come out with a plan which would, among other things, create the making work pay benefit to lower the welfare wall and improving the Canada child tax benefit to support working families by making the non-refundable child tax credit into a refundable credit, so even those who do not pay tax get it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often hear that the GST is great for people who are poor. The guys staying at Metro Turning Point do not go out to by an Escalade in the afternoon. They are not taking advantage of it. A lot of people simply cannot.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of our plan is to help lift vulnerable seniors out of poverty by increasing the GIS, to honour the Kelowna accord, a plan for aboriginal Canadians, and a number of other things too such as fighting for access to things like affordable housing, child care, public transit. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My recommendation for the government would be to look at some of these things and see if it could not, for once, do something for the people who need help the most.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about education. I know I talk about it a lot, but it is an important message. Canada is a nation that is highly educated, and we have done pretty well. We have done well in some ways more by accident than design. We are a big nation, huge in natural resources with a relatively small population, largely spread in central centres. We do not have the kinds of tornados that swept through the United States yesterday. We do not have the kinds of natural disasters we see across many continents. We have not had world wars fought on our soil. We have had things pretty good. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255">(1255)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para886485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now face new challenges in the world. We face the emerging economies of China, India and Brazil. They are not our enemies, but they will be competitors for human capital over the next number of years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also see huge investments being made by OECD nations, which know they have to increase their skill level. They know they have to increase every citizen's ability not only for their own sake, but so they can contribute to their national economies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the last acts of the previous Liberal government in 2005 was to bring an economic update into the House. We wanted to focus on helping students. We wanted to help all students because we felt it was important, but particularly important was to help those most in need. That update included $550 million over five years to extend Canada access grants to 55,000 students from low income families. The grants would have been extended to all four years of an undergrad education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The update also included $2.2 billion over five years to improve student financial assistance and make post-secondary education more accessible for low and middle income Canadians. There was money for internships and MBA scholarships. Money for workplace training to enhance participation by aboriginal Canadians was also included. There was money to specifically assist persons with disabilities to get post-secondary education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Canadians, and they may be in their early twenties, have come to me because they are faced with a particular challenge. I am sure other members of Parliament see them as well. Many of these young kids graduated from grade 12 feeling like they belonged. However, other kids, who were part of their graduating class, were heading off to university or community college or getting a job. Those the kids are left at home because there is a black hole once they leave high school.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kids who come to see me do not look for much. They are looking for some workplace training. They are looking for an opportunity to get a job to do what they can do to provide for themselves and society. Our Liberal government put $165 million in the update to help those kids have a better chance at an equitable life. When the government was defeated and the Conservatives came in, that all went out the window. It is a crying shame because we are not doing all we can to assist children to get the education they need.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another program was the summer jobs program, which we remember from last year. The Conservative government knew it worked, but it had to put its own stamp on it. The government changed the program from the summer career placement program to the summer jobs program. It reduced the amount of money and changed the criteria. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizations across this nation, almost all of them not for profit, relied on the summer jobs program. Students thought this was crazy. There was a big fuss by a lot of members of Parliament on this side of the House. I remember one day last year, eight different Liberal members stood up in question period and asked a question about that summer jobs program. It clearly was broken, but the Conservative government said that things were fine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked if the government was going to put more money into fixing the hole. The answer was no, things were just great. In the fall, the government slipped $45 million into the supplementary estimates to cover its tracks. I will give the present minister credit for going back to the old Liberal program. We will have to see how it unfolds over the next few months. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That clearly showed the government did not respect students or community organizations, made up of volunteers who help us run the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886495"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some good ideas out there. I do not have to give all the answers, but let me talk about a few recommendations on the post-secondary side.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886496"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78942,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78942&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Yukon</A> was 100% correct about the millennium scholarship foundation. I was pleased to hear the previous Conservative speaker say that he supported it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886497"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The millennium scholarship foundation was set up in the late 1990s by the Liberal government, and it has been a success. There were some problems early on with respect to it. There were some clawbacks in some of the provinces. There were some issues with getting it organized. It now works very well. Every province and every territory work with the millennium scholarship foundation and want it renewed. The foundation provides about $350 million every year of almost exclusively needs based funding for students. That needs to be replenished. We cannot afford to lose $350 million of funding for students.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300">(1300)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para886498"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost everyone wants to see the millennium scholarship replenished, or some of those people who I think have an ideological aversion to the millennium scholarship want to replace it with a needs based granting system. We definitely need to do something. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886499"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada student loans program needs to be redone and looked at in a whole new way. We need to open it up to more people. We need to expand its scope. We need to reduce the cost of borrowing so that it makes more sense for students. We need to reduce bankruptcy provisions for students along with it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are my views. I encourage the government to have a look at that. We studied some of this when I was on the finance committee. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julian Benedict, who heads up the Coalition for Student Loan Fairness, has put together a lot of work on this. This is not new. This is not something the government has to study to death. The solutions exist.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invest in research and innovation. Build on the great progress of the Liberal government in the late 1990s and early in this century, when the economy was finally on track after that $41 billion annual deficit was turned into a surplus. We started to invest in research and innovation. I would admit that like poverty, it is not a big vote getter, but it may well be the single most important achievement of Canada in the last 10 years in becoming competitive.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago we used to hear about the brain drain. In the <i>Globe and Mail</i> we would read about losing researchers to the United States and other parts of the world. It does not happen now. We are repatriating researchers to Canada because of those investments in CFI, CIHR, the granting councils and a whole host of research oriented areas. We are starting to lose that. And what did the government do? It fired Dr. Art Carty, one of the pre-eminent scientists in this country, who was leading the charge on a lot of this and had great respect in the research community. It is pretty scandalous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we not invest in research? Taking the indirect costs of research was something else from the economic update and we increased it to 40%. The Conservative government turned that over. Invest in the CIHR. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research came to the finance committee, 13 institutes that do unbelievable work. I know about the CIHR not because I am a doctor or because I am particularly scientifically gifted, but because I was involved in the national board of the Heart and Stroke Foundation when the CIHR came along. It changed research in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizations like the Heart and Stroke Foundation redid their governance. I know because I was part of it. I have the scars from that. We redid our governance so that we could pool money to take advantage of the CIHR which now in my view is being marginalized. We are losing another great researcher; Alan Bernstein has left his head position at the CIHR to go to New York. We need to do all of these things. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should talk about the Atlantic accord. I am sure my colleague from Gander—Grand Falls will tell us. We stood in the House about a year ago when the budget was being read and realized the Conservatives were killing the Atlantic accord, the most important piece of economic development for the province of Nova Scotia and for Newfoundland and Labrador. The right hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A> signed that deal in 2004 guaranteeing Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia exclusive access to their offshore resources and all of a sudden it was being killed. What could be done?</div>
    </p><a name="Para886507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know what happened. First the then <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',111558,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=111558&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">minister of foreign affairs who is now the minister of defence</A> said, “Nobody is going to be kicked out of our caucus for voting on principle”. That was before he realized there was no one over there who had principles. Then they changed their minds. All Canadians want the Atlantic accord back.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of things the government could do to improve on the budget it is proposing to bring forward. We know that Tory times are hard times and we see coming down the pike the possibility of a recession. What is troubling is that the misery being inflicted on the poor people in Canada because of a right-wing ideology appears set to continue. Ask women's groups, minority groups which lost the court challenges program, literacy groups, hard-working public servants who are losing their jobs because they were doing their jobs. Ask students what they are going to do with an $80 tax credit, working families who find it tough to get child care. Tory times are tough times and we deserve better.</div>

He concluded by ranting against right-wing ideology, intimating that somehow Canadians do not sympathize with this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to relate to the member the reaction I receive in my constituency to some of the things the government has done. There are some very popular measures. One of those is the pension income splitting and another is the $1,200 per child assistance to families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come from a riding that has the dubious distinction of having the highest proportion of seniors in Canada. One of the things that is very important to them is something else that we have been doing that enables the government to reduce taxes and give back to parents some of the money that it has taken from them. Tax reduction is something that we have absolutely emphasized is important to all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the member rants against those who have a right-wing ideology, I challenge him to go out and talk to the people of Canada about the specific measures that this government has implemented and what they mean to them. I think he will find out and he will agree that they actually support what we are doing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key things that I want to ask the member's opinion on is whether he agrees with our emphasis on paying down the debt. To me this is one of the more important things that we have done as Conservatives. That is something that helps everyone. If we do not pay down our debt, we will continue to have huge interest payments which do not allow us to have the tax reductions that we should have.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax reduction can happen when government spends less. When we have a huge debt hanging over our shoulders, we cannot put in place that tax reduction. Does he agree that paying down the debt should be a priority for us as a government?</div>

    </p><a name="Para886524"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear a lot from the party opposite that we have to be disciplined and take the long view. As a matter of fact, the hon. member who got up a few minutes ago said that if we do not pay down the debt at an accelerated pace, we will be hurting future generations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is a question of balance. We pay down the debt, but we do not slash and burn in the short term simply for ideological reasons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886526"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party opposite always talks about taking the long view. However, when we look at their policies they are all short term policies that are targeted for short term political purposes and goals. We still do not have a science and technology policy. This is something that we need to build in Canada for the long term.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have a national water policy which is something that we need to protect our economic growth in the long term.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literacy is very important, especially in a high tech economy. Literacy is very important for long term prosperity. The government slashed literacy. Then we also saw the largest spending budget in Canadian history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the long term view in the government's approach? Does the government care about the economy, or does it only care about politics?</div>

I must agree with my colleague on those things.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the funniest things I saw recently was the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> speaking to his caucus before the House came back saying, “If things are going to get tough, do you want to trust the Liberals?” Mr. Speaker, I know you are impartial and cannot laugh when you hear that, but the millions of Canadians who are watching us now are saying, “Wait a second, the Conservatives left us a $41 billion annual deficit and a $500 billion debt. The Liberals fixed it up, invested in the priorities of Canadians and gave the Conservatives a $13 billion annual surplus. The Conservatives are the ones who cannot run an economy to save their lives. They give money away but not to the people who need it”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886532"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a group of people over there who love power but hate government. Government can be a source of good things. We can reduce taxes. We can pay off debt. We can provide better services to Canadians. The Liberals can do it; the Conservatives cannot.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax reduction is good, but there are other ways to help people than reducing taxes. Direct subsidies to people who need help could be increased.

    </p><a name="Para886546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today it is my great honour to speak about what our government is doing regarding the budget consultations. Right now in Canada we are among the strongest G-7 economies and the only G-7 member with both an ongoing budget surplus and a falling debt burden. That is remarkable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is also an emerging energy superpower. We are among the world leaders in clean hydroelectric power and natural gas production. We have one of the strongest and largest global oil reserves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we are also taking aggressive action to manage economic uncertainty. We are making broad long term tax reductions which impact on the Canadian public throughout our nation. We are reducing record amounts of debt, and we are spending responsibly and efficiently.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada cannot be immune from uncertainty in the U.S. nor immune from the global economy as a whole. Canada is working from a position of strength. Our economic fundamentals are solid.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are experiencing the second longest period of economic expansion in our history. Inflation is remaining low and stable. We have the best job market in a generation. Our unemployment rate is the lowest in 33 years. Canada is one of the few countries with a financially sustainable public pension system and that benefits many of our residents and our seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have seen job gains in other well paying sectors, manufacturing job losses are a real concern to our government. That is why we have introduced a billion dollar community development trust to help workers and communities facing major downturns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we have put $8 billion in tax relief for manufacturers to help create the right economic climate for job creation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that paying down our national debt is important for Canadians. It is important for our economy. It is also important for the future generations of Canadians who should not be burdened with the debt we have accumulated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than two years, our government has reduced the federal debt by nearly $37 billion including $10 billion in this fiscal year and at least $3 billion each year after that. This means the federal debt burden on every Canadian man, woman and child is lowered by about $1,570 or about $1.5 billion a month. That brings the balance of our federal debt to $467.3 billion from its peak of $562.9 billion in 1996-97. That is a reduction of over $95 billion. That is remarkable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006-07 the government spent 14.4¢ of every revenue dollar on interest on the public debt, down from the peak of 37.6¢ in 1990-91. We intend to continue along this track. At this rate the federal debt will fall below 25% of our GDP by 2011-12, three years ahead of the original target date, marking the lowest debt burden since the early 1980s.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important to our small businesses. Yesterday I met with the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses which is very supportive of the tax cuts that the government has made. The Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses has over 100,000 members throughout our nation. In one of its surveys of its members it asked this question: In what proportion should future federal surpluses be applied? The responses were as follows: 48% said pay down the federal debt; 36% said reduce taxes; and 16% said increase program spending. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see, small businesses across our nation feel that the main priority is to pay down our debt and reduce taxes. That is what we have done and that is what we will continue to do in order to support all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the $60 billion of cuts announced in our fall economic statement, including another one percentage point reduction in the GST, the total actions taken by the government to date are approaching $200 billion in tax cuts over this year and the next five years.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320">(1320)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para886559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to 75% of the tax relief offered by the government benefits individual Canadians and their families. That is how it impacts on our population today: a reduction in the lowest personal rate, from 15.5% to 15%; an increase in the basic personal amount, to $9,600 for 2008 and to $10,100 for 2009; a working income tax benefit was put in place to help low-income Canadians over the welfare wall; a registered disability savings plan was put in place to assist parents of persons with disabilities with the tools to provide financial security for their loved ones when they can no longer care for them; and also a child tax credit providing up to $300 of tax relief for each child under 18 years of age.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time ever, we are providing pension income splitting for all seniors and pensioners. We also eliminated the capital gains taxation on gifts of listed securities to private foundations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By reducing the GST by another percentage point, our government has fulfilled a key campaign commitment and kept its word to Canadians, to our voters. Reducing the GST from 6% to 5% builds on the initial GST cut introduced in budget 2006. For consumers, the total savings from the two percentage point reduction will amount to approximately $12 billion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses, members were asked to rate the priority of reduction of taxes by the federal government. Here, 39.1% placed a high priority on reducing the GST and 39.9% placed a medium priority on reducing the GST. So we can see, overall, it was a very high priority for the sample. We are listening to small business. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Canadians are already benefiting from one new tax cut, thanks to the Conservative government's second GST cut in as many years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the weeks ahead, Canadian families can look forward to even more tax relief as the Conservative government's retroactive income tax reductions also take effect. Our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> has cut income taxes retroactively. As a result, Canadians families will have a smaller tax bill for the 2007 year. I know all of us are looking forward to that. Effective January 1, 2007, the lowest personal income tax rate will be reduced to 15% from 15.5%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the amount that all Canadians can earn without paying federal income tax will be increased to $9,600 for 2007 and 2008, and to $10,100 for 2009, as I said before.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, these two measures will reduce personal income taxes for 2007 by almost $225 for a single worker earning $40,000. A two-income family that earns $80,000 will save more than $400 on their 2007 tax bill. That is significant.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the leadership of our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, Canadian families will have more money refunded for last year, more money this year, and more money for the years to come. That is money into the pockets of everyday Canadians, where it counts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886568"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para886569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something that I am personally very excited about is the taxpayer bill of rights that our government introduced last year. It was very pleasing to stand with the minister and be there when she announced this taxpayer bill of rights. This is a historical document that will benefit all Canadians, including those in my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78541,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78541&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Kildonan—St. Paul</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that our tax collection system can be more accountable and more user friendly for the public. The public need not be fearful of dealing with the Canada Revenue Agency to meet its tax obligations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 15 points. I know I am running out of time and cannot go over all 15 points. However, the taxpayer bill of rights was a groundbreaking initiative that our government put forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, these significant steps will help Canada remain well positioned to face any volatile environment. The opposition consistently criticized and opposed these vital measures, offering nothing as an alternative but costly band-aid solutions with no long term vision, threatening to return Canada to a deficit. Approaching budget 2008, we will continue to act in a stable and responsible manner.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the six women I talked to all have families. Some of them are living in one bedroom apartments, five or six people living together as a family. They are paying 90% of their income on rent. This government has done absolutely nothing for them. They cannot eat the taxpayer bill of rights. It will not pay the rent and what is abhorrent is that most of the people I was talking to were actually newcomers. Two of them were from Afghanistan.

It is unfortunate, though, that I have to follow the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78541,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78541&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Kildonan—St. Paul</A>, because she has so completely captured our government's position that it is difficult to add to what she said. If I were a lawyer, I would say the case is closed, but thankfully I am not a lawyer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I will try to expand a bit on what she has said and focus some of my statements on the tax cuts of which she spoke. Now more than ever, I think, we are realizing that with the softness in markets south of the border and abroad, it is essential that we as a government prepare our country to be able to withstand any changes south of the border, to continue the substantive economic growth we have seen, and to maintain the incredible growth in jobs over the last number of years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, we have a <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and a <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> who have been able to see this for some time and who have had the vision to bring in some of the most historic tax cuts in our nation's history. There have been some 60 tax cuts since our government took office 21 months ago. As I think back to January 23, 2006, it has been only two years, but the amount that has been accomplished is really quite incredible, especially in relation to the previous government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is as if we came to office understanding the situation the country was in and realizing that it was time to give back to all the hard-working, taxpaying Canadians and the businesses that have built our country and maintained such an incredible economy. That is exactly what we have done. We have given tax relief in the realm of $190 billion, not only this year but over the next five years. As well, in the previous economic statement in October, we added an additional $60 billion in broad tax cuts, including a further reduction in the GST.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often hear the opposition complain about the GST cut. In the past, we have heard that complaint many times from the Liberals. In fact, in 1993 the Liberals won an election based on the promise of getting rid of the GST, but of course that got tossed the day after the election. They actually utilized the revenue from the GST for a number of years. There is no question about it: they had no intention of ever keeping that promise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a government, we felt it was the right time to bring that tax down. We committed in the last election campaign to reduce it from 7% to 6% to 5%. We promised to do that in five years, but as everyone knows, as Conservatives we like to take the initiative and get the job done, so we actually achieved that promise in less than five years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, it took us under two years in office to accomplish that reduction. The opposition parties, and specifically the Liberals, have complained quite loudly about this reduction, but when we think about the GST reduction and the timing that is now in effect, we are seeing it come in at a moment in Canada when it is actually needed quite considerably with our dollar where it is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our dollar, being affected by international markets and the strength of the Canadian economy, has risen quite dramatically, to the point where it actually broke the $1 mark in U.S. dollars. That was somewhat unexpected and has really put some pressure on Canadian consumer prices. There has been a lot of interest by consumers in reductions in the prices that they see relative to other markets. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, bringing in the GST cuts is one thing the government can do to assist our business community and our retailers in dealing with what many see as a challenging situation with our dollar. Thankfully, the dollar has moved back from its high mark of $1.10, and we hope we will be able to continue to work our way through this time of parity. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335">(1335)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para886594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GST cut has definitely helped the auto sector, which has had considerable pressure placed upon it over a number of years, in that it has seen both growth and decline. A GST reduction such as the one we have put into place has really aided the auto sector in being able to offer prices at a much reduced rate. I know that members opposite complain about and scoff at a $600 saving on a vehicle, but $600 is a lot of money where I come from. Maybe at their country clubs they can light their cigars with those six $100 bills, but back where I am from, that is a lot of money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the purchasing power of consumers is going up. That is an important thing to remember, because Canadians want to take more of that pay home and they deserve to take more of that pay home. I am someone who believes in having more money in the taxpayer's pocket and not in funding every government program that the Liberals, NDP and Bloc want brought in.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a time for government intervention and there is a time when government needs to back down. When the fiscal capacity of government is removed by returning it to the people, where it actually rightfully belongs, it becomes a more conservative environment so that government is able to look at all of its spending programs under a conservative lens. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, that is what this <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> has been able to accomplish with the changes he has brought in, and we actually are seeing considerable benefit in our economy. Out in Manitoba, where I am from, we are seeing a fantastic situation because of the fact that we have seen a real retooling of the fiscal imbalance in our country. It was something that our party campaigned on. We campaigned on changing our equalization program to better suit Canada and, in reality, to bring it back to its original form. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the previous Liberal government dealt with it in a way that became very political. It was utilizing federal fiscal capacity to begin intervening in the territory and the jurisdiction of the provinces. Perhaps the Liberals felt that it was a successful political methodology to utilize, and maybe they were right in some situations, but in terms of actually keeping the federal government in the jurisdiction in which it belongs, it was the wrong choice. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we can look at provinces such as Manitoba, which under this new formula is receiving $1 billion more than it did. That is allowing the province to actually start working in the areas that are in its jurisdiction, such as post-secondary education, health and child care. These are the areas that Manitoba can now focus on, instead of having the federal government trying to come up with some half-baked scheme, such as we saw under the former administration, with plans that could not possibly work and could not possibly be funded but were built only as an electoral scheme to draw votes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we are seeing this country emerge as an energy superpower that is second only to Saudi Arabia. Canada has been able to utilize its natural resources, including its petroleum supplies, thus allowing our country to continue our stellar economic growth pattern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that we cannot continue with our other economic and energy strategies. Too often, we forget that Manitoba is one of the largest exporters of green energy. Manitoba's hydroelectric capacity is practically the largest in North America. It is something that is under-reported, so I have to incorporate it into my speech now, if members will indulge me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken about the debt reduction, which is at about $10 billion over this year alone and at $27 billion since we came into office. That is the equivalent of $1,570 for each man, woman and child. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340">(1340)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para886603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is going to be a legacy for our children and for the individuals who will come after us so that they will have the capacity to be able to continue building this country in the future and to continue to make it the greatest place on earth to live. I know that as I look back on the time that I have spent in the House of Commons I will realize that with the leadership that we have had from the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> we have done exactly that.

    </p><a name="Para886608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very fortunate to be part of an earlier announcement in the spring. A young first nation lady by the name of Alisha Bigelow was the first recipient of a program in Manitoba that assists first nations people in being able to come up with the down payment. We have seen among first nations peoples that it has been challenging to buy that first home. The most challenging part has been coming up with the down payment.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was really exciting for me to be a part of this announcement that there is now government assistance for first nations people in buying a home and getting a mortgage.

However, the government will have to invest heavily in Quebec's priorities in the upcoming budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We announced certain conditions pertaining to certain key sectors. It is important that the budget respond to calls from Quebeckers and the Bloc Québécois by providing $1 billion in aid for the forestry industry and not aid shared by the forestry and manufacturing industries. The budget must provide $1.5 billion to help manufacturers purchase more productive and efficient equipment, which will boost productivity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important area is transfers to municipalities. Municipalities have an urgent need for assistance to renovate municipal infrastructure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creation of an independent employment insurance fund is another priority. The Bloc Québécois has been suggesting this for quite some time. Successive governments have paid down Canada's debt out of funds generated by workers, whose contributions make up the bulk of the fund. When the government takes this money, which belongs to workers, and uses it to pay down the debt, these workers are entitled to expect much better and much more respect from their government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government also needs to set up an income support program for older workers. The Conservative Party made this promise during the last election campaign. To date, there has been no indication that the Conservatives intend to keep their promise. Yet they made a very firm commitment. Once again, workers and seniors are being shortchanged by the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the issue of funding for social housing. Each year, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation generates a surplus of several billion dollars. It is important for the government to come up with a strategy for reinvesting in social housing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk a bit more about the sectors I mentioned. With respect to help for the manufacturing sector, the Bloc Québécois, through its participation in the Standing Committee on Finance, generally approves of the direction that the committee proposed. Several measures proposed by the Bloc Québécois were accepted by the committee, but others were rejected, even though some of them were essential. Among those accepted by the Standing Committee on Finance, which means that they were accepted by Liberal, Conservative, New Democrat and Bloc members, are some important measures worth highlighting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc believes that the government should not stall in following up on some of the proposed measures because even Conservative members of the committee agreed to them. The committee recommended that the government allocate $1 billion to the forestry sector. I think the government should act on this measure. One billion dollars for the forestry sector alone. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I said that the trust that was announced and voted on this week was for $1 billion to be divided between the manufacturing and forestry sectors. It is important to point out that difference. There are a lot of similarities between the two sectors.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350">(1350)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para886625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec's forestry sector is in such a state of crisis that it requires special consideration. The Standing Committee on Finance agreed to that and recommended it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee also recommended that $1.5 billion be redistributed to manufacturing industries through tax refunds and tax credits so that these industries can buy new equipment and become more productive. If we want these companies to compete in the global market, we have to help them prepare for it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All members of the Standing Committee on Finance agreed to that measure, and they also suggested that the federal excise tax transfer be raised to 5¢ to help municipalities become more competitive. The committee also recommended that this measure come into force not in 2010, but right now. This is an important element that the Standing Committee on Finance approved of and recommended to the government in its prebudget report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the employment insurance fund surplus, the Bloc Québécois finds it unfortunate that an independent fund cannot be created to help cushion the blow for workers who lose their jobs temporarily or, sometimes, indefinitely. That money should go back to the workers who paid into the fund before it goes anywhere else.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important element has to do with the dignity of seniors. Earlier I mentioned the Conservatives' promise during the last election campaign to make the guaranteed income supplement for seniors fully retroactive. The government did not get it done. It did not agree and it broke its promise to seniors. The Bloc Québécois is very disappointed that the Standing Committee on Finance did not agree with this measure. This is a real shame for seniors; we owe them a lot. These people often live below the poverty line. The government and society are indebted to them, and we should respect that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiscal imbalance is also important. It really must be settled. We called for $3.5 billion for post-secondary education funding, because it has been cut in recent years. It is vital that we get the funding we used to get if Quebec is to move forward and to properly educate all the students under its jurisdiction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of social housing and the status of women, the Standing Committee on Finance, once again on the Bloc's initiative, agreed to have the government use some surpluses from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to invest in social housing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By acting on this very interesting report we can give back to a number of people, including aboriginals, so that they can once again live with much more dignity. The CMHC must dip into its surplus to provide money for social housing and to create an improved program, so there is more adequate social housing throughout Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, in its supplementary report, the Bloc Québécois was also severely critical of the ideological cuts made in recent years to status of women programs and to the court challenges program. The Bloc recommended that these measures be reinstated, but the committee did not agree. It is a terrible shame, and that is why we included this recommendation in our supplementary report. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude with the issue of funding for culture, where there is a huge lack of money. Over the past two years, we have not felt that the government was committed towards developing culture.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last May, students from my riding had the opportunity to participate in an exchange to Ontario through SEVEC, an organization supported by the Department of Canadian Heritage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886638"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para886642"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in his career, he was stationed in Manitoba. In 1986, Reg and his partner, Constable Thomas, were at a gas station to assist an individual when that person fired on them killing Constable Thomas and striking Constable Gulliford with three bullets. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Reg was never the type of person to give up. He survived. He underwent 29 operations and by September 1987 he was back on his feet. Incredibly, he returned to work with the RCMP in St. John's the following January.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886644"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, at the age of 46, Sergeant Reg Gulliford passed away after battling with cancer. As always, Reg faced this terrible disease with strength of character and always a positive approach. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886645"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I spoke to Reg's mother, Bernice , who lives in Buchans. She was very proud of her son and misses him very much. He was a great son and, like his colleagues, he was a proud member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and truly a great Canadian hero.</div>

First of all, we should remember that the Bloc Québécois had set six conditions for its support of the 2008 budget: an assistance plan to help workers and businesses affected by the forestry and manufacturing crisis, measures to restore dignity to seniors, the return of the education and social programs transfer to 1994-95 indexed levels, increased funding for social housing and a reversal of the Conservative government's ideological cuts, increased funding for culture, and a 180-degree turn on the environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will not be surprised to hear me talk about assistance for the manufacturing sector in this House. I am the industry critic and therefore take considerable interest in this matter. The manufacturing and forestry industries are experiencing an unprecedented crisis. The committee recommended that the government implement various initiatives to help the sectors and workers affected by the crisis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Finance therefore recommended that the government allocate $1 billion to the forestry sector. The Committee also recommended that the government allocate $1.5 billion in reimbursable contributions to allow companies to purchase new equipment. There was also the recommendation to increase the excise tax on gas to 5¢ per litre and to permanently transfer this federal tax, effective 2008-09, to all municipalities, a request made many times by Quebec municipalities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also want to support the workers affected by this crisis. To that end, the committee recommends that the government create an independent employment insurance fund and an assistance program for older workers. Naturally, the Bloc Québécois is disappointed that the committee did not accept its suggestion to use the surplus in the independent employment insurance fund to enhance the program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the committee ignored our request to reinstate the Technology Partnerships Canada program, at a cost of $500 million. But the facts are tragic. Action must be taken; the situation is urgent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some figures. Since January 1, 2003, 148,000 jobs have been lost in the manufacturing sector. Since the Conservatives took power in 2006, 78,000 jobs have been lost in the manufacturing sector. And these numbers are just for Quebec. Since April 2005, 21,000 jobs have been lost in the forestry industry alone, which includes the related industries and services, such as transport and forestry equipment. That is just over half of the total in Canada. Since the Conservatives took power, Quebec's forestry industry has lost nearly a quarter of its jobs. In total, of the 288,000 jobs lost in Canada, 148,000, or 51%, were in Quebec. <sup></sup></div>
    </p><a name="Para886897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hardly need remind hon. members that the forestry industry is important to Quebec. Quebec has 88,000 jobs in forestry, sawmills and pulp and paper plants; 230 cities and towns depend primarily on the forestry industry, and 160 cities and towns depend exclusively on it. Nearly half the forest communities in Canada are in Quebec. The forestry industry is a key reason for settlement patterns in Quebec. We do not want people to leave our regions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have worked to propose solutions that we would like to see in the coming budget. They include support for businesses that want to buy new production equipment. This can take the form of a program of loans and loan guarantees to help companies modernize.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies that are suffering and having difficulty borrowing money on private markets must pay a risk premium, which increases the interest they pay. If companies are to compete successfully, they must buy new production equipment, which means that the government must guarantee their loans.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1510"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1510"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1505"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1510">(1510)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para886900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also suggest a series of investments and tax measures to support research and development in industry. The federal government must provide better tax support for corporate research, development and innovation. It must expand the range of expenses that are eligible for funding, for example, by including the cost of taking out patents or training personnel to work on innovative projects. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the R&amp;D tax credit must be made refundable so that companies can take advantage of it, even if they are at the development stage and not yet turning a profit. It can take many years to develop a new product. We need to support our businesses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government really must support research and development by cancelling the cuts to the Technology Partnerships program and increasing the program's funding instead. It must make sure that the program funds really go to the provinces so that they can distribute the funding where it is most needed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading-edge sectors such as pharmaceuticals, environmental technologies, advanced materials and production technology have been left on their own. Contrary to this government's claims, the tax cut is not a cure-all. We must reintroduce an economic diversification program for forest regions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I represent a resource region, I am in a position to understand the difficulties a region can experience when its primary economic activity is in jeopardy. A number of regions in Quebec are taking the full brunt of this crisis in the manufacturing and forestry sectors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois is therefore proposing that special attention be given to the resource regions that are affected by the present forestry crisis and that desperately need to diversify their industrial base. We must therefore restore a regional economic diversification and support program for the regions that have been hit by the forestry crisis. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must offer tax breaks for the companies operating in resource regions and support them while they grow by encouraging skilled workers to settle in the regions. We must create a program to support the development of energy and ethanol production using forest waste. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78745,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78745&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">The Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</A> has eliminated the program specifically devoted to the regions affected by the forestry crisis. That is the laissez-faire policy adopted by the government. We saw nothing in the Speech from the Throne or in the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A>'s economic statement. We must see some solutions in this budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of revising trade laws to provide our businesses with better protection against unfair competition, we can see that as a result of the Conservative laissez-faire trade policy our businesses are being left to their own devices to deal with what is sometimes unfair competition. Canadian antidumping laws date from the Cold War era and are completely out of date in the present situation, particularly for dealing with China. It is urgent that Canadian trade laws be brought up to the same standard as in the other industrialized nations, in particular the United States and the European Union countries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As well, despite the fact that the Standing Committee in Industry, Science and Technology unanimously recommended that it do so in its February 2007 report on the manufacturing sector, the government is not modernizing its antidumping legislation. They are completely out of date and give our businesses less protection than the laws of virtually all of the industrialized nations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, we propose better financial support for the workers who are hit by the crisis in the manufacturing sector. We believe it is necessary to enhance the employment insurance program. We also have to make sure that we avert an exodus of workers hit by this crisis, and we have to support those of our workers aged 55 to 64 who are victims of mass layoffs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To conclude, the Bloc Québécois is close to the grassroots; it stands with the people of Quebec; and it is trying to find solutions that will address this crisis. It seems to us that the next budget is an opportunity to deal with this, and we call on this government to take action. It is urgent, and this is the time when it must be done; the future of our communities depends on it.</div>

The report contained 22 recommendations to address the crisis. The report was tabled in the House after the committee spent a year studying the issue and hearing witnesses. Of course we think it is important for the government to adopt a number of these measures. However, only one of the measures—accelerated capital cost allowance—was chosen, and then only by half measures, unfortunately. We still think these recommendations are valid. The committee gave its unanimous approval, and we would like to see them in the budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important to understand that during the prebudget consultations, we met with groups that are often ignored in our budgets, such as status of women and social housing groups. The government often forgets to consult these groups because they do not represent big business. All the same, these people are deeply involved in areas that experienced harsh program cuts, and now they would like their funding back.</div>

    </p><a name="Para886949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has given $300 million over five years to Palestine. We had a huge crisis in Burma and the government has done good legislative work on that, but on the aid side there is only $2 million a year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope we could get all parties in the House to increase that amount. I just came from the Thai-Burma border and lots of money is needed for food and education. There are refugees right on the border. I hope the member would support me on that.</div>

    </p><a name="Para886954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</b> Mr. Speaker, I heard a comment from the NDP. Perhaps that member would like to repeat it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am please to rise in this debate today. Certainly, there are a couple of fundamentals that really need to be discussed here when discussing the preparation leading up to the budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is important that government listen to those who have elected it. Whether it is this government or any other government, it is extremely important to listen to the people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly, there is no point in asking Canadians for their views and their advice if we are simply going to ignore them. That counsel, the concerns, the ideas presented to us by Canadians from all walks of life and from all regions of the country, in our case, has contributed immeasurably to the development of a strong and fiscally sensible economic action plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fact with which we continually struggle is the realization that we cannot do everything at once, but by setting priorities, making realistic choices, and finding ways to do what is needed while still living within our means, we have been able to strengthen our economy and increase opportunities for Canadians now and into the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with such progress, we have not finished our work. That is why prebudget consultations are so helpful in developing budgets that better reflect the priorities of all Canadians, not just a select few but all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are close to completing a series of cross-Canadian round tables and the online prebudget consultation process is still under way. I would encourage all my fellow members in every party in this place to tell their constituents about this unique opportunity to offer their views and suggestions until February 11, the last day of the online consultation. Hon. members will find the online prebudget consultations on the Finance Canada website, for anyone who cares to look.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still receiving comments and ideas for budget 2008 and beyond, so it is too early to comment on all of those results, although I will say, having been a panel member at the prebudget consultations in Halifax, many excellent comments and ideas were received by the panel.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard early and clearly, in our first round of national prebudget consultations after we took office, that Canadians pay too much tax. In fact, lowering taxes stood high on the list of priorities we heard about during our first ever national online prebudget consultation process back in 2006. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said a few minutes ago, there is no point asking people for their advice if we are not willing to act on what we have been told, so we acted quickly on many fronts, and in particular, we acted to reduce taxes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted what Canadians said they wanted: to get ahead and stay ahead, and to create better incentives for Canadians to succeed. We also wanted to improve the rewards for working hard, saving and investing in the new knowledge and skills.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that we have made great strides on the tax front. We have provided relief in every way the government collects taxes: personal taxes, consumption taxes, business taxes and excise taxes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have increased the basic personal amount to $9,600, retroactive to January 1, 2007 and the basic personal amount will be further increased to $10,100 on January 1, 2009.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially good news for low income Canadians who can least afford to pay taxes. The $10,100 as of 2009 and the $9,600 as of January 1, 2007 is the total amount all Canadians can earn without paying federal income tax.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This measure provides Canadians with an additional $2.5 billion in tax relief in 2007 and 2008. In addition, our government moved the lowest personal income tax rate to 15% from 15.5%, retroactive to January 1, 2007.</div>

    </p><a name="Para886971"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measure provides Canadians with $8.4 billion in tax relief over this year and the next five years. Personal income taxes will come down even further as a result of our tax back guarantee. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886972"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fiscal year, we plan to make an additional debt reduction of $10 billion for a total of more than $37 billion in debt relief since coming to office. We are dedicating all interest savings from this shrinking federal debt to further reduce personal income taxes. This is serious debt relief and serious tax relief for Canadians. With the additional debt reduction in the 2007 economic statement, the total value of tax relief provided under the tax back guarantee will rise to $2.5 billion by 2012-13. Together, these income tax cuts will deliver relief on income tax returns this year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886973"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These tax cuts will move some 385,000 people off the income tax rolls altogether. It is good news for low income Canadians. As a result of the steps we have taken, the purchasing power of consumers will go up. In addition, the take home pay of all Canadians will go up. Reducing taxes for all Canadians is a key part of our long term economic plan entitled “Advantage Canada”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886974"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a plan that would lead to a more rewarding future for Canadians and their families. It is a plan to give Canada and Canadians the key advantages to be able to compete effectively and attract new growth and investment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other four key advantages are: a fiscal advantage eliminating Canada's total government net debt in less than a generation; an infrastructure advantage, building modern world class infrastructure that promotes economic growth, a clean environment and international competitiveness; a knowledge advantage, creating the best educated, most skilled and most flexible workforce in the world; and an entrepreneurial advantage reducing unnecessary regulation and red tape, and increasing competition in the Canadian marketplace. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would further like to point out that since coming to office some 24 months ago, our government has taken action that approaches $200 billion in tax relief for Canadians and businesses, bringing taxes to their lowest level in nearly 50 years. As we move forward, the good news is that we are working from a position of strength. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic fundamentals have remained strong and we can be proud of our achievements. We are experiencing the second longest period of economic expansion in Canadian history. Business investment is expanding for the 12th consecutive year. Our unemployment rate is the lowest in 33 years with more Canadians working than ever before.</div>
    </p><a name="Para886978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada is one of the few countries in the world with a sound public pension plan and we are on the best fiscal footing of the major western industrialized countries. In fact, we are the only member of the G-7 with both ongoing budget surpluses and a falling debt burden. </div>
    </p><a name="Para886979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we are well along in our 2008 prebudget consultations. We are listening. We are putting Canadians first and without exception, we fully intend to continue to do that. </div>

    </p><a name="Para886983"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para887000"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend my colleague, the parliamentary secretary and the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78823,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78823&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">South Shore—St. Margaret's</A>, with whom I share space over in the Justice Building, for his comments. I must say that he has been a great mentor to me. He is a veteran here in the House and for a new member of Parliament it has been good to have a guy like him show us the ropes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887001"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The topic in front of us today is something that we have been able to reflect on as we look back over the last few months to see the kind of pressures that have come to bear here in Canada and to reflect on the kind of response that we have made in ensuring that Canada's economic fundamentals will allow it to withstand the kind of pressures that we have seen, for example, from the slowdown that seems apparent in the United States.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that Canada, looking back over the last decade, has not been immune to these outside economic pressures. We witnessed the drying up of the equity market that occurred in the Asian markets not too long ago, the tech bubble, BSE and SARS, various geopolitical events that happened in the world that cause our economy some ill. There is no doubt that in the future the one thing we know for sure is that this will not be the last. There will continue to be events that arise in the world economy. We know that year after year our economy continues to be ever more connected with what happens in the world. We see that in trade. We see that our dependence on a strong economy relies on good trade relationships with other parts of the world. We can all be sure that will be increasingly important. What that also brings is the greater likelihood that world events will impact our economy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we prepare for that? The measures that this government has taken in the last year have been exactly spot on in what we need to do. Almost every economist will say that the best way to manage and backstop against those kind of pressures is to concentrate on fundamentals, concentrate on getting our fiscal house in order, ensuring that we are making the right investments, that we are not overtaxing Canadians and that we are reducing our debt. I would maintain that is exactly what this government has been doing the last two years, which is what has given rise to the kinds of things that my hon. colleague talked about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have reduced debt by some $37 billion since we took office. We have seen taxes go down. Taxes for all Canadians and businesses right across the country have been reduced by some $190 billion that has been lightened up from our economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887005"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we see happening from that? We see unemployment being at its lowest level in some 30 years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887006"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are all the result of sticking to the basics.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition wants to talk about programs. I will take, for example, the community development trust. This was a good program that was devised, in particular, for one industry towns where the workers were in transition and needed help and to help those towns build stronger new economies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we hear? We hear that it is not enough. The opposition members would have us spend and spend. They would take us into deficit. They do not seem to talk. Let me correct that. They do think the GST should go back up to 7%. We have heard that from them as well. The GST is putting some $12 billion back in the pockets of Canadians because of those two measures, a promise we kept from the 2006 election. They would put that GST back up to 7%. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545">(1545)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would need to defer to some of the commentary the Liberals would bring on this question. It would be up to them to tell Canadians how they would disburse these new taxes that they would apply back to Canadians, but they have a tax and spend approach, which t is exactly what failed Canada in the past. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach is to liberate the economy and that is what we are doing. We are making investments in the right areas and to have fiscal balance. We are trying to ensure that the provinces and territories are working on an even footing, that they have the kinds of resources they need to spend in their jurisdictions that is fair, predictable and consistent, the kind of proper balance needed between the two levels of government to ensure we are serving Canadians well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We invest in the right areas but at the end of the day we ensure that the kind of economic decisions we make enable Canada's economy. What has come as a result of that? My hon. friend from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78823,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78823&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">South Shore—St. Margaret's</A> has explained that in some detail.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the opportunity over the last six months to participate in the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. It has been a very enlightening experience listening to the testimony in committee on the topic that we are discussing on the service sector of Canada's industries. Some 75% of our economy is in the service sector, a critical sector for our economy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887013"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee had several meetings on the whole issue of how the strengthening of the Canadian dollar has impacted us here in Canada. What the witnesses said supports exactly the kind of logic that we have applied, not just in our economic statement this past fall, not just in budget 2007, but going right back to when we campaigned back in 2005-06 to bring a new and better approach for Canada, and it is paying off.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the time to start delving into robust, strong interventionist policies, the kind of heavy spending, heavy intervention by governments that, to be honest, got us in trouble back in the 1970s and 1980s. It was those kinds of approaches, these knee-jerk reactions to try to jump in and use public dollars to create imbalances in our economy that caused the ebb and flow to issues around inflation and interest rates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many members will remember that that was a very chaotic time for our economy. We have learned from that and we are doing a better job of it. This government will continue that approach. No one ever wants to see job losses in the country, but the fact is that when times come upon us where we need to re-tool, adjust and equip ourselves for the newer economy, adjustments will take place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we heard from witnesses who appeared before the committee is that while we may have lost some jobs in one part of the sector of the economy, we are actually gaining even more in other sectors. We may have lost 100,000 or so jobs in some sectors of the economy, in this case in manufacturing, but we have actually gained 400,000 jobs in another sector. The net gain has been positive. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some think, in the service sector in particular, that all jobs are low paying. That has not been the experience. Every sector has its highs and lows in terms of quality employment, the kinds of jobs that can give people the livelihoods they need to raise their families, move ahead and be tremendous contributors to Canadian society. That is what we all want and that is what we are all looking for.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887018"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that times are changing and Canada needs to adjust with it. The very best way we can do that is to ensure we concentrate on giving the economy all the tools it needs to have effective job opportunities, the right kinds of investments and the kind of dynamic, competitive environment that will attract investment, and that is happening. We are seeing companies coming to Canada doing a fantastic job.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other members have suggested that there is some kind of demise of our manufacturing sector. I have to say that our manufacturing sector is the most resilient and the strongest part of our economy that I have seen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887020"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Midland, Ontario in my riding, there is a sector that is 35% overrepresented on the provincial average of manufacturing jobs. Yes, they are going through some paces and they are having to make some adjustments, but they are in business and they are performing well. In other sectors of manufacturing in Canada, bigger investment is coming. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887021"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will end with that. I invite comments from my colleagues.</div>

    </p><a name="Para887023"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague opposite speaks of the GST. I would say to him that he is reinventing a reality when he says that members on this side of the House have any intention of raising the GST. I do want to ask him why, when he cites economists, he does not cite those economists who said that the GST was the worst possible tax cut the government could employ, that in fact it should have been looking at income taxes?</div>
    </p><a name="Para887024"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he speaks about government spending, I particularly want him to comment on the fact that with the Liberal government, from 1992-93 to 2005-06, program spending was 2.3% and Liberal government spending, after balancing the budget from 1997 to 2005-06, was 5.5%. With the Conservative government from 2005-07 it was 6.4% and the direct federal spending by the Conservative government was 8.6%. That is higher than any previous Liberal government since 1992.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887025"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does he reconcile his remarks with these figures?</div>

We welcomed members opposite to support us in that decision, but if I recall, they voted against that. They were against reducing the GST. I assume from that they would have preferred to keep it where it was. That is the root of my comments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887027"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other question, this government in the last two years has reduced debt by $37 billion. The debt is now down to $457 billion, the lowest it has been in some 25 years. At the same time, we have liberated the taxes on Canadians by some $190 billion. We have done that and we have continued to make sure that investments are in the right place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887028"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we are investing in things like supporting our men and women in the armed forces. These are important priorities, the kinds of things that we promised we would do also.</div>

    </p><a name="Para887036"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak during this prebudget debate. In the coming weeks we are expecting to see a budget from the government, a government that so far has let down Canadians across the country and has particularly let down the people of Manitoba and of Winnipeg.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887037"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago the government inherited a sound fiscal record left by the previous Liberal government, a government that worked for nearly 13 years to bring our country out of deficit, a deficit, I might add, that we inherited from the former Conservative government, a pattern not uncommon to Conservative governments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887038"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a Liberal government that produced eight consecutive balanced budgets. Canada had the best fiscal record of all the G-7 economies when the Liberals left office.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times were good when the government took office and now our fervent wish and top priority is that the Conservative government now stay out of deficit. As hard times are upon us, the fiscal cupboard is almost empty. We have seen a government that cares more about posturing and power, a government that politicizes the affairs of the country, a government that often misspeaks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887040"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has introduced two budgets and an economic statement. We saw a spending spree when times were good, and I would say, irresponsible tax cuts aimed to attract the voter rather than sound fiscal management.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also managed to cut in areas that would make us more productive, such as research and innovation, or in areas that were in desperate need, such as literacy and poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to touch on a number of issues that are of concern to the people of Manitoba and those issues that aboriginal Canadians face today that must be addressed by the government in its upcoming budget. We see a trend from the government and its fiscal record, a trend that entails mismanagement, hypocrisy, vindictiveness, and as I said before, much misspeak. There is misspeak on lowering income taxes while in fact increasing them, misspeak on program formats while in fact the government cut funds and narrowed the criteria.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government decided to break its promise on income trusts, it destroyed $25 billion of Canadians' hard-earned savings. This was a direct hit to the pockets of every Canadian. The income trusts policy, I would say, was based on a false premise. The Conservatives have not been able to prove the notion that income trusts give rise to substantial tax leakage and tax unfairness. It is completely false. It has been discredited by many experts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887044"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What there has not been enough public discussion on, and my colleague raised it earlier in question period, is how indeed this income trusts debacle is affecting both the CPP and other public and private pension programs. That is something that requires further study.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to note that while holidaying far away, I was stopped on the street by a resident of my constituency, whom I do not know, who complained about income trusts and the horrendous impact it had on his family's finances.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also troubling to hear the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and his <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">finance minister</A> say that the federal government has no role to play in urban communities. We know that last November the Federation of Canadian Municipalities came out with a report entitled, “Danger Ahead: The Coming Collapse of Canada's Municipal Infrastructure”. The report outlines a, what is said to be underestimated, $123 billion infrastructure deficit that Canadian municipalities now face. The report called for a national plan to eliminate this deficit and prepare the groundwork for effective management of our infrastructure. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887047"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shell game the government is playing with infrastructure money is really an insult to Canadians. The reality is that Liberal programs are the backbone of that funding. The reality is that of the new money the government says it is putting forward, four programs are not accessible to municipalities. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real Conservative building Canada fund is $8.8 million, and even that is suspect, and now may be as little as $1.3 billion over seven years. That is disgraceful and duplicitous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887049"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Manitoba we are anxious to know that funding for the floodway will come out of the old Liberal national strategic infrastructure program, not out of provincial allocations. Bridges, roads and water are very important to Manitobans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887050"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment is a priority for everyone. We have an obligation to address this issue now and for the future. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887051"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, we are seeing no leadership from the members opposite. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> was quoted in the <i>Toronto Star</i> in June 2004 as saying, “Carbon dioxide does not cause or contribute to smog, and the Kyoto treaty would do nothing to reduce or prevent smog”. Perhaps that is another misspeak.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887052"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government claims it has taken action on the environment, but again it is empty rhetoric and an empty plan. We have a plan. I am not going to go into any details, but we know that the carbon budget would make a difference.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has restricted access to the home energy retrofit program for those who need it most. There is less money in the program, narrower criteria, and those who are poor cannot access it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887054"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear it over and over again from every pulpit and every podium that children are our future. Well, the government must show it and invest in children and invest in post-secondary education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887055"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition is committed to working with the provinces to bring forth an effective, high quality child care early learning program for families, something each and every child has a right to. We have not seen the promised 125,000 spaces. We have not seen the 32,000 spaces the minister says he has created.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887056"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding of Winnipeg South Centre day cares have waiting lists of 300 children. Parents are forced to leave their employment. Many are not achieving their goals of further education because they do not have the necessary supports for their children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 27, the headline in the <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i> read, “Tories say they made child care boo-boo”. It was a big boo-boo and Canadians are paying for it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887058"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently visited the aboriginal head start program in Winnipeg where the evaluations are showing they are changing the realities and opportunities for academic success for children and their families who participate in the program. I urge the government to look at this seriously.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of post-secondary education, money must be available to students and universities for the direct and indirect costs of research. The government must go further than it did in budget 2007. Yes, there was money for 4,000 graduate students, and I appreciate that, and I am sure they appreciate that as well, but what about the undergraduate students? What about the students struggling to make ends meet? What about those young Canadians who cannot even access post-secondary education?</div>
    </p><a name="Para887060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The millennium scholarship fund must be renewed. Countless Manitoba students have had their debt load reduced through this program and it has enabled them to go on to further education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot stand here and not talk about aboriginal Canadians. Members opposite treated the Kelowna accord, which dealt with the issues of poverty, education, housing, health, governance on reserve and off, with what I would call disgusting disrespect for this initiative. For 18 months it was a consultative process and all parties came up with a solution. It is a priority if we are going to close the gap. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen how the Conservative government operates: income trusts; investment tax deductibility; squandering of fiscal prudence; raised income taxes for the poorest versus a regressive GST cut that benefits the rich; a relief package for workers that does too little, too late; mounting job losses; a rising dollar; a struggling U.S. economy; and a number of our own key sectors in trouble. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">finance minister</A> has not excused himself with tremendous credibility on the financial management front. I speak not just of squandered fiscal prudence and income trust debacles, but the simple management of his own office and the disregard for his own government's guidelines.</div>

    </p><a name="Para887089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is interesting today that the debate is around where to spend the surplus. That was not always the case. It took years and it was a struggle for all Canadians, not just a Liberal government that worked to reduce and eliminate the deficit. However, over a period of time all Canadians made sacrifices and worked together to achieve what was to become the soundest fiscal situation in any of the industrialized world. A declining debt to GDP ratio, a capacity for governments both to lower taxes and increase spending. In fact, the Conservative government inherited the strongest fiscal situation of any government in the history of Canada upon entering office.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78936,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78936&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Yellowhead</A> said something that was extremely telling a few minutes ago. He posed the question as to why the Liberals still cared about the Kelowna accord. Why did Liberals include the Kelowna accord as one of their priorities? Why did Liberals still considered the Kelowna accord to be important? According to the member for Yellowhead, in the consultations across the country, he did not hear many Canadians speaking about that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A responsible and progressive government would defend the rights and interests of all Canadian, regardless of whether they form the majority. The government and the Conservative Party have demonstrated a remarkable capacity under the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> to pit one group against another, to write people off if they do not believe they will vote for them. It was for easy for them to write off the Kelowna accord. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did a simple political calculation and politically the aboriginal and first nations people in Canada would not vote for the Conservatives, so they were expendable. It was very easy for them also to eliminate early learning and child care. They calculated that by and large young women would not vote for them according to the polls, so they wrote them off. They took them off the political balance sheet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887093"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good governments and principled governments do more than help those people who vote for them. They help all Canadians. There is a responsibility, particularly for aboriginal and first nations communities, to work with them, to address the economic and social challenges that are faced by aboriginal and first nations communities. It not just good public policy for them to ensure equality of opportunity, but it is good public policy for all Canadians, particularly as we see aboriginal and first nations communities being one of the fastest growing populations in the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not, as non-aboriginal political representatives, take this seriously, we are letting down all Canadians on what could be a massive economic and social challenge. We need to not only bring back the Kelowna accord and address those social issues, but we need to move beyond Kelowna and address the economic challenges and opportunities for Canadian aboriginal people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding in rural Nova Scotia has three aboriginal reserves, the Cambridge Reserve, Port Reserve and Shubenacadie Reserve. The challenges being faced by people in those communities is immense. As a government, we invested in schools at Shubenacadie Reserve and we invested in people. We were prepared to move beyond that with the Kelowna accord on a national basis. I would like, as one the priorities of a future Liberal government, to restore the Kelowna accord and to move beyond it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believed in early learning and child care. In fact, it is not just good social policy; it is good economic policy. An article in <i>The Economist</i> magazine called “A guide to womenomics” focused on the kinds of economic policies that not only could address equality issues, but also address economic growth and prosperity. It pointed to the countries that enjoyed the greatest level of economic growth, particularly Scandinavian countries. These countries not only did the right thing in terms of reforming their tax systems and cutting corporate and personal taxes and moving to a more competitive tax system, but they also invested in social policy, particularly early learning and child care.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615">(1615)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not have a strong network of early learning and child care, it will hurt women disproportionately. Women pay a higher career cost and earnings cost than men, typically, for the responsibility of raising children. Regardless of how progressive couples become, that continues to be a fact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The degree to which communities and society work together to share that burden and opportunity will reduce the barriers for women in the workplace and increase the economic prosperity of the country. That was made clear by <i>The Economist</i>. It is not a left wing or right wing principle; it is just good, basic, sound economic and social policy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond that, we are in a situation where other countries, and I mentioned some of the Scandinavian countries, countries like Norway and Sweden and Ireland and Australia, have reformed their tax systems to be more competitive. One of the benefits we have as a country in a surplus situation is we can reform our tax system. There is no country in the world, however, that is reforming its tax system by cutting a consumption tax. Canada is the only one. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global economic consensus is that a country is better off cutting personal income taxes and reducing income tax. In fact, with the $14 billion per year that the Conservatives are expending with the GST cut, they could have increased the basic personal exemption, the point at which Canadians start paying income taxes, to about $20,000 per year. It is currently around $9,600. We could take millions and millions of low income Canadians off the income tax rolls altogether and provide a tax break through the income tax system to all Canadians and have a more competitive tax system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is our corporate tax rates are still higher than many of our OECD competitors. While statutory corporate tax rates may be becoming as competitive, the actual effect of corporate tax rates are still higher in Canada. The problem is it is a moving target. The Conservatives are saying that in five or ten years Canada will be one of the most competitive corporate tax environments in the world. In five or ten years other countries are going to move faster, address corporate taxes and become more competitive and we are going to be sitting here. They say in the long run that we will be more competitive. John Maynard Keynes, the economist, once said, “In the long run, we're all dead”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We actually have a responsibility to be nimble, to move more quickly and to reform our tax system for growth, prosperity and equity more quickly. Cutting the GST is not the best way to achieve that. I believe it is more important to cut personal income taxes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond that, it is critically important that we not ignore the looming economic challenges facing the country. The reduction, or practically the elimination, of the fiscal envelope or fiscal capacity of the government to act in times of crisis is troubling. The latest edition of <i>The Economist</i> magazine said, “Economists reckon that Canada's fiscal and current account surpluses could disappear”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would have thought, even a few months ago, that a country with as massive a surplus as Canada was enjoying, a country that had been lauded by countries, economists and finance ministers around the world as a beacon of fiscal probity and economic innovation would have <i>The Economist</i> magazine say, “Economists reckon that Canada's fiscal and current account balances could disappear?” </div>
    </p><a name="Para887105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very serious situation because it speaks to the bad economic management of the government. Not only is it incapable of investing in sound social policy, but it is also incapable of good economic growth policy. I would not mind it being completely market reliant and laissez-faire if it in fact understood the market.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond that, Canadians are looking for long term investments on recreational infrastructure. Across my riding, facilities were built in the memorial wave of federal investment. Facilities, arenas and recreational facilities were built as part of the centennial wave of federal investment. However, across my riding there is a tremendous infrastructure deficit in places like Lantz, Brooklyn and Windsor.</div>

    </p><a name="Para887113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did take steps to address environmental issues and climate change issues. In fact, our present leader was the environment minister who introduced project green, a plan to green the Government of Canada. As minister of public works, I established in my department the Office of Greening Government Operations, which aimed, through green procurement, green building management, and LEED's gold standards in buildings, to address that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887114"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that I want to see governments do more. This is something I share with the member. She said something that was extremely important, that is, that economic growth can coincide with environmental responsibility. She is absolutely right.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Innovative governments and companies around the world are seizing the green agenda, the green rush. They are investing in clean technologies and the research, development and commercialization of those technologies. It is broadly felt that in fact environmental technologies and clean tech will be the fastest growing area of the 21st century. Canada has the potential to be a global leader in clean energy and clean tech, so I agree with her on that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a member of the Liberal caucus, and in fact it might even be the member across the way who just spoke, has been quoted as saying in the <i>National Post</i> on July 17 that this kind of budget deliberation would be like asking a “janitor for budget suggestions”.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see the member opposite shaking his head so perhaps it was not him, but that a Liberal member would have the gall to say such a thing about Canadians participating in a budget process, what does he think about that?</div>

I would hope that the hon. member, when he does table it and when it is found that I did not say that, would apologize to me, withdraw his comments and apologize to the House for misleading the House, because I certainly would not say something like that. I think there is human dignity in every job that anyone does because there is pleasure and dignity in service. I would not ever say that and I did not say it, so I would hope that the hon. member, as an honourable member, will do exactly that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887120"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the hon. member is from a rural riding. I have been to his riding. I know that he in fact lives in a beautiful part of the country and operated or operates a tourism facility there, a very nice one. He should understand the importance of the government's lack of commitment to tourism and the fact that the government eliminated the GST tax credit for individuals and damaged tourism at a time when the declining U.S. dollar already had dealt it a blow.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a rural member, he should understand the importance of agriculture. I meet with farmers in my riding on an ongoing basis. I hear of the importance of a buy Canadian plan, focusing on encouraging Canadians to buy local and encouraging more Canadians to think about food security, and to think about the importance of a national food policy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear about the importance of investing in infrastructure to help farmers sell their goods and farmers' markets in places like Wolfville, Windsor and Halifax. There is a proposal to have the most innovative green market anywhere in Canada in Halifax. ACOA turned it down because it did not see the importance of farmers being able to sell locally to consumers who want the best products grown in Canada.</div>

    </p><a name="Para887124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various ways to approach a prebudget consultation in a prebudget speech. One can roll out a series of economic facts. One can talk about certain specifics or one can lay out certain principles and backgrounds and begin to develop what one thinks. I think that both methods are positive. Both methods have their strengths.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887125"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having listened to a number of my colleagues go into specifics today, I thought I would concentrate more on a general aspect of laying out my philosophy, my background and where I come from so that the voters of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78674,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78674&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saskatoon—Humboldt</A>, the people I represent, could better understand where I come from on a principles basis, so they could understand what their representative thinks, what goes into his deliberations, and why he comes to certain perspectives when he casts his vote. I hope that my colleagues will bear with me as I take a slightly different approach.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887126"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would first like to lay out for my electorate and the population at large my background so that they might know my bio. I come from a very middle class family. My dad was a farmer. He has an education degree and taught for a while before going back to his first love. My mom is the local town librarian back home. We were not by any stretch of the imagination a rich or wealthy family.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887127"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I went off to the University of Saskatchewan, from which I ended up graduating with degrees in geophysics and economics, I did not have some major trust fund or any great amount of wealth to support me. I think this was very good for my education and for my background in understanding basic economics. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pay my way through university, to be able to afford to go and have the privilege to earn some degrees at the university to provide for my future and to help with my education, I had to work each summer. I had to get down and do physical labour and do something that helped to build and mould my character.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In particular, I ended up working at a couple of different places. I worked at Good Spirit camp as the manager, chopping wood and managing the store. There I learned about fiscal responsibility. I also worked at tree planting for three summers in B.C., which was very important for my practical economic understanding. While the theory of economics was wonderful in the classroom, piecework tree planting is very good for practical economics. I understood very quickly that if one did not plant that tree and do it right, one did not get paid. There was a direct and immediate correlation and responsibility between the work one had done and the payment. I had the privilege of receiving that paycheque only for what I did and was responsible for.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887130"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I value those summers because they taught me about responsibility and valuing money, things that I think are sometimes lost today on people who do not come from a background where they are forced to address those questions directly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887131"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I begin to speak today, I note that those are the experiences I come from. I took those prejudices and that background and began to apply them to my general principles approach as to how we should do our budget deliberations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on that background, I began to work through my principles. First and foremost, in regard to all the expenditures of all the money that we receive from the people of Canada, we as parliamentarians must consider that it is not our money. It is not the government's money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the money of the people of Canada. They individually worked for it by the sweat of their brow. It was their effort. It was their initiative that caused the creation of wealth. We only hold it for them in trust. This is a trust that we must hold in higher regard than we hold our personal finances. I think we must remember that in regard to every penny we spend in budget 2008 someone worked for it, someone sacrificed and someone made decisions to try to create that wealth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, instead of having the government come to this with the assumption that we have the right to spend the money, that it is ours to decide, we as the government and as members of Parliament should be required to justify each and every expenditure. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630">(1630)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be able to say in regard to each year's budget that every penny was well spent. We should go through them over and over again. Just because program spending was appropriate in one year does not mean that we should continue it in a future year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887136"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must continue to justify to the voters, the electorate and the citizens of Canada that their money needs to go to whatever programs we put into the budget, because it is ultimately theirs and we only hold it in trust. It is not our right to decide what to do. We only get that right as it is given to us by the voters and only in trust.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887137"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to hold that wealth from our voters in trust, it must be required that whatever expenditures we make, we do them with the utmost efficiency and for the creation of more wealth, not less. We must use government expenditures to create more opportunity to create services that cannot be provided through other means, and we must use those services with maximum efficiency. We must not waste money in any way, shape or form.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887138"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those basic principles underlined, we look to history to see where they have been best applied, where governments have held money most in trust, and where have they gone out and applied these principles in an economic fashion with the greatest efficiency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887139"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see that very clearly throughout history this has been best applied by government administrations that have applied some basic principles. They are governments that have emphasized free markets, not a collectivistic approach. They are governments that have supported free trade rather than a mercantilist style of approach, one that would hoard for an elite and keep a country looking inward instead of using the economic efficiencies of the entire world. This means a government policy that uses the currency as a means of trade and not as a means of manipulation for the power of the state to tax through inflation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887140"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those historical premises and the philosophical understanding, how do we then begin to apply that to what we have? I think the government has been quite good at applying those basic principles.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, we have paid down the debt that was built up and which was predominantly a legacy of the Trudeau administration in our history, with some other administrations also sharing lesser degrees of blame. We have paid down the debt by $37 billion and will continue to pay down that debt by a minimum of $3 billion more per year. That is wise and prudent management of the public finances, because that debt is taxation for the future. It was caused by irresponsible and wasteful squandering by previous administrations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we have emphasized lower taxes, because again it is back to that principle: we hold the money in trust. While there have been criticisms of certain specific tax cuts, I know of no tax cut that is a bad tax cut. They are all good. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I am proud of the government's business tax cuts. While certain parties in the House may sharply criticize corporations, they do not criticize the investments in things, which teachers, farmers and workers across the country receive from these corporations in the forms of dividends and appreciated stock value. It is people's retirement that is being boosted as these companies are being supported.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most notably, we have also dropped the GST by two full percentage points. Again the opposition criticizes us, although there is a certain degree of irony since two of the parties that were around at that time were harshly critical of it when it was first implemented and used the exact reverse of their arguments then.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize that parties are not the same throughout their history. They are organic, living and changing things, but there is a certain irony when the exact same people who in some situations criticized the imposition of a consumption tax are now reversing their position to criticize the decreasing of a consumption tax.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done other things. Among them, we have helped to increase the basic deduction for income taxes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887147"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see my time is winding down, let me say finally that cutting taxes and watching the deficit are two of the most important things, but we must also make sure that we spend on necessities, not frills. We have increased spending on certain things such as infrastructure and direct targeting to communities in need. Those sorts of things are necessary to promote and protect our society, particularly regions of our society that are at a disadvantage due to outside forces.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Targeted wise spending on solid things, cutting the budget, cutting the deficit by balancing the budget, and cutting taxes are the priorities of the government. They are the priorities--</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may point out to the hon. member, there has been a considerable amount of discussion and papers prepared outside the government, so I do think it is prudent for the government to take information from outside the public realm, from outside the civil service, and examine it to see if it has been well and thoughtfully done.

    </p><a name="Para887165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we adjust the tax system to favour one group or the other, surely he would see that not all tax cuts are necessarily fair to the other parties in society.

One of the other jobs I did not mention in my preamble that I had done was that I worked in a bakery from 4 a.m. to 12 noon each day and paid out unemployment insurance each and every day.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with my hon. colleague, that instead of emphasizing sometimes the redistribution of things, we should be fair and let the working poor keep their wages, keep what they have worked for, and I would suggest cutting payroll taxes is one of those fair ways to cut taxes.</div>

I think it is paramount that all of us in this House have that chance to speak for all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everyone in this House is quite aware, we live in a global economy with very fierce competition and growing uncertainty from time to time. In an environment like that, government needs to find bold and innovative ways to stay ahead of the curve. Part of that process is, as insinuated early, listening to Canadians. That is why we hold these prebudget consultations every year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887172"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We look to Canadians for ideas to help the government create an environment that rewards hard work, encourages growth and improves our quality of life. We are well on our way down that road.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887173"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are making broad-based, long term tax reductions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887174"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are reducing record amounts of debt. That is something that we have to continue to do. We have to look at the debt that this country has incurred and that has been added to since the 1970s as mortgages on people's houses that they pass on to their children and their grandchildren. I do not want my granddaughter and any possible future grandchildren to have that debt. We need to work on it all the time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887175"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are spending responsibly and efficiently.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887176"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Canada is certainly on a solid financial footing, we are mindful of the various challenges that confront us; global pressures and domestic challenges that vary from region to region and certainly from sector to sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887177"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some examples that come immediately to mind are: the appreciation of the Canadian dollar that has left a variety of sectors struggling; increasing economic competition from abroad, especially from emerging economies like China, Brazil and India; and, aging infrastructure and increased gridlock. We have to address these issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887178"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These challenges require a clear plan to guide us into the future. That plan is our long term economic plan called “Advantage Canada”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887179"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “Advantage Canada” plan focuses on creating five key advantages: a tax advantage, a knowledge advantage, an entrepreneurial advantage, a fiscal advantage, and an infrastructure advantage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887180"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last point, an infrastructure advantage, Canadians have told the government that they are concerned about the state of Canada's infrastructure: our roads, bridges and public transit. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887181"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell members that those concerns are no less warranted in my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78803,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78803&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</A>. I hear from my former colleagues in municipal government, the mayor and councillors there today, that it is one of their biggest concerns at that level and I certainly understand that. We are going a long way toward addressing that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887182"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing that, we are making the largest investment in infrastructure since World War II, $33 billion over seven years, through this building Canada plan. This is new money to build roads and rapid transit lines, rehabilitate bridges and water systems, and upgrade our international gateways, trade corridors and sewage treatment plants.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887183"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what exactly is our building Canada plan? Building Canada would fund strategic investments in projects designed to produce results in three areas of national importance: a growing economy, a clean environment, and strong and prosperous communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887184"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building Canada would provide long term, predictable funding right up to the year 2014. It would provide the provinces, territories and municipalities with the certainty they have been looking for. In fact, over half of the funding under the building Canada plan would be provided directly to municipalities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887185"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific elements of the plan would include maintaining the increase to 100% in the GST rebate, which, combined with the GST rate reduction, would provide municipalities with $5.8 billion in predictable revenue from now through to 2014 that could be used for infrastructure priorities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember my 12.5 years in municipal government. It always irked me that municipalities had to pay GST on any of the projects and any of the purchases that they made. We did get 58% of it back, but it still was not right. It took staff time and government staff time as well. This is clean and it should have been done years ago.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887187"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also maintain and extend the federal gas tax fund, providing municipalities with $11.8 billion over the next seven years for a range of infrastructure investments such as public transit, water and waste water infrastructure, and local roads.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645">(1645)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887188"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan will create an $8.8 billion Building Canada fund that will in part support larger strategic infrastructure investments of national and regional significance, such as improvements for the core national highway system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887189"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, the Building Canada fund will provide the necessary financial support to smaller community-based infrastructure projects. I have a lot of those in my rural riding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887190"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building Canada focuses on upgrading our border crossings and gateways through our $2.1 billion gateway and border crossings fund. This includes a significant investment in a new crossing between Detroit and Windsor to improve the flow of traffic at our most important gateway.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887191"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan will provide $1 billion for our Asia-Pacific gateway and corridor initiative. Through this initiative we are making important infrastructure investments that will allow Canada to take advantage of the growing Asia-Pacific market.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887192"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each province and territory will be provided with $25 million minimum in base infrastructure funding annually, which amounts to $175 million each over the next seven years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887193"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan establishes a $1.26 billion public private partnership fund, the first initiative of its kind in Canada, something that really excites me. We are also providing $25 million over five years to set up a federal public private partnership office.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887194"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this public private partnership, or P3s as it is commonly known, the government is doing its part by providing long term, predictable infrastructure funding. There are not many instances of a better way, a different way, of doing business than the use of public private partnerships.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many success stories in other countries around the world. Perhaps one of the best known in Canada is the Confederation Bridge linking Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick. I had the privilege of crossing that bridge this past summer. It is quite a sight. This kind of public private partnership has worked very well there. Another good example is the Royal Ottawa Hospital right here in Ottawa.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When managed properly, P3s can help close the infrastructure gap. We have to be innovative in finding ways to address the infrastructure deficit in this country. I would like to emphasize that smart investments in infrastructure drive productivity, support trade, and fuel economic growth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's highly competitive, just in time world, modern, efficient infrastructure is not a luxury; it is a necessity. Replacing our aging infrastructure is going to be a challenge. It is also a priority if Canada is to continue to be competitive in today's global economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887198"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need our roads, our bridges, and our trade corridors in order to move our goods efficiently. We also need public transit to move our people quickly and safely but also to decrease the effect and harm to the environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887199"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need our water systems to provide us with clean water.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887200"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following our “Advantage Canada” plan, our government has developed a forward looking infrastructure renewal plan that balances regional needs with national priorities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building Canada provides historic and long term funding for provinces, territories and municipalities, so they can build modern and healthy communities today and for future generations.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, this year's prebudget consultation process included hosting a public town hall meeting in Victoria that was well attended, presentations and attending finance committee hearings in Victoria by the committee last December, reviewing hundreds of letters and emails from my constituents and having countless conversations with folks on the street.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this process, I heard two predominant messages from the residents of greater Victoria. First, invest with vision in a more socially, environmentally and economically sustainable future. Second, that investment in Victoria should begin with housing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They asked the government to review the massive corporate tax cuts announced in the fall fiscal update in favour of targeted measures to restore balance in our communities and in our social and physical infrastructure and to tackle climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight a few of the excellent presentations we heard in the Victoria meetings of the House of Commons finance committee. The non-profit group, Heritage B.C., spoke eloquently about the importance of conserving heritage buildings and rehabilitating them for modern use, especially affordable rental housing. Its very pragmatic proposal would strengthen the federal historic places initiative by restoring the commercial heritage properties incentive fund and creating a federal tax incentive to amplify the success of tax measures in Victoria and Vancouver that has allowed us to protect some properties but, unfortunately, has not been supported by the federal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard from the BC Sustainable Energy Association, which expertly warned not only of the environmental hazards of the government's non-response to climate change, but also the economic hazards of being left behind as the rest of the world shifts to clean, renewable energy while we stay wedded to an obsolescent fossil fuel economy of past centuries. We must put a price on carbon to turn this around. Left unchecked, global warming could cost B.C.'s economy in the billions of dollars.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887222"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society identified six key actions that the federal government should take to protect healthy ecosystems in the face of climate change. I hope it considers those seriously.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president of Results Canada made a compelling call to increase our foreign aid which he noted has actually dropped even further below our commitment of a 0.7% target from 0.34% of our gross national income in 2005 to 0.3% in 2006.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the finance committee came to town, I hosted a public town hall meeting to hear the priorities of my constituents that were not necessarily linked to the narrow focus of taxes. Overall, those in attendance expressed a strong desire to see the federal government re-establish its leadership role in the arena of social policy and to nurture the social contract we have together as Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, overwhelmingly, the number one area of urgently needed investment in Victoria continues to be housing and homelessness. In October, the City of Victoria released its task force report on breaking the cycle of mental illness, addictions and homelessness after four months of work. The task force did an excellent job analyzing the problem and mapping a way forward, but many of its recommendations cannot be implemented without support from Ottawa. In fact, the report clearly identifies the past Liberal government's withdrawal from the social housing sphere in the early 1990s, along with cuts to federal transfer payments, as two of the contributing factors to our current crisis. Now the Conservative <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105827,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105827&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">human resources minister</A> does not even bother attending housing meetings with his provincial counterparts, pretending it is not his problem. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887226"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chorus of voices pleading for federal help from the perspective of ethics and social justice has been joined by that of members of Victoria's business community who have come out as forcefully and unequivocally as they possibly could.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote briefly from the testimony of the Victoria Chamber of Commerce. It stated:</div>
    </p><a name="Para887228"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="30" align="right"></td>

</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the absence of our federal <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105827,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105827&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">human resources minister</A> from the meeting with his provincial counterparts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887230"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chamber of Commerce added:</div>
    </p><a name="Para887231"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>In this time of record government surplus, it is absolutely necessary for the federal government to apply a focused effort to reducing homelessness across Canada, and in doing so improve the business environment for thousands of Canadian companies. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para887232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentiment from the Chamber of Commerce echoes what I have heard on the doorsteps in Victoria. Even in the more affluent areas, I frequently hear concern for affordable housing and homelessness mentioned on the doorsteps of homes that might cost $700,000 in Victoria. These residents understand that even if this issue does not afflict them personally, it is relevant to them because they are members of the Victoria community. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887233"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is that community spirit, the truly Canadian quality of caring for one's neighbour and choosing to contribute solutions to our common problems, that is alive in Victoria and in communities across Canada, which the Conservatives do not seem to recognize in their obsession with tax cuts, especially corporate tax cuts that benefit the banks and large financial organizations. It shows that affordable housing is a fundamental issue that strikes the hearts of all Canadians and it shows that tax cuts are not universally popular if it means that some in our society go without. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887234"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to a couple of other areas that require targeted investment in the upcoming budget, according to my constituents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is time for the government to accept the majority will of Parliament and allow the NDP's early learning and child care act to pass. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073187,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073187&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-303</A> has now passed two votes in the House and one in committee. Parents across Canada who desperately need affordable child care cannot wait any longer and parents who want to choose quality early learning over big box day care deserve that option.</div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para887236"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, one million Canadians struggle to repay student loans, which have reached record levels, and they need help. The federal government expects to make $497.9 million in interest on student loans in the coming year. Every dollar in interest is one more dollar that a low or middle income student pays for his education compared to other students whose parents pay for theirs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not be easy to level this structural inequality in our post-secondary education system. However, a good starting point in this budget would be to reduce the interest rate paid by students, to establish a system of immediate grants based on financial need, to improve options for lightening the debt load and to establish a student loan ombudsman's office to help students navigate this inefficient system. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para887238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, public research informs good public policy, but it would appear that the Conservatives are allergic to both. They have cut key funding for the Canadian Climate Impacts and Adaptation Research Network, eliminated the federal science advisor, overruled and fired Canada's nuclear safety regulator and continue to grossly underfund research in the social and human sciences. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, corporate influence on Canada's campuses and in university research continues to rise because the Liberal cuts from a decade ago have yet to be adequately restored. Our colleges and universities need stable, adequate core funding that corresponds with their economic growth in order to remain internationally competitive and provide the best possible education to our children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need increased funding for research in the public interest if we are to avoid letting profit become the guiding factor in public health, safety and environmental decisions. Budgets 2006-07 were colossal missed opportunities to invest in key strategic areas for more sustainable--</div>

The banks and resource sectors benefit the most from these cuts. The financial sector will get one-third of Canadian corporate pre-tax profits. The oil and gas and mining sectors will get one-sixth of Canadian corporate pre-tax profits. Yet the single mom who is struggling to make ends meet and has no day care, was offered $100 a month and yet in Victoria she has to pay about $1,000 a month. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only does it affect parents and ordinary families, but these across the board cuts will do nothing to target the sectors that we want to stimulate, like the manufacturing sector or green industries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just untargeted, across the board cuts that will have no impact on our productivity. As former cuts during the Liberals' term have shown, there were no improvements in productivity. </div>

I would like to thank the citizens of the cities of Burnaby and New Westminster. Many members of the community were emailing me, sending letters or making phone calls about what they believe the priorities should be for this country. I will come back to that in a moment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, Canadians are seeing a disconnect between what the current Conservative government is doing, what the former Liberal government did, and what they actually see as major priorities that should be tackled by the federal government of this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should start by talking a bit about the financial situation that Canadians find themselves in. This will be a wake-up call for Conservatives and Liberals who are continually clapping and patting each other on the back and talking about how economic good times have come.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important wake-up call. Since 1989 when the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement was put in place, and since this corporate tax cut agenda started with this inevitable drive to the bottom, most Canadians are poorer. It is unbelievable, but Statistics Canada tells us that two-thirds of Canadian families are earning less now than they were back in 1989.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened? When the Conservatives and the Liberals talk about these good times, who are they actually referring to? StatsCan also tells us what has actually happened. The wealthiest 20%, the wealthy elites that the Liberals and the Conservatives represent, and they are the parties of the elites, those two parties, same old, same old, the wealthy elites have actually seen their share of national income go up to 50%. The wealthy elites in this country now take half of the entire national income pie. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr. Peter Julian: </B> Mr. Speaker, if the Conservatives do not like hearing this, then it is about time that a little dose of Main Street came into the Bay Street party, the Conservative Party. The wealthy elites, that 20% of the corporate CEOs and corporate lawyers now have 75% of all the wealth in the country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887260"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is wrong with this picture? We have a Canadian income pie and half of it goes to the wealthy and we have the wealth pie of Canada and three-quarters of it goes to the wealthy. What has happened to the rest of Canadians?</div>

They will have to go back to another corporate lobbyist party to get those pats on the back that they love so much for their massive corporate tax cuts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened to the middle class? The average middle class family over that same period has lost a week's income each and every year since 1989. They are working 52-week years, but they are being paid now for 51 weeks. They are trying to make do with less. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in the lower middle class, the next income sector, have actually lost two weeks of income. Working class families, hard-working Canadian families have lost two weeks of income for each and every year since 1989.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the poorest? The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78359,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78359&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Victoria</A> referenced that earlier. They have lost a month and a half of income over this same period. They are working 12-month years, but they are only being paid for 10 and a half months now. There is no secret why we are now seeing hundreds of thousands of Canadians sleeping out on the streets and in the parks of our cities. What we have seen for the poorest of Canadians is that their income has basically fallen through the floor.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the economic reality the Liberals and the Conservatives have completely ignored over the last 20 years while they have been putting in place their massive corporate tax cut agenda. The only priority of the former Liberal government and the only priority of the current Conservative government is to cut corporate taxes. They have done that massively. I will come back to that in a moment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in this prebudget debate. We have now had two years of Conservatives acting like Liberals, as the Liberals acted like Conservatives.

What we are seeing in this prebudget debate are calls for more corporate tax cuts. </div>

Then the Conservatives say, “No, we will be faster. We will slash those corporate tax cuts. We will give the banks, big oil and big gas more money than they can imagine”. And the Liberals say, “No, we will do more”. This competition back and forth of who has the biggest corporate tax cut is clearly not in the interest of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about our health care system that is deteriorating? Many seniors and other people who have health difficulties can tell us about the longer and longer wait times because there has not been sufficient investment in our health care system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the homeless? The only money that has gone into housing in the past 15 years was from the NDP budget amendment that we forced on the Liberals. The Conservatives have tried to take credit for it. The Liberals have tried to take credit for it. The only injection in housing, and it was only a start, has come from the NDP budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the environment? What about the transportation deficit? The transportation and infrastructure deficit is estimated by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to be over $100 billion. What about that? </div>
    </p><a name="Para887272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the poor state of housing for our military personnel? There is substandard housing on military bases across the country. Our military personnel are being treated with contempt by the Conservative government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about returning veterans? They have come back from often traumatic situations in Afghanistan, and they have not been provided with mental health counselling or addiction support. It is absolutely appalling how the Conservatives will talk a good line about the military, but when push comes to shove, they prefer giving huge tax cuts to their corporate buddies rather than supporting adequate housing on military bases and adequate programs for returning veterans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about our police officers? What about our justice system? They were chronically underfunded under the Liberals. It has reached the point where they simply cannot prosecute and they simply cannot investigate to the same extent as if they were fully funded.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about citizenship and immigration concerns, a system that has completely broken down? What about women's shelters? What about the record levels of student debt?</div>
    </p><a name="Para887276"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the priorities that the government should be tackling. The Conservatives said they would be different from the Liberal government and they are exactly the same. They are concerned about one thing and one thing only: an appalling obsession with corporate tax cuts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887277"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the result been after two years of the Conservatives doing the same thing as the Liberals? The cumulative fiscal impact is about $190 billion, with the most recent corporate tax cuts going to banks, big oil and big gas companies. The cumulative effect of the fall economic statement is about $12 billion a year. Over six years we are talking about over $70 billion. We are talking about huge amounts of money being shovelled off the back of a truck to the corporate sector, when all of these crying and important needs are simply being ignored.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887278"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to Burnaby--New Westminster, what about some of the issues that people have raised, such as the issues of housing, and the issues of underfunding and health care that we see at the Royal Columbian Hospital and at Burnaby Hospital? What about funding for the World Police and Fire Games that was given to Quebec City and has been systematically refused by the Conservative government, even though it honours our police and fire personnel? What about funding for the renewal of Burnaby Lake? Again it was refused by the Liberals and refused by the Conservatives, even though they found money for Wascana Lake in Saskatchewan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887279"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about our citizenship and immigration centre that Burnaby city council has offered up essentially to the federal government for funding? What about addiction programs and supporting our police officers, the city of New Westminster Police and the Burnaby RCMP? What about those priorities? What about women's shelters? What about supporting the students that are going deeper and deeper in debt as the Conservatives shovel more and more money at their corporate CEO buddies?</div>
    </p><a name="Para887280"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most appalling thing is that the government does not prioritize these when it knows that the average corporate CEO earns more in the first seven hours of the year than the average Canadian worker earns in the entire year, even though hours of work have increased.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887281"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the priorities that the government should consider.</div>

This comes from a government that with the softwood lumber sellout, cost 10,000 jobs in the softwood sector and gave away $1 billion, absolutely the most appalling lack of financial acumen possible. The Americans took the government to the cleaners and it did nothing to support the softwood sector.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the manufacturing industries, we now know, thanks to the Conservatives, we are losing 200 jobs each and every day because of the government's complete inability to handle good, effective management of the economy. There is no balanced approach on the economy. All the Conservatives have is one note, and that is more corporate tax cuts to the banking sector and the oil and gas industry. Therefore, 200 Canadian families lose a breadwinner every day because the government is so appallingly incompetent.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to answer his other question, which he did not ask but which he should have. It is the whole question of competitive rates in corporate taxation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have lower corporate tax rates than the United States as the member well knows. The Liberals say that we should go even lower as do the Conservatives. The member might want to inform himself and read some of the studies, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, accounting firms that have studied the rate of corporate taxation. They say that the best level of competitiveness comes from the fact that Canada has a public health care system. That is a major competitive advantage vis-a-vis the U.S.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States a company has to pay those health charges through HMOs. In Canada they get a subsidy because our health care is covered through our taxation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By having a lower corporate tax rate and by not funding our public health care, the Conservatives are making our companies less competitive. This is what they do not understand because they are economic Flintstones. They simply have no concept of important and smart financial management. That is why, when the finance ministry analysed political parties, which one better manages finances of governments, both provincial and federal, the Conservatives were next to last. The only ones worse were the Liberals. The best financial managers were the New Democratic parties. Most of the time our governments balance the budget and we provide a balanced economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives are economic Flintstones. They have no concept of how to manage federal government funding, and it shows, oh does it shows. </div>

    </p><a name="Para887299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to rise and speak today with regard to the prebudget consultation. I will begin by taking a look at the past two budgets delivered by the Conservatives since they assumed office.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first budget delivered in 2006, entitled “Turning a New Leaf”, would have represented a grand opportunity for any government. The Conservatives inherited a $17 billion surplus from the previous Liberal government as well as optimal economic conditions that included the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to outside observers, many of whom admired Canada for being a progressive democracy, budget 2006 turned out to be a complete dud, mostly because it concentrated on ideology and a curious attempt by the Conservative Party to somehow reshape government in its own image.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887302"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Conservatives reversed the Liberal tax cuts, which cuts were for the lowest income Canadians. They increased the tax cut from 15% to 15.5% and then they tried to deceive Canadians by claiming somehow that it was a tax reduction. Talk about being duplicitous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing the government did in its 2006 budget was eliminate the national child care program. What did it replace it by? It replaced it with a baby bonus of $100 per month. What an insult. Not a single child care space was created and $10 billion went down the drain.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we quickly learned that turning a new leaf was a precursor to more drastic cuts in social programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887305"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within six months of assuming office, the Conservative Party announced that it was somehow necessary to slash a further $1 billion worth of spending. Some of these cuts included $18 million from illiteracy skills programs, $55 million from youth employment initiatives and $11 million from the first nations and Inuit tobacco control strategy.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said: Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to bring this motion forward, but I am also saddened by the reality that in this day and age I still have to stand up and fight for equality for women in our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887311"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, on October 18, the country celebrated Person's Day, a day recognizing the historic victory women won in Canada when they were declared persons under Canadian law. That was 1929. Almost 80 years later, women are still striving to achieve true equality with their male counterparts in society, in the workplace, in the household and even in Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equality is not a word to use lightly. Fundamentally for most Canadians, the word “equality” describes a set of values, more important, a vision that Canadians have fought hard for. A vision alone will not create equality. Hard work through research and advocacy is necessary and this is not yet changed. We may have de jure equality rights, but we need substantive equality in Canada. After all, using the word “equality” without adding any substance to the terms and conditions of the women's program is frankly a very deceptive and dangerous road to take.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of the politics behind the women's program is a very interesting one.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006 the Conservative government chose to ignore its own officials and removed the word “equality” from the terms and conditions of the women's program at Status of Women Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two years of concerns expressed by many across the country, including members of the Standing Committee on Status of Women and my caucus, I tabled this motion in November 2007 to bring the goal of equality back into the women's program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, without any fanfare, or notification or any press release or no notification to the committee, which originally highlighted this issue, the minister revised the wording of the home page of Status of Women Canada's website to include the word “equality”. The minister did not mention any change to the mandate in her opening remarks to the committee this past Tuesday. In fact, it was soon discovered that this change was meaningless as the funding guidelines for the women's program did not reflect this so-called changed position.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887317"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, after two media releases which highlighted this error, our office has just observed the magical changing of the mandate on the website of the women's program. We must be one effective opposition and that must be one desperate government. Nevertheless, women's groups and organizations are still being ignored because nothing has really changed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government ignored the valuable work that was being done by countless women's groups and organizations, which relied upon funding from Status of Women Canada to do research and advocacy. The government ignored the fact that the tireless work of these groups and organizations had an impact on women's rights in many ways. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, it was women's advocacy groups that helped bring about change, including the introduction of maternity benefits in the Unemployment Insurance Act in the seventies, family law legislation which would ensure economic justice for wives and improvements in child support guidelines and amendments to federal and provincial human rights and justice legislation to prohibit and prosecute acts of sexual harassment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887320"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government removed the word and the concept of equality from the funding guidelines of the women's program, it turned back the clock. Without any changes to the funding eligibility requirements, the word “equality” has little meaning for the groups and organizations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887321"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of maintaining the original mandate for the women's program and continuing the work that needs to be done to advance women's equality, the government closed 12 of 16 regional Status of Women offices across Canada. It totally eliminated the policy research fund, which supports policy research on gender equality issues, and it changed the rules of eligibility for funding. This is what matters most.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, while not for profit organizations across Canada have either closed or downsized because of the punitive measures taken by the Conservative government, these changes have paved the way for Canadian tax dollars to go right into the coffers of for profit organizations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887323"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, several of my colleagues on this side of the House revealed the incredible disparities that existed with pay equity and economic security for Canadian women. The disparities do not stop here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887324"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A federally commissioned report entitled “Equality for Women: Beyond the Illusion”, released in July 2006, reveals the following facts: girls are the victims of more than four out of five cases of sexual assault on minors; four out of five one parent families are headed by women; the employment income gap between male and female university graduates has widened; and women still only earn 71¢ for every $1 a man makes. The list goes on. We know the House has only one in five female members of Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of work does need to be done, and despite what the Conservative government would want us to think, we cannot do it alone. We need the knowledge, the dedication, the passion and the results that advocacy and research organizations provide. We need the grassroots.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735">(1735)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that these organizations are no longer eligible for the funding that they used to get for research and advocacy activities because of this unilateral change two years ago, how can these organizations contribute in the ways that they have in the past? How can we achieve the full participation of women in the economic, social, they said cultural, and political life of Canada without the work of these groups that research and advocate for equality? Equality is important.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now spend a few minutes focusing on what I believe are three critical areas where we need to achieve gender equality: economic, social and political. All three aspects are heavily intertwined. Economically, independent women are able to secure social rights for themselves and their children. Furthermore, those who fall behind economically and socially will not be able to find the time to be involved politically. Of course, as we see here, with a lack of political leadership, it will be that much harder to fight for economic and social rights for women.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On all three fronts, the Conservative government failed to address the incredible challenges that Canadian women face. For example, at every level of education women in Canada earn less than men. In 2003, women who were high school graduates earned 71% of what male high school graduates earned at full time work. Similarly, women with post-secondary degrees earned 68.9% of what their male counterparts earned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In female dominated professions such as teaching, nursing and clerical work, men still earned more on average and the majority of minimum wage workers in Canada are women. These statistics are even worse for women of a visible minority or of aboriginal descent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, women are finding it harder to keep up as the primary caregivers because of the rising costs of raising their children and finding the care for them that they need. Removing the word equality from the mandate of the women's program is one thing, but the government has also turned its back on Canadian women in other ways.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006, the government ignored the recommendations of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women which endorsed the changes to pay equity legislation as stated by the federal task force on pay equity. To top it off, the government chose to deliver child care through the mailbox and Canadian women are still waiting for the government to fulfill its promise of creating thousands more desperately needed child care spaces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no choice when there is no space and no spaces in Canada are being added by the government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are real issues of violence against women. In 2006, Canada had 553 shelters for women. These shelters admitted more than 100,000 women and dependent children than in previous years. Statistics Canada shows that three-quarters of these women were victims of abuse, 66% were feeling psychological abuse, 55% physical abuse, 41% threats, 37% financial abuse, 28% harassment, and 23% of these women were victims of sexual abuse.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were close to 5,000 solved homicides between 1994 and 2003, of which 38% were family related. Spousal homicides accounted for about 18% of all solved homicides and almost half of all family homicides. The point here is that women are much more likely than men to be killed by their spouse. The spousal homicide rate against females is five times higher than the rate for males. Too often women stay in physically and/or sexually abusive relationships. Those who do get out of these relationships have difficulty finding affordable housing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, 42% of renter families headed by single mothers had difficulty finding affordable housing. The government may say that it funds service programs, but in reality it is not really funding real change through the research of the advocacy that formally was fostered by the women's program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, removing the word equality is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this government's lack of action and disregard for Canadian women who need support the most. But it is indicative of its thought pattern. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006, the government cut the budget for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation by $45 million. In the same year it also announced a $200 million reduction in federal contributions over the previous year toward creating new affordable housing through signed agreements with the provinces and territories.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aboriginal women in Canada are also confronted by a number of challenges. The life expectancy of an aboriginal woman is 76.8 years versus 82 years for a non-aboriginal woman. Aboriginal women are more than three times more likely to report being victims of spousal violence than non-aboriginal women.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740">(1740)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, 24% of aboriginal women reported that they had been victims of spousal violence in the previous five years. Outside of the home in 2001, 17% of aboriginal women in the labour force were unemployed. For non-aboriginal women this was 7%. According to Statistics Canada in 2000, the median income of an aboriginal woman was $12,300, about $5,000 less than a non-aboriginal woman. And these women are also more likely than aboriginal men to be working low-paying jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of these statistics representing real people, the government refused to implement the Kelowna accord, an agreement with the first nations, Métis and Inuit communities across the country to improve their quality of life. These women are looking for leadership, yet when they look at the current Conservative government, they see very few women being put in leadership roles to enable them to play key roles in shaping our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006, the Conservative Party fielded the fewest women candidates, a meagre 10%. Out of the 26 current cabinet positions, only five of them are filled by women. Today, while women make up more than 50% of the nation's population, women only comprise 20% of the seats in this House. The United Nations has ranked us 30th in the world in terms of representation of women in Parliament, behind countries like Norway, Trinidad and Tobago and others. </div>

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we are working to have one-third of Liberal candidates in the next federal election be women. I would like to ask all Canadian women to look closely at the front benches of the government and ask themselves if this is the kind of leadership they want to fight for their rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister earlier this week repeatedly read her approved lines when asked at least five or six times by three opposition parties about the mandate of equality and the funding for the women's program. Despite words about equality, women are realizing, as I and my colleagues have, that the government is not serious about achieving real equality but rather using the word equality as a smokescreen for its inaction. What does the future hold for Canadian women as they continue to fight for equality with little help from this current government that does not believe in advocacy for equality? </div>
    </p><a name="Para887347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I am rising in this House to call upon the government to bring the goal of equality back into the terms and conditions of the women's program at Status of Women Canada. Of course, this would only be a starting point. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are asking the government to stop turning back the clock and start taking action. Canadians, especially Canadian women, want the government to listen, to understand and to act. That includes funding for advocacy and research.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, my colleague, the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78831,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78831&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Beaches—East York</A>, and I hosted a round table discussion in my riding of London West on issues that affect Canadian women. We listened to their ideas, their concerns, their struggles and their stories. They need affordable child care, it is that simple. The national child care and early learning program brought in by the previous Liberal government was the first step toward creating a comprehensive strategy that would leave no child behind. A 1984 Royal Commission on Equality and Employment stated that “child care is the ramp that provides equal access to the workforce for mothers.” </div>
    </p><a name="Para887350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian women deserve proactive pay equity legislation. Employers need to take action and ensure that all employees receive equal pay for work of equal value. But more recently, members of the Liberal Party women's caucus proposed several changes to current programs and legislation to deal with violence against women and housing affordability, among other issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our women's caucus supports providing increased federal funds dedicated to civil aid under Canada's social transfer to ensure that women have much needed access to legal representation in family law matters. Our women's caucus also recommends that the federal government develop a national public awareness campaign to highlight the problem of violence against women and what can be done to eliminate it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a national housing strategy that is inclusive of women developed by our women's caucus. Access to safe and affordable housing is a foundation upon which other economic and social outcomes depend. Low income women need affordable housing. It is for their well-being and the well-being of their dependant children. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon the government to follow our example, take the ideas, fight for the equality of women, put real equality back into the mandate of the women's program, its funding guidelines, and provide these women with the opportunity to stand on equal footing with male counterparts, economically, socially, politically.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887354"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand the Conservatives will continue to say that they have addressed women's equality issues. I guess changing a website on the day of my motion does it for them, but women know the difference in the mandate and funding guidelines of the women's program, how it used to be and how it can be. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887355"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask members to support this motion for real, meaningful equality, not just words.</div>

    </p><a name="Para887368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are important questions, questions I must say that the government takes very seriously. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887369"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the minister's presentation just last week to the standing committee, she was very clear about the fact that equality continued to be the objective of Status of Women Canada, in particular the women's program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887370"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the hon. member, why does she still believe that this is something that needs to change? Her motion supports doing something that in fact has already happened.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887371"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she is giving her response, I wonder if she could explain why it is that the advocacy component that she talked about is somehow equitable with equality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887372"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equality is there as the objective. Advocacy, as I see it, might be one of the tools, but the member will know that these programs go out to groups and none of the groups that she mentioned, groups that might have done advocacy in the past, are not restricted from applying for program funding under the women's program.</div>

They used to. We can produce services to individuals and we can help them with the problems that exist, some problem that currently exists.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot get over the hurdle. We cannot change the equality by just coping with the problem. We have to have some understanding of what is really happening, the ability of those organizations to do the research. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still some allowance for small amounts of research, but they cannot use it to advocate for change. It is sort of like the court challenges program. We cannot challenge and we cannot make it better. We are not talking about keeping status quo or helping someone out. Those are all programs that can be done through HRDC or Immigration Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887377"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real focus of this program was under past governments, but not the member's government. All the members on that side have watched and were silent since 2006 when this changed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887378"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came into my office this morning. I checked the website. It was the same with just a couple of words on the front pages, similar to what the minister had said the other day. She never referred to anything in her opening statement to the committee when she came to make her presentation on Tuesday. Members had to draw it out of her. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887379"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we do everything in secret? There have been real changes over the last two years. We cannot deny that the offices have closed, but it is the work of organizations that had to be more creative in trying to get funding. However, they are not allowed to advocate for equality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887380"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry but status quo is not acceptable. If we do not have champions, if we do not move for change, it does not happen. I am sorry, the government is failing in that regard.</div>

    </p><a name="Para887389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women's program fulfills its mandate by providing financial and professional assistance to organizations to carry out projects at the local, regional and national levels, in key areas such as women's economic status and violence against women and girls, within a framework of transparency and accountability.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday this week, the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78831,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78831&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Beaches—East York</A> issued a press release stating that the minister was misleading Canadians. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is the hon. member who has her facts wrong.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887391"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In committee, the hon. member asked the following question of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',111556,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=111556&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Canadian Heritage, Status of Women and Official Languages</A>, “Are you saying that you've now changed the policy and you've put the word “equality” back in the mandate? That's what I understood you to say”. And the minister responded, “Exactly”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887392"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is the hon. member who is misleading Parliament, women's groups and all Canadians, since the hon. member believes that “equality” means “lobby groups”. The hon. member should ask clear questions if she wants clear answers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887393"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that these hon. members are simply confused. It is important to remember that for many people—especially for women—the word “equality” has a lot of meaning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms and conditions of the women's program have changed to reflect the new mandate. We have updated the priorities and we have informed the public about it. Nonetheless, it is insulting for the hon. members opposite to harm organizations that are working very hard across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Equality” is defined as “the condition of being equal in quantity, magnitude, value, intensity”; it is “the condition of having equal rank with others”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the term “lobby group” does not appear anywhere in the definition. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government supports practical projects that make a clear difference in the lives of women and that promote equality for everyone. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887398"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for lobby groups calling for funding to lobby on behalf of a certain category of women and certain ideas, we continue to believe that it is not up to the government to fund or support one opinion more than another. Our government has always cared about equality for all its citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to recall that the women's program was created in 1973 as a result of a recommendation regarding equality presented by the Royal Commission on the Status of Women. In its report released in 1970, the royal commission recommended implementing a federal mechanism that would support the efforts being made to improve the status of women in Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his message to Canadians on December 6, 2007, on the occasion of the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> said: “We believe fundamentally in the equality of men and women”. The words of our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> are a source of inspiration. They convey this government's sincere commitment to two profoundly Canadian values: equality and justice for all—values that are firmly entrenched in our history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887401"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including the word “equality” in the mandate of the women's program of Status of Women Canada is a reflection of our remarkable achievements in this area. Our government increased the women's program budget to $20 million, an increase of 76%, which is the most significant increase it has ever received. Current funding for the women's program is the highest it has ever been.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1755"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755">(1755)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887402"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, our government is committed to improving the status of women, their families and their communities across the country. The work we have done to improve the women's program reflects that commitment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887403"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also partnering with federal departments and agencies, civil society and other levels of government to eliminate the systemic barriers to women's participation in the economic, social and democratic life of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887404"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',111556,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=111556&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Canadian Heritage, Status of Women and Official Languages</A> announced $8 million in funding for 60 projects that will be carried out across Canada under the women's program of Status of Women Canada. These projects were submitted in response to the first call for proposals issued in June.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887405"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 260,000 women and girls will benefit from these projects, which are aimed at eliminating the barriers they face, providing them with information about preventing violence, helping them improve their financial knowledge and encouraging them to create peer support networks. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887406"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second call for proposals was issued by the Women's Community Fund in November 2007. By the December 21 closing date, the fund had received 342 applications, a 30% increase over the first call.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887407"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these proposals are for projects intended to promote women's economic security and prosperity and their health and personal safety and to put an end to all forms of discrimination and violence against women. All the projects are expected to help improve the status of women in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887408"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months, the government has made a number of changes to the women's program to make it run more efficiently. For example, this year, for the first time, applications can be submitted online, and numerous sessions have been held across Canada to train potential applicants. In addition, teleconferences have been used to reach rural and isolated communities. Questions and answers have been posted online, as well as application and proposal forms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887409"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By including the word “equality” in the mandate of the women's program of Status of Women Canada, the Government of Canada is demonstrating its commitment to full equality for all Canadians, which is not yet a reality, despite the tremendous progress we have made. Including the word “equality” in the mandate of the women's program can only be good news for Canada as a whole and for Canadians in all their diversity.</div>

I am surprised that they can claim to not agree with providing support for defending rights and claim to want to achieve equality for women. How can we achieve equality for women, men, children or human beings if we are not open to discussions and debates on our ideas and opinions? How can we achieve equality under those circumstances? It is not possible because equality comes only after long discussions on ideas and opinions. I found it quite amusing that she said the government does not provide support for defending rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887411"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should not come as a surprise, from a party that firmly believes in equality among nations, from a party that firmly believes in the emancipation of peoples, from a party that firmly believes in democracy, that the Bloc Québécois will support the motion we are debating this evening.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887412"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the Conservatives say, there is not equality among men and women. We just need to look at this House, which is under-represented by women, and at what little consideration the members of the minority government have for more than 50% of the population, to understand how much further we have to go. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, this government does a disservice to women. It hurts the cause of equality and it is imperative that we limit its actions as much as possible so that it does no further damage, hence the pertinence of this motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that it does a disservice to women and I said that the Conservatives are hurting the cause of equality and these are not insults or rants made lightly. You can rest assured that much stronger words come to mind when I think of what they have done to the status of women. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2006 this government eliminated the court challenges program. At the time, the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action was concerned that eliminating the program would slow down women's progress towards true equality. It said, “This program has provided Canadian women with their only access to the use of their constitutional equality rights.” </div>
    </p><a name="Para887416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, this government's fallacious argument was that it made good laws and it would not pay lawyers to challenge them. The decision to abolish the court challenges program did a disservice to women.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887417"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, the Conservatives slashed the women's program to prevent human rights groups from gaining access to it. They muzzled women not just once but twice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887418"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World March of Women is an international feminist movement that brings together groups and organizations working to eliminate the causes of poverty and violence against women. They fight all forms of inequality and discrimination affecting women. Their actions are based on 21 demands falling under four broad themes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887419"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is establishing programs to eliminate poverty and violence against women.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about violence against women. This law and order government boasts backwards and forwards that it has improved the security of women. If we tell them that they have done nothing for women, they reply, “security”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887421"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that how women want violence against women to be eliminated. More tasers for the police, perhaps? We shall see.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887422"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are demanding a comprehensive 10-year education and awareness campaign, managed by feminist groups and funded by the government, to eliminate violence against women; immediate and free access, for all women victims of violence, to resources providing assistance as well as to prevention, awareness and advocacy services; better financial support for women's shelters for victims of violence in aboriginal communities; access to operational funds for women's groups from cultural communities and visible minorities, enabling them to meet their needs and participate in Quebec society; better access to education for all women, particularly single mothers and women with no personal income; universal access to French courses, along with adequate allowances and access to childcare, without any exclusion based on immigrant status or years of residency in Quebec; a major social housing initiative, with 8,000 units of low-income, cooperative and non-profit housing per year. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805">(1805)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887423"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not at all like the Conservatives' reactionary thinking. This is about awareness and education. This is about minimizing isolation and poverty and improving quality of life for women.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887424"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the second theme, redistribution of wealth in order to improve the living conditions of women, things are not good. The Conservatives do not care about redistribution of wealth, and they do not care about the demands of the World March of Women. Women want progressive taxation of businesses and individuals based on the principles of justice, equity and redistribution of wealth. We do not have that. They also want a universal family allowance program with a supplementary allowance for poor families based on children's real needs. We do not have that either. One thousand dollars a year is not much help to many people.The Conservative government is not interested in these demands, particularly not if rich oil companies think they are a bad idea. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I do not have time to elaborate on the other two themes—elimination of discrimination against all women and legislation to ensure the respect of women's rights. However, it is clear that the government is not particularly concerned about these demands. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887426"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help achieve the goals of the International March of Women—and I assure the House that I trimmed the list in order to bring to light those that pertain exclusively to the provinces and Quebec—it is vital to have the support of women's rights and lobby groups, such as the Fédération des femmes du Québec, the National Association of Women and the Law, the Canadian Feminist Alliance and other feminist lobby groups that have watched this government's support disappear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is in fact harmful to women and is making it very difficult to achieve equality between men and women. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last December several major unions, disgusted with this government, took a preemptive strike by providing financial support to women's organizations “that have been punished under the Conservative government’s anti-equality agenda”. The announcement made by the unions coincided with the 26th anniversary of Canada's ratification of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Furthermore, John Gordon, president of the Public Service Alliance of Canada, stated:</div>

    </p><a name="Para887431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion calls on the government to restore equality for women, by setting that as an objective of the women's program of Status of Women Canada. The motion also should have called on it to restore the eligibility criteria for women's rights groups and lobby groups, but we all know that, for those who care about equality, the only way to advance the cause of women is to send this government back to the opposition benches, where its yearning to fight wars, restrict the right to abortion and bring back the death penalty will no longer be a danger to us all.</div>

While I absolutely agree with the motion, it needs to be more specific, because like everything else with the Conservative government, Canadians, and certainly women, cannot trust the Conservatives. They manipulate things. They turn and twist things. We need to be very careful as we respond.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887435"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been stated, Status of Women Canada has carefully and very recently reinserted the word “equality” on the website. However, it is only a word. The work, the raison d'être, of the mandate should encompass more than just a word. It must include the essential work: the research, lobbying and advocacy done by women's organizations across the country. That, of course, is what is really at stake. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is systematically dismantling the gender equality mechanisms that women in Canada fought hard to establish. The government cannot be trusted. It is failing ordinary women in Canada and it is stalling women's equality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887437"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has already de-funded and disastrously altered Status of Women Canada. It has cancelled the court challenges program. It has refused to sign onto international agreements that would advance women's equality in Canada. As well, it has failed to implement recommendations from the pay equity task force and the expert panel on accountability mechanisms for gender equality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing from hundreds of witnesses, the House of Commons Standing Committee on the Status of Women conducted a study on the impact of recent funding changes to the programs at Status of Women Canada. That committee made five key recommendations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887439"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first recommendation is that Status of Women Canada reverse its decision to close the 12 regional offices of Status of Women Canada. The second is that the department maintain its policy research fund to fund independent policy research. The third is that Status of Women reinstate the goal of equality in the mandate of the women's program. The fourth is that Status of Women must also remove limitations on funding for research and advocacy activities in the revised terms and conditions of the women's program. The fifth is that SWC provide funding through the women's program and that it be made available to non-profit organizations as well as for profit organizations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the word equality is bandied about by the government, real equality has been removed from the core of the women's program. By changing the requirements for funding under Status of Women, groups that do research and advocate changes to public policy to promote women's equality will no longer be eligible for federal funding. The objective of women's organizations is to advocate on behalf of women, and this restriction will silence the heart of the women's movement. One has to wonder if that has not been the goal: to silence the women of this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887441"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very concerned that for profit organizations are now eligible for funding from the women's program. Generating funding proposals is very difficult. It is very time consuming, especially for not for profit organizations, which have very tight budgets and very few people to do the important work. It is even more difficult with the now defunct regional offices, with 12 of 16 gone. For profit groups have the means to hire experts in preparing funding applications, while the non-profit groups struggle just to stay open, just to stay alive. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887442"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative cuts to the operating budget of Status of Women Canada and the closure of those 12 of 16 offices across the country is a major setback for women's equality. The government eliminated nearly half of the Status of Women's staff responsible for the advancement of women's rights and 40% of the operating budget for SWC.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the closure of the offices at Status of Women Canada, the government also cancelled the research policy fund, which supported independent, nationally relevant, forward thinking policy research on gender equality issues. This fund supported research that identified policy gaps, trends and emerging issues.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815">(1815)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887444"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am afraid the department will not be able to produce the same calibre and diversity of research. What on earth will we do without all that input? How will we make good policy in this country?</div>
    </p><a name="Para887445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these recommendations made by the committee on the Status of Women, New Democrats believe Canada needs an independent Status of Women department, with full funding and its own minister. An effective Status of Women department must be able to research, monitor and advocate for women's rights and support women's groups because they are promoting gender equality. We need them there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the government has cut women's equality at the program, policy and research level, it has also cut women's access to equality at the judicial level by cancelling the court challenges program. This small program provided the most vulnerable Canadians with the ability to access equality under our Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the cancellation of the program was an ideological decision, not a fiscal decision. It is part of the plan to systematically dismantle gender equality mechanisms in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internationally, the government has failed to provide leadership on gender equality. Domestically, it has failed to provide leadership. When compared to other countries, Canada is underperforming. The 2007 global gender gap report by the World Economic Forum places Canada 18th, behind Sri Lanka, the Philippines and most European countries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887449"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has failed aboriginal women in Canada by refusing to sign on to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887450"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president of the Native Women's Association, Beverley Jacobs, states:</div>

</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para887452"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has also failed to live up to its commitments under the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women by not implementing any of the 23 recommendations from the CEDAW committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887453"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a national level, the government has also failed to provide leadership on gender equality by refusing to implement the recommendations from the 2004 pay equity task force and the 2005 expert panel on accountability mechanisms. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887454"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the government has and will continue to systematically dismantle gender equality mechanisms unless we are prepared to fight back, and I can assure the House that the women of this country are prepared to fight back.</div>

The other comment she made was that the Conservatives would not fund one opinion over another. The last time I looked, I thought that women's rights were human rights and not subject to opinion. They are not a matter of opinion; they are a matter of fact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will present a scenario. Two years ago, the Conservative government removed equality from the Status of Women program and shut down 12 of 16 offices.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two years of aggressive lobbying from all opposition parties in the House of Commons, all provincial Status of Women ministers across this country, all women's organizations in the country and after advocacy organizations, like Women and the Law, were forced to shut their doors, and after they shut down the women's rights and then the voices of women in this country, the Conservatives came out with the word again and put it somewhere. Why? Because we are coming to an election soon, after all, and the Conservatives want to be perceived as moderate. They are trying to fool women.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday they put the word “equality” in the cover page and not actually in the program mandate. Because my colleague and I issued a press release and were pretty aggressive on that, today we have a different version. The Conservatives have now put “equality” in the program mandate but the criteria for the funding with respect to research and advocacy on behalf of women is still not there. They are still not eligible for funding and regional offices are still shut down.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows real contempt for Canadian women on the part of the Conservative government in my view. The Conservatives are playing a shell game with the women of this country, because at the core of the Conservatives they really do not believe in women's equality. I do not believe so after what I have seen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the projects funded may help the individual woman who is lucky enough to access some of those programs the Conservatives are funding that deal with their specific problem individually, whether it be access to training or something else, but it will not change the conditions, the policies and the environmental culture that caused that problem in the first place. It will most certainly not help the thousands of Canadian women who are affected by the systemic barriers to services or the law. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, women in this country cannot access civil law because legal aid funds do not cover that and yet their spouse, who may have assaulted them, can access legal aid assistance under the Criminal Code, while the woman cannot access it because it is civil. That is pretty sad.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the kinds of injustices for which those organizations work and fight. It is the research on policies and laws that discriminate against women that was done by women's organizations and then their lobby that really gave women their voice, which then resulted in changes by government, things like changing the assault of women. Police never charged the person who assaulted when they went to a home. The woman had to charge the person. Now it is the police who must charge the person who assaults. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parental leave, rape shield law, property rights at time of divorce, all of these things were done because women had voices through organizations that did research and then helped them to lobby for those things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives are playing, as I said, a disgusting shell game because of a possible election coming up. They do not truly believe in any of this. Otherwise this would not be happening at the eleventh hour and they would have done it properly and made the proper changes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is that the Conservatives initially took out the word “political”. Now they have inserted another word that says “democratic”. However, it means very little. It is attached to nothing. Women's organizations will still remain shut down. Advocacy on their behalf will remain shut down as well. Pay equity will still remain a dream for women. The United Nations recommendations to give women more equal rights will still not be a reality and will not mean anything.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1825"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1825"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1825">(1825)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been told that the government cannot fund women's organizations that lobby and yet it can give $500,000 to the Canadian Conference of Defence Associations, which is a lobby organization for defence contracts. We cannot give money to women's organizations to lobby for women's rights in this country. How sad is that? </div>
    </p><a name="Para887467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has made women voiceless, just like it has done with its backbench members who cannot say anything. Women in Canada are not allowed to be advocates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the government really think Canadian women are stupid? The minister should be ashamed of herself and either show respect for Canadian women or resign. It is quite obvious she has absolutely no influence over the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> in this area of policy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of all this, the Conservatives have shut down the court challenges program, which allowed women to challenge government laws on policies that assisted women to attain their rights. This was a very valuable tool for women and it remains shut down. This again shows to me that this work means nothing, otherwise the government would have reinstated the court challenges program which gave women the strength and power to access their rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless people have money in this country, they cannot access their charter rights. The government has left it up to only those men or women who have money. No one else can access their charter rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equality is not a word that should be thrown around lightly without substance behind it. Many people are struggling all over the world to fight for their equality and many are dying for it. We in this House have been talking about Afghanistan. Our soldiers have given their lives in Afghanistan to assist women, in part, to regain their rights in Afghanistan and yet the government turns around and plays charades in its shameful games with Canadian women's rights, human rights. I find that appalling and embarrassing as a Canadian. I cannot believe that the Conservatives would do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are lucky to live in a country that prides itself on multiculturalism, compassion and goodwill toward one another but we are not perfect. We have a history of issues and problems in areas marked with violence. We are learning from that but we have a great deal more to learn. We should be condemned for the way we treat women and for the way we treat our aboriginal women in particular.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a time when we should be moving forward and correcting these past wrongs, what does the government do? First, it cancels good programs and then, because it thinks it will go to the electorate and the polls indicate that women may not vote for the Conservatives, they put a word back in that means absolutely nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By eliminating the early learning and child care agreements that we had established across this country, by eliminating the Kelowna accord, a real plan to help eradicate poverty among first nations communities and by closing 12 out of 16 Status of Women offices across this country, the government is telling women too bad, so sad. The Conservatives claim it is not their problem if women do not have child care and cannot go to work. They are saying that they should stay on welfare. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met with rural women this summer and their major problem is that they do not have access to government services in their region. Many of them do not have access to computers, transportation and many other services. The government is telling these women to figure out a way to look after the problem themselves because it is not its problem. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sad day in our country. Canada has shown the way around the world in many different ways through our international development agency, as I know from my time there. We have advocated for women's equality. We are ensuring that other governments in the world, like South Africa, have women's equality in its constitution. Africa actually has a champion for all women's policies. We have been aggressive and strong around the world, and then we do not even do it in our own home. It is a disgrace.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said: Mr. Speaker, first I would like to thank the Speaker for agreeing to my request earlier today to have this emergency debate tonight. I think it is very important that we have members here tonight and that we focus on this most urgent issue, not only in my community in east Vancouver and specifically in the downtown eastside but I hope that it will illuminate and draw attention and visibility to the plight of aboriginal people across the country, those who are infected by HIV-AIDS, those who are living in poverty, those who are living in the cities but also those aboriginal people who are still on reserve.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a deeply concerning issue. It is something that I face and deal with in my community every single day. When I see the devastation of people and the housing that they live in or people who are homeless on the street, when I see the soaring rates of infection for HIV-AIDS, I have to ask myself, why in a country as wealthy as Canada, why in a country that has all of the human capacity, all of the resources at its disposal, do we have an infection rate that is parallel and in some places exceeds what we see in the developing world? </div>
    </p><a name="Para887486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we have such terrible poverty among aboriginal people? Why do we see people who face the grind of daily poverty, who face a lack of access to health care? </div>
    </p><a name="Para887487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78928,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78928&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this emergency debate tonight will cause us to reflect and think, but most important, to propel the government to take action to resolve this crisis not only in my community but across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was new research done by Evan Wood, who is a research scientist at the B.C. Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS. He produced some alarming results based on a four year study. It shows that the HIV infection rate for aboriginal people in the downtown eastside is twice as high as that for non-aboriginal people. I would point out that already in this community that is so under stress, the HIV infection rate is much higher than in the general population.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research is very disturbing, but it is not new. This particular report is new but there has been lots of research that has taken place. For example, the Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network tells us in a release put out today that HIV-AIDS continues to be a serious health concern for all aboriginal communities, but the rise of HIV rates among aboriginal people is most apparent in Canada's inner cities where an increasing proportion of aboriginal people now live. We know from the recent statistics from Statistics Canada that there is a much greater emphasis now of aboriginal people in the urban environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken Clement, who is the president of CAAN, points out, “Many of our people do not have access to trauma care and treatment. We consider colonization, loss of land and territory, loss of language and the residential school system all social determinants of health impacting the epidemic amongst our people”. That is something that I see every day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Vancouver website points out that the life expectancy for aboriginal people in our city is 9 to 13 years less than the average population. Daily, the Vancouver Native Health Clinic on East Hastings Street, a wonderful place, deals with a tidal wave of people who need support and help and it barely has the resources to keep going. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. David Tu, the clinic coordinator, says, “once infected, aboriginal people are only half as likely as non-aboriginal people to start HIV treatment and are twice as likely to die of HIV compared to non-aboriginal HIV positive people in this same neighbourhood”. Remember that this is a community where already the HIV rate is practically off the books. He says, “This speaks to the failure of the medical system to effectively engage urban aboriginal peoples in the system of care and prevention”.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1835"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1835"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1835">(1835)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He goes on to say that the history of racism, the history of discrimination toward aboriginal people in the health care system is something that we have to overcome and we have to do that in mainstream society. Again, the West Coast Aboriginal Harm Reduction Society, WAHRS, which is a great grassroots organization of people who are injection drug users and who are living with HIV-AIDS and hepatitis C, tells us that its street outreach HIV prevention program had its federal funding cut a year ago.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887495"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same group also had the funding cut for hospital visits that helped people when they were finally in treatment and they were actually getting some help. This program was making sure that people were completing that treatment and yet that funding, peanuts, was cut for that program. The funding is so low that the group may not be able to continue after this year. That is another group that has been struggling to survive and it is coping with a very large demand.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887496"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot talk about this issue without also relating it to the underlying issues. Those are issues of racism and colonization, but it is also about the growing gap between wealth and poverty in our society. It is about the issue of aboriginal people who are being left to die, aboriginal people who are being left without the support and care that they need.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887497"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we know that according to a recent Pivot report, of all the people who self-identified as being homeless in their affidavits, 28% were aboriginal, even though aboriginal people only represent 1.8% of the general population in greater Vancouver.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887498"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same report found that aboriginal people make up 30% of the total homeless population in Vancouver. It also found that of the 70% in the report who identified as aboriginal in the GVRD, they identified as street homeless. That means they had no physical shelter, that they sleep on the street or in doorways, parkades, underpasses and parks, compared to 57% of the non-aboriginal homeless population.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887499"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Vancouver just in the last year, we have seen the loss of 560 low income housing units. Not all of them were in the downtown east side, but the vast majority of them were. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years between 2003 and 2005 we saw the loss of another 400 units. We know that a single employable person gets to live on $600 a month, yet by the federal government's own market basket measure, it costs about $1,300 a month to live in our expensive city. We can see the incredible disparity between people who are being left behind and people who have no resources and are very vulnerable and at great risk. We now have about 2,000 people in Vancouver who are homeless.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the United Nations has drawn attention to this great issue. In his report, the UN rapporteur calls on the federal government to bring in a comprehensive national housing strategy that focuses its attention on aboriginal people in particular.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same rapporteur in his October 2007 report called on the federal government to commit funding and resources for a targeted national aboriginal housing strategy. Where is it? Where is the housing for the people who need it in my community and in other communities? The government cannot even get the statistics right. The same UN rapporteur said that the government should work with other organizations to develop proper statistics and indicators for homelessness and housing insecurity. What an outrage that we do not even know what the full picture is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to say that despite this alarming health crisis and despite the seriousness of the situation and the lives that have been lost and injection drug users who are now infected and living in poverty, still there is a great sense of community spirit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For three years I have been trying to get support for the native youth centre in my riding. The federal government has not yet committed to the project.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I demand of the government that it get its priorities right and that it pay attention to the people who are most at risk in my community and other communities. We have billions of dollars in the federal surplus. Why is it not going to help these people?</div>

I had hoped that the debate tonight would be one where the members of the House would put their best foot forward and do the right thing, but here we have a Liberal member who is just coming out with the Liberals' little message book. They want to attack the NDP.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the record be clear. The NDP supported the Kelowna accord. We have always supported resources, programs, funding and assistance to aboriginal people in this country. In fact, we have been the outspoken critics both of the current government and the former government that had an appalling track record.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did we have to wait for 13 years to get to the Kelowna accord? Maybe the member would like to tell us that. It was the people of Canada who defeated his government, not the NDP.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it be clear that the NDP supported the Kelowna accord as we have supported all programs for aboriginal people. Shame on those members who are already turning this into another partisan debate instead of standing here and focusing on what are we going to do today, now, to help people who are dying in my community and in other communities because Parliament has not had the will to act.</div>

If we want to back and look at the reasons, we are looking at a terrible history of colonization of aboriginal people. We are looking at a residential school system and even today redress and healing from that terrible chapter in Canadian history has not yet happened. We can look at the last two years of the Conservative government, we can look at the 13 years prior to that of the Liberal government, we can look at years before that. It is a failure.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report goes on to talk about the shocking incidence of incarceration of aboriginal people in Canada. It says that more than 20% of the incarcerated population is aboriginal. Yet the aboriginal population is only 3% of the overall Canadian population as a whole.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I talk a bit more about the problems, I want to point out there are some very successful culturally appropriate interventions in Canada, and I will mention one. It is the Nine Circles in Winnipeg. This client centred approach to HIV-AIDS patients talks about the fact that it wants to improve quality of life for those living with and affected by HIV-AIDS. It goes on to talk about the culturally appropriate services, which include elder support, cultural ceremonies and continued connection spiritually, mentally, emotionally and physically. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those culturally appropriate services are extremely important. As the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A> rightly pointed out, part of the legacy that many first nations are facing is the legacy of residential schools, which has meant that the cultural underpinnings in many communities have been disrupted and fractured and many people end up in situations where they just simply do not have the resources in their cultural and community supports.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887530"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things we know is true is that accessibility, particularly in rural and remote communities and certainly in inner cities, is difficult. A project called the Cedar Project looked at HIV-AIDS infections in aboriginal populations in both Prince George and Vancouver. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887531"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the elders, who was interviewed in that project, talked about the fact that what happened in many of the rural and remote communities, because of lack of economic opportunities, was the youth gravitated to major centres like Vancouver and ended up in the Vancouver East side or in Prince George. Because there are no cultural supports or services there for them, the youth end up in a lifestyle that sometimes has them contracting HIV-AIDS.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887532"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sad comment is these young people go home in many cases to die. In the report from the Cedar Project, the elder said that it reminded her of how the salmon returned to their spawning beds to die. That is the harsh reality of what is happening in British Columbia and throughout Canada. Many of these young people return to their rural and remote communities. They are sick, sometimes they infect other people in their communities and sometimes they die. What a tragedy that is for the communities and family members. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887533"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the House will move beyond partisan rhetoric to talk about what a loss it is for those communities, what a tragedy it is for the young men and women who simply do not get to live the life that most of us would expect.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, when we talk about HIV-AIDS it does not just stop there. The Lung Association of Canada has some statistics on this. It talks about the fact that worldwide the majority of AIDS patients die of tuberculosis. What happens is the immune system is depressed and then people contract these other opportunistic infections. One of its statistics says that first nations, Inuit and Métis people have a tuberculosis rate 30 times higher than the rate of other people born in Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much more in this report, but I want to give a couple of numbers. In its latest report the CTC noted that the TB rate in aboriginal communities was rising. In 2003 it was 22 per 100,000 and in 2005 it was 27 per 100,000. In 1999 these rates were four times the national average and about as much as 20 times the rates of non-aboriginals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further on in the report, it talked about the fact that a lot of the contributing factors to tuberculosis and HIV-AIDS infection was poverty. It is a stark reality that many first nations, Inuit and Métis people do not have access to adequate housing, to adequate drinking water, to education and they certainly do not have access, with that kind of background, to sufficient economic opportunities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887541"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para887544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not simply a Vancouver East problem. What we have seen again in report after report is that the rate of poverty in first nations, Métis and Inuit communities puts many of these communities in third world conditions. We also know there is something called the social determinants of health. The Lung Association of Canada, and I want to thank it for the good work on this, lists a number of social determinants of health which include the kinds of things we are talking about, housing, income, access to good jobs. All these factors affect the health of people.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assembly of First Nations has a campaign on eradicating first nations poverty. It talks about the utter poverty in many first nations communities.

It talks about adequate screening for people who have HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. It talks about a very important harm reduction strategy. It talks about healthy sexuality.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell members that our government is very concerned about the damage and pain drugs cause families. We take this issue very seriously.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will provide them with the plain truth on the harms of illicit drug use. There are no safe amounts. There are no safe drugs.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the House that in our fight against problems associated with illicit drug use, where the greatest risk is contracting HIV-AIDS, we are paying particular attention to vulnerable populations, and especially to treatment for injection drug users in the Downtown Eastside.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken to the mayor of Vancouver on many occasions and my officials are actively engaged with both the province of British Columbia and the city of Vancouver to ensure that the national anti-drug strategy will improve the treatment services available and coordinate efforts for other services, such as counselling, housing and other public health initiatives.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked my colleague, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78954,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78954&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Parliamentary Secretary for Health</A>, to address the specific issues relating to HIV-AIDS and Canada's aboriginal population. However, before I yield the floor to my esteemed colleague, it is necessary to emphasize that this government has also been front and centre in the fight against HIV-AIDS, both here at home and internationally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, from the time we took office, our government has been committed to a comprehensive long term approach to HIV-AIDS in Canada and indeed throughout the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government believes that it is important to strike the right balance among the initiatives and approaches we support in the fight against HIV and AIDS. To this end, significant financial support is being provided to community programs, laboratory research to improve diagnosis and treatment, and public awareness campaigns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also strongly believe in the fundamental importance of vaccine research that will one day lead to preventing HIV infection for future generations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, the Government of Canada will invest more than $84 million toward HIV-AIDS in 2008-09, more than has ever been spent in our nation's history. These investments will support both the federal initiative to address HIV-AIDS in Canada and the Canadian HIV vaccine initiative, investments that will continue to grow over time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me speak about the federal initiative to address HIV-AIDS in Canada. This initiative represents a comprehensive and integrated Government of Canada response to the HIV-AIDS epidemic here in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goals of this federal initiative are to prevent the acquisition and transmission of new infections, to slow the progression of this disease and improve quality of life, to reduce the social and economic impact of HIV-AIDS, and to contribute to the global effort to reduce the spread of HIV and mitigate the impact of this disease.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worldwide, an estimated 4.3 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2006. This provides further evidence, if further evidence is necessary, that HIV-AIDS is a disease that knows no boundaries: geographic, socio-economic, gender, age or otherwise. Although the epidemic is most entrenched among vulnerable populations, it also reaches into the most privileged groups in society.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1910"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1910"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1915"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1905"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1910">(1910)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para887584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worldwide in 2006, those between 15 and 24 accounted for 40% of new infections. An unprecedented number of adult women are currently living with HIV. According to the World Health Organization, AIDS is one of the main causes of death in children under five.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para887585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIV-AIDS related stigma and discrimination still persist in Canada and continue to fuel the domestic epidemic. As is the case in other parts of the world, populations at risk of HIV infection in Canada include the most vulnerable groups in society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men who have sex with men are the group most affected by the epidemic, accounting for 51% of the estimated 58,000 individuals living with HIV infections in Canada at the end of 2005. People who use injecting drugs comprised a further 17% of the total, and women represented 20% of individuals living with HIV. Aboriginal persons account for a disproportionately high percentage of the individuals living with HIV infections in Canada. Similarly, people from countries where HIV is endemic also represent a disproportionate number of these infections.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the Government of Canada has committed, through our federal initiative to address HIV-AIDS in Canada, to develop discrete approaches to addressing the HIV-AIDS epidemic for these target populations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dare say these population specific approaches result in evidence based, culturally appropriate responses that are better able to address the realities that contribute to infection and poor health outcomes for the target groups. Population specific approaches also allow people at risk of infection and those living with HIV and AIDS to directly shape policies and programs that affect them.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para887589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is confident that focusing on the most at-risk populations will be the best way to fight HIV-AIDS. </div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para887590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important initiative I mentioned at the outset is the Canadian HIV vaccine initiative. This is an agreement between the Government of Canada and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. It represents an historic step forward--and I stress that word historic--in offering hope that one day we will have a safe, effective, affordable and accessible HIV vaccine for everyone who needs it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian HIV vaccine initiative builds on the Government of Canada's long term commitment to a comprehensive approach to fight HIV-AIDS globally and domestically, including the development of new HIV prevention technologies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vaccine initiative represents a whole-of-government approach involving the Canadian International Development Agency, the Public Health Agency of Canada, Industry Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and of course Health Canada. As this initiative unfolds, partnerships with researchers, non-profits, the private sector and other stakeholders will be sought both here in Canada and internationally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dare say this initiative is an inclusive, global collaboration involving developed and developing countries and public and private sectors, such as researchers, NGOs, private companies and governments, to accelerate the development of a safe, effective, affordable and globally accessible HIV vaccine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vaccine initiative is also strategically aligned to complement the existing international efforts to develop an HIV vaccine, such as the global HIV vaccine enterprise's strategic plan and the international AIDS vaccine initiative, to name just a couple.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing countries are of course most impacted by the burden of the HIV-AIDS pandemic. Therefore, ensuring that these countries' needs are met is at the core of this initiative.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para887596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian HIV Vaccine Initiative will receive $111 million over five years from the Government of Canada and $28 million from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. </div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para887597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funding is made up of new resources totalling $85 million and a redirection of existing HIV-AIDS resources that amounts to $26 million. The Gates foundation is contributing one dollar for every three new dollars the government puts toward the initiative. Specifically, this initiative will focus on six key areas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first area is discovery and social research. Through this component, support will be provided to HIV vaccine discovery and social research, while strengthening the capacity and promoting greater involvement and collaboration among researchers in Canada and low- and middle-income countries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area is clinical trial capacity building and networks. Support will be given to researchers and research institutions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, which will strengthen their capacity to conduct high quality clinical trials of HIV vaccines and other related prevention technologies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is pilot scale manufacturing capacity for clinical trial lots. The proposed manufacturing facility will increase the global capacity to produce HIV vaccine candidates for use in clinical trials. These trials will be conducted mostly in and for the benefit of low- and middle-income countries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth area is policy and regulatory issues. This component will improve the regulatory capacity in low- and middle-income countries, particularly those where clinical trials are planned or ongoing, and will address policy issues that will ultimately promote global access to HIV vaccines.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth area is community and social dimensions. The vaccine initiative will support the development and strengthening of community, legal, ethical and human rights frameworks for HIV vaccines in Canada and in low- and middle-income countries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the sixth area is planning, coordination and evaluation. The vaccine initiative will coordinate its activities with Canadian and international HIV vaccine research and development partners to ensure that the Canadian contribution to the global HIV vaccine enterprise is the most effective.</div>

    </p><a name="Para887611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recollect that the Gates foundation had suggested that countries that participated should not remove funds from their national and local communities in order to participate.

    </p><a name="Para887612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we talk about extensive funding, I would like to ask the minister, looking at the debate tonight with a huge cohort of people in this country who in increasing numbers of HIV infection and who are dying in large numbers, how does the minister feel in his conscience that he could take away from the Canadian effort to give to the Bill Gates effort and not just put new money, which is what he should have done in the first place?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be safe to say that the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation initiative is one where we have various pots of funding, some of it from our current funding, but also some that is new dollars that were not allocated by previous governments on this file.

    </p><a name="Para887615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe in my heart of hearts perhaps that we need a balanced approach.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some cuts that we have been trying to manage with the AIDS communities that were a result of the final Liberal budget of 2005 that were mandated by Parliament and, therefore, my ability to deal with them is somewhat constrained. However, in terms of our government, we have not done so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the harm reduction issue because it is important, too. I want to say to the hon. member that harm reduction is part and parcel of our policy. Treatment is harm reduction. Prevention is harm reduction. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enforcing and toughening our laws to get the pushers and the gangs off our streets is part of harm reduction. I would dispute the hon. member's characterization of our national anti-drug strategy. In fact, I can say that the commentary on our anti-drug strategy from police chiefs, community leaders and, most importantly, parents I have spoken to who have children taken away from them by the scourge of illicit drugs support our anti-drug strategy has been positive.</div>

Really, we have become an exemplary model for other countries as the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation goes and does its work worldwide on so many issues. The foundation is now saying to look to Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, as part of this initiative, an understanding that there will be in this country a manufacturing facility that will in fact manufacture vaccine components that in turn, after appropriate testing and safety considerations, will be able to be tested in the wider marketplace.

I know that of all the communities and ridings in this country, her riding has been the most devastated by this particular issue. She has some of the poorest in her riding. She has the highest rate of substance abusers and she has a large number of urban aboriginal communities, as do we in the four western provinces, but hers by far is the largest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to stand and support her statement and to say that we know this is a national disgrace. We know that the studies have shown that 2:1 aboriginal people have new infections of HIV-AIDS. Much of it we know is directly attributed and related to illicit drug use but a whole lot of it is attributed to poverty or lack of housing and all of the other social indicators that have led to the use of substances over the years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to quote from a very well known and respected physician in Vancouver who said, “addicts are made, not born”. The most common precursors are early childhood deprivation, neglect and abuse. For several generations Canada's native children have been far more likely to suffer grinding poverty, abuse and childhood substance addictions than non-natives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887641"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not something that we can talk about in the abstract. This is not something that we can stand here and speak in glowing and fine words about how we have strategies and we intend to do this and that. As a physician, I can say that the effectiveness of anything that we do must be shown in the outcomes. I for one have seen many outcomes that have led to very important new ways of dealing with this issue and they have been rejected by the government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887642"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that when the minister says that HIV-AIDS knows no boundaries and it affects vulnerable people as well as privileged people, while I recognize this, I must say that tonight we are speaking about the most vulnerable people in this country. Therefore, the minister must deal, if he is going to have an effective strategy, with these issues that affect this group of people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, we know that addiction is primarily a health issue with social correlated factors. I will put this in plain language and I will quote from the result of the report that the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78944,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78944&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A> took her question from today.

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Our findings demand a culturally appropriate and evidence-based response to the HIV epidemic among Aboriginal injection drug users. Canada's drug strategy has recently been the subject of significant criticism. This criticism stems from the fact that resources are overwhelmingly devoted to law enforcement-based interventions, which have been shown to have negative health consequences related to health service interruption and limited evidence of effectiveness as evidenced by increased illicit drug supply and decreasing drug prices.</small></td>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para887645"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister spoke very beautifully about evidence based but here is evidence that says that the way that his government is going toward a national drug strategy is actually not based on evidence at all, but is based mostly on ideology.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we speak to this issue, I want to quote from this report because I think this report has been the diving board from which the member launched her plea today. The report also states that we need “to acknowledge the harms of seeking to address addiction through a strategy that” is not culturally appropriate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An evidence based response to HIV epidemic amongst aboriginal drug users has told us that there must be other cohorts that we must look at.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about that today and put it in plain language. There is no place here if we are to resolve this problem. I think we can stand in this House for the next 25 years and each one of us can bleed and speak glowingly and speak with great emotion about the plight that the member brought forward today: the plight of the aboriginal people, of HIV-AIDS, hepatitis C, grinding poverty, lack of housing, an enormous amount of social dislocation because of aboriginal residential school issues, abuse, and urban aboriginal issues that have not even been dealt with by the government and do not even figure in the language about which it speaks.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1930"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1930"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1935"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1925"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1930">(1930)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about what we can do. Therefore, there is no place here for ideology or moralistic biases. The way to deal with the complex issues of substance abuse and related diseases, such as HIV-AIDS, hepatitis C and an increasing incidence of tuberculosis in this country among aboriginal people, is to employ a multifaceted strategy that has been proven to be effective. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what we mean when we talk about certain strategies which have yet to be proven to be effective. We know this is why clinical research, community and social research is absolutely important if we are to deal with the first part of any public health strategy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know there are some basic, public health 101 principles to a public health strategy, and the first one is research and epidemiology. This is what we were talking about today, research and epidemiology that is telling us who the susceptible populations are, where they live and what things make them susceptible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people believe that we can prevent addiction by telling people nice stories and telling them preventive things when they are young, which means that they think addiction is something we learn to do, something we can stop doing at any time we want and that it is purely a behavioural thing. However, medicine has told us that addiction is certainly not a behavioural issue alone, but that is one small part of addiction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887653"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and epidemiology are telling us that among urban aboriginal communities and other aboriginal communities the issues are very clear. There are issues of poverty. We heard people speak of the poverty of aboriginal peoples, especially aboriginal women who are among the poorest in our society. We have heard of the lack of housing and the lack of access to health care, especially for urban aboriginal populations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887654"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to address prevention in this instance, we must deal with those things that cause people to become substance abusers. We need to deal with the residential school issues because we know that those have left aboriginal people with exactly what Dr. Maté talked about when he talked about the fact that there had been abuse, early childhood deprivation and neglect. Being deprived of parents for a long time have led to generations of aboriginal people being denied the right to grow up as most of us have.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887655"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must deal with these issues if we are to talk about the first thing that the minister mentioned in his national drug strategy, which was prevention. Prevention is not about making nice speeches and going into a school and telling people they must not take drugs. It is about dealing with these very basic issues that epidemiology has told us contribute to this particular problem in aboriginal peoples and, indeed, in all people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887656"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that there is a link, not only between housing, but between discrimination and social dislocation. The hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A> spoke very movingly about that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887657"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere in the government's national drug strategy has it talked about housing. The minister spoke about it but I have not seen a housing strategy by the government. I have not heard it discussed in its Speech from the Throne. It was never in any of its budgets. It has never been discussed. In fact, I understand there was a housing meeting in Vancouver today and the minister responsible for housing did not bother to turn up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk the talk and there are lots of wonderful words coming from the minister but there is no substance to them. There is no action on it and so nothing has been done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is even worse is that the Kelowna accord, which was brought forward by our government to deal, in a culturally sensitive manner, with issues, such as housing, education and health, was cancelled by the government. It was one of its first acts. The Kelowna accord would have worked in a totally new way. It would have worked with aboriginal people who would have been part of the solution, part of that public policy development and public policy implementation. That is what is meant by those nice words that the minister used, “culturally sensitive”. The phrase “culturally sensitive” is actually a strategy and an implementation based on that kind of thing. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I hear about a national drug strategy that talks about prevention and that talks about enforcement, I do not hear other words. Public health strategies deal with good research in, first, epidemiology; second, prevention; third, something called harm reduction; fourth, treatment; and fifth, rehabilitation and being able to get oneself back into some sort of mode of life again after one has been ill or has had a disease.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of substance abuse, enforcement must be a sixth factor in a very clear public health strategy, public health 101. This is not ideological. This was drawn up in my head. This is public health strategies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government is going to talk about a reasonable or a believable national health strategy, it must talk about it. I have just talked about prevention, epidemiology and the things that link them that has not been talked about and is not being done by the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about harm reduction. I listened to the minister saying that he had no evidence that the Insite program actually achieved any results. That was extremely interesting because Insite is one of the most progressive forms of harm reduction on the North American continent. He was quoted as saying that during the time that he had decided that he would not support fully the Insite for a short period of time and temporarily he would let it go on. So this wonderful program is in limbo.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is that I heard his leader, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, say that he did not believe in harm reduction, as if harm reduction were the Easter Bunny or Santa Claus or something that one had to believe as an article of faith. Harm reduction is a clinically proven set of strategies that came about from people having done the work done in those strategies, implemented them and looked at how the results occurred.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887665"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harm reduction is a fundamental piece not only of public health but of medical care. Harm reduction is saying that if we people or children are dying of gastroenteritis that we will look at giving them different water to drink while we fix the water system. Harm reduction is about helping people to survive and have as little illness as they can while we are trying to find a solution for them in the long run. Harm reduction is reducing the harm to the person or the community until such solutions can be found to solve the problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887666"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the minister speaks about a vaccine as if it were the silver bullet, I must say that this is the end objective, but what about now? What about the people who are currently suffering or have died? What about harm reduction?</div>
    </p><a name="Para887667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harm reduction in the government's eyes is a moral issue. As I said before, if we look upon this as a clear public health issue, then we should not talk about morals. We realize that needle exchange does not help people to use more drugs. Needle exchange helps to prevent people who are using intravenous drugs from getting HIV-AIDS, hepatitis C and other diseases. If they have hope of living they may to want to go into detoxification or into treatment. They may make good choices for themselves and eventually find a new rehabilitative way of life. That is what harm reduction does for them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud of the Insite program because I was the federal minister responsible for the Vancouver agreement at the time when we brought in Insite. With the City of Vancouver, the province and the community all agreeing to do this, we got the money to set up this particular facility. Within six months, the facility was directed at doing two things. One was that it was directed at saving lives because overdose deaths were happening in that community in large amounts. Within six months of Insite being set up, overdose deaths had gone to zero.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a clinical study done by St. Paul's Hospital and UBC HIV-AIDS clinical trials network. This was not done by a bunch of people sitting around a corner thinking they wanted to prove something. This was done by real researchers applying absolutely appropriate methodology to do this. That was the first thing. It had actually achieved its objective in six months. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1940"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1940"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1945"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1935"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1940">(1940)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887670"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most surprising thing that came out of this was an indirect effect that they did not expect. The people who came to Insite were the people who actually did not go to doctors or nurses, did not go to institutions, and were not interested in getting care. These were the really marginalized people in society. Thirty per cent of them within a year were seeking detoxification. That was a remarkable side effect. No one could believe the percentage. One-third of the people who were going to Insite were seeking detoxification. Once they had been detoxified, many of them moved on to counselling. They also moved on to getting treatment, whether it was methadone or opioid use or other ways of getting themselves back into living ordinary lives and not getting HIV-AIDs, hepatitis C and other diseases.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said before and as I will say again, ideology should have no place in public policy, especially not in public health policy, and especially not from a government that has the ability to save lives by doing the right thing, and the proven right thing in this case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to talk about treatment. I am very proud of this because I was responsible for assisting the UBC researchers in a program called NAOMI. It is a three year project. They are looking at new methods of treatment that would work on narcotic or opium addicts or heroin addicts who were resistant to methadone treatment. The project involved giving them either a synthetic opioid or heroin and seeing how it worked. Those results are not out, but from what I hear from some of the researchers, there are going to be remarkable results in the use of opioids.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is going on in Europe. These projects have been shown to be successful in Switzerland. Belgium is starting a new opioid study. We have people who are ready to do these studies on treatment, and yet the government is not even speaking to them. I am meeting with them tomorrow with our leader, Mr. Dion. We are going to speak with these people who have been begging for a meeting with the minister--</div>

The researchers at UBC and St. Paul's Hospital have not been able to get a meeting with anyone in the Conservative government, not a B.C. minister and not the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78772,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78772&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Health</A>.

We are meeting with the researchers tomorrow to talk about some of these new treatment modalities that they are going to work on to see if they can assist people with treatment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sad day. We are dealing here not only with substance abuse, for which the government has no answer other than an ideological position that the Conservatives call a national health strategy, but we are also dealing with aboriginal people who are the most affected by this. The tools which were put together to deal with this problem and to get the kind of preventative measures that are needed for aboriginal peoples were not put into place. In fact, they were cancelled. We hear of small amounts of money being handed out. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Liberals were in government, we set up an urban aboriginal strategy that was going to assist urban aboriginal people to deal with health issues, to deal with substance abuse issues. There was a young urban aboriginal strategy as well. These have disappeared. They are gone. The government is obviously not interested in this most vulnerable population. It has obviously moved them somewhere off the path.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887679"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why I think this debate is important. It is an emergency. The problems have increased since the Conservatives came into power and they do not want to seek the right answers. They have developed an ideological attitude to things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate tonight can shed light on some of the absolutely appalling public policy around these issues. Maybe Canadians will listen and decide that it is time that we stopped talking about aboriginal communities and did something about them. Maybe Canadians will decide that it is time we stopped talking about substance abuse and did something about it. We had started. We know that if we form government, we will continue to build on those very good strategies.</div>

There are so many inaccuracies and misleading statements in the member's speech it is hard to know where to begin. Let me just point out a few things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the residential school agreement, we, the Conservative Party, signed that agreement. There is $1 billion to help mitigate some of the harm that was done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On housing, the member says that there has not been a single housing announcement. In fact, the government is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in housing. Just a few months ago in Winnipeg, I announced $2.1 million for a three storey, fully furnished, 20 unit apartment building at 415 Logan Avenue. I encourage the member to check it out, the Anishinabe Place of Hope. That was designed for first nations people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member talked about hepatitis C. Now, that is something else. For a Liberal member of Parliament to talk about hepatitis C after the Liberals denied compensation to the tainted blood victims, including aboriginal peoples, is just scandalous. It was a deliberate public policy decision by the Liberal government to deny compensation, one of the greatest scandals in Canadian history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member talks about fundamentals, first principles. Surely, what is more fundamental than anything else is fundamental human rights. Most Canadians would be shocked to know that first nations people are not included under the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Liberals are preventing this government from including first nations in the act--</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need a lecture from the member about housing and who signed what and when.

If we are going to deal with the fundamental issues of a disease that is caused by substance abuse and intravenous drug use, we need to deal with them in a manner that is consistent with public health principles. These are not my principles. They are not Liberal Party principles. They are proven public health principles. Any country in the world would have known what they are. And I am asking the government to actually observe them.</div>

Certainly the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the Conservative government seem to be moving in this direction very rapidly.</div>

    </p><a name="Para887697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member asked me to comment on Insite. If Insite closes down, given that Insite had brought the overdose death rate of that particular group of people who attended Insite down to zero, should one of them die when Insite is closed, that would increase the death rate as a result of a direct act of this government. I cannot put it more verbally than that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to an anti-drug U.S.-style approach, it is not only Europe that has been doing this. We can talk about Spain or Belgium. We can talk about the work that is being done in Germany. The European Parliament has decided that this is the way it is going to go because based on evidence, it is working. The results are extraordinary. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia started a project like Insite and now it is all over Australia. Every place in Australia has similar clinics. They are no longer projects. They have been adopted as a strategy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I can say to the member is that if we do not base our strategies on what is known to work, and what is evidence based, on what research has shown us, then we will have made a great mistake, and the government will have to accept the results of that mistake on its shoulders.</div>

I am a member of the Standing Committee on Health. We often urge the committee to consider the health of aboriginal peoples. Usually, committee members would rather talk about issues that fall under provincial jurisdiction, but I think it is time the Standing Committee on Health took a closer look at issues that concern it directly and that call for federal government action in an area that does fall under its jurisdiction: the health of aboriginal peoples. Statistics about the health of aboriginal peoples are frightening.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To return to the matter at hand, I would like to inform the House that we are aware of research published by the <i>American Journal of Public Health</i> confirming that aboriginals are more likely to have HIV than other Canadians. The study shows that aboriginal drug users in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside are twice as likely to contract HIV-AIDS as non-aboriginals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research data shows that, during the four years of the study, 18.5% of aboriginal men and women who use injection drugs such as cocaine and heroin became HIV positive, compared to 9.5% of non-aboriginals. This disparity is rather significant and, in my opinion, should be the subject of a thorough study or at least serious awareness on the part of the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The epidemic, which continues to spread throughout the world and from which practically no country is immune, can spread several ways. According to the report “AIDS Epidemic Update” produced in 2006 by UNAIDS and the WHO, approximately 39.5 million people are HIV positive, and the pandemic continues to target vulnerable communities. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T2000"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2000"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1955"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2000">(2000)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the number of people living with HIV has increased in all areas of the world. In 2006, 4.3 million people were newly infected with HIV and 2.9 million people died of AIDS related illnesses. In Canada, the number of people living with HIV-AIDS grew from 50,000 in 2002 to 58,000 at the end of 2005. Up to 25% do not know they are HIV positive.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, aboriginals represent the most vulnerable populations and are most often the victims of this pandemic. They are nearly three times more likely to be infected by HIV than any other Canadians. This statistic alone, I think, should be enough to make the government realize the importance of this critical situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings of the study on aboriginals in Vancouver confirm the existing data gathered throughout the country. Previously, in 2003, a study of aboriginals in Vancouver concluded that aboriginal intravenous drug users become infected by HIV at twice the rate of non-aboriginals. The Public Health Agency of Canada also released a report on these statistics in November 2007. If I may, I would like to share some of the findings, which are extremely alarming. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aboriginals continue to be overrepresented in the epidemic of HIV infection in Canada. They represent 3.3% of the Canadian population, but account for an estimated 7.5% of all existing HIV infections. In addition, 9% of new HIV infections reported in 2005 occurred in aboriginals, 53% as a result of intravenous drug use, compared to 14% for the general population. The overall infection rate among aboriginals is therefore roughly 2.8 times the rate among non-aboriginals. One final statistic that shows how serious the problem is concerns aboriginal women, who account for 48.1% of positive HIV tests reported among aboriginal peoples, compared to 20.7% among non-aboriginal peoples. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These findings point to the need for specific measures to address the unique features of the epidemic of HIV infection in the aboriginal population. According to the Vancouver study, intravenous drug use poses the greatest risk of infecting the aboriginal population not only in Vancouver, but across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of our first nations are not more likely to use drugs because of their culture or biology; drug use is rooted in a malaise caused by serious social problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of social problems, I would like to talk about the poverty in aboriginal communities across Canada. Canada is responsible for the aboriginal peoples, but the poverty among our first nations is one of the most serious social injustices in this country. Canada has more than 750,000 first nations people. The latest census indicated that the aboriginal population had exceeded one million. Of that number, 750,000 live on reserves, in urban areas and in Canada's northern territories.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we compare the situation of the first nations with that of the rest of Canada's population, a number of facts emerge. First, one in four first nations children lives in poverty, compared to one in six in the rest of the population. The life expectancy of first nations men and women is 7.4 and 5.2 years shorter, respectively. First nations dwellings are nearly twice as overcrowded as other Canadian homes. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half of first nations homes are contaminated with mould. The socio-economic conditions of first nations are comparable to those of developing nations, as people's health status is well below the national average.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Assembly of Quebec was one of the first legislatures to acknowledge the very existence of the first nations. It recognizes aboriginal people as a nation within Quebec and already has a nation-to-nation dialogue with them.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it unfortunate, in this illustrious place with 308 elected members, that elected individuals, with specific positions such as that of the parliamentary secretary, use the debate to engage in petty politics.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am ashamed to be here in the House this evening with people who take part in the debate and say such things. This is no laughing matter and it is no time for getting sidetracked and bantering about Quebec's separation. We are talking about people dying and people getting infected every day.

    </p><a name="Para887746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a unique opportunity. We are a unique party among all the world's democracies, a party that has no financial connections to anyone. Our only goal, our only objective, is to defend the rights and interests of the people we represent. We did not endorse placing COLD-fX on the shelves the day after Don Cherry visited the House. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No lobbyist can buy our support and we will never be in power. I would like them to understand why the Bloc Québécois has a role to play in this House. Although the government may not understand it, Quebeckers certainly understand. That is why they have been giving us their support and putting their trust in us for the past 15 years.</div>

Those programs are important. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that HIV transmission is often linked to injection drug use. People may not have enough money to buy new syringes every day or even every hour, or they may simply be unable to get the devices they need to administer drugs correctly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizations like CACTUS are very active in syringe distribution programs. Other programs, such as those offered by community health centres, provide information, support and help. Drug users have rights too. Drug addiction is an illness and it can be treated. However, to treat the illness, people need access to comprehensive programs that treat not only their bodies, but also their souls. This is not just a physical illness; it is a spiritual one as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have developed a number of programs in Quebec. I know that in Vancouver, too, there is a place that is very useful to people—</div>

    </p><a name="Para887760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the emergency debate is more about the aboriginal side of this. I believe that aboriginals make up the largest part of the HIV-AIDS infected individuals in that area, but I would like to broaden the debate somewhat because I think HIV-AIDS is a problem right across the country and certainly in places around the world. The advance of this disease is much more severe than we see in Canada, although when one sees an area that is around 30% infected, it is very significant. Most Canadians would be appalled at the idea that we have an area of population in this country where 30% to 40% of the population is infected with HIV-AIDS.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIV-AIDS is a disease that is 100% preventable. We know how to prevent this disease. It is not like what we know of the luck of the draw as to whether we get cancer, heart problems or other diseases that afflict our population. This is one that we know how to fix. We know that we can prevent it. We know of the absolute tragedy when an individual becomes infected with this terrible disease.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem in our debate this evening is how to use the dollars that we allocate in Canada in the most effective, efficient way in dealing with this problem. As parliamentarians, we come here tonight to be able to dialogue with each other, to be able to put our heads together, hopefully, in as non-partisan a way as possible, to deal with this issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak to this issue. I have the privilege of chairing the finance committee and some people might ask what I am doing talking about health care. However, I did have the opportunity and the privilege to chair the health committee when it did a study on this exact issue just a few short years ago. In the study, we looked at the dollars that were going into HIV-AIDS in Canada and at whether we were getting any proper or appropriate results.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals testified before the committee. We certainly looked at the aboriginals and tried to discern whether the appropriate measures were being taken or whether there was more we could do with regard to the aboriginal communities and HIV-AIDS.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to go back to our report, because we tabled that report in the House, and that is really what we do with reports from committees. In committee, we are not making a report to a specific ministry or minister. It is a report to this Parliament and to and for the people of Canada. We try to lower the political temperature in those committees so that we can do that to the best ability of the hon. members in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I would like to say that we do acknowledge the severe problem that is afflicting our populations with this disease. What are we going to do about it?</div>
    </p><a name="Para887767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had the opportunity to visit Africa a couple of times, where HIV-AIDS has impacted the population much more severely than it has in Canada or any place in the world. When looking at the problems in Africa, as Canadian parliamentarians we all feel for that continent. We have tried to help by sending a significant amount of money. In fact, we passed bills in the House to try in a compassionate way to get anti-viral drugs to those populations, to get them there in ways that they can afford and that would actually help ease the suffering and the curse of this disease.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Africa, I talked to some of the leaders. We were able to sit down and dialogue. I remember one HIV-AIDS conference that I was at in Senegal, on the west side of Africa. Ten different countries in Africa came together. These were countries that had severe problems. There were two countries with examples of how they were infected much less severely than the rest of Africa. One was the country of Senegal and the other was Uganda. They approached the HIV-AIDS virus in a much different way.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2030"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2030">(2030)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One country immediately allowed for free testing and free drugs to be able to deal with it, and the other one said no, that it was going to do everything it could to make sure that its populations did everything they could not to become infected. Those two approaches were aggressive and effective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, the prevalence of the HIV-AIDS epidemic in Africa is so significant that it is devastating to see when one visits there. On the way home, I was thinking about what we in the western world could do in regard to HIV-AIDS that would help in our country and internationally. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that struck me immediately was that maybe we should stop stealing their doctors, because they need them much more than we do. By that, I mean the medical practitioners. We have a rich country, one of the wealthiest in the world, and I would suggest that it is the best country in the world. It is not the richest in the world, but it is very rich. We can train our own physicians. We should try to do that as much as possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if we really are going to help Africans on this disease, we have to focus on something that will last a long time and actually address the problem. If we cannot change their culture and if we cannot change the reason they get HIV-AIDS, which is a very difficult thing to do, then we need to make sure that we do everything we can to get a vaccine in place to protect people from this virus.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, at the Senegal conference I remember that for two days all the parliamentarians could talk about was how poor they were. Their number one problem was poverty, they said. It was poverty, poverty, poverty, they said, and I listened to that for two days. Finally I said that I did not think their problem was poverty. I said that I thought it was corrupt governance. The room went absolutely quiet, but the next day they came to me and said that I had a point, that they knew their parliaments and their governance were somewhat corrupt. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They actually came up with a solution at the end of this conference as to how they would deal with corrupt governance in order to be able to take the money from the World Bank and the global funds to address the HIV-AIDS epidemic in an appropriate way. They said, “Why don't we set up an arm's length agency of government that would have the mandate to deliver this HIV-AIDS money directly to the patients and not go through the mechanism of government?”</div>
    </p><a name="Para887775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why am I relaying that story to members? Because it relates directly to what we are talking about. In Canada, we dedicate $9 billion to $12 billion for first nations people in this country, yet we have some of the worst conditions, third world conditions, on some of the reserves. Why is that the case? It is not really a lack of money. It is because the money is not going where it should in order to address the problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here tonight on an emergency debate about HIV-AIDS. I could easily make the same case for aboriginals and say that we need an emergency debate on fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, which is particularly prevalent on first nations reserves, and in epidemic proportions. By the way, every one of those cases is 100% preventable. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could make a case for aboriginals that we should have an emergency debate on diabetes on first nations reserves, because the diabetes epidemic on reserves and within the first nations population is very significant.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could make a case for aboriginals that we should have an emergency debate on the obesity rate for children on aboriginal reserves. The health committee just finished a report on that subject last March. It showed that 55% of children on aboriginal reserves are obese or overweight. It is in epidemic proportions in the general population at 26%, but for aboriginals on reserve it is 55%, and off reserve it is over 40%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these cases could be made and would be very valid. The problem is deeper than just dealing with HIV-AIDS and the money that we put toward it. I am not trying to downplay it or say that as parliamentarians we should reduce funds or change funds. What we should do is make sure that we do everything we possibly can to deal with the root problems on our reserves and with first nations peoples.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2035"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2035">(2035)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is our focus, number one, but part of this is the way that we govern and treat aboriginal people. We do not give them matrimonial rights. We do not allow them to own their own homes. We do not allow the structure and give them the respect they deserve with regard to the way we treat them, so they have low self-esteem. That is all part of the root problems of why they get into major drug problems and have a culture that allows them to become infected by the disease of HIV-AIDS.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that I have the answers here, and I do not think anyone in this House has all the answers, but I know that the problem of HIV-AIDS on reserves and off reserve, and particularly in this area of Vancouver, is significant. I know that we should do everything we possibly can to help these individuals and to prevent them from transmitting that disease to more Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get back to the report that the health committee did, we listened to the witnesses about this disease and the first thing we said was that the moneys had not moved since the early 1990s. This was in 2005. Since the early 1990s, $42 million a year was all the money that the Canadian government put into HIV-AIDS. We said that was not enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked the government what was being done with the money and we were told this and that. I am not going to drag it out, but the real gist of the testimony was that we could do much more. There was a tremendous case made for that. Every dollar that we put into it was going to save the taxpayers a tremendous number of dollars in the long run because it would prevent a number of infections.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I was convinced that we needed to add funds to our HIV-AIDS funds in Canada. I recommended and the committee recommended unanimously that we increase the amount. In fact, our minority report suggested that we would double the amount of money to $85 million. That is what the Liberal government of the day did. The amount was increased to $85 million. Our government has followed through on that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there was another part of our report that is very significant. It is important for the House to understand this if we are going to put more money into HIV-AIDS in Canada. At that time, there were 4,000 new infections per year. With that money, the goal was to reduce the number of infections. If we were just going to put money into the problem, then we were not going to really address the situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We needed to have a goal to say that we were actually going to do something with the money we wanted put into it, even though when we did that we knew the numbers did not really make a lot of sense. We looked at what was happening in other countries around the world. The United States was putting in $12 per capita for its spending on HIV-AIDS. Canada was putting in $1.40 per capita. Australia was putting in $1.25. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interesting part about this is that even though the United States put in 94% more money, the prevalence rate there was massively higher than what it was per capita in Canada. Canada was contributing much less than the United States and our prevalence rate was much lower. Australia was putting in only $1.25 per capita and its infection rate in the population was much lower than Canada's and that of the United States. It had nothing to do with the correlation that when more money is put in, the prevalence of HIV-AIDS is reduced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of our recommendation concerning the money was that the government was to put in $85 million, but $5 million of that would be going directly to first nations and Inuit people and another $5 million to inmates. I do not know the exact percentage of inmates in our institutions who are aboriginal, but it is a significant number, so we could say that much of the $10 million allocated would go to aboriginals.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, we have heard the minister explain to the House that we have a national drug strategy and that two-thirds of that amount goes to prevention and to treatment of individuals affected by drug problems. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that is an appropriate response. It is the right way to go. I believe also other countries should model the number of dollars Canada put into the vaccine and research. The Gates foundation is an example and model of what we are trying to do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can leverage the money in other countries and leverage the money that we put into the federal government to come up with some results that hopefully will get a vaccine to deal with not only HIV-AIDS in Africa but in Canada, Asia and other places around the world where this disease is out of control.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem on the east side of Vancouver is significant. I am not trying to downplay it any way. I am saying that as a government we are dealing with it in a multifaceted way, and I am pleased to see what is happening.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we do more? Absolutely. How can we say we do not want to do more? We want to do more, but we want to be effective with the resources we have as a government. There are limited resources. More money is not necessarily the answer. We have to have a multi-pronged approach, and that goes right back to the way we govern our first nations people, the way we give them the self-respect they deserve, the way we deal with the obesity problems, FASD, the alcohol problems, the way we deal with the health problems on reserves and all the other things I have explained.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we can do better. We always can do better and it is important that we strive to do better. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This emergency debate is not necessarily an emergency debate, although I guess if one has HIV-AIDS on a first nation, one would see this as an emergency. I do not downplay that at all. However, it has gone on for a considerable amount of time. We are here today to discuss it and debate it as parliamentarians. Hopefully, we can do that in a constructive way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a government, we have placed a considerable amount of resources in this area. We will continue to do that, I am sure. However, my biggest hope is we will get a vaccine to deal with this virus. The money we have put into the vaccine approach to this is the way toward a solution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one last thing, and I want to close with this. I said I was in Africa twice, once to the HIV-AIDS conference in Senegal. The other was a trip to Tanzania and to Ethiopia. I talked to the health minister of Tanzania. She said to me that whatever we did in the western world, not to give Tanzania more drugs. She said that if we gave it more drugs, the people would think they had the disease fixed. She said that they were so close to changing their cultural habits that allowed the infection to be passed on from one to another, and that was through multiple different ways. She was astute enough to know that the cultural habits had to change, if the people were going to slow the advancement of HIV-AIDS in their country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was thinking about that. The compassionate part of me was saying I wanted to give the people the drugs. We want to be compassionate and to ease the suffering. This individual was saying that if we were really compassionate, we should educate their youth, their females so they would understand how this virus was passed on, and prevent the next generation from becoming infected. That is what a really compassionate world would do to help Africa.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887799"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vaccine is one way that we can certainly assist those people. The faster we can get a solution with regard to a vaccine, the better off they will be, the better off we will be and the better off the people of the east side of Vancouver will be.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a terrible situation in Canada and around the world. There is not one Canadian who would not want to help if he or she possibly could. However, helping is multifaceted. We have to discern that here tonight and recognize that it will not happen with just one focused approach. We have to be comprehensive in the plan. It is no different than our approach with FASD, or obesity or some of these other significant problems in our society.</div>

I do not understand whether he is drawing a correlation between how much money someone puts into a problem or whether he is looking at the issue of evidence based facts, effective things that we do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887802"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I want to go back. The United States spends 90% more money per capita and its results are absolutely appalling. It has the same ideologically based approach that the Conservative government seems to have, which is enforcement and nothing about harm reduction. The war on drugs, et cetera has not worked in spite of the fact that there is so much money. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887803"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. member points to Australia, which spends about 10¢ less than Canada and gets better results, and he wonders why. Australia believes in a real comprehensive national strategy, which is research, epidemiology, prevention, harm reduction, treatment, et cetera. We know Australia has many Insite clinics.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887804"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it occur to the member that perhaps it is not how much money we put in, but what is done with the money, how it is spent, what other strategies are used and that using evidence based strategies is the only answer?</div>
    </p><a name="Para887805"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member mentioned a particular person in Africa who told him not to give them money for drugs, that they had to change their culture first. Is the member suggesting that it is the aboriginal culture creating this increase in HIV-AIDS, by any chance? Is there something aboriginal people do culturally wrong that gives them this problem? Therefore, let us blame the victim. It seems to me that is what the member has said.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887806"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the member explain those remarks because they are really confusing? I have no idea what the member means by them.</div>

    </p><a name="Para887808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will read the statistics, which are in our report. It says that the prevalence of HIV-AIDS in Australia is 60% lower than in Canada, yet it is paying $1.25 per capita for HIV-AIDS prevention. In Canada, it is $1.40. In the United States, it is $12. It is a significant amount more per capita, yet it does not address the problem. In fact, it is 94% higher in infection rates and other problems. There is no correlation for the amount of money that goes in compared to the outcomes. That is my concern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had a disappointment with the health committee's decision, and I am reading from our minority report on that study, it would be that we should have targeted some outcomes. What will we try to do with this money? We say that over a five year period, let us try to reduce the number of infections. When we know the disease is 100% preventable, how can we stop more people from becoming infected? We had that goal with our report. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, we have put more money into that area and we have seen an escalation of HIV-AIDS infections in Canada. Therefore, we have not been very successful in this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the health minister in Tanzania, what she was saying was if we gave them more money for drugs, they would think they had a cure and they would not have to worry about protecting themselves from their social habits to deal with it. Unfortunately, I have had the HIV-AIDS people in Canada saying the same thing. They think they have a cure already. They have antiviral, so they do not have to worry about whether their social habits will allow them to become infected by it or not. Unfortunately, that is a dead-end street. There is no cure for HIV-AIDS.</div>

    </p><a name="Para887813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Vancouver we have the Insite safe injection site, which has been proven to reduce deaths surrounding the issues related to drug addiction and injection drug use. Yet that important facility, which is a clean facility, which has the presence of health care professionals and which is responsible for referrals to other agencies and other kinds of health care, gets a very short leash from the federal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We keep hearing the federal government say that more studies are needed. We know there have been 25 independent studies of Insite showing that it does exactly what it claims to do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also heard earlier from the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A> that the Western Aboriginal Harm Reduction Society had its funding cut by the federal government. Therefore, it cannot do its important harm reduction work on the downtown east side among the aboriginal community. Even a program of hospital visits to support people who seek treatment for their addictions is likely to fail because of this funding cut.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the member address the importance of harm reduction and how that should figure in what the government does to address these important issues?</div>

    </p><a name="Para887818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two-thirds of the government's national drug strategy is prevention and treatment, which addresses harm reduction. It may not do it in exactly the same way as the injection sites. I believe we were looking for the completion of some studies before making a discernment of what to do with those. We will wait for that to happen. When it comes to this problem, it is multifaceted and one is not the whole solution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I personally question sometimes whether it is compassionate to have individuals come in and inject them, although it is safer. I do not deny that at all. However, it is also giving up on them by allowing them to continue a bad habit. If it moves them from there into treatment and we can prove that we can get them off these bad habits, then it is compassionate and we can really help them. However, if it only promotes bad habits that will ultimately kill them, I am not sure that is as compassionate as some of the people in this room might think it is. </div>

    </p><a name="Para887826"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I speak to the issue in the downtown eastside, and I have been there many times, I guess what I am struck with is the passing reference to aboriginal people or what I hear is dismissive references to aboriginal people coming from colleagues opposite.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887827"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the emergency goes beyond aboriginal people and HIV-AIDS. I think there is an emergency in this country as it relates to aboriginal people and the lack of support that the government is providing for them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The downtown eastside in Vancouver has become symbolic for all of the ills of the urban aboriginal. It is notorious. It is known for despair. It is known for the poverty. It is known for substance abuse. It is known for the sexual exploitation in the downtown eastside. All of which could be transferred to many other communities across the country, not necessarily with the same intensity but certainly prevalent and certainly there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887829"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the opportunity to visit the downtown eastside in the last months a number of times. Very recently, I had a tour with the liaison officer from the local police department. I toured the area. I visited the women's centre. I visited the aboriginal mother centre. I met with groups of women. I certainly know their challenges and indeed have seen their despair.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess what I am struck with, as I go into the downtown eastside and look at them, is, and we have heard this often, they are someone's mother, they are someone's sister, they are someone's brother and they are no less human than any of us. They deserve the treatment, the care, the courtesy, and the respect that I think is not given to them appropriately.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not hear to speak to the health challenges of AIDS. My two colleagues who are physicians can run circles around me on that. I want to speak to some of the issues as they relate to aboriginal people, some of the determinants of why we are here tonight, why we are talking about aboriginal people on the downtown eastside, and why they are experiencing such skyrocketing HIV infection rates.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am here to speak about the causes and the realities in the lives of aboriginal people and why so many of them are living with AIDS. As we saw in some of the clippings that some of us received, Ms. Barney, a member of the Lillooet Titqet Nation, was recently quoted in the <i>Globe and Mail</i>. She said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have seen from the government, and I do not want to be political, has in fact been a pattern of betrayal and disrespect for aboriginal people. We have seen dramatic cuts made to many of the programs that serve them, whether it is the aboriginal languages program or whether it was the $11 million first nations and Inuit tobacco control strategy program, which was a preventative health initiative. What we also know is that the government has scrapped the Kelowna accord, a trade-off I fear.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were criticized earlier in the evening for bringing up the Kelowna accord and politicizing the debate. The Kelowna accord provided real solutions for aboriginal people. The Kelowna accord offered hope to aboriginal people.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelowna really touched on the issues affecting aboriginal people, such as housing, health care, economic development, education, all of which would close the poverty gap between aboriginals and non-aboriginals in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887839"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard much in recent weeks about the great success of the government's water strategy. I will acknowledge that some progress has been made, but it has been made at the cost of other programs. It has been made at the cost of education. I can run off a litany of educational programs in communities from coast to coast to coast that have been cancelled, delayed, or put on ice literally and figuratively for years to come because there is an unwillingness to put new dollars into communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelowna was quite singular. It was an 18 month process that involved politicians at the federal and provincial level as well as aboriginal leadership from right across the country. It involved bureaucrats from various levels of government and bureaucrats from community organizations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of Kelowna was the fact that it was a holistic response to communities. It allowed communities to develop their own plans and set their goals and aspirations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kelowna agreement $95 million was allocated for last year for the education of young people in this country and $264 million for this current year. For housing, both on reserve and off reserve, there was $500 million for last year and $275 million for this year. Economic development opportunities would have equaled over $40 million for this year and last. In terms of stabilizing the first nation and Inuit health system, about $137 million for last year and $218 million for this current year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887843"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the underpinnings of poverty, crowded houses, lack of education, lack of hope, and lack of opportunity, drives young people out of their communities to seek what they think might be a better life in the big city only to fall into the trap of dependency, addiction and frequently sexual exploitation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887844"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard much from members opposite about costs. This afternoon, in another debate, a member implied that Kelowna was really not that front and centre in the minds of Canadians. He said that when the government did its budget consultations nobody spoke to it about Kelowna.</div>

It was not simply to please foreign bankers or leave room to cut a few pennies of GST off the cost of a new coffee maker. We eliminated the deficit to claim control over our future - to finance the kind of Canada we wanted to leave for our children, to fortify our social foundations and, above all, to help those who need it most.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelowna was a first and important step on that road to helping those who need it most. I listened with great interest to the member opposite talk about the needs of Africa. I do not want to minimize them in any way, but I cannot help wondering what an African person coming in and going to northern Manitoba, or going to Vancouver's eastside would say about Canada, and how we live and how we serve our population.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the aboriginal leadership has questioned the government's view and role of aboriginal people. They have frequently commented and I will quote Mr. Fontaine, the National Chief of the AFN, who said, “We see this as discriminatory treatment. We ask ourselves if this government really cares about first nations”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, because it is on the record, that there is not a real care for the plight of aboriginal people by members opposite. We have, as many do, the derogatory comments made by members opposite, some at the highest levels of government and some in this department in the past and in the very recent past. So, it is no wonder that we are not seeing the attention given to the aboriginal file that we should have.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard much about the residential schools concern and the residential schools legacy has caused much harm to aboriginal people. The Indian residential schools settlement was negotiated by the previous government, culminated on the signing of it with the passing of a peace pipe that we saw on the front pages of the <i>Globe and Mail</i>, and it was certainly a step in the right direction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887851"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I hear members opposite talking about the residential schools agreement, I cannot help wondering when is the apology coming? When are the Conservatives going to say, on behalf of the Government of Canada, to aboriginal people across this country “we are sorry”?</div>
    </p><a name="Para887852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard much about the survivors of residential schools and the loss of culture that they faced, the loss of heritage, the loss of language and the sad legacy of emotional, physical and sexual abuse. We have heard of the childhood wounds and the lifelong challenges that they faced to overcome them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a study released today and I want to read from an article in a news release from the Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network. It referred to two recent studies by the Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network, one addressing homophobia in relation to HIV-AIDS in aboriginal communities and the Canadian aboriginal people living with HIV-AIDS in care, treatment and support issues. It showed, and this is startling, “that 16% of participants in each study had attended a residential school and an overwhelming majority, 90% plus, had a parent or a grandparent who had attended. These deep childhood wounds would not go away in four or five therapy sessions”.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She further indicated that preliminary data for those who participated in it said that addictions are a major factor in living with HIV-AIDS. Intensified use of drugs and alcohol was an initial coping strategy when diagnosed, and addictions were dealt with soon after diagnosis in order to begin antiretroviral treatment, or getting cleaned up, and more important than dealing with HIV-AIDS.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residential school survivors need this apology. We have seen the pain and suffering on the downtown eastside. It is important that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A> has brought this issue forward to highlight it. What she has also brought forward, and which governments, all parties, in fact all Canadians have to take ownership, particularly in light of the Statistics Canada report that came out not too many days ago, is the growing aboriginal population, the growing poverty and despair in the aboriginal population, the drug addiction that is so prevalent in that population because of the lack of hope and the lack of opportunity. We as legislators and parliamentarians have an obligation to speak out on it, to make sure that Canadians are aware and that Canadians participate in closing the gap for aboriginal people in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887856"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the member opposite for bringing this issue forward. She highlighted the issue of HIV-AIDS, but she highlighted the greater issue of aboriginal people and the despair which many of them feel.</div>

It is absolutely clear that the member has no idea about collaboration, consultation, sitting and working together to develop a plan. He does not understand that there is not a one size fits all. He does not understand that it is not about one party telling the other what to do. It is about working with the communities for 18 months to hear their needs, concerns and how to remedy them. No, that member of Parliament thinks that each and every time he knows best what is required for aboriginal people. He does not respect the need to listen. He does not respect the need to hear. He does not believe in collaboration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887861"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in a committee and listened to over 20 presentations from communities where they said, “Do not do this,” and he said, “I know best”. The lessons of Kelowna are lessons of collaboration. They are lessons of working together. They are lessons of giving and taking and developing plans and developing frameworks, coming to a mutual and common understanding of what the issues are region by region and community by community right across the country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two comments. First, the Kelowna accord was not an accord. It was a press release which was released in the dying days of a government that had been in existence for 13 years. That is the best the Liberals could do, a press release. There was no money set aside or anything. It was just a press release.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the precursors for success fundamental to everyone are human rights. I would like to know why the Indian affairs critic for the opposition is preventing this government from allowing human rights and section 67 apply to first nations people as it applies to her and me. It is absolutely despicable that human rights for first nations peoples are being denied by the official opposition.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberal members of Parliament support the repeal of section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. They have supported it from the outset. What they have not supported is the lack of respect, the lack of process and the lack of consideration for the concerns of first nations communities when they came before the committee and said, “We want to know how this is going to impact on us. How is it going to affect our collective rights? Has an impact analysis been done? Is there some consideration for a non-derogation clause?”</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give the member chapter and verse where we have said it over and over again that we support the repeal of section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course this is an important debate tonight and that is why I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to take part in it. There is no doubt that high HIV rates among aboriginal people is a matter of grave concern not only to this government but of course to myself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887881"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HIV is a plague upon the modern world and, unfortunately, we do see very high rates of HIV among aboriginal people in this country. However, one of the factors that can lead to an increased rate of HIV is that of poverty. As such, I would like to take some time to speak to that important issue which does face many people from aboriginal communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887882"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government recognizes that the aboriginal people in this country face unique challenges in overcoming poverty. I have already spoken to how we, unfortunately, have a system that holds too many aboriginal people back, a system that needs reform. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887883"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, in collaboration with aboriginal peoples and our partners across the country and in the provinces and territories, we are looking forward to continuing to implement results based initiatives that will have a real and tangible impact on the lives of aboriginal people, such as extending individual human rights to first nations people, something that we had to fight hard to push within this Parliament, something that seems so common sense to people on this side, as the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78954,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78954&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health</A> has already just mentioned, a common sense approach of extending individual human rights, something that everyone has, something that I as an aboriginal person has, but something that first nations people did not have. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is something that we had to push, each and every day for the last year, just to try to get this important bill through our committee. Finally, after considerable public pressure, it looks like it may be beginning to move forward, but it has been a challenge, and that is something that we face with all of our interesting ideas that we have brought forward to improve this broken system that I have talked about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other areas in which we are making progress are in the areas of water, housing, family supports and, of course, economic development in order to create conditions for healthy, sustainable communities, which are really the best means to combat poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach in these areas will have benefits for all aboriginal people. We have made a lot of progress toward our goal of improving the quality of life for aboriginal people in ensuring that they enjoy a standard of living that is comparable to other Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887887"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, one area in which we took a specific interest was the area of clean water. When we first came to office, we inherited a situation where we saw nearly 200 aboriginal communities that were living under shameful water conditions. It was really a forgotten tragedy that the previous government paid no care to. We immediately put in a plan of action to address the drinking water on first nations communities and, since then, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada has been working in partnership with Health Canada, Environment Canada and first nations governments themselves to improve the situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887888"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We launched the plan of action, which was part of our commitment, to monitor the progress and to make information available to everyone to ensure that our focus remained on this important task and to have measurable improvements in the lives of first nations people. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',111551,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=111551&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Indian Affairs</A> recently released the latest progress report and it shows that it has been consistent and has had very encouraging progress.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is committed to ensuring that residents of first nations enjoy the same protection afforded other Canadians when it comes to drinking water. When we came to office, there were 193 high risk systems in first nations communities. That number has now been reduced to 85.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the plan of action was launched, it identified 21 priority communities with high risk systems and which also had drinking water advisories. The latest progress report has only six communities in that category. We are very proud of that progress but we will continue to move ahead because there are still a number of communities outstanding and we hope to see that improvement in those communities happen quite quickly as well. That is one area of our concern in first nations health.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2125"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2125">(2125)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887891"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also providing aboriginal women, children and families with the supports they need to contribute to prosperous, stable communities. We have invested over $55 million over five years in family violence and prevention programs on reserve. This sum includes funds for Indian and Northern Affairs Canada's family violence prevention programs, as well as money for the construction of new shelters through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's shelter enhancement program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that adequate housing is essential to healthy, prosperous communities. The government is committed to providing first nations living on reserve with the same housing opportunities as other Canadians. To that end, we are working with first nations to increase the availability of safe and affordable housing and help communities create new options that provide a means to build equity and generate wealth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that hon. members are aware of the first nations market housing fund which was announced last year. This $300 million fund, expected to be operational this spring, will help increase the housing supply on reserve and give first nations families and individuals a greater range of housing options, particularly home ownership and market rental units.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the government recognizes that one of the keys to improving quality of life and eradicating poverty is through skills development and by increasing aboriginal participation in Canada's economy, which really is the most essential part. When we can extend the benefits of the economy, giving people the hope and opportunity that a job and a career will provide them, this is the key to getting out of the shackles of poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see aboriginal peoples who are now enjoying unprecedented access to venture capital, business supports, training and educational programs. Mainstream businesses are eager to partner with aboriginal groups. Aboriginal people are well known for their entrepreneurial skills. I come from an entrepreneurial background myself and many in my family are also very entrepreneurial. We see this throughout aboriginal communities and across the country people are ready and more than willing to seize the opportunities that business can provide.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working with our partners to ensure that first nations, Inuit and Métis can take advantage of our current circumstances. We are also working to encourage aboriginal youth to pursue careers in business sciences and the skilled trades.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the hon. members that budget 2007 invested an extra $105 million over the next five years to more than double the skills of the aboriginal skills and partnership initiative which funded skills training for thousands of aboriginal people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the aboriginal workforce participation initiative, we are working with the private sector to open the doors of wealth and opportunity for aboriginal people. This initiative secures partnership agreements between some of Canada's leading companies and public agencies, along with industry and professional labour groups.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aboriginal workforce participation initiative helps employers recruit, retrain and promote aboriginal services. This is an extraordinarily important initiative and one where we are seeing significant progress being made. Our goal is not simply to create jobs but to remove the obstacles that separate employers from employees. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain economic growth, we must establish new beneficial partnerships. We must encourage aboriginal youth to pursue careers in business and science and in the skilled trades. We must continue to get the message out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing business with aboriginal people benefits all Canadians. This is why we have signed partnership deals bringing together first nations with private sector firms like EnCana and Siemens. In relation to Siemens, I actually had the pleasure of signing a historic agreement with Siemens Canada just last year in 2007 in Saskatoon, an agreement that was going to bring into force a human resources initiative where Siemens was going to be hiring many aboriginal people across Canada. It is something that I had the pleasure of being part of.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is initiatives like that which will bring about the historic change that we are hoping to see in the next few years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot forget about the urban aboriginal strategy which has been renovated and extended for another five years with a tighter focus on employment. The urban aboriginal strategy has been seen throughout the 12 test cities as being highly successful. It is something that is in my home town of Thompson which has the highest percentage of aboriginal people in Canada in an urban centre. It is a program that delivers results. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T2130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2130"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2130">(2130)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para887904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took part in an announcement last fall where the urban aboriginal strategy, in conjunction with the community, decided that there was a need for housing in that city for young mothers who were attempting to go to university so that they could get a career. That is an example of why we need to bring these resources to smaller centres so people can get the education they deserve.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this fall's Speech from the Throne, we are committed to helping aboriginal people get the skills and training they need to take advantage of job prospects, especially in the mining and resource sectors where we are seeing an increase in employment opportunities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no question that poverty cannot fully and finally be eradicated without robust economic opportunities. As the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',111551,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=111551&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development</A> has said, economic opportunities that generate not just wealth but purpose and a sense of progress toward a better future, is the path out of poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, our government is doing its part. Over the last year we have brought about Aboriginal Business Canada in a new form so that it is completely consolidated into one department so it can focus better on being able to extend the benefits of our economy to aboriginal people throughout the country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are building on the aboriginal business and economic growth that has already been achieved and we are looking at how to strengthen and deepen the positive results. For example, we are considering how to increase access to capital for small businesses and how to enhance opportunities in the marketplace for community based enterprises.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that these measures demonstrate a very strong federal commitment to economic opportunities for all aboriginal people, both on and off reserve and in urban and remote locations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other positive signs all across the country. First nation leaders have been organizing and reaching out to governments and the private sector to build on our extensive economic agenda. Our government is committed to tapping into this enthusiasm and expertise. We have named an impressive group of aboriginal people to a National Aboriginal Economic Development Board. What is more, we have received useful guidance from the Senate committee on aboriginal peoples in this regard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that aboriginal poverty is a serious and pernicious problem and there is no doubt that genuine progress is challenging. It requires clear thinking, diligent effort, patience and collaboration. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government will continue to work in concert with our aboriginal, provincial and territorial partners to achieve this progress. Together, we will create practical solutions, allocate appropriate funds; establish clear roles and responsibilities and set goals and achieve them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are committed to supporting initiatives that will alleviate the poverty that is endemic in too many aboriginal communities. By improving quality of life through addressing real issues, such as drinking water, housing, and supports for children and families, and by promoting economic opportunities and skills development initiatives, communities and individuals will be encouraged to grow and prosper and, ideally, no longer be shackled by the burden of poverty.</div>

This is much of what we have brought forward as an agenda, which will deliver what we see as economic outcomes for aboriginal people throughout the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First nations people, both on reserve and in urban centres, are always looking to have that opportunity to get a job, have a career and begin to have the same economic benefits that we see throughout the country. Unfortunately, not enough aboriginal people are able to take part.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course this is something that is very important to me. I have had the opportunity to go to university and as an aboriginal person I note that this is something that unfortunately is not seen as often as we would like. It is something that we would like to continue to promote, because it is through education that we will see the benefits and outcomes that we are all aspiring to have within our first nations, Métis and Inuit communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is actually our initiatives in education that are the most exciting, in British Columbia in particular, where we have had an historic agreement with the government of British Columbia. That is bringing about an important systemic reform to the education system in that province. It is actually going to begin bringing about a type of school board system that will allow for a degree of standards to improve the outcomes for first nations students. It is an exciting time in British Columbia. I am looking forward to seeing that exported to other parts of Canada.</div>

Like my colleague, I wondered really what it had to do with the issue of the downtown eastside and HIV-AIDS and its prevalence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887921"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree with the hon. member, and we all do because it is kind of like motherhood to say that the way out of poverty is to get a good education and to have economic opportunity, we are talking about a certain cohort of people in an area that has the highest poverty rate in Canada. We are talking about people who have multiple challenges: people with mental illness, people who have lived with abuse, and people who have to deal with the everyday fact that they know they are going to die from HIV-AIDS or hepatitis C or some disease.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are people who are so challenged with regard even to getting up in the morning that to talk about economic opportunity is far out of their ken, and we need to be able to talk about those other things. We are talking here about poverty so deep and a hopelessness so great that we have to deal with those issues before we can even begin to talk about economic opportunities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question for the hon. member. That is all very well and good and I know he seems to care a lot about human rights, but if the hon. member and his government care so much about the human rights of aboriginal people, why did they not sign the United Nations convention on aboriginal rights?</div>

It is true that our government was one nation that did not endorse or vote for that declaration, for a number of important reasons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has had a long and storied history with our first peoples. We have built a country that many in the world look to as one of the greatest. We have done this through a negotiated way with our first peoples. We have built a Constitution that has extended historic rights to first nations people. We have also had numerous settlements and treaties signed over the years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, in regard to the declaration that the member would like to sign now, according to her and her leader, although the previous government had no intention of signing--</div>
    </p><a name="Para887927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. members:</b> Oh, oh!</div>
    </p><a name="Para887928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rod Bruinooge:</b> In fact, Mr. Speaker, this declaration would reset Canada to a pre-contact moment. That is what it contemplates. It has a philosophy that wants to bring Canada back to a pre-contact moment, set aside all the constitutional changes we have made to incorporate aboriginal people and set aside all the treaties we have signed. That would be very damaging to our country. That is why we have acted quite prudently.</div>

    </p><a name="Para887930"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what drives me crazy is this lack of understanding or willingness to accept that before economic opportunity can exist people need to have basic necessities covered, whether it is shelter and housing, income security, food, or safety. If they do not have those, and if they think they will get kicked out at the end of the week or they do not have a roof over their heads, it is pretty hard to go to school or to take advantage of whatever economic opportunity there might be. If a person is living way below the poverty line, that economic opportunity does not exist.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887931"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the member if he acknowledges that. What does he mean by economic opportunity? Does he include in that the recognition of meeting these very basic human needs that in my community are being completely unmet by his government? We have not seen any housing dollars from the federal government coming into our community to build the housing that is desperately needed. Will he acknowledge that this needs to be addressed?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to housing, I think we have seen that the government has chosen to take two important paths.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the Manitoba example. I know that it does not apply exactly to British Columbia, but I will use it as an example.

    </p><a name="Para887942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to pick up on a theme that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A> mentioned a few moments ago. It is about the sense of community that exists on the downtown eastside of Vancouver. I think that often people have the sense that this is just a place of despair, a skid row area that does not have a sense of itself as a community, where people do not care for each other and where neighbours do not pay attention to what is happening with other neighbours.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My experience of the downtown eastside is exactly the opposite of that. People there are very much a community. It is very much a neighbourhood. People there do express incredible values of support and care for each other.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also a place of activism, where people take an interest in what is happening in their neighbourhood and are willing to organize, to fight and to stand in solidarity with each other to seek change and a transformation of the life that they know in that area. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a place of very difficult problems but also of great hope. I hope we never lose track of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate tonight is about the recent study which showed that Vancouver's aboriginal drug users on the downtown eastside were twice as likely as non-aboriginal users to be infected with HIV. This is certainly an issue that is of very great concern to all of us who know that neighbourhood, who know people who live there and who have friends and relatives who live there, but who also want to see an appropriate social policy in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study showed that 18.5% of aboriginal men and women who injected drugs such as cocaine and heroin became HIV positive, compared with 9.5% of non-aboriginal intravenous drug users. There obviously is a particular issue here in this neighbourhood that is affecting the aboriginal community disproportionately.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the course of the night, we have heard about many aspects, many reasons and many theories about why that might be, but one of the things in this debate that has disappointed me is the sort of underlying assumption that we have limited resources with which to address problems like this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk about how we live in a wealthy and well-to-do society and about how we have many advantages in this society. We here also know that the government is running surpluses. I find it a little hard to talk about surplus, about government having more revenues than it is spending on programs, when we have needs like those that exist on the downtown eastside of Vancouver and when we have needs like those that exist in the aboriginal communities across Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clearly a misnomer to say that there is a surplus in the government coffers when needs like those that exist among the aboriginal community in Vancouver, among intravenous drug users and among people who are living with AIDS and HIV go unaddressed. I think it is absolutely unjustified to pursue huge tax cuts for profitable corporations, for banks and oil companies, when these kinds of needs exist in our community. How can we possibly justify giving breaks to profitable corporations, to the wealthy, when these kinds of needs exist in our communities and go unaddressed? </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we do it? There seems to be no rationale in cutting the fiscal capacity of our federal government to the tune of $190 billion over six years when these kinds of needs exist in our community. Surely we should be considering the capacity of our government to assist citizens by dealing with the problems in our social infrastructure in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times tonight we have heard the Conservative members talk about the need to provide economic opportunity. I do not think anybody would disagree with the idea that it is an important facet, but are we to do that at the expense of addressing the important social needs of our communities?</div>
    </p><a name="Para887953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are we to do that and not recognize that it is hard to take advantage of an economic opportunity when people do not have a roof over their head, or when there is no food on their plate, or when they cannot dress decently to go for a job interview, or when their teeth are so bad that no one would hire them in the first place, or when they cannot get the treatment they need for mental illness, drug addiction, HIV-AIDS, tuberculous or hepatitis? These are all things that I think beg the question slightly.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be providing these services. We should be looking at these programs. Throwing money at a problem does not always solve it either. But to say that we have limited resources in the circumstances in which we live here in Canada and in the circumstances that our government operates is absolutely wrong.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a couple of things that I wanted to talk about specifically tonight during this debate. One is the whole question of drug policy. I think it has been proven very clearly and definitively that the kinds of drug policies that we have that stress enforcement and criminal sanction against drug users is completely ineffective. It does not solve the problem or address the problem of drugs in our society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish we had taken advantage of the history that we have with the alcohol prohibition movement and learned lessons from that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I am reminded that I am splitting my time with the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78654,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78654&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—New Westminster</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have learned something from alcohol prohibition. When it was in force in the United States, we saw exactly the same kinds of problems we see now with drug prohibition in Canada. We see the same kinds of addiction issues. We see the same kinds of gang related crime issues. We see the same kinds of family dislocation and community dislocation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We even see the same kind of danger in neighbourhoods when stills exploded in people's garages and basements as we see with grow-ops and meth labs in our neighbourhoods now. I think we could have learned from that experience. I think it has been clear and definitive.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue that I want to talk about that I think bears on what is happening on the downtown eastside in Vancouver is the whole approach to harm reduction. In Vancouver we have been championing the four pillar approach to dealing with drug addiction and drug issues in the city: prevention, treatment, enforcement and harm reduction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harm reduction is always the pillar that seems to be the hardest fought and certainly with the current federal government. In Vancouver this approach is not controversial. I think, widely, people accept that this is the right way to deal with the crisis around drug addiction and drug use in Vancouver. We know that we need every aspect of that four pillar approach, but we particularly need harm reduction approaches.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years ago when needle exchanges were first proposed, Vancouver was one of the first places to set up a needle exchange. That was controversial in the beginning. I think the appropriateness became very clear in Vancouver of ensuring that those people who were addicted to injection drugs had clean works to use, so that they were not spreading disease and were not harming themselves by that practice. The needle exchanges have proven very successful in saving lives and preventing the spread of disease in Vancouver.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have a very important project in Vancouver that should be a permanent feature of our approach to dealing with drug addiction in our community. That is in the Insite safe injection site. We know that Insite has been saving lives. We know that it has worked and it is effective in its goals. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that providing a clean and safe environment for people who are addicted to injection drugs and where there are medical staff to supervise and assist, and also provide referrals to treatment and other kind of health care has improved the circumstances of hundreds, if not thousands, of people in the city of Vancouver.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that it has been studied by independent analysts. We have had over 25 studies of the Insite facility. The studies have shown that it is meeting its goals, that it is effective in reducing harm and saving lives, yet the federal government still looks for another study. It is looking for an excuse to not renew its licence permanently.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short term licence renewals that we have are affecting the ability to deliver an appropriate service in our community. I think there is widespread support for the service and short term licence renewals should not continue. We need to make sure that the government reverses its policy there and gets its act together when it comes to dealing appropriately with Insite.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole issue of housing is one that I think is absolutely crucial in all of this. People who do not have a roof over their head, who are homeless and living on the streets also have severe health problems. They are not going to receive the assistance they need in dealing with their addiction issues. We know that the housing programs of this country are sorely lacking. There is no national housing program in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had to fight tooth and nail to see the homelessness program renewed in the last couple of years. This program is coming up for renewal again in the next few months. All of these things will contribute to the health of the community in Vancouver. I appreciate having had the opportunity to speak on this issue tonight.</div>

    </p><a name="Para887973"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there are far too many cracks for them to fall through in the current system that we have. Just a few weeks ago the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78654,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78654&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—New Westminster</A> and I met with the Burnaby New Westminster task force on sexual exploitation of children and youth. It raised the issues of the cracks that young people, who are seeking treatment for drug addiction, can fall through.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887974"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that when a young person decides, or any person decides, to seek treatment for drug addiction that the treatment needs to be available immediately. It was pointed out to us that in the Vancouver area it is often possible to get someone into detox right away, which is the first step in that process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these people finish detox, they come out and they need to be housed some place because they always have to wait for treatment because the waiting list for treatment is so long and the places are so few and far between. However, when they come out of detox before they go to treatment, there are no transitional housing places for them to go. We cannot send them back to where they were before. They cannot be put back on the street or couch surfing in the environment where they were using drugs before because that will only set back their determination and the possibilities of treatment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once they get into treatment and they are finished treatment, they come out and again, they need supportive housing operations so that what they learned and the treatment that they experienced can continue outside of the actual clinical or treatment facility setting. Yet, it is hard to find those kinds of housing options for people. Again, the transitional housing just is not there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, we need to find independent housing options for those young people, so that they can take up a life and apply what they have learned, the kinds of treatments they have gone through, the kind of ongoing commitment they have to staying clean and sober. If they have to go back on the street, if they go back to couch surfing because there is no home for them, all of that is lost. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those cracks related to housing between the various points of the treatment process are very serious indeed and are not addressed by the kinds of housing policies that we have at the federal government level. We had the first housing conference this week of provincial housing ministers in two and a half years, and unfortunately the federal minister of housing refused to participate in that meeting. I think that is a shameful act on his part.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal minister should have been there to contribute, to show that the federal government was interested in pursuing and participating in the solution to the housing crisis in Canada. Yet, the federal government chose to be absent. That is not acceptable and it needs to be fixed.</div>

He was speaking about prohibition times almost a century ago and the lessons that we as Canadians should have learned from that time. It was an interesting series of comments he made in his excellent speech, particularly because the economic conditions that existed around the time of prohibition exist again today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sad shame and tragedy of what has happened over the last 20 years economically in this country. Essentially, we are recreating the same conditions that we had around the time of prohibition and, later, the Great Depression. This is not just limited to Canada. In the United States, we see similar levels of income inequality, as we well know.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States now, according to many economic indicators, has the same level of income inequality that existed in 1928. We have turned the clock back economically in the United States to a time prior to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's new deal, prior to the array of social programs that were put into place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, we are seeing a similar situation. Through the actions of the previous government and the present government, we are now looking at levels of inequality that existed in the period of the Great Depression. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poorest of the poor in Canada, the poorest 20% of Canadians, have actually seen a collapse of their incomes. They are now essentially living on the same income that they used to earn in 10.5 months in 1989. Today, they are earning essentially a month and a half less of income even though they may be working full time or through employment insurance, if they can access it, or welfare, which is increasingly difficult to access. They are living on far fewer resources.</div>

At the same time there has been this catastrophic fall in the incomes of the poorest of Canadians. We know that aboriginal Canadians are among the poorest of the poor and share the sad title with Canadians with disabilities, with the poorest level of income in this country, levels of income that provoke the kinds of social situations that, as the member for Vancouver East said so eloquently, mirror third world conditions here at home. Because of that, we are seeing the tragedy of the downtown eastside of Vancouver where individuals who are able to access welfare are trying to live on $600 a month when the minimum cost to keep a roof over their heads is $1,300 a month. It simply does not add up.</div>

They do not have access to the job market because of all those barriers, putting aside the immense tragedy of the residential schools and the racism that aboriginal Canadians have faced in society. </div>
    </p><a name="Para887993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the legacy of residential schools and of racism these individuals now find themselves in the downtown eastside living on incomes far below any incomes that are sustainable.

There is not a single person in the House who is immune from addiction, who is immune from the kinds of tragedies that we are seeing now in the downtown eastside. Any member here, as the result of the loss of a loved one, as the result of a personal tragedy, the loss of a job, the loss of income could find himself or herself in a situation where he or she becomes addicted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para887995"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not talking about Canadians who have a different set of circumstances from one that might cause any of us to become addicted. We are talking about human beings who, through immense adversity, find themselves in appalling conditions and are seeking our help. As a result of that we should be looking to provide programs that are culturally appropriate and programs that actually give the kind of solace and the lifting up that is required, but we do not see this from the government.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We signed the residential schools settlement for $1 billion. We compensated the forgotten victims of hepatitis C to the tune of $1 billion.

    </p><a name="Para888007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funding that was put forward by the government came out of the NDP budget from three years ago. Even at the time, when we forced the former Liberal government to provide some funding for housing, we knew that was only a first step in what was required in long term investments to re-establish social housing and a national housing program in this country. Some of that money has been taken by the current Conservative government and set aside. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very slowly flowing, but the reality is that it is far from what is required across this country to address a national tragedy, which is the growing homelessness in the streets of our city. There are hundreds of thousands of Canadians sleeping out tonight. We are not just talking about aboriginal victims of HIV-AIDS. We are talking about individuals in all corners of the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandmother used to tell me about the Great Depression. I could not imagine a country where there were thousands of people sleeping out in the streets. She used to tell me about the dirty thirties, and I thought, my goodness, it is wonderful that I am living in a country where we have resolved that problem. Yet now in 2008, it is right back to the same kind of horrible social conditions that people saw back in the 1930s. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply do not believe that the government is taking this issue seriously and making the massive investments that are required to provide social housing right across this country.</div>

    </p><a name="Para888019"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of HIV-AIDS is one that has probably touched virtually every community that is represented here in the House of Commons. In my dental practice I treated those infected with HIV and I saw first hand the devastation that this disease can cause.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888020"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have travelled to many developing countries and I have witnessed the destructive effects of this disease, not just on those infected, but also on the families and the communities left to deal with the aftermath.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888021"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past December in Kitchener, I had the privilege of walking through the One Life Experience, a 2,000 square foot interactive exhibit created by World Vision, which allows people to walk in the shoes of one of four children who have been affected by AIDS. This powerful display gave me a renewed sense of what it must be like to deal with the bad news that the blood tests have been returned and have confirmed a positive HIV diagnosis. How does one deal with that shattering news? My prayers go out to those who have been infected with HIV and to the families and communities that are left scrambling to cope.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888022"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 58,000 Canadians were estimated to be living with HIV infection in 2005. This unfortunately represents a 16% increase from 2002.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888023"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While new infections will unfortunately continue to occur, survival rates will improve due to treatments for HIV. As a result, requirements for treatment and care will also continue to increase in the future. An estimated 2,300 to 4,500 new HIV infections occurred in Canada in 2005, slightly higher than what was estimated for 2002. That is troubling to say the least. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888024"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all have a collective responsibility to ensure that concerted action is taken. This government has taken concrete steps to address this disease, and hopefully one day, we will find a vaccine that will alleviate this worldwide epidemic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888025"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of who is most at risk in Canada, we can identify three groups. The main risk group for HIV in Canada is men who have sex with men. This group comprises 45% of new infections. Persons exposed to HIV through heterosexual contact comprise approximately 36% of new infections. Of the groups that are most at risk in Canada, persons who inject drugs make up 16% of new infections. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888026"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This last statistic is of particular importance to the aboriginal community as the proportion of new HIV infections among aboriginal Canadians due to injection drug use is much higher than among all Canadians. This highlights the uniqueness of the HIV epidemic among aboriginal persons and it underscores the complexity of Canada's HIV epidemic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888027"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aboriginal persons continue to be over-represented in the HIV epidemic in Canada. They represent 3.3% of the Canadian population, and yet in 2005 it was estimated that aboriginal persons accounted for 7.5% of all those living with HIV in Canada. That is an estimated 3,600 to 5,100 aboriginal persons living with HIV. Equally troubling is the fact that aboriginal persons also comprised 9% of the new HIV infections in 2005. These numbers give us an overall HIV infection rate among aboriginal persons about 2.8 times higher than among non-aboriginal persons. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888028"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is in the middle of the range of developed countries with respect to rates of HIV infection. Our per capita rate of persons living with HIV infection is lower than that in the U.S.A., Italy and France, but it is higher than that in the U.K and Australia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888029"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of newly reported cases of HIV infection in B.C. is slightly higher than in Canada as a whole. In 2006, 8.4 new cases per 100,000 were reported in British Columbia. This compared to 7.8 cases per 100,000 across Canada. Again we see a disparity in the percentages. Overall, 20.3% of Canada's cumulative reported HIV cases are from B.C., whereas B.C. represents about 13% of Canada's population.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2220"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2220">(2220)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para888030"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005 and 2006 the proportion of reported HIV cases attributed to an injection drug use exposure in British Columbia was 25% as compared to 19.3% in the rest of Canada. Of the 4.3 million plus people living in British Columbia, 4.5% were estimated to be of aboriginal identity, this according to the latest 2006 census.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888031"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the HIV reports in B.C. with ethnicity information, aboriginal persons accounted for 15.1% of cases reported in 2005 and 15.8% of cases reported in 2006. The rate of new HIV infections among aboriginal injection drug users compared to non-aboriginal users has been observed for a number of years in Vancouver. While this in itself is not a new finding, it continues to be an issue of concern and is related to the overall higher rates of HIV infection in aboriginals in Canada in general.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888032"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building on what the hon. minister said, I will to provide some concrete examples of what is being done by this government to address HIV-AIDS in aboriginal communities across Canada. This of course includes what is being done in Vancouver's downtown east side. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888033"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government knows that many factors have increased the vulnerability of aboriginal Canadians to HIV. HIV-AIDS has a particularly significant impact on aboriginal women. Females represent nearly half of all positive HIV test reports among aboriginal peoples, approximately 47% as opposed to 20% of reports among non-aboriginal people. Aboriginal people are also infected with HIV at a younger age than their non-aboriginal counterparts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888034"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated before, injection drug use is the main risk for HIV-AIDS among aboriginal people in Canada. Over half of the new HIV infections estimated among aboriginal people for 2005 were attributed to injection drug use compared with only 14% among all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888035"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted by our hon. <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78772,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78772&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Health</A>, the government is serious about addressing the issue of drug use among Canadians. The national anti-drug strategy offers a two track approach which is tough on crime and compassionate for victims, and provides $63.8 million over two years to tackle the drug trade. It includes three action plans: one, preventing illicit drug use among young Canadians; two, treating people with illicit drug dependencies; and three, combatting the production and distribution of illicit drugs.</div>

    </p><a name="Para888037"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the federal initiative to address HIV-AIDS in Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, in partnership with Health Canada, supports the work of the National Aboriginal Council on HIV-AIDS. This council acts as an advisory mechanism. It provides policy advice to Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada and other relevant stakeholders about HIV-AIDS and related issues among all aboriginal peoples in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888038"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The council is a mechanism for the development and coordination of shared actions between the federal initiative to address HIV-AIDS in Canada and aboriginal communities working on HIV-AIDS issues. Its aim is to ensure that Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada and its representatives have effective and efficient access to policy advice regarding aboriginal HIV-AIDS and related issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Health Agency of Canada supports community based organizations as well as national NGOs to achieve a number of goals. These goals include: supporting a national voluntary sector response that plays a coordinating and leadership role in the response to HIV-AIDS; helping engage in direct meaningful involvement with people living with or at risk of HIV-AIDS; encouraging collaboration and partnership to address risk factors of the disease and achieve an integrated approach to disease prevention across sectors; enhancing the capacity of individuals, organizations and communities to respond to this epidemic; gathering and encouraging the exchange of HIV-AIDS information and knowledge; enabling the development of respective informed and innovative policies and program interventions that are relevant across Canada; and finally, enhancing a broader response to the HIV-AIDS epidemic and its underlying causes.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Public Health Agency supports specific projects in the Vancouver downtown east side: the Vancouver Native Health Society for a project that aims to reduce disparities in HIV treatment and care through community based initiatives; and the Western Aboriginal Harm Reduction Society to advance regional capacity building initiatives for non-reserve community based programing through workshops, training, outreach, community forums and discussions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the Positive Women Network is supported to increase access to integrated culturally relevant services by young HIV positive aboriginal women and other women in collaboration with other stakeholders. This will create a peer-driven, safe and supportive environment for young HIV positive women, particularly in the Vancouver downtown east side, and focus on a meaningful participation of these women in the direction of their own care, support and prevention initiatives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The network is also supported in the development of innovative programing and resources for women, their families and service providers. It develops culturally appropriate services for aboriginal women who face multiple barriers to care, treatment and support. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Persons with AIDS Society of British Columbia is being supported to assist its members on matters such as income security, will and estates, landlord and tenancy issues and human rights infringement. Staff and volunteers help clients prepare forms, understand procedures and, at times, accompany clients at tribunal hearings or appeals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888044"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Health Agency of Canada also supports five national projects, specifically targeting aboriginal communities and HIV-AIDS.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network's culturally appropriate harm reduction program development. The project objective is to develop national and regional capacity building initiatives from non-reserve aboriginal community based programing. This will be achieved by developing a harm reduction model targeting vulnerable populations, including at risk women and youth, inmates and two-spirited men developing training on using the model in creating a national aboriginal task force on injection drug use.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the Red Road HIV/AIDS Network Society's bloodlines project. This project objective is to provide an accurate, culturally relevant publication that includes meaningful educational information for aboriginal people living with HIV-AIDS and their family and friends, front line workers, health providers, program planners and policy-makers. The project objective will be achieved through launching <i>Bloodlines Magazine</i> nationally, which represents the voice of marginalized populations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888047"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is the Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network's Fostering Community Leadership to End HIV-AIDS Stigma and Discrimination Social Marketing campaign. The project objective is to increase levels of awareness and knowledge about HIV-AIDS among aboriginal leadership by at least 10% through social marketing principles.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project intends to end stigma and discrimination and create community environments that may become more responsive and conducive to establishing needed education, prevention, testing, diagnostic care, treatment and support programs. The project objective will be achieved through an initial social marketing campaign that is intended to speak to the basic principles of human rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888049"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth is the Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada's project titled, “Addressing the HIV Needs of Inuit in Urban Centres”. This project's objective is to improve the quality of life of Inuit infected with or affected by HIV by improving access to Inuit-centred prevention, diagnosis, care, treatment and support provided by AIDS service organizations, aboriginal and non-aboriginal-specific organizations, as well as other health, medical or social service providers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888050"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project objective will be achieved through the formation of an advisory committee, a literature review of HIV prevention, testing and diagnosis, care and support services currently available, interviews with Inuit men and women and through the identification of gaps and strategies to develop a best practice document and/or audiovisual teaching tool.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2230"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2230">(2230)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para888051"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth is a further Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network project. Its objective is to develop national and regional capacity building initiatives for a non-reserve aboriginal community based program. This will be achieved by developing a harm reduction model targeting vulnerable populations, developing training on using the model and creating a national aboriginal task force on injection drug use.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888052"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see, the government is working closely with aboriginal communities to support efforts that are and will continue to make a difference.</div>

Obviously he is reading from a long list of projects that have had some funding or will get some funding. I do not think anyone is disputing the fact that funding exists. Part of the debate we have had tonight is the fact that there is completely inadequate funding. Over the years, cuts have been made to the HIV-AIDS programs. Our organizations are struggling, whether it is within the aboriginal community, and I named some in my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A>, or elsewhere across the country. It also includes national organizations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888054"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The member tries to give us the illusion that his government is taking the right action and is providing the necessary supports and resources, and it is an illusion. If it were something that was having the right kind of impact, we would not be seeing the kinds of reports that have sparked this emergency debate. We would not see the four year study that Evan Wood did for the B.C. Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS in British Columbia. We would not see other studies come forward, showing an alarming increase in the rate of HIV-AIDS among injection drug users.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888055"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask the member to think about that and share with us whether the government has the commitment to realistically address those needs, whether it is through the health care system or through the provision of housing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888056"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to the question of Insite, the safe injection facility is a program that has worked. It has saved lives and helped people gain access to treatment . Yet it is operating with a great sense of insecurity about its future. It only has a temporary exemption from the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to operate until the end of June.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very reason there is an emergency is because public policy has failed. It has failed on many different levels. Therefore, I find the member's comments tonight to be very far from where we are in terms of reality.</div>

We certainly want to take action on it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust that during the comments I made my colleagues picked up on the number of times that I referred to community based. What is key is that we look to aboriginal groups, working in cooperation and collaboration with government, to provide programs that are culturally relevant and that have been recommended by aboriginal groups for aboriginal groups and then we will have a much greater chance of success.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that we have not had success in dealing with these issues and putting it on this government is somewhat unreasonable. We have been working at this for the last two years but this problem has not been with us for only two years. With the examples I have given, we are certainly taking it seriously and, as I said, working in collaboration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to address is on the question that was raised about the Insite model. A number of my colleagues in the NDP have referred to this and have implied that there is unanimous support for this model. , I do not take anything away from the democratic right of my colleagues in the NDP to recommend this as an effective model, that is what democracy is about, but it is very important that Canadians understand that there is not unanimous support for this type of treatment. In fact, I recall very vividly last year when a number of people from the Canadian Police Association visited my office and shared with me a number of concerns they had regarding the justice system in our country. One of the issues that is of concern to the Canadian Police Association is this very practice.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Nellie Cournoyea said in 1975 in the Status of Women report, speaking together, paternalism has been a total failure. It is again the treatment of our aboriginal people that has allowed us to show this growing gap in terms of health outcomes between average Canadians and our aboriginal peoples that puts our aboriginal peoples down at 67% and 62%, which would be in keeping with third world status.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was minister, I had the privilege of attending the launch of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health and I was proud to be there with Monique Bégin, Stephen Lewis and Sir Michael Marmot. As the minister, I had to speak to the embarrassment of the gap in health status between our aboriginal peoples. Health status must show total equality and not leave anybody behind.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last summer, we had to beg the Commission on Social Determinants of Health to come to Canada because it thought everything was okay here. When I spoke in Santiago about this embarrassing gap in health status for our aboriginal people, the commission could not believe what it saw in the downtown east side nor what it saw among our aboriginal peoples who have been through way too much in terms of paternalism.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888080"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess we on this side do believe that the Kelowna accord was an opportunity to turn this upside down. The accord was an 18 month process that was going to deal with health, housing and economic development, as well as education and accountability. This process involved aboriginal peoples and ended up with the signing of aboriginal leadership and of all the provinces and territories in order to really turn around this paternalism once and for all, and to begin the new beginning that was indeed the hope.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888081"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that it is impossible for people to stay well and to make healthy choices in their lives without a secure, personal and cultural identity. Our identity is what brings self-esteem and resilience, that in the determinants of health, poverty, violence, environment, shelter, equity and education, it takes the ground of a secure personal identity to help people make good decisions in terms of how they see themselves in eating well, exercising , gambling and using drugs and alcohol. It is that background that leads to the life in which a lot of the people in the downtown east side have found themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888082"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in the downtown east side one Sunday morning at 7:30. I walked around and talked to a few of the people there and looked into their faces. I guess I can never think, as a mother, that this could be my child or that this could be anybody's child. However, we know that they must have the same baby photos as our children have and that it just does not seem fair that something happened in terms of their upbringing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that 85% of the women in downtown Toronto, with Women's Own Detox Centre, have had some sort of child or sexual abuse. In terms of shopping bag ladies, it is probably well over 100% because that has happened to these people way more than once.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It means that they had to numb themselves and sometimes become addicted and ended up turning tricks in order to be able to sustain their habit. These people could never trust authority because the people who were supposed to be looking after them ended up abusing them. It ends up being that they have trouble with teachers, police and all kinds of people of authority, and that is where this begins.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888085"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that we continue this debate and we have this hugely important conversation tonight about how the country is still failing in actually getting the fundamentals right so that people can have secure childhoods.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight, I want to say that I had great hope that when Dr. Kellie Leitch had been appointed by the<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78772,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78772&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> health minister</A> to do a report on children, that her report would be the kind of comprehensive report that we knew was coming, that would deal with poverty, violence and all of the things affecting children that she knew so well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That report was supposed to be due in July 2007. I believe, because she did decide to put poverty and these other things that are not in the exact purview of a health minister in her report, that we are watching this report being suppressed and suppressed, and that this is again how the government just does not get it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not as if tonight's debate should be a surprise. Speaking about the general population, we could be talking about heart disease, type 2 diabetes, TB infection rates, smoking rates or suicide rates. Then we note that the proportion of AIDS is still climbing. This again speaks to this gap in terms of how the paternalism has not worked and having top down solutions and well intentioned colonials tell these people what to do and how to run their lives has got them and us into huge problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last number of years the kind of data that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A> pointed out to us has been there. The Epi update from the Public Health Agency last year and probably the year before and the year before that indicated that aboriginal people remain overrepresented in the HIV-AIDS epidemic in Canada. Among aboriginal Canadians the proportion of new HIV infections in 2005 was attributed to intravenous drug use. At 53% it was much higher than Canadians at 14%. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIV-AIDS has a significant impact on aboriginal women. During 1998 to 2006 women represented 48.1% of all positive HIV test reports among aboriginal people as compared to 20.7% of reports among non-aboriginal people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aboriginal people with a diagnosis of HIV tend to be younger than non-aboriginal people. Almost one-third, 32.4%, of the positive HIV tests of aboriginal people from 1998 to the end of 2006 were younger than 30 years as opposed to only 21% of these infected in non-aboriginal people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the “Burden of HIV Infection Among Aboriginal Injection Drug Users in Canada”, a report published in the American Journal of Public Health, it raised the attention of many people including the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A> and my colleagues. I think it is very important that we go to the conclusions of that report which called for culturally sensitive and an evidence-based response. I am afraid it is where our government has sorely let these people down.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888093"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a denial that harm reduction works and therefore, yet again, the government is choosing ideology over evidence. This is unbelievably irresponsible. The fact that Dr. Wood and Dr. Julio Montaner have said that the other need is for evidence-based response just compounds this error again and again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea that harm reduction would be taken out of the drug strategy was appalling to every member of the Canadian Medical Association last August. It was appalling and there are some tough questions for the minister, but the minister and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> still will not budge on this.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $100 million that was included in the first ministers accord in 2004 and was to be used directly for health human resources for aboriginal people seems to be missing. I have asked the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78772,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78772&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Health</A> about it.

The money is not there. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just think how many more nurses and physicians that money would have paid for, not to mention cultural sensitivity training for people in the health profession. That money would have helped to achieve the kind of care that Dr. Wood and many others have said time and time again just does not exist.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liz Evans, the head of Insite, gave a speech on Wednesday morning at the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions. She was clear when she said that aboriginal women are the toughest people to deal with in terms of needing cultural sensitivity. They are not able to separate themselves from a power differential in terms of a male going with them to treatment. This requires extraordinary training and extraordinary sensitivity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organization that she runs, which includes Insite, North America's only supervised injection site, is at risk. The community service program aims at providing support to people in Vancouver's downtown eastside. It offers support in hotels and houses as well as a range of programs and services, including a low income community bank, dental clinic, community cafe, laundromat, drug user's life skills centre, and a needle exchange program. These are successful. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my patients are still on the street. It takes time to build a relationship with them to make them feel safe. It takes time before they finally ask for help. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus my remarks on the government's track record on HIV-AIDS and its total inability to comprehend the social determinants of health.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theme for this year's world AIDS conference was “Stop AIDS: Keep the Promise”. Stopping AIDS in this country is going to take us stopping Steve. Stopping AIDS requires education, prevention, a vaccine, and hopefully, some day a cure. However, it is clear that this year's theme was lost on the Conservative government. I only see broken promises about creating an effective and accountable HIV prevention program in the coming years. Yet again, ideology is trumping evidence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's track record on HIV-AIDS is abysmal. From the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister's</A> refusal to attend the international AIDS conference, to the elimination of harm reduction strategies, to the slashing of community support programs, the Conservative government has preferred ideology over sound public health policy based on evidence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These decisions are especially offensive because they have come at a time when HIV rates are rising and our most vulnerable populations, such as aboriginal groups, need our help the most, and yet the government cannot help but cut programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control at the Public Health Agency of Canada tells us that more Canadians are living with HIV-AIDS, an estimated 58,000 at the end of 2005 compared with 50,000 at the end of 2002. An estimated 2,300 to 4,500 new HIV infections occurred in 2005 compared to 2,100 to 4,000 in 2002, and yet the government is cutting the programs that prevent it. People would rather not get AIDS. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand how, in spite of rising numbers, the government decides to cut programs. It is not that we are doing well. The government is cutting when we are doing terribly with respect to our most vulnerable people, our aboriginal population, and the people that tonight's debate is about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is astounding to me that in the main estimates for 2006-07, under public health agencies, it says there has been a steep increase in sexually transmitted infections over the last decade and rising co-infections of HIV with diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis C, and syphilis. Yet, the government is cutting programs. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T2255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2255"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2255">(2255)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para888107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 58,000 Canadians now living with the illness and the thousands of Canadians who will become infected every year, we cannot stop the clock on AIDS. Prevention and support services matter more than ever and yet the government is cutting $15 million out of the program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888108"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last fall, the United Nations announced that AIDS rates in developed countries will spike if governments drop their guard. This government has dropped its guard and it has dropped $15 million out of a program that was promised in the base budget. Shockingly, the minister has admitted this in terms of borrowing the money to be able to match the Gates money. Surely this is completely different than what the Gates foundation presumed in its promise of the money. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just cannot believe that the government can think that the people of Canada are so stupid as to think that it is okay to take cut money from community prevention programs and the supports and services to people living with AIDS at a time when the numbers are going up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888110"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ontario, our community AIDS programs have been cut by 60%. In British Columbia, we do not even know, and yet its money is going to run out at the end of next month. We have been told that this disproportionate cut was just because Ontario came to the plate first. Just coming to the plate first does not mean that these people in British Columbia and in all the other provinces are going to take their hits too because $15 million is missing from the program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888111"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the silence from the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78772,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78772&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Health</A> that shocks me. After the minister had promised that the new funding levels would be announced early in the new year, how can the government continue to cut? How can these community organizations go on? They have to lay off people. They have no idea how much money they will be receiving at the end of the month. They have no idea where this $15 million will be coming from. It is not surprising that the members for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A> and <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78713,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78713&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver Centre</A> are worried.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888112"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be very clear. AIDS service organizations have never received a reduction in AIDS funding under any prior government or administration. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78936,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78936&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Yellowhead</A> who spoke tonight was part of the health committee that said that the funding had to go up, and yet he is quiet when his government is cutting $15 million out of the community funds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are untimely, irresponsible cuts and are unprecedented firsts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888114"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surge in HIV-AIDS rates among Vancouver's aboriginal drug users is especially distressing. It is the big F on our report card in terms of how we are doing. We know our aboriginal people are at higher risk for HIV-AIDS infections and we know that IV drug users are also at greater risk. This is a compounded problem and now we are seeing the increasing gap in terms of aboriginal and non-aboriginal drug users.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888115"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para888116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the researcher in the paper said, this is a tragedy. Many people in the aboriginal community are reaching out for care and the care just is not there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned that the government is turning a blind eye. It is because of ideology instead of evidence. The government is insisting on saying this is about law enforcement. I am proud to say that we, as the previous Liberal government, gave $1.5 million to support the evaluation of the three year pilot for Insite. I am pleased that there have been a series of reports that show that it works and that the government has had to be backed into making little tiny extensions, and accepts that this is a program that needs to be there, but it needs to be all across this country, not just in Vancouver. It is astounding that these people will not listen.</div>

The residential schools agreement was signed by Irwin Cotler and Andy Scott. The day I was sworn into cabinet we made sure that we put the hepatitis C agreement on the road and that those negotiations took place. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so saddened by the government's approach. In some of our prisons 50% of the inmates have hepatitis C. If the parliamentary secretary cared about people with hepatitis C you would be pushing to have needle exchanges in those prisons. </div>

    </p><a name="Para888140"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Wood's paper, as the member has said, speaks in terms of the availability of culturally sensitive supports and services and care as well as evidence based results.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liz Evans was able to tell us that not one death in all of those visits to Insite is an extraordinary success. People can live long enough to have a bit of hope and maybe get some help, but they are still alive, thanks to the Insite program. </div>

Men, women and children of all ages and socio-economic backgrounds can be impacted by HIV-AIDS. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The epidemic is most entrenched, however, among vulnerable populations, including aboriginal people. In fact, aboriginal people are among the most HIV vulnerable groups in Canada and are over-represented in this epidemic. Although they represented only 3.3% of the population in Canada, aboriginal persons comprised approximately 7.5% of the prevalent infections and 9% of new HIV infections in Canada in 2005. Injection drug use continues to be a key mode of HIV transmission in the aboriginal community. HIV-AIDS has a significant impact on aboriginal women. Aboriginal people are being infected with HIV at a younger age compared to non-aboriginal people. In 2005, the overall HIV infection rate among aboriginal persons was estimated to be 2.8 times higher than those of non-aboriginal persons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These facts cry out for all concerned in government and health organizations. We need to take action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government recognizes that HIV-AIDS in aboriginal communities remains an ongoing problem and we are taking action to deal with it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada will invest more than $84 million toward HIV-AIDS in 2008-09, more than has ever been spent in our nation's history. These investments will support both the federal initiative to address HIV-AIDS in Canada and the Canadian HIV vaccine initiative, investments that will continue to grow over time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our federal initiative, our government has identified HIV-AIDS in aboriginal communities as a key priority. Our government's federal initiative has two aboriginal specific funding programs supporting community effort. Hardly paternal, as was the allegation from the opposition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-reserve first nation, Inuit and Métis communities HIV-AIDS project fund is working toward the reduction of HIV incidents and facilitates access to diagnosis, treatment and social support for aboriginal people living with HIV-AIDS in urban areas across Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The specific populations HIV-AIDS initiative fund is addressing national policy and program priorities for people living with HIV-AIDS.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, for first nations living on reserve and some Inuit communities, this fiscal year Health Canada is investing $5.8 million, representing an increase of $400,000 over the previous fiscal year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mandate of the on reserve HIV-AIDS program is to provide HIV-AIDS education, prevention and related health services to first nations on reserve and some Inuit communities. The overall goal of this program is to work in partnership with first nations and Inuit communities to prevent HIV-AIDS transmission and support the care of those impacted by HIV-AIDS.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is not all. In August 2006, Health Canada provided support to help plan and implement the international indigenous peoples satellite conference, an affiliated event of the 16th international AIDS conference.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also provided support for the attendance of up to 51 on reserve first nations people living with HIV-AIDS.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888162"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to support Aboriginal AIDS Awareness Week and the ongoing work of the Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network, the Canadian Inuit HIV/AIDS Network, the National Aboriginal Committee on HIV/AIDS and other similar community level organizations. Hardly paternal, as was the previous government's approach.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, HIV-AIDS knows no boundaries. HIV is having a significant impact on aboriginal women and aboriginal youth. Aboriginal people are being infected at a younger age than non-aboriginal people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost half of the reported HIV cases among aboriginal people are among women. HIV infection appears to occur at a younger age in aboriginal women than the rest of the Canadian population, and young women under the age of 30 constitute a large proportion of the reported HIV-AIDS cases in the aboriginal community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the federal initiative to address HIV-AIDS in Canada, youth have been identified as a priority. The Government of Canada supports national partner organizations such as the Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network and the Assembly of First Nations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educational resources targeting women have been developed by our partner organizations. We are doing this to keep aboriginal families safe. This also means protecting the communities in which they live.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that certain factors such as poverty, sexually transmitted diseases, limited access to health services, and of course substance abuse, including injection drug use, have increased the vulnerability of many aboriginal Canadians to HIV. In fact, injection drug use has accounted for approximately half of AIDS cases in aboriginal peoples since 1998.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Dr. Evan Wood, a research scientist at the B.C. Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, aboriginal drug users living in Vancouver's downtown eastside are contracting HIV-AIDS at twice the rate of non-aboriginal users. Dr. Wood's research shows that 18.5% of aboriginal men and women who inject cocaine and heroin become HIV positive. That compares with 9.5% of non-aboriginal intravenous drug users.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To adequately address this problem, it is critical that all levels of government work together to improve living conditions for aboriginal people living in the Vancouver downtown eastside. Under the Public Health Agency of Canada's non-reserve first nation, Inuit and Métis communities HIV and AIDS project fund, two projects have targeted this district specifically. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the Vancouver Native Health Society's project, which aims to enhance sexual health, reduce drug use and create social support for those infected with HIV-AIDS. The second is the Western Aboriginal Harm Reduction Society, which also aims to enhance sexual health, reduce injection drug use and advance regional capacity building initiatives for non-reserve aboriginal community-based programing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nationally, our government is working to ensure that communities are safe, clean and of course drug free. This is done through our country's national anti-drug strategy. Last October, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> of Canada announced the launch of the national anti-drug strategy, a strategy that places emphasis on educating Canadians, especially young people and their parents, about the negative effects of drug use.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888172"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An anti-drug strategy like this one has long been overdue in Canada. Our government is serious about implementing effective change to keep our communities safe from illegal drug use. We are concerned about the damage and pain these drugs cause families. We intend to reverse that trend.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888173"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why our government has committed to a strategy that will prevent illegal drug use from corrupting our youth, affecting our families and communities, and fueling organized crime and gangs. I am proud to say that we are delivering on our plan and achieving great results.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada is working hard to address HIV-AIDS in aboriginal populations across the country. We know that the issue continues to be a prominent one, one that requires a great deal of attention from governments at all levels.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888175"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our government is delivering on its commitments to keep all Canadians safe and healthy no matter where they reside in Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also allows me an opportunity to reflect on the debate this evening. We have heard many different points of view. I would like to recognize the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A> for bringing this to the floor of the House of Commons. </div>
    </p><a name="Para888177"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see tonight, although there may be different points of view, we all agree that there is a problem and that we all have to work together to come to a solution. This is one of the great things that Canada brings to the table when it comes to solution seeking: the democratic process. That is what we have seen here tonight.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888178"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have seen a debate of ideas. I know that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78772,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78772&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">health minister</A> is listening. I know that Canadians from coast to coast to coast who are watching this debate or who will read about it in <i>Hansard</i> will provide suggestions, and the government will listen and take action because that is the record of this government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888179"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need only look at the residential schools compensation, the hepatitis C compensation, the government's historic efforts to bring first nations people on reserve into the Human Rights Act, the tens of millions of dollars that have been invested in bringing clean water to first nations to improve their lives, and the hundreds of millions of dollars that are going to housing projects across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888180"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it will take a multi-party, multi-citizen and multi-government effort to empower individuals to make the best decisions for themselves. I know that this government looks forward to working with everyone to ensure that all people have the opportunity to be fulfilled as human beings and Canadians.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the debate tonight, I do think it has been a helpful debate. Whenever we can bring light to the serious challenges that face Canadians, in this case a specific community, that is a good thing.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could talk about the $270 million in our new homelessness partnership strategy to prevent and reduce homelessness, the $300 million dedicated to the development of first nations market housing, a fund to support market housing approaches for first nations communities, and our efforts to include all first nations people so they can share and enjoy all the human rights we all share here in this House.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing we heard tonight is that this is not just isolated to Vancouver.

    </p><a name="Para888192"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard a number of figures being presented tonight of investments and interventions that were made by the previous government and by ours. In light of the grave issues that we are faced with, I wonder if the parliamentary secretary could sum up by commenting on where the substantive evidence or the substantive data might be that would suggest that these interventions that Canada's previous governments and current governments have been making are in any way helping to stem this menace to health in the neighbourhoods like the east side of Vancouver.</div>

    </p><a name="Para888195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has, for example, increased the funding for the urban aboriginal strategy to over $68 million over the next five years. We are also trying to include first nations people on reserves in the human rights legislation. I think many Canadians would be shocked to find out that first nations people on reserve are not included. It seems mind-boggling that anyone in Canada would not enjoy the same human rights that every parliamentarian does.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In budget 2007 we have made announcements dealing with low income families through the working income tax benefit for example. We have announced a new labour market approach that will focus on enhancing the participation of groups more vulnerable to low incomes, such as persons with disabilities, aboriginal Canadians and older workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para888197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a $500 million labour market program that will provide employment support for those not currently covered by EI. We have funding for the aboriginal skills and employment partnership, which will support aboriginal Canadians and that has been doubled. </div>
