General of Canada)</B> moved that Bill C-18, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code (impaired driving causing death and other matters), 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
with Bill C-18 of the present session and Bill C-82 of the 
previous session, the government has responded positively to 
every one of the 10 recommendations made by the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights for specific amendments to 
Criminal Code provisions related to impaired driving. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1997, the House of Commons directed the standing 
committee to review the impaired driving provisions of the 
Criminal Code.  On May 25, 1999 the committee tabled its report 
entitled “Toward Eliminating Impaired Driving” with an appended 
draft bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within two weeks of receiving that report, the government 
introduced Bill C-82, which was fast-tracked and given royal 
assent, as amended, on June 17, 1999. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As tabled, Bill C-82 followed very closely the draft bill which 
the standing committee had appended to its report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to achieve speedy passage, the provision raising the 
maximum penalty for impaired driving causing death to life 
imprisonment was removed from Bill C-82 and placed in Bill C-87. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-82 came into force on July 1, 1999.  With prorogation, 
Bill C-87 died on the order paper.  The government committed 
itself to reintroducing in this session the provision that was 
found within Bill C-87. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-82 amended seven penalty provisions and one investigation 
provision as follows.  It increased the minimum fine for impaired 
driving offences to $600.  It raised the minimum driving 
prohibitions for all impaired driving offenders and increased the 
maximum driving prohibitions for second and subsequent offenders. 
The bill specified that judges must consider a blood alcohol 
concentration reading above 160 milligrams per cent as an 
aggravating factor in sentencing. 
It specified that a judge may make a probation order for 
assessment and treatment in relation to addiction in a 
jurisdiction that has such a program.  The bill also specified 
that a judge may make a probation order for ignition interlock 
use in a jurisdiction that has such a program.  It introduced a 
new maximum penalty of 10 years of imprisonment for leaving the 
scene of an accident knowing that someone was injured.  It also 
introduced a new maximum penalty of life imprisonment for leaving 
the scene of an accident knowing that there was a death or an 
injury and not caring whether death ensued and death did ensue. 
It raised the maximum penalty for driving while disqualified to 
five years of imprisonment where the crown elects to proceed by 
indictment.  Finally, the bill extended the period from two hours 
to three hours during which an officer with reasonable grounds to 
believe an impaired driving offence had occurred can demand a 
breath sample.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 follows through on the government's commitment to 
reintroduce the provision found in Bill C-87.  It would raise the 
maximum penalty for impaired driving causing death from 14 years 
to life imprisonment, as recommended by the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights in its report.  This maximum penalty 
would equal the maximum penalty for the offences of manslaughter 
and for criminal negligence causing death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A maximum penalty is reserved for cases involving the worst 
offender in the worst factual circumstances.  However, even when 
considering the appropriate sentences for offenders who are not 
sentenced to the maximum penalty, the courts can consider the 
fact that the maximum penalty for an offence has been raised and 
adjust the penalty accordingly.  This amendment will contribute 
to the message that still needs to be sent:  society will not 
tolerate impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another amendment in Bill C-18 that implements the 
positive response by the government to a recommendation made by 
the standing committee in its report “Toward Eliminating 
Impaired Driving”.  This is an amendment that would add drugs to 
section 256 of the criminal code as a basis upon which a peace 
officer may seek a warrant to obtain a blood sample.  Currently, 
the warrant may only be sought where the officer reasonably 
believes that a driver committed an impaired driving offence 
involving alcohol, in circumstances involving an injury or a 
death, and where the driver is unable to consent to the taking of 
a blood sample.  This will add to the tools that peace officers 
may use in investigating certain drug impaired driving offences 
committed in violation of paragraph 253(a) of the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides meeting commitments for specific legislative changes 
made by the government on October 22, 1999, when it tabled its 
response to the report of the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights, Bill C-18 also contains two provisions that are 
technical in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of these would amend the French definition of a motor 
vehicle found in section 2 of the criminal code to accord with 
the English definition, which excludes vehicles propelled by 
means of muscular power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other technical amendment will delete the offence of driving 
while disqualified from the list of indictable offences found in 
section 553 of the code that come within the absolute 
jurisdiction of a provincial court judge.  This is necessary 
because Bill C-82 raised the maximum penalty for driving while 
disqualified from two years to five years of imprisonment where 
the crown proceeds by indictment.  The charter provides the right 
to a jury trial for an offence carrying a maximum penalty of five 
years or more.  Therefore, the amendment in Bill C-18 will ensure 
that section 553 is in compliance with the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not naively believe when it put forward the 
amendments contained in Bill C-82 that criminal code changes by 
themselves would eliminate all incidents of impaired driving. Nor 
was the standing committee naive in makings its proposals. The 
criminal law must do its part in the struggle against impaired 
driving; however, other systems must also fulfill their important 
parts.  Governments, many public and private organizations, 
families and individuals have contributed to a real shift in 
public attitudes toward impaired driving over a period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, despite significant reductions over the past decade in 
the percentage of fatally injured drivers who have a blood 
alcohol concentration exceeding the legal limit, the remaining 
extent of impaired driving is still an enormous problem.  The 
government will continue to work with other governments and 
organizations to combat impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to continuing work in the field of criminal law, 
prevention and educational work related to impaired driving is 
carried out by Health Canada as part of Canada's national drug 
strategy.  Improving road safety measures to fight impaired 
driving is an important aspect of work carried out by Transport 
Canada.  If we have learned anything from the standing 
committee's review of the impaired driving provisions, it is that 
individuals and organizations are working with various levels of 
government and police agencies to develop a combination of 
countermeasures that will eliminate impaired driving. 
It has been a pleasure to observe parliamentarians of all 
political stripes laying aside partisan politics and working 
together in order to address the serious problem of impaired 
driving.  I wish especially to thank all members of the standing 
committee for their hard work in writing a report and drafting 
legislation to meet a common goal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also gratifying to see the extent of public interest and 
participation in the development of criminal law responses to 
impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we may not all agree on every measure that has been 
proposed to eliminate impaired driving, together we have taken 
some important steps which improve the criminal law and 
contribute to the combination of measures aimed against impaired 
driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that members of the House give their support to Bill C-18 
which responds to the standing committee's remaining two 
recommendations for specific criminal code amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to Bill C-18.  I heard the member opposite 
applaud the standing committee and the work it has done.  I too 
concur that the work that has been done on this particular bill 
is very positive and serves to protect the lives of Canadians 
from the tragedy of harm and death that can come from impaired 
driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular bill, as the member opposite has just stated, is 
intended to increase the maximum penalty for impaired driving 
causing death to life imprisonment, providing for the taking of 
blood samples for the purposes of testing for the presence of a 
drug and making a number of other amendments as detailed here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw attention to the excellent work of my colleague 
from Prince George—Bulkley Valley on this particular initiative 
and the long persistent road that he has been on to bring this 
forward to the House of Commons.  The very reason that this issue 
was even before the standing committee was largely due to the 
result, effort and the determination of one particular member of 
the Reform Party, the member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me allow the House to reflect, and those watching today, on 
the long road it has travelled to actually get this bill to the 
House here today.  It was more than three years ago, February 
1996, that a private member's bill was put forward by the member 
for Prince George—Bulkley Valley with the Reform Party, Bill 
C-201.  It was an act to amend the criminal code to provide for a 
seven year minimum sentence for those convicted of impaired 
driving causing death.  At that time there was no minimum jail 
term.  The maximum sentence was unclear.  The bill was defeated 
in the House by a margin of 31 votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you might think that might be the end of the story, 
that the hon. member might have quit there after having finally 
got his bill to the floor and votable, which is not an easy thing 
to do in the House.  There is a long series of lotteries, in 
effect, that one has to go through to get to that point.  He got 
his bill to the floor with great public support and yet it was 
defeated in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was not going to deter the member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley.  On December 2, 1996, because of the 
great public support for what he was doing, he proposed a private 
member's motion, M-78.  The motion read that pursuant to Standing 
Order 68(4)(a), the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights be instructed to prepare and bring in a bill to amend 
those sections of the criminal code which deal with impaired 
driving in order to (a) enhance deterrents and (b) ensure that 
the penalties reflect the seriousness of the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not give up on the bill and he went ahead with a motion. 
That motion then was unanimously adopted by the House of Commons 
on February 7, 1997, a year after he had started this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That started the ball rolling in a sense here in the House of 
Commons.  On October 30, 1997, another motion, M-78, was 
introduced as an opposition day motion.  Nothing really happened 
on the first motion but to keep the pressure on, this member 
again brought it forward in our caucus.  He brought it forward as 
an opposition day motion.  The member for Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley proposed Motion No. M-78, which again asked for the 
unanimous consent of the House and with further instruction that 
the justice committee carry out a review and report back to the 
House of Commons with legislation by May 15, 1998. 
Unfortunately, the government took no action at all even though 
that motion was given unanimous consent.  Nothing happened even 
though it was approved by the House of Commons.  There was no 
movement by the government opposite.  There may be a variety of 
reasons for that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main thing here that was important to people who supported 
this initiative of the Reform Party member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley was that they wanted to see some action 
and there was none.  It was not until the fall of 1998 that an 
extension to the deadline was agreed to just to keep it alive 
until November 30, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was because of not wanting to let this die, because we wanted 
to keep it alive, the member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley 
negotiated to extend the deadline to May 15, 1999.  More than 
three years from when he started this initiative he would not let 
go of this much needed legislation to protect the innocent from 
the damaging and sometimes life terminating effects of drunk 
driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee conducted hearings throughout February and March, 
1999 and tabled its report in the House in late May.  The 
resulting legislation, Bill C-82, which was part of a package, 
was passed by the House and came into effect on July 1, 1999.  It 
was a long road to see a good section of what was called for by 
the member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley.  It was 
strengthened, admittedly, by the committee and was adopted by the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 1 the bill we are debating today was introduced, 
Bill C-18.  It deals with some sections that some members of the 
House were not comfortable having included in Bill C-82.  We are 
moving ahead today on Bill C-18.  We are hopeful that Bill C-18 
will be passed by the House and this will complete the long road 
that the Reform Party, led by the member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley, has championed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole persistent determination to see good legislation 
brought forward to protect Canadians and the lives of Canadians 
by a member of the Reform Party reminds me of other pieces of 
legislation that this party has brought forward in the House and 
has caused changes to occur that have subsequently been adopted 
and championed as their own by the Liberal Party opposite.  I do 
not begrudge that.  I suppose that is part of the dynamics here. 
But today I want to reflect on some of the other impacts the 
opposition has had on positive legislation in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, some of the changes to the Young Offenders Act that 
have occurred recently in the new youth criminal justice act were 
largely brought about by members of our party.  I know there are 
many members opposite who would agree with that.  The requirement 
to have parents in the courtroom when juveniles are being 
sentenced is an initiative of the Reform Party.  The requirement 
to have some degree of accountability for parents when a charged 
youth is released into their custody was an initiative of the 
Reform Party that has been adopted in the youth criminal justice 
act.  There are many other initiatives as well.  I suspect we 
would not even have seen the changes to the youth criminal 
justice act that are being proposed had it not been for the 
pressure that was put forward by members of the Reform Party 
responding to the concerns of the public, of grassroots 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all celebrating a balanced budget but I can remember back 
in 1998 looking at the information put forward by the Reform 
Party that showed a huge debt hole that had been dug by previous 
Tory and Liberal administrations.  Just as Bill C-18 and Bill 
C-82 were initiatives of members of the Reform Party, so it was 
that it was the Reform Party responding to the deep debt that had 
been incurred by these previous governments that pressured for 
balanced budgets which today we have.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a bill that was designed to better protect children from 
sex offenders, particularly when those sex offenders want to work 
for an institution that cares for children, allowing these 
institutions or volunteer organizations to better do a complete 
assessment if there was any record of this person who wants to 
work with that organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That bill was passed by the House twice, made it through 
committee and, in fact, went on to the Senate. Unfortunately, 
after prorogation I do not believe that bill has been resubmitted 
by the Liberal government into the Senate and it now floats in 
the ozone.  However, that does not mean we are going to give up 
on it.  Again, a particular initiative brought forward by the 
official opposition to better protect children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, another member of our party brought forward the whole 
initiative on organ donation, organ transplants and saving of 
lives through appropriate legislation to allow for that activity. 
Once more the Liberal government has responded to another good 
idea from the Reform Party and the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One I know we will all remember, it is recent, is the call right 
across the country from families calling for fair family 
taxation.  Last year we had a public outcry from those tired of 
tax policies that discriminate against certain family choices of 
child care.  There was a call by single income parents across the 
country for fair family taxation so that the dollars and the 
choices are left in the hands of parents.  What happened with 
that was it forced the subcommittee of finance to actually look 
at this whole issue.  A report came out of that committee that 
contained a number of good recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, that whole issue was brought forward and brought to light 
in the House through the Reform Party responding to public 
pressure from across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me return to Bill C-18.  I want to conclude my comments by 
applauding again the Reform Party member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley who met with the Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving from coast to coast and attended many of their meetings. 
He brought forward their issues in the House during question 
period and during statement time as well as their petitions from 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of things that demand our time here in the House 
of Commons.  He could have chosen to do other things, but he 
responded to the outcry of parents who have had children killed 
or spouses maimed by drunk drivers.  He said “No, I am not going 
to let this go”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He persisted until today we have legislation in the form of Bill 
C-82 that has been passed by this House and is going on to be 
made law, and now Bill C-18 to complete the package.  It makes me 
proud to stand among my peers in the Reform Party.  We are 
responding to the concerns of the grassroots.  We are bringing 
forward issues and getting them into committee where they can be 
heard by committee members and witnesses can be brought forward. 
In effect it demonstrates that, collectively, in the House when 
we can get a good idea into committee and the members opposite 
hear the witnesses, it can result in excellent legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I applaud the member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley 
and the Reform Party for the leadership shown on this particular 
issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider it a privilege to speak on Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, what we are debating is not the seriousness of the 
offence of impaired driving causing death.  We all agree that 
this is unacceptable, and ought never to happen, absolutely 
never. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not one member of this House would contradict the Minister of 
Justice on that point. 
Every parliamentarian sympathizes with the victims of the 
horrible negligence suffered by some of our fellow citizens. 
This is why we must fight this unforgivable excess, which takes 
away too many innocent lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as there are victims of impaired drivers, something must 
be done.  The problem must be addressed directly.  There can be 
no hiding behind easy measures.  As long as the statistics show 
there are victims, the Bloc Quebecois will take an interest in 
the issue, try to prove certain approaches and work on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, today the objective of the legislation is not my 
problem.  The objective is a good one.  I support it. 
My problem is not with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all want to reduce the number of deaths on our roads, and as 
quickly as possible, but the means to this end proposed by the 
Minister of Justice are inappropriate, unacceptable even.  The 
minister's approach is too simplistic.  I would say even that 
the minister's approach is quite senseless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the minister is claiming is not too complicated.  I would 
say even that it is so uncomplicated as to be irresponsible. 
She simply says “Pass this bill.  Let us impose life 
imprisonment and the number of highway deaths will drop”.  That 
is magical thinking but it is pretty simplistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-18, the Minister of Justice intimates that 
incarceration is effective in the fight against impaired driving . 
According to her, the threat of life imprisonment should have a 
direct influence on the behaviour of potentially dangerous 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her opinion—and Mr. Speaker I am sure you fully agree with 
me because you are a very wise man—the risk of getting life 
imprisonment instead of a 14 year sentence would have an impact 
on the behaviour of uncle Joe or cousin Pete who, for example, 
partied a little too hard at Christmas or New Year. The minister 
is saying “Let us send a clear message to the public”. One 
wonders whether the minister is not confusing the terms message 
with cheap publicity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either way, such a communication plan could end up costing us 
dearly in the long term, particularly since there is absolutely 
no guarantee that it will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, Bill C-18 should trigger a substantive debate on the 
excessive use of incarceration by this government. We have here 
a government that chooses the easy way, the simple way out. The 
equation used by the government, particularly since the current 
Minister of Justice was appointed, is the following one: 
seriousness of offence plus pressure from the right 
automatically equals unjustified extension of jail terms. This 
is some formula coming from a Minister of Justice. 
Unfortunately, this is what the Liberal government has got us 
used to in recent years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that those who oppose this simplistic 
approach are not always making friends, but I am not in politics 
primarily to make friends. I am in politics to get messages 
across, to make common sense prevail, to remind the government 
opposite that it is going in the wrong direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who oppose this simplistic approach are being 
accused of lacking compassion for the victims and of 
systematically siding with the accused, which is not the case, 
of course. Those who are aware of what goes on in the Standing 
Committee on Justice know very well that this is not the case. 
The opponents of the doctrine of law and order are also accused 
of being soft on law.  If the responsible approach being taken 
by the Bloc Quebecois is synonymous with being soft on law, the 
Bloc Quebecois is only too glad to be so labelled, particularly 
as it is not alone in advocating a responsible approach to 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, the supreme court had occasion to warn the public and 
the Liberal government in particular about overreliance on jail 
sentences as a means of reducing crime-related problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes of my speech to quote the 
Supreme Court of Canada on some extremely important matters, 
because it is clear from Bill C-18 and all the bills the Minister 
of Justice is introducing lately, including the young offenders 
bill, that the minister and the government have not read this 
extremely important decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to the Gladue decision handed down last year by 
the judges of the supreme court, some of whom, including Justice 
Cory, put the federal government on trial for its sentencing 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members might wish to make a note of the Gladue 
decision, and take a look at it, because it is very important 
and the Liberal government might perhaps change its approach to 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will therefore read an important part of the Gladue 
decision dealing with what the court described as “the problem 
of overincarceration in Canada”.  The excerpt I would like to 
read goes as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a world leader in many fields, particularly in the 
areas of progressive social policy and human rights. 
Unfortunately, our country is also distinguished as being a 
world leader in putting people in prison. 
Although the United States has by far the highest rate of 
incarceration among industrialized democracies, at over 600 
inmates per 100,000 population, Canada's rate of approximately 
130 inmates per 100,000 population places it second or third 
highest. Moreover, the rate at which Canadian courts have been 
imprisoning offenders has risen sharply in recent years, 
although there has been a slight decline of late. This record of 
incarceration rates obviously cannot instil a sense of pride. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the Bloc Quebecois member for Berthier—Montcalm, but 
a justice of the Supreme Court of Canada who is saying that 
“This record of incarceration rates obviously cannot instil a 
sense of pride”. The decision then reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The systematic use of the sanction of imprisonment in Canada may 
be dated to the building of the Kingston Penitentiary in 1835. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this has no link whatsoever with the Chair, but there was 
certainly something political in all of this, because if a 
prison was built in Kingston, it had to filled up. Therefore, 
people had to be sent to prison. This is not the supreme court 
justice talking, but the member for Berthier—Montcalm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now back to the decision: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The penitentiary sentence was itself originally conceived as an 
alternative to the harsher penalties of death, flogging, or 
imprisonment in a local jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sentencing reformers advocated the use of penitentiary 
imprisonment as having effects which were not only deterrent, 
denunciatory, and preventive, but also rehabilitative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>with long hours spent in contemplation and hard work contributing to the 
betterment of the offender. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, things have changed since that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding its idealistic origins, imprisonment quickly 
came to be condemned as harsh and ineffective, not only in 
relation to its purported rehabilitative goals, but also in 
relation to its broader public goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of Canadian commentary regarding the use and 
effectiveness of imprisonment as a sanction was recently well 
summarized by Vancise J.A., dissenting in the Saskatchewan Court 
of Appeal in <I>McDonald</I>, <I>supra.</I> 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This justice said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of inquiries and commissions have been held in this 
country to examine, among other things, the effectiveness of the 
use of incarceration in sentencing. There has been at least one 
commission or inquiry into the use of imprisonment in each 
decade of this century since 1914. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, I would like the members opposite to listen very 
closely. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An examination of the recommendations of these reports reveals 
one constant theme: imprisonment should be avoided if possible 
and should be reserved for the most serious offences, 
particularly those involving violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They all recommend 
restraint in the use of incarceration and recognize that 
incarceration has failed to reduce the crime rate and should be 
used with caution and moderation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imprisonment has failed to 
satisfy a basic function of the Canadian judicial system which 
was described in the Report of the Canadian Committee on 
Corrections entitled: “Toward Unity: Criminal Justice and 
Corrections” (1969) 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As “to protect society from crime in a 
manner commanding public support while avoiding needless injury 
to the offender”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court continues its analysis and says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada does not imprison as high a portion of its population as 
does the United States. However, we do imprison more people than 
most other western democracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code displays an 
apparent bias toward the use of incarceration since for most 
offences the penalty indicated is expressed in terms of a 
maximum term of imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of difficulties arise if 
imprisonment is perceived to be the preferred sanction for most 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps most significant is that although we regularly impose 
this most onerous and expensive sanction, it accomplishes very 
little— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat “accomplishes very little”.  This is in reference to 
imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court continues: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—apart from separating offenders from society for a period of 
time. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past few decades many groups and federally 
appointed committees and commissions given the responsibility of 
studying various aspects of the criminal justice system have 
argued that imprisonment should be used only as a last resort. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important and it is the justices of the supreme court 
who are saying so.  They go on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With equal force, in Taking Responsibility the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Solicitor General stated— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is in 1988, not many years ago.  The committee said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now generally recognized that imprisonment has not been 
effective in rehabilitating or reforming offenders, has not been 
shown to be a strong deterrent, and has achieved only temporary 
public protection and uneven retribution, as the lengths of 
prison sentences handed down vary for the same type of crime. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They go on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since imprisonment generally offers the public protection from 
criminal behaviour for only a limited time, rehabilitation of 
the offender is of great importance. However, prisons have not 
generally been effective in reforming their inmates, as the high 
incidence of recidivism among prison populations shows.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the conclusions of a House of Commons committee, which 
are quoted in the supreme court decision. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of imprisonment as a main response to a wide variety of 
offences against the law is not a tenable approach in practical 
terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most offenders are neither violent nor dangerous. Their 
behaviour is not likely to be improved by the prison experience. 
In addition, their growing numbers in jails and penitentiaries 
entail serious problems of expense and administration, and 
possibly increased future risks to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, modern technology may now permit the monitoring in the 
community of some offenders who previously might have been 
incarcerated for incapacitation or denunciation purposes. 
Alternatives to imprisonment and intermediate sanctions, 
therefore, are increasingly viewed as necessary developments. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee proposed that alternative forms of sentencing 
should be considered for those offenders who did not endanger 
the safety of others. It was put in this way, at pages 50 and 54 
of the report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the primary foci of such alternatives must be on 
techniques which contribute to offenders accepting 
responsibility for their criminal conduct and, through their 
subsequent behaviour, demonstrating efforts to restore the 
victim to the position he or she was in prior to the offence 
and/or providing a meaningful apology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except where to do so would place the community at undue risk, 
the “correction” of the offender should take place in the 
community and imprisonment should be used with restraint. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now go back to the decision by the Supreme Court of Canada, 
which concluded thus: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, it may be seen that although imprisonment is intended to 
serve the traditional sentencing goals of separation, 
deterrence, denunciation, and rehabilitation, there is 
widespread consensus that imprisonment has not been successful 
in achieving some of these goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overincarceration is a 
long-standing problem that has been many times publicly 
acknowledged but never addressed in a systematic manner by 
Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen, the Supreme Court of Canada, superior court 
justices in certain provinces and parliamentary committees have 
studied this issue over the last 30 years. Recently, in the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, which includes 
the Department of Justice and the Solicitor General of Canada, 
everyone agreed that putting people in jail is not the solution. 
We have to find other ways of dealing with the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister had the opportunity to show us that she had learned 
something from these 30 years of study, that she had 
understood the direction suggested by the Supreme Court of 
Canada in its recent judgement. She had the opportunity to show 
that her interpretation of that supreme court judgment led 
toward something other than a life sentence for someone who has 
committed a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we will have to wait for another bill, because it is 
not the case in this one. 
I know justices who must be extremely disappointed in what they 
are hearing in this debate today. How can the minister seriously 
claim that a life sentence will have a deterrent effect on 
Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If she does not want to listen to the point of view the Bloc 
Quebecois, she should at least heed what the justices of the 
Supreme Court of Canada had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat what the supreme court said about the 
effectiveness of incarceration. It is very important for members 
opposite to understand this. The supreme court justices said 
that incarceration was harsh and ineffective. In 1998, the 
members of the justice committee repeated that incarceration had 
no deterrent effect on the behaviour of offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is obvious to the whole legal community does not seem 
obvious to the justice minister. Where does the minister get the 
idea that imposing harsher jail sentences will affect the crime 
rate?

incarceration rates obviously cannot instil a sense of pride”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may argue that the bill before the House is going to 
bolster Canada's image. Does the minister appreciate the fact 
that Canada will be known as one of the highest ranking 
developed countries in terms of the incarceration rate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister takes pride in such things, then I understand 
why she introduced Bill C-18, because it will only push Canada 
higher on that scale. Maybe our goal is to rank higher than the 
United States. 
Do we want to americanize our justice system? I do not think so; 
I really do not think that is our goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes as no surprise that the minister does not feel she has 
to follow through on the representations we regularly make to 
her in the House. The government always does as it pleases, 
without taking into account the views of the members of this 
House, and that is nothing new. However, it is unfortunate and 
even troubling to see that the minister and her government have 
chosen to ignore the advice of their own court of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no qualms about referring matters to the 
Supreme Court of Canada in order to put Quebec in its place and 
to prevent from achieving its goal democratically. 
It is all fine and good to listen to the supreme court in such 
instances, but perhaps the Department of Justice and the 
government should listen to and read the supreme court decisions 
on other cases than those referred to it in order to bring 
Quebec to heel and to put it in its place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I invite the minister to read the latest decisions on 
imprisonment handed down by the supreme court. I would hope that 
this will convince her to backtrack on Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only has the minister not taken good note of the advice of 
her magistrates, but she is now overdoing it. She has introduced 
a bill that will certainly not result in a reduction of the 
incarceration rate in Canada. 
If the minister could demonstrate that increasing prison terms 
would help decrease the number of deaths caused by impaired 
driving, then we could view the increase of inmate population as 
a necessary evil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the minister is just not able to do that, because it simply 
cannot be done. Many studies have already found a total absence 
of causal link between longer prison terms and a lower crime 
rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, we must not forget to consider the adverse effects of 
an unwarranted increase in the inmate population. 
In this regard, let us recall the supreme court decision in the 
Gladue case,  which said the increasing number of offenders in 
jails is causing severe cost and administration problems and may 
increase the threat these offenders might pose to society later 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the problem that parliamentarians are too often 
confronted with: the excessive and systematic use of jail 
sentences. Not only is this excessive use of jail sentences 
unwarranted in the general framework of sentencing policies, but 
it is not suited to the nature of the specific offence we are 
dealing with today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, data compiled by the Canadian centre for justice 
statistics show that the number of deaths caused by impaired 
driving has not increased in Canada. 
On the contrary, the numbers for 1998 are the lowest since 1989. 
The offence of impaired driving causing death is not rising 
sharply, as the minister opposite wants us to believe for 
political motives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this statistical fact does not allow us to claim 
victory, it deserves some consideration during the examination 
of a bill that implies that the number of offences of impaired 
driving causing death is greatly increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, we were entitled to expect that such an extension of the 
sentence was reflected in the statistics on this offence. As we 
cannot justify this hard line approach based on its effect on 
crime, we might have wanted to deal with a problem that was 
really on the rise. But this is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another factor that deserves our attention in the 
debate on Bill C-18, and it is how the courts operate. And this 
is very important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A dearth of legislative resources available to the courts might 
perhaps have justified increased sentences.  But, the statistics 
show that the courts have never handed down a jail sentence of 
more than 10 years for the offence of impaired driving causing 
death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts, which are the best placed to evaluate the 
circumstances of each offence committed, have never seen fit to 
impose the maximum sentence now available in the Criminal Code, 
which is 14 years.  The question then arises as to what real 
effect adopting the sentence of life imprisonment would have on 
the practice of our courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, imposing life imprisonment for impaired driving might 
result in some ridiculous situations.  For instance, a drunk 
driver who was clearly negligent could receive a stiffer 
sentence than a hired assassin who deliberately set out to kill 
someone and who receives a reduced sentence for being an 
informer.  Consideration should also be given to certain 
sentencing statistics having to do with other offences similar 
to the offence of impaired driving causing death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Criminal Code, impaired driving causing death carries a 
life sentence of 14 years.  Since 1985, the average sentence 
handed down by Canadian appeal courts for this type of offence 
is 19 months. 
How can the minister justify a shorter sentence for someone who 
cold-bloodedly kills someone while driving recklessly than for 
someone driving under the influence of alcohol? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that incarceration is a last resort.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a South 
Shore constituent, who volunteers for senior's literacy, recently 
wrote to me concerning a police record check.   He understands 
this process is meant to filter out unsuitable applicants but he 
resents the administrative bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After hand delivering his request to the local RCMP for a police 
record check, he realized he did not have his birth certificate 
but he did have a current Firearms Acquisition Certificate which 
has a scanned photo and a birth date on it.  However, this card 
is not accepted by the RCMP to do a police check. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to obtain his FAC, he is required to submit his birth 
certificate so that a police and background check could be 
carried out as a prerequisite to its issuance.  Logic would 
dictate in the circumstances described that the Firearms 
Acquisition Certificate is a verification of one's birth.  Surely 
even this government could figure that out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the official opposition presented a clear unity plan for 
everybody to see.  On one side we have issues that will improve 
the federation and on the other side clear rules on the issue of 
secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, after the government has been in power for six year, is 
there not more than one clear unity plan on the table for Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have a clear unity plan.  Its good results are shown 
by the fact that the unemployment rate is lower than at any time 
in the past 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan is based on balanced budgets, low interest rates, low 
inflation, lower taxes, strategic investments and a strong social 
safety net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a plan.  It is working. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, our unity 
plan is focused on fixing the way the federation works, working 
on the democratic processes, working on the way this parliament 
works and fixing things like the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, after the government has been in power for six years, is 
there only one clear plan A on unity in this country? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have a clear plan A.  It is exemplified by the 
evidence of the lowest unemployment rate in 20 years, and 
especially lower unemployment in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is whining, but Liberals are working in the 
interests of Quebecers and all Canadians and we will keep doing 
that to maintain the unity of our wonderful country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, our 
unemployment rate is down in spite of the policies of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan has a strong position on the issue of secession.  If in 
fact a province decides to leave the country there needs to be a 
two-pronged question, for surely if Canada's borders are 
divisible, so are a province's borders divisible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, after six years in government, is there only one clear 
position on secession in this country? 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I recall the clear position of the Reform Party when it 
had those shocking ads with the Xs across the faces of Quebecers, 
saying that they were not supposed to be ministers.  Now 
Reformers have the nerve to talk about a better plan for Canada. 
It is to laugh.  Mr. Speaker, it is to laugh.

the Reform Party is the only party that has had a plan in place 
for five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another topic, the chairman of the National Battlefields 
Commission spent $1,700 of taxpayers' money at Liberal Party 
fundraisers.  Mr. Juneau claimed he was actually saving 
taxpayers' money because it would be cheaper for him to attend 
the fundraiser to talk to Liberal cabinet ministers than to fly 
to Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March the government issued a policy directive to prevent 
this kind of thing from happening.  Why has the Liberal 
government broken its promise and allowed this kind of thing to 
happen? 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the exact opposite is the 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows that on March 5 I issued a statement on 
behalf of the government.  On March 19 we put the rules in place. 
The government acted right away on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the House that when the Reform Party talked about 
crown corporations donating to the Liberal Party in March, it had 
received some of those contributions itself. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there we go.  The Liberals are trying to deflect their 
own record once again rather than taking responsibility for their 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy directive that the minister talks about has forbidden 
agencies and boards from donating to political parties.  How can 
the government possibly justify spending taxpayers' dollars on 
Liberal Party fundraisers?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

President Clinton is pushing for enforceable core labour 
standards at the World Trade Organization.  Core labour standards 
are the most basic rights:  the right of workers to organize, no 
slave labour, no child labour.  The Americans support core labour 
standards in trade agreements but Canada opposes them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trade minister even said that the American move calls for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for

to quote President Clinton.  Let me also quote him.  He said “We 
know that countries which have opened their economies to the 
world have also opened the doors to opportunity and hope for 
their own people.  Where barriers have fallen, by and large, 
living standards have risen and democratic institutions have 
become stronger”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should know that the Canadian government 
supports core labour standards.  The Canadian government at every 
opportunity at the ILO stands very forcibly on this issue.  The 
fair rules of the WTO are good for Canadian jobs, good for 
Canadian labour and are certainly good for the Canadian economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, nobody 
contests that trade with different countries is good, but we also 
know that labour standards are good as well and they have to be

lag behind the Americans.  The member has to quote President 
Clinton because he cannot quote this government.

Canada has taken the lead at the ILO to implement a protocol to 
protect against abusive labour and to protect child labour.  We 
have taken to trade forums the need to bring the ILO and the WTO 
together in a co-operative way to share those issues.  Canada was 
taking a leadership position long before President Clinton ever

closely the situation with InterCanadian.  We are aware that the 
company is making its best efforts to come to an arrangement with 
its major creditors that would allow services to restart in the 
next few days.  We know the company is keeping its employees and 
its representatives informed on these efforts.  We can understand 
the effect that the uncertainty of the situation may be having on

<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that answer is simply not acceptable either to the travelling

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was prepared to get involved in a multimillion

national emergency and suspended the Competition Act.  Now that 
there is a real national transportation crisis, created by the

level of concern and involvement?  Will he get involved to save

one of the positions that the hon. member has taken, that is, 
that the government has interfered and the minister has taken an

agriculture subsidies away from our farmers, the government has 
failed to get any commitment from our trading partners to 
eliminate their trade distorting policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers from every region of the country are under 
constant threat of illegal trade actions by our closest trading 
partners.  Our producers need quick action by the government to 
resolve these disputes.

groups across the country on a strong united front for Canada to 
stand up to the European Union and for Canada to stand up to the

them and, in particular, could have protected society better. I 
was just beginning to give examples to show that Bill C-18 is not 
consistent with the Criminal Code structure we have be using for 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gave several examples, one of which I will repeat so that the 
Liberals can understand that something is wrong with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the example I gave. I talked about a drunk driver, who 
was clearly negligent, who had decided to drive after having a 
drink and who hit and killed someone. This is extremely serious. 
This is a crime. However, this person could receive a stiffer 
sentence than a hired assassin who deliberately set out to kill 
someone. The hired assassin could receive a reduced sentence for 
becoming an informer; he will often be accused of a lesser and 
included offence and get off with a shorter sentence than the 
drunk driver who has killed someone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a principle of law called mens rea, whereby it must be 
established the individual acted with the intent to kill. It is 
not the case here. He did not intend to drive off while under 
the influence and kill someone. I realize, however, that some 
recidivists should get harsher sentences, but the Criminal Code 
already provides a 14-year prison term in such cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judges have already tried recidivists, individuals as they 
are referred to in the lingo of lawyers, who have a criminal 
record one mile long. There was one case in Canada where the 
judge handed down a 10-year prison sentence for impaired driving 
causing death. There is only one such case in all of Canada. 
Judges therefore have the necessary leeway to hand down 
sentences of up to 14 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other example I gave had to do with reckless driving causing 
death.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code provides a 14-year prison term for reckless 
driving if the same driver kills someone while deliberately 
driving recklessly. He was not impaired, but drove recklessly. 
He is not accused of impaired driving, but of reckless driving 
causing death. The maximum sentence provided by the Criminal 
Code is 14 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having reviewed the jurisprudence concerning this section as 
well as the sentences handed down for reckless driving causing 
death, we find that the Canadian appeal courts imposed prison 
sentences averaging 19 months for this type of offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister justify the fact that an offender who 
killed somebody in cold blood by driving a car dangerously will 
receive a lesser sentence of imprisonment than a driver who was 
impaired by alcohol? I want the minister to give a logical 
response to that. I want her to tell me how that makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, let us not forget that imprisonment is a last resort 
solution to any delinquency problem. Again, the Supreme Court, 
whom I quoted extensively in the first part of my speech, was 
very clear on that subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote once again what the justices of the supreme court 
said. They said this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past few decades many groups and federally appointed 
committees and commissions given the responsibility of studying 
various aspects of the criminal justice system have argued that 
imprisonment should be used only as a last resort and/or that it 
should be reserved for those convicted of only the most serious 
offences. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has not demonstrated that she has 
exhausted all the means available to her to deal with the issue 
of impaired driving to protect the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, she decided to choose the easy solution by proposing to 
drastically increase the term of imprisonment set out in the 
Criminal Code. She opted for a Reform policy when she could have 
acted differently. To win a few easy votes, she decided to play 
with the criminal justice system and upset its balance. This 
shows a lack of courage on her part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must look at the whole picture. It is an extremely serious 
problem. What is the main objective of any legislation on 
impaired driving? To try as much as possible to make people 
understand that impaired driving is a criminal offence a serious 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did this last June through a series of amendments. Let us 
wait and see the results before amending the Criminal Code 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While impaired driving is a serious offence, there are other 
effective alternatives to incarceration that can minimize its 
impact, including the use of alcohol-ignition interlock devices. 
There are two provinces where this device is in use, Alberta and 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the committee stage, it was the Bloc Quebecois that sold the 
idea of this device and convinced the committee members that it 
had to be included in the legislation so that provinces wanting 
to offer such a program could do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois won its case for a first offence. 
The first time an individual is arrested for impaired driving he 
can, in order to reduce the period of his driving license 
suspension, have his car equipped with an alcohol-ignition 
interlock system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in terms of prevention and education and especially in 
terms of reaching the first objective, namely changing the 
driving habits of drinkers, we would have liked, in the case of 
a repeat offence, the driver or the repeat offender to be 
compelled to have his car equipped with an ignition interlock 
device. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government took the easy way out by proposing these 
amendments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on all afternoon about impaired driving and the 
implications of the changes the minister wants to make through 
Bill C-18. I am sure whoever was in the Chair would pay as much 
attention as you are now, but my time is limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have demonstrated to everyone that the justices of the 
supreme court and of superior courts, legal experts, 
psychologists, chairs of parliamentary commissions and 
committees who studied the issue all found that incarceration 
does nothing to change bad habits and lower the crime rate. 
Education and prevention as well as effective and active 
measures the provinces can implement the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members also know what the Bloc Quebecois thinks of this bill. I 
checked to see what reporters and columnists covering Quebec 
courts thought about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1999, <I>La Presse</I>, which surely cannot be called a 
separatist newspaper, ran an article with a catchy headline “The 
Bloc is blocking”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For once, Mr. Pierre Gravel was of the opinion that we were 
doing our work by creating a filibuster to stop Bill C-82 in its 
tracks, because, among other things, the bill provided life 
sentences for impaired driving causing death. 
He agreed with us that this was absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said this about the Bloc Quebecois. “On the contrary, it is 
its”—meaning the Bloc Quebecois'—“firm attitude that put a damper 
on the over-zealousness of the proponents of zero 
tolerance”—meaning the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, there is another editorial, by Mario Roy, entitled 
“Drinking and driving: let's not lose our heads”.  It is clear 
he is talking about the minister, because she lost her head a 
long time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Mr. Roy say in this editorial?  He says that the 
minister is making a mistake.  He also says that, having 
consulted legal experts and watched what goes on in court, he 
can tell her bill makes no sense.  He gives several examples. I 
will read this one because it is a good one. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who follow court proceedings know the real purpose of the 
Criminal Code provisions dealing with manslaughter. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite explained that they chose the life sentence 
because the Criminal code provides for life sentences in the 
case of manslaughter, and killing someone when driving under the 
influence is just as serious as manslaughter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of what those who follow court proceedings know about 
what the Criminal Code provisions dealing with manslaughter 
stipulate, Mr. Roy added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crown prosecutor and defence counsel often resort to plea 
bargaining, sometimes with the approval of the jury, even in 
cases of horrible, cruel and premeditated murder. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manslaughter is a lesser and included offence as compared to 
premeditated murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals equate an impaired driver who 
hits and kills someone with a murderer who planned the crime. 
The driver did not plan to kill. 
Unfortunately, he had one drink too many, and what he did was 
criminal, I agree, but those opposite are comparing him to a 
murderer who planned his crime in advance. This journalist finds 
that unacceptable, and justifiably so, especially after 
consulting those who am familiar with the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reading in <I>Le Droit</I> this morning that certain Quebec 
lawyers are critical of the minister's approach in this matter. 
Worse yet, the chief of police in Aylmer is opposed to it and 
says it makes no sense.  He wonders whether it will be 
applicable and applied by the courts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the minister, and especially the government House 
leader made a deal with some of the opposition parties in June 
to let the bill pass.  I also know that a number of members on 
the government side oppose this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the member for Brome—Missisquoi, a former president 
of the Quebec bar association, does not support giving a life 
sentence to an impaired driver who has caused death.  I would 
hope he will be man enough to rise and criticize the Minister of 
Justice's backward approach, which, clearly, will never achieve 
the objectives sought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stiffening the sentence and putting people in prison for life is 
not going to change the habits of drinkers who get behind the 
wheel at the end of an evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The holidays—Christmas and New Year—are coming.  They should 
think of their relatives, friends and colleagues at the office 
party.  Some of them will be driving while impaired.  If they 
kill someone, should we treat them as criminals?  Perhaps, but 
not in the same way as a hired killer.

<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to this subject.  I know I speak 
on behalf of my constituents when I stand to address the issue of 
drunk driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by commending the work of one of my 
constituents, Geraldine Dedrick, who is a very active member of 
Mothers Against Drunk Driving for the Halifax region.  Geraldine 
faced the terrible tragedy of losing a son to an accident related 
to drunk driving.  I am honoured to stand here to support her 
efforts and those of countless others who are working today so 
that people tomorrow may be spared this tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of impaired driving causing death is a very 
important issue in the province of Nova Scotia.  The current 
president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving is Mr. Pat Dutton, who 
heads the Halifax, Annapolis Valley and Digby chapters.  I 
commend him for his very important work in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day people living in the riding of Halifax West face a 
very real and possibly fatal threat.  Every day in my riding 
people are concerned about someone they know who may be drinking 
and driving.  I am sure it is the same throughout the province of 
Nova Scotia and across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the criminal code was amended to deal with persons who 
drink and drive, it has been estimated that 20,400 Canadians have 
died at the hands of those who choose to drink and drive.  At the 
same time, up to 1.5 million Canadians have been injured during 
the time span since these laws were enacted.  The death and 
casualty numbers read like those of war.  The government has the 
tools at hand to reduce this carnage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my colleagues of the New Democratic Party support the 
review and enactment of legislative measures to enhance 
deterrents and to ensure that we use the tools of legislation to 
do what we can to put in place laws to reduce these accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about this issue, we are not talking about people 
who have sacrificed their lives for our country or for any higher 
ideal; we are talking about people who have had their lives or 
their good health ended because someone chose to drink too much 
and subsequently turned their vehicle into a terrible weapon out 
of control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even while I am speaking, it is likely that a Canadian will lose 
his or her life due to drunk driving.  An average of more than 
one Canadian every five minutes is injured due to drunk driving. 
An average of one Canadian is killed every six hours.  This is 
simply obscene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While clearly the loss of life and limb is paramount, let us not 
ignore the incredible toll that this takes on our health care 
system and the ripple effect on other costs to taxpayers.  This 
is not only an issue of death and injury, it is an issue of 
responsibility in so many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the responsibility lies at many levels.  There is the 
level of the individual.  We all have individual responsibility 
in this matter.  I have chosen not to drink at all.  I know 
several others who have made this choice.  I know there are many 
other responsible social drinkers who would never climb into a 
vehicle with anywhere near the legal blood alcohol limit. 
Then there are others who are social drinkers who occasionally 
make the wrong choice about drinking and driving.  This wrong 
choice is estimated to be responsible for a death every single 
day in this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are the repeat offenders, many with serious drinking 
problems who cause much of the carnage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the responsibility of the community.  More and 
more communities are banding and working together to change the 
laws.  It is largely due to their efforts that the backwards 
social philosophy of “one for the road” is increasingly 
becoming a thing of the past, and we are very thankful for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mothers Against Drunk Driving and many other organizations have 
become very sophisticated and involved and have done much of our 
homework in this particular area.  It is good to have such 
community-responsible citizens who are taking up their 
responsibility to make sure this tragedy does not persist.  This 
enables us as legislators to help address the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many small business owners who serve alcohol who are 
undertaking initiatives in their businesses to curb irresponsible 
drinking and to reduce the incidence of drunk driving.  I commend 
them for their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is foolish to think the entire problem can be legislated 
away.  It is no more than criminal not to make every change we 
can as parliamentarians to address the loss of life and health 
through drunk driving accidents.  The government should have no 
fear of addressing this issue if it is concerned about the polls 
because nine out of every ten Canadians believe this is a problem 
for the government to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost three of every four Canadians support lowering the blood 
alcohol concentration level from 0.08 to 0.05.  We would not be 
breaking any new ground here.  Many countries are ahead of us. 
Australia, Belgium, Finland, Greece, Netherlands, Norway, 
Portugal and France have all lowered their legal levels to 0.05. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some provincial governments have taken the lead on this issue. 
Newfoundland has implemented a 24 hour licence suspension with a 
$100 licence reinstatement charge if a person's level is over 
0.05. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to inform the House as to what Nova Scotia has done 
in this area.  As of the beginning of this month, new legislation 
is in place that has been approved by all the parties in the 
legislature in Nova Scotia.  These new drinking and driving laws 
taking effect include the immediate 24 hour suspension of a 
driver's licence for someone pulled over with a blood alcohol 
level of between 0.05 and the legal limit of 0.08.  For the first 
conviction there is a one year revocation of driving privileges. 
A second conviction warrants a three year suspension, up from the 
current two years.  Three time offenders will lose their licence 
for at least 10 years.  A fourth time offender will never drive 
again.  These are very important changes under the motor vehicle 
act of Nova Scotia.  They underscore the significance of the 
whole issue that we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Pat Dutton, president of the Halifax, Annapolis Valley and 
Digby chapters of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, compared these 
new laws to a Christmas list being fulfilled.   He said: “Today 
all the things that are being put in place are things that are on 
our list”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to see this kind of involvement by 
communities, to see the changes that are taking place in various 
provinces and to see that all this is working together to try to 
ensure that lives are protected and that people do not suffer 
needlessly as a result of impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I spoke on this matter I indicated the concern 
among my constituents of Halifax West that there should be the 
capacity under provincial legislation to confiscate cars involved 
in these offences.  That is a very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us explore in committee the possibility of automatically 
requesting from drivers breath and/or blood samples in crashes 
resulting in serious injury or death.  Let us review the current 
two hour presumption limit to obtain a breath or blood sample. 
Let us review all these things with a view to trying to improve 
this situation.  Let us not be afraid to examine the code, to 
expand the reasonable or probable grounds on which law 
enforcement officers can investigate crash scenes that involve 
death or serious injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big concerns in my riding of Halifax West is the 
extent to which we are able to determine the role alcohol plays 
in accidents causing death.  Let us look at ways to ensure that 
we know if alcohol has played a part in someone's death or injury 
due to a traffic accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy statement Mothers Against Drunk Driving includes this 
very important phrase:  “While an individual's decision to 
consume alcohol is a private matter, driving after consuming 
alcohol or other drugs is a public matter”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to just comment briefly at this point on the impact 
the whole matter of drunk driving can have upon the lives of 
families and on the lives of people who are affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need not lose someone through drunk driving to know how 
serious it is and how much pain one can feel when a loved one is 
lost.  I lost a nephew a number of years ago.  He was aged eight. 
It was as a result of a serious vehicle accident.  The young 
fellow was driving his bicycle on his way home and was crossing a 
busy highway when a truck hit and killed him.  We do not know in 
that case whether there was alcohol involved, but whether there 
was alcohol involved or not, the pain is still the same when we 
lose a young life like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember this young fellow when I was actively involved in 
karate.  He wanted me to break some boards for him.  Sometimes in 
karate we have a technique where we break one inch boards.  He 
said, “Can you break a board for me, Uncle Gordon?” and I said, 
“I suppose I could”.  He ran down to his basement and came back 
with a big 2x4.  I looked at it and said, “I think maybe I will 
have to do this on another occasion”.  Sadly, the other occasion 
did not arrive.  I did not have the opportunity to break a board 
for him because his young life was cut short at the age of eight 
due to the accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we add to that the loss of a loved one through drinking and 
driving, we can imagine how much more pain and suffering we go 
through knowing this life did not have to be lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to Bill C-18 which deals very specifically with the 
whole issue, it is an act to amend the criminal code and to deal 
with the issue of the penalty.  This legislation amends the 
criminal code in order to strengthen impaired driving provisions 
to ensure a sufficient deterrent effect on potential offenders 
and that the sanctions to be imposed for offences involving 
impaired driving reflect the gravity of the offence as well as 
the degree of responsibility of the offender.  Bill C-18 would 
raise the maximum penalty for impaired driving causing death from 
14 years imprisonment to life imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments implement recommendations of the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights in its report, 
“Toward Eliminating Impaired Driving”.  The committee's 
recommendations on the provisions of this bill are in response to 
public pressure spurred by Mothers Against Drunk Driving, police 
associations, victims groups and members of parliament from all 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP fully supports the legislation.  The criminal code 
amendments strengthen the penalties and increase the deterrent 
values of the impaired driving provisions in the code.  The 
legislation addresses the seriousness of impaired driving in our 
society by both strengthening the penalties for offenders and 
increasing the options and powers available to the police and the 
courts to more effectively combat drunk drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that passing legislation to ensure swift 
implementation of the new provisions will save lives.  It sends a 
very important message that impaired driving is an avoidable 
criminal act which carries unacceptable risks of injury and 
death.  In 1985 parliament added the offences of impaired driving 
causing bodily harm and impaired driving causing death to the 
criminal code with maximum penalties of 14 years imprisonment 
where the result is death and 10 years imprisonment where bodily 
harm is caused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the extent that penalties can discourage those who might 
leave an accident to evade getting caught for impaired driving, 
the changes to the offence of leaving the scene will send the 
message that running away from a collision where someone is 
injured or killed is a very serious behaviour and it carries a 
serious penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Estimates found there were roughly 1,300 deaths due to impaired 
driving in 1997.  Information from the Traffic Injury Research 
Foundation study in Ontario suggested impaired drivers comprised 
55% of the driving fatalities.  The 1999 report by the Insurance 
Corporation of British Columbia indicated that in each of the 
years 1995, 1996, 1997 more than 80% of the impaired driving 
deaths in British Columbia were comprised of impaired drivers and 
their passengers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP would like to see zero tolerance on drinking and driving 
on our streets and that these horrible statistics be greatly 
reduced or eliminated so future generations of Canadians need not 
suffer the horrible losses of this terrible crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-18, an 
act to amend the Criminal Code (impaired driving causing death 
and other matters), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is always with pleasure that I rise in this House, and 
particularly now to address this bill. I believe it is critical 
that the minister recognize this important issue and have this 
legislation introduced before Christmas. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased that after months of delay the government has 
come forth with legislation that will reintroduce the life 
imprisonment clause for impaired driving causing death.  This is 
a very timely introduction of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The life imprisonment provision was originally part of Bill 
C-82, the act to amend the criminal code with respect to impaired 
driving, which came into law and into effect in the last 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 will allow a judge the discretion to invoke a life 
sentence for impaired driving, in essence strengthening the 
existing provisions of the code.  Obviously it is contemplated 
for the worst of all case scenarios, most aggravated 
circumstances, repeat offenders, high readings and the like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This simply raises the ceiling for this type of offence. 
Vehicular homicide is murder, let there be no doubt.  When it 
comes to the result of a reckless and negligent act, the 
intrusion that this places upon the victims of these types of 
offences, the harsh reality is that a person killed by a car is 
just as dead as a person killed by a gun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These imprisonment provisions came in exchange for speedy 
passage in the House.  Some of the parties in opposition backed 
away from this particular provision at the justice committee when 
the legislation was to be introduced.  Now they have 
recapitulated and come forward in support and I am hoping that 
support will continue throughout this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party felt that these provisions were very 
important and thus assurances were received from the Minister of 
Justice that these clauses would be reintroduced as separate 
legislation.  I congratulate the minister for having had the 
integrity and foresight to follow through with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party does support Bill C-82 but felt that 
there were areas for improvement, this being one of them.  Bill 
C-82, without a doubt, improves upon the current outdated 
legislation and introduces tougher sanctions in the areas of 
fines and suspensions.  But the bill itself did not give police 
sufficient powers to protect society from hard-core drinkers 
resistant to charges of impaired driving, nor did it allow for 
automatic breath and blood samples to be taken from those who 
were involved in impaired driving related accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tragically, most people have experienced or know a person 
directly or indirectly whose life was affected due to careless 
and negligent acts of a drunk driver.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal offences involving drunk drivers have declined 23% 
since 1994.  However, this is a bit of a misleading statistic. 
In 1997, we know that the statistics started to level off again. 
It is misleading because many individuals involved in this type 
of activity simply do not get caught.  We know that with the cuts 
to police forces across the country, detachments are often 
understaffed and officers simply do not have the sufficient 
equipment and patrol cars to be out on the roads to combat this 
most serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mothers Against Drunk Driving released a press release in 
November 1999 in which Carolyn Swinson dealt with the stats over 
the last 15 years.  The press release stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jurisdat (did the statistics) reports that 103 people were 
charged with impaired driving causing death.  Yet Transport 
Canada reports that 1,350 were killed due to impaired driving. 
Jurisdat reports that 886 were charged with impaired driving 
causing bodily harm.  According to 1996 figures, there were 
approximately 46,000 Canadians seriously injured in alcohol 
related crashes...in some cases, police are opting to suspend an 
impaired driver's licence with provincial administrative 
sanctions rather than lay a federal criminal code charge. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is because provincial governments proceed quicker through 
the courts when a code section is invoked under those provisions. 
As well, provincial governments do not collect statistics that 
reflect this.  Therefore, to suggest that the statistics are 
truly indicative of the numbers of impaired drivers on the 
highway is quite wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia does collect statistics of provincial licence 
suspensions that arise from these types of problems, and these do 
increase proportionately to the same number that are showing up 
in the federal statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem itself is quite clear.  Hard core drinkers continue 
to get behind the wheel irregardless of efforts that are made 
either through federal or provincial statutes.  We should not be 
content until we have tightened up both federal and provincial 
legislation to deal with this problem in every way possible. 
Where we can accomplish the saving of lives, it stands to reason 
and is a statement of the obvious, that we as legislators and 
elected persons should be putting every effort into the task of 
ensuring safety on our roads and highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Positive steps that do come from this legislation include 
provisions that would increase the time limit for breathalyzers 
and approved screening devices in the testing of impaired drivers 
to three hours, and also encouraging and strictly enforcing the 
over .08 provision of blood alcohol concentration.  All these 
amendments will assist police officers in the performance of 
their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker from the NDP spoke about the province of 
Nova Scotia and the efforts made there to toughen its impaired 
driving legislation.  Nova Scotia Premier John Hamm has just 
introduced and ushered in legislation that would suspend drivers 
for 24 hours if .05 trace of alcohol was found in a person's 
blood while operating a motor vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Hamm and members of his administration, like Jim 
DeWolfe, Bill Dooks and Ron Chisholm, are all working very 
hard for all Nova Scotians and their constituents in this 
particular legislative area.  Yet, sadly, the problem persists. 
It does not only persist with young people, which is another 
misnomer about this particular problem.  The Canadian Automobile 
Association, CAA, says that its message to drunk drivers and the 
dangers that flow from this is getting through to the age group 
of 16 to 25, but impaired driving remains a stubborn problem with 
respect to those in the age group 35 and older. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 in Ontario, more than 300 people were killed on the 
roads as a result of drunk driving.  If all of these drivers were 
caught, that would hopefully stem the problem. However, it does 
not stem the problems for the victims of these related accidents. 
We know that lifetime suspensions that can result are one way to 
deal with these particular drivers as an after the fact approach.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, drivers do have the provision and option now to install 
interlock devices that will get them back on the road sooner. 
These are very encouraging steps that the government, in 
co-operation with the opposition, has worked toward bringing into 
fruition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fines can be increased to at least $2,000, with judges being 
given the option of imposing higher fines if the circumstances 
dictate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Insurance Bureau of Canada says that over a two year period 
an impaired driving conviction costs at least $5,000 in terms of 
additional premiums to consumers.  There are obviously spinoff 
costs that relate to this problem as well.  It is surely not to 
suggest by any means that this is just a fiscal problem, because 
the cost in human life and limb is the most prevalent and serious 
aspect of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet even with financial hardship, embarrassment, publication of 
names and this type of information, there are still individuals 
who take the chance or stubbornly refuse to give up this type of 
lifestyle and activity.  The message has to be sent and sent 
clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is often reference in the criminal code and in the court 
rooms across the land to deterrents and denunciation.  However, 
the seem to be, in many instances, bad words or words that are 
not quickly embraced by the justice system in the country.  They 
are noticeably absent from the new youth criminal justice act. 
However, deterrents, both general and specific, still very much 
have a role to play when judges and our criminal justice system 
are attempting to send a message to individuals. That is to be 
coupled with all sentencing provisions and all of the 
considerations that judges must take in when crafting a sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To combat the problem itself, we must assist police officers. 
Police on average indicate that it takes two hours and forty-five 
minutes to process a criminal code charge relating to impaired 
driving. Police need better access to mobile breathalyzers, 
physical sobriety testing and passive alcohol sensors to make 
their job more efficient and to enable them to assist the public 
in this battle against impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers do an amazing job with the tools that they have 
but they are faced with fiscal undermining and a very complicated 
and ever-increasing active criminal element in the country. The 
police do the best they can to the best of their abilities but 
they are increasingly frustrated.  Warnings and fines do not work 
on hard-core drinkers.  The police need to have their powers 
enhanced in some instances to get that message across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated earlier, the Minister of Justice is to be 
commended for reintroducing the legislation.  I hope, and the 
previous speakers have indicated that there will be broad support 
for the legislation.  I hope it will receive swift passage 
through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the age of majority and the age of drinking, 
one has to recognize that with privileges come responsibility. 
Some consider a driving licence to be more of a right, than a 
privilege, but it is in fact a privilege.  It is incumbent upon 
the legislators in this place to remind Canadians that there is 
responsibility associated with that.  Giving additional powers to 
police officers to demand breath and blood samples whenever an 
accident occurs would also be a welcome inclusion in the criminal 
code when the accident that results from an impaired driver 
leaves a person dead or injured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the demand for a breath or blood sample 
without sufficient evidence raises problems in the legal 
community.  There is a strong argument to be made about the 
violation of an individual's rights, the presumption of innocence 
and the charter implications, but on balance the need for these 
powers to gather evidence and protect society from impaired 
drivers, and because of the prevalence of this particular type of 
offence, I suggest it is justified.  This minor infringement is 
certainly in the public interest.  Currently an officer is 
allowed to request a roadside breath sample based on reasonable 
suspicion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on an accident, this, in and of itself, is a suspicion 
that an officer should and could rely on for the demand for a 
blood or breath sample.  In the confusion of an accident, it 
stands to reason that officers are often very much concerned with 
assisting injured individuals and evidence is simply lost. 
Instead of forcing police officers to make sometimes very tough 
judgment calls, everyone should be subjected to a breath or blood 
sample within the discretion of the officer when the 
circumstances arise. 
This eliminates the judgment calls and relies on technology to 
determine the guilt or innocence based on an approved screening 
device.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inevitably there is a lengthy and legal wrangling that will 
result over the admission of this type of evidence and the police 
are very often put on trial in these types of criminal code 
offence prosecutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will allow a police offer to better do his duty.  I also 
suggest that it would free him up to be back on the street sooner 
doing the job that he or she is entrusted to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am suggesting that the strengthening of impaired driving 
legislation will help the country.  It will help all citizens in 
improving the safety on our highways.  It certainly will 
strengthen the criminal code in its approach to this type of 
offence.  Bill C-18 is but a part of the puzzle.  I am hopeful 
that the House will also consider future changes to the criminal 
code in this particular area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other such administrative arms 
have done a terrific job in raising the profile of this issue. We 
can do a great deal more in terms of educating people about the 
problem itself.  We do have to do more to send a message to 
habitual offenders who continue to endanger lives on the 
highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judge Clyde MacDonald, in my hometown of New Glasgow, Nova 
Scotia, often used to say that an impaired driver under the 
influence of alcohol driving down the Trans-Canada highway, 
pointing the vehicle at innocent oncoming traffic, was no 
different than pointing a gun at a person.  That is the type of 
realistic approach that we are hoping judges will take when 
combating this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear time and time again from the government, and hopefully 
with all sincerity, that public safety has to be the number one 
concern.  I encourage all Canadians to support and embrace Bill 
C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to recognize all members of the justice committee 
who participated and worked extremely hard on this legislation. I 
also want to thank the numerous witnesses who appeared before the 
committee and gave their expertise and insight into this issue, 
many of whom had been affected directly and gave heartbreaking 
stories about how their lost loved ones had been taken from them 
by impaired drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these people and for all Canadians, we have to send a 
message that impaired driving will not be tolerated.  As they did 
with Bill C-82, I am hopeful that all members of the House will 
put aside partisan politics and work together in this public 
interest and vote in favour of Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I want to take the opportunity to wish you and all 
members of the House the best for the holiday season, a healthy 
and safe holiday season.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
work regularly with the Progressive Conservative member who just 
spoke. I know that he is very attentive, knows his issues very 
well and is a lawyer by training. He did practise law and, if I 
am not mistaken, he was a crown prosecutor. The hon. member is 
therefore very familiar with the whole structure of the Criminal 
Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also knows that some offences are more or less comparable to 
impaired driving causing death. 
I know that the hon. member has read several studies—if he has 
not, I would invite him to do so, but I believe he has— 
regarding the impact of imprisonment on an individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a prison term is imposed on a person, what will be the real 
impact of that measure on the individual when he gets out of 
prison? Will that person have understood? Are there studies 
showing that an offence that can lead to life imprisonment is a 
deterrent to such a person? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I made a speech and I quoted justices from the supreme 
court and the superior court. 
I also quoted some reports from parliamentary committees. After 
studying the same subject nearly every year for the past 20 years 
at least, we have come to the conclusion that imprisonment will 
not help lower the crime rate.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, the possibility of life imprisonment will not 
deter an impaired driver from getting behind the wheel of his 
car. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very simple. A reading of the supreme court 
decisions shows that it feels that there are far too many prison 
sentences handed down in Canada, that Canada is one of the 
countries that hands down prison terms the most in the western 
world. 
Committee reports say imprisonment is useless. In their reports, 
the legal experts say that it is not the right way to deal with 
those who have drinking problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By increasing the present 14-year sentence for impaired driving 
causing death, no longer even imposed by judges, to life 
imprisonment, does the member really think that it will 
effectively reduce the number of offences of impaired driving 
causing death? Does he really believe that it will have an 
effect on those who drink and drive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague 
who is a member of the Standing Committee on Justice for his 
question. The hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm has worked very 
hard. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member makes a very good point about rehabilitation. 
There is no question that a person with an alcohol addiction 
problem will not be cured out and out by a lengthy prison 
sentence.  However I spoke about the issues of deterrence and 
denunciation that are required when it comes to the taking of a 
human life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple short answer to his question is that yes, sadly there 
are occasions when a person has repeatedly taken a chance by 
getting behind the wheel.  As remarkable as it might sound, there 
are occasions when four, five, six or ten convictions are racked 
up and even after having spent time in prison the person will 
still take that chance.  If one life can be saved by a lengthy 
period of incarceration, why would we not want to give judges the 
discretion to impose that type of deterrent sentence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend is also a practising member of the Quebec bar. He 
is intimately familiar with the criminal code, speaks in a very 
erudite way about criminal law matters and shares my passion for 
criminal law.  However he knows that even the imposition of a 14 
year sentence, or potentially a life sentence, does not mean that 
the person will serve that amount of time in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again we have seen corrections and the parole 
board release individuals one-third, one-sixth or one-fourth into 
their sentences.  If a judge decides that an individual offender 
has taken liberties and has jeopardized human life or human life 
and limb, the person deserves a sentence in the range of a life 
period of incarceration, which in Canada does not mean life. We 
know that means at a maximum 25 years and usually much less. If a 
judge can get the message out to the community, the small 
communities that are willing to take the risk, then let us put 
the tools in the hands of our judiciary to send that message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I did not want to interrupt the previous speakers, but 
earlier this afternoon the House leader gave notice that there 
would be closure on the debate on the Nisga'a bill.  I am not 
clear on this so I just want to ask the Speaker whether after one 
day of debate it is appropriate to invoke closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 469 amendments. 
I do not see how we will be able to deal with them in one day. 
Can I have some advisement from the Chair in this regard?  It 
seems inappropriate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bryden):</B>  I thank the member for 
Calgary Centre for his intervention.  The government only gave 
notice and that really is not subject to debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question. It is rare that we have the opportunity to ask 
another a question after an answer, but I think that we must not 
confuse the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of someone who has a drinking problem and who drives 
while impaired and is arrested four, five or six times, the 
Criminal Code, as amended last June by Bill C-82, allows for 
stiffer sentences, and I applaud that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there had been better follow-up on that person, and if 
participation in certain programs had been required—and I made 
proposals in this regard in committee, but the government did 
not respond—we might have been able to rehabilitate that 
driver. It is a criminal offence, I repeat, to drive while 
impaired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is more technical. I know that the member was a 
crown prosecutor, so he will be able to shed light on this 
question for the House. He knows that the Criminal Code contains 
the offence of dangerous driving. The maximum penalty is 14 
years for hitting and killing someone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill, if that person were hit and killed by an 
impaired driver, there is a possibility of life imprisonment. 
Does the hon. member find it logical to put that in the Criminal 
Code? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to 
the question.  I agree that there are other sections of the 
criminal code that address similar types of situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Impaired driving could also be prosecuted as criminal negligence 
causing death.  I personally favour the insertion in the criminal 
code of a section that recognizes vehicular homicide.  Perhaps 
that might satisfy the hon. member in terms of having a code 
section attached to that provision when there is a degree of 
negligence coupled with the presence of alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the greatest respect to my colleague from Quebec, we have a 
difference in philosophy in terms of the rehabilitative process. 
We also have a difference in philosophy on the vision of the 
country.  There is no question that we can do more about 
rehabilitation when it comes to alcohol and drug related 
problems, but the money has to be available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently that is not the situation.  The government has not put 
the money forward for these types of programs to protect society. 
Sometimes these individuals have to be incarcerated for lengthy 
periods of time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was very 
interested in the interaction between my two colleagues.   Having 
heard of deaths caused by impaired drivers in my riding and how 
devastating it is to families, and also touching on the work that 
organizations such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving have done, I 
think this piece of legislation is worthy of debate.  I find it 
quite interesting to hear my hon. colleague from Quebec say that 
we should not be imposing a life sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my hon. colleague from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough if there is any difference 
between driving a car and killing someone while impaired or 
taking a gun while impaired and pointing it at someone and 
shooting?  If it is good for one, why would it not be good for 
the other? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
of my colleague from West Nova.  I know that he and all members 
of the House are very concerned about this type of scenario. 
He poses a very practical question.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I referred to the commentary by Judge Clyde F. MacDonald 
in Pictou county when he made that exact analogy.  I suggested 
that the current criminal code provisions spoke to murder and 
manslaughter when alcohol was involved.  Oftentimes that is the 
case, particularly in domestic situations.  It seems in those 
cases it is only an aggravating circumstance.  Or, sometimes 
defence lawyers use it as a mitigating circumstance as to the 
state of mind of the individual who committed the murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely impaired people, who voluntarily put alcohol in their 
systems and get behind the wheel and go out on the highway and 
kill someone, have to be dealt with very harshly under the 
current provisions of the criminal code.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate you on your ascension to the chair.  You do indeed 
look quite comfortable up there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-18, 
a bill with which I am quite familiar as a result of sitting on 
the justice committee for the last two years.  Originally the 
bill saw the light of day as Bill C-82.  The genesis of Bill C-82 
was in fact in this parliament.  Parliament instructed the 
justice committee to draft a report and a bill and then report 
back to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee listened to extensive testimony and became quite 
familiar with the issues surrounding drunk driving in the course 
of the testimony.  The committee did in fact draft a report and 
then the bill.  Both the report and the bill were adopted 
unanimously by the committee.  It then successfully persuaded the 
Minister of Justice to sponsor the bill back into the House, and 
she was gracious enough to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill returned to the House, the Bloc Quebecois refused 
to let it proceed unless the clause with respect to life 
imprisonment was deleted.  This was after unanimous agreement 
among members of the justice committee on both the draft report 
and the bill.  The House leaders agreed that the clause would be 
dropped and reintroduced.  The balance of the bill was proceeded 
with and proclaimed on July 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have done very few things in parliament for which I have 
received more compliments than the bill we introduced on July 1. 
Constituents were thrilled with parliament and the government's 
response to drunk driving.  Frankly they were quite disturbed 
when they later learned that we had not retained the provision 
with respect to life sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were very pleased with the committee's initiatives.  It is 
one of the most satisfying experiences I have had as a member of 
parliament.  It was quite a non-partisan experience as members on 
both sides of the House worked very carefully.  To quote one of 
the members, we all put “a little water in our wine” to achieve 
unanimity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, the clause with respect to life imprisonment 
has been referred back to the House in the form of Bill C-18. The 
issue in the bill is quite simple.  If a drunk driver causes the 
death of another person, that drunk driver is guilty of an 
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life. 
Presently the maximum is 14 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other difference is with respect to the authority of the 
justice of the peace to issue a warrant for the taking of a 
sample if an accident has caused death as a result of the 
consumption of alcohol or a drug.  We heard some testimony in 
this regard and I am pleased to see that the minister has taken 
the opportunity to reintroduce that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of which I wish to speak is with respect to 
imprisonment for life for causing death while one is impaired.  I 
would like to take this opportunity to bring before the House 
certain pieces of testimony that we heard and which were very 
persuasive to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first was the testimony of Sharleen Verhurst and Jennifer 
Dixon, both of whom are from British Columbia.  Jennifer's 
background is in the faculty of medicine at the University of 
British Columbia.  Sharleen's background is in the faculty of law 
and criminal justice at the University College of Fraser Valley. 
Sharleen is involved with the local RCMP detachment as a crime 
prevention co-ordinator and speaks personally and with great 
passion about these issues as her life has been affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take this opportunity to read into the record the 
testimony because it gives reasoning to the debate, something 
that is not always present here.  It compels one to reach the 
conclusion that the committee came to after listening to the 
testimony.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In keeping with the need to view impaired driving as the serious 
and deadly crime that it is, maximum sentencing requirements 
should be aligned with that of a crime involving a weapon, as a 
vehicle operated by an impaired driver is just that, a weapon. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That point was mentioned by my hon. friend from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minimum sentencing considerations should account for the sad fact 
that though the offender receives jail time, family members and 
friends receive “life sentences” without their loved ones. 
There is simply no reason for an impaired driver not to deal with 
the consequences of their own selfish actions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem that a maximum sentence for impaired driving 
causing death should follow criminal code section 220(a), causing 
death by criminal negligence using a firearm, as in both cases a 
type of weapon is used to cause death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went on to recommend two things, one of which was 
imprisonment for life for someone who kills while impaired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second piece of testimony that impressed the committee was 
that of the Addictions Foundation of Manitoba and the Winnipeg 
Police Services in a joint submission.  Again I will read from 
the record: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Present inconsistencies in sentencing give a message which 
suggests that death or injury resulting from impaired driving is 
somehow less serious or the driver is less responsible than death 
or injury from other acts of irresponsible behaviour.  The 
drinking driver is no less responsible, having made the decision 
to drive after drinking or by failing to make other arrangements 
for transportation prior to drinking. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple message out of both of these testimonies is that if a 
person causes the death of another human being by virtue of 
drinking and being impaired, that person should be criminally 
responsible for their behaviour and the penalty should be the 
same as if the person caused the death of another person by means 
of a weapon or by means of criminal negligence causing death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think about it for a moment we will come to the 
conclusion, as did the committee, that there is really no logical 
counter argument.  Whether the individual is dead by virtue of 
the discharge of a firearm, a stabbing incident or a drunk 
driver, the penalty should be parallel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think of the legal absurdity.  If I am found to be guilty of 
criminal negligence causing death while driving my car, but I am 
stone sober, I am exposed to a life sentence, but if I kill 
somebody while I am impaired in exactly the same circumstances, 
my maximum exposure is 14 years.  Should I therefore go out and 
become impaired to reduce my liability?  It does not make a great 
deal of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes no sense to give a life sentence for a form of 
behaviour while sober and a lesser maximum while impaired and 
engaging in similar behaviour.  If I can get life imprisonment 
for criminal negligence causing death or manslaughter, there is 
really no compelling reason why a driver should not be given life 
imprisonment for drunk driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 54 of the committee's report states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because neither criminal negligence causing bodily harm or death, 
nor manslaughter offences provide for a mandatory minimum prison 
term, it would be inappropriate to do so for impaired driving 
convictions, at this time. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee did not go with the minimums: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Otherwise, there could be a very great incentive to an accused 
person to offer a plea to criminal negligence or manslaughter, 
and a similar incentive to a crown attorney to accept it.  The 
same concern militates against increasing the 10-year maximum 
penalty for impaired driving causing bodily harm, since the 
maximum penalty for criminal negligence causing bodily harm is 
also currently 10 years.  However, because the maximum penalty 
for both manslaughter and criminal negligence causing death is 
life imprisonment, the committee is persuaded that the maximum 
penalty for impaired driving causing death should be the same. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That recommendation was made after several months of testimony 
which we heard all across the country and it was a unanimous 
recommendation of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therein lies the reasoning of the committee, and it is reasoning 
supported by the testimony that has a logical symmetry so that 
there is a parallelism and a balance in the criminal code with 
other forms of behaviour which cause the death of an innocent 
person.  It really should not matter whether this death was 
caused by manslaughter, was caused by criminal negligence or was 
caused by impaired driving.  The result is the death of another 
human being and therefore the punishment should be similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the committee was persuaded that a judge should be 
able to sentence an individual to life imprisonment if the facts 
and circumstances warrant that kind of sentence. 
It made no sense to the committee to permit a judge to sentence 
someone to life imprisonment if the death was caused by criminal 
negligence or manslaughter but would be limited to 14 years if it 
was caused by an impaired person driving a motor vehicle. 
Therefore I think the reasoning of the committee is sound.  It is 
based on the evidence.  Therefore I urge all members to support 
the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard a number of extraneous arguments in opposing the 
bill.  May I say that really many of those arguments have nothing 
to do with the reasoning of the committee.  It had nothing to do 
with whether this is a rehabilitable offence or issues such as 
that.  It had everything to do with needing a logical consistency 
and symmetry in the criminal code.  If we do not have that we 
will have other sets of logical inconsistencies which will make 
absolutely no sense to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity to speak.  I would 
appreciate any opportunity to respond to questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
generally appreciate the comments from the hon. member opposite. 
He made many very good points that were agreed upon by people in 
the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one area on which I have a bit of an issue with him. 
We need always to try to apply credit where credit is due when it 
is possible.  I think the committee did a good job but I think 
there are the yeoman's efforts that were put forward by the 
member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley that were largely 
responsible for bringing this issue forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member opposite say that the Liberal government has 
shown much strong initiative on this.  Yet I am reminded, and 
would be curious to hear his comments on this, there was a motion 
on this put forward by the opposition led by the member just 
mentioned back in 1996 that was unanimously adopted by the House 
and no action was taken.  We brought it forward again in 1997 and 
it was adopted by the House.  There was no action by the 
government and then again in 1998.  Finally we got some agreement 
to get some action on it if we would delay the deadline until 
1999.  Now finally we have some legislation before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see this largely driven by the Reform Party and the member for 
Prince George—Bulkley Valley.  The justice committee did 
eventually respond.  But I would just like to hear the member 
opposite recognize the contribution made by the member mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  In the context of recognizing the 
contribution made by the member for Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley, I would also like to recognize the contribution of the 
member for Berthier—Montcalm, the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, the member for 
Scarborough—Rouge River, the member for Sydney—Victoria.  I 
would say to the hon. member this was an all-party initiative, 
that it did come from the House, that it was referred by the 
House to the committee.  The committee did ask for and did 
receive an extension in time because as one got into the issues, 
one started to realize that the issues were fairly complex.  We 
were rewriting the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a lawyer, it gets no better than that, to dive into the code 
and rewrite the code in accordance with testimony that we heard. 
We heard testimony from literally all over the country, some of 
it initiated by the member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley. But 
there are other areas where the member for Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley was off in directions to which the committee would not and 
could not go when they were logically inconsistent and could not 
be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the issue in this bill was minimums.  If we think 
about it for a few minutes, putting minimums in on this would 
create another level of absurdity much like the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm, who was concerned about the individual who 
goes to a Christmas party, drinks one too many and kills an 
individual.  His argument was that takes the offender up to a 
life sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be even worse if we went to a minimum of seven years 
because it may well be that a judge would say in the 
circumstances that this is not an individual who is a habitual 
drunk driver and that this was a mistake and even though there 
was a very tragic consequence that the sentence should not be a 
minimum of seven years.  That is one of the reasons we did not go 
that way.  The member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley would 
have gone that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was much give and take in the committee.  It was a period 
of time of the committee which made me proud.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a minimum of partisanship.  After we got into the 
bill, after we heard the testimony and after we drafted the 
report we recognized that it was hard to take partisan positions 
because it did not make a lot of sense.  I thought it was a great 
moment for the committee, and that member along with a number of 
members of the House made significant contributions to the 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
realize it is difficult for a Liberal to give credit where credit 
is due, particularly if that credit goes to a Reform member.  I 
want it to be publicly known that through his private member's 
initiative the whole thing came to light.  I applaud the member 
for Prince George—Bulkley Valley on his efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member for Scarborough East believe that this law 
should apply equally to persons under the age of 18? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  No, Mr. Speaker.  It is fairly simple. We 
treat individuals differentially when they engage in criminal 
behaviour under age 18.  I commend Bill C-3 to the member's 
attention.  That is not one of the recognized offences.  I 
appreciate the opportunity to answer the question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have more of a comment to make than a question.  When 
lawyers talk about that what they live for is rewriting the 
criminal code, I want the member to know that they scare the 
living daylights out of ordinary citizens.  I say that in all 
honesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot see why those under 18 would not be charged the same. A 
life is a life.  When one is old enough to drive one is old 
enough to take responsibilities.  An impaired driver who drives a 
vehicle is actually handling a weapon.  It is the choice that one 
makes when one decides to drive impaired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the committee is not 
composed of only lawyers.  We did not receive a great deal of 
testimony from lawyers.  The only two lawyers' organizations that 
made representations were the Canadian Bar Association and 
Barreau du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The testimony that we received was from police officers and a 
variety of other witnesses from across the country.  My thought 
on it was that it was actually good testimony which helped us to 
think about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comment with respect to writing it was that as a practising 
lawyer it literally gets no better than having an opportunity to 
open the criminal code and arrive at a legally sound and a 
reasoned position so that the imposition of certain kinds of 
penalties on certain kinds of criminal behaviour is consistent 
with other parts of the code, because one can arrive at legal 
absurdities which other lawyers will quickly exploit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the issue of under 18, as far as I am concerned 
people under 18 are still not adults.  They are held criminally 
responsible for their activities pursuant to the Young Offenders 
Act, which is about to be changed pursuant to Bill C-3.  If the 
hon. member feels compelled that it should be brought before the 
committee, that drunk driving should be included in category 6 
offences which can receive adult sentences, I am open to the 
idea.  On the face of it, it strikes me as not a particularly 
good idea.  It strikes me as diminishing the whole concept and 
philosophy of youth justice.

<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ) </B>moved that Bill C-212, an act 
to amend the Canada Labour Code, the Parliamentary Employment 
and Staff Relations Act and the Public Service Staff Relations Act 
(prohibited provision in a collective agreement), be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today 
in the House to speak to Bill C-212, an act to amend the Canada 
Labour Code, the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations 
Act and the Public Service Staff Relations Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this long title means in fact is that Bill C-212 would 
render any provision in a collective agreement concluded under 
these acts, excluding a provision based on the seniority 
principle, of no force or effect where employees hired after a 
specific date do not receive the same employee benefits, wages 
or conditions of employment as those received by other employees 
covered by the collective agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, if such a provision is contained in a collective agreement 
signed on or after the coming into force of the act, it will be 
declared of no force or effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, if such a provision is contained in a collective agreement 
signed before the coming into force of this enactment, it will 
be of no force or effect on a day that is two years after the 
day on which this enactment comes into force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, as a responsible political party, the Bloc Quebecois 
would like to do away with orphan clauses, or discriminatory 
clauses if you prefer, in all collective agreements under 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear. The labour minister and the federal government 
absolutely refuse to admit there are orphan clauses in a number 
of collective agreements under their jurisdiction. But, later on 
in my remarks, I will prove that there are some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going any further, we should agree on a definition of 
orphan clauses. These are clauses in collective agreements under 
which employees hired after a specified date do not receive the 
same employee benefits, wages, or conditions of employment as 
those received by other employees who have been hired before 
that date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine the direct and indirect impact of such clauses on 
our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ottawa, the Bloc Quebecois has always been the only party to 
care about this issue. But just in Quebec, we have over 100,000 
workers who come under federal labour legislation, and are not 
covered under the Quebec labour code. This is true not only for 
Quebec workers, but for all workers in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discriminatory clauses are the source of a lot of frustration 
and create a rift between older and younger employees, 
generating tensions within businesses where they are in use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They greatly contribute to social inequality. Several studies 
have shown that income inequalities in Canada are linked to 
salary inequalities between young workers and more experienced 
ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1981 and 1993, the salaries of men aged 18 to 24 dropped 
by 20%, while the salaries of men in the 45 to 54 age group 
increased by 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The orphan clauses are a problem that must be fixed. They 
prevent young couples from providing their children with decent 
living conditions from a very early age. 
The Canadian Institute of Child Health explains the financial 
difficulties young families are facing, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economically, today's young families with children are worse off 
than were those of their parents' generation. In 1976, a single 
parent with one child needed to work 41 hours a week at minimum 
wage to bring the family up to the poverty line; in 1993, this 
had increased to 73 hours per week. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, especially the Minister of Labour, must 
recognize the long term effects of this kind of short term 
solution, which badly penalizes young people.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even more absurd, is that the labour minister and the 
federal government do not recognize that these provisions are 
discriminatory. A hundred thousand workers from Quebec who are 
subject to the Canada Labour Code are not protected against 
these discriminatory provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government understand that the opposition to these 
orphan clauses has nothing to do with a generation gap, but 
rather that these discriminatory provisions are what divide the 
generations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discriminatory provisions hurt the younger workers and that has 
significant social consequences on our society. 
The goal here is not to make victims out of our youth, but to 
take the time to consider the facts that seem to go against the 
values of solidarity and fairness which are necessary to social 
cohesion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Orphan clauses in collective agreements can make members of some 
generations feel they are being treated unfairly. Unfairness at 
a time when people are not as wealthy as they used to be is 
totally unacceptable. In this period of austerity, we have to 
stick together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to decry and fight against the unfair treatment handed 
out to the poor, the young, the elderly and so on, generations 
absolutely have to stand united. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the federal government not do as the province of Quebec 
did and create a parliamentary committee to consider the issue 
of discriminatory provisions in federal collective agreements? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are the labour minister and the federal government scared of 
facing the truth? Why not give the various stakeholders and 
parliamentarians the opportunity to go before a parliamentary 
committee and discuss this issue? Holding a social debate 
throughout Canada, would that not be a healthy and democratic 
way to address such an important issue as the orphan clauses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government would rather stay mute, turn a deaf ear 
and not take responsibility for a social problem that is all too 
real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec there is a strong consensus among a number of 
different stakeholders against the so-called orphan clauses. 
Opponents include the Bloc Quebecois, the national executive of 
the Forum Jeunesse du Bloc Quebecois, the Conseil national du 
Parti Quebecois, the Conseil des jeunes du PQ, the Jeunes 
libéraux du Québec, the CSN, the FTQ, the CERQ, to name but a 
few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, a Sondagem survey carried out from March 20 to 24 
found that 59.6% of the population of Quebec was opposed to 
unions signing collective agreements which imposed working 
conditions and salaries on new employees that were less 
advantageous than those of existing employees, and 41.7% of 
respondents reported that they would accept a cut in salary in 
order to make it easier for young people to enter the work 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given these survey findings, it is inconceivable that the 
federal government continues to turn a blind eye and a deaf ear. 
If it really intends to put an end to these orphan clauses, let 
it pass legislation along the lines of my Bill C-212. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the federal government finally have the courage to 
speak out against orphan clauses as the people of Quebec have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure hon. members that the Bloc Quebecois will keep on 
the federal government's case until it abolishes these clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, certain federal collective agreements do indeed 
contain discriminatory clauses.  I will give some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start with the CBC.  The Syndicat des techniciens et 
artisans du réseau français de Radio-Canada has negotiated an 
agreement with an orphan clause.  Article 31.1 of that agreement 
reads as follows, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Job guarantees, employees hired prior to December 1983. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Corporation makes a decision to significantly reduce 
operations at a given location, there will be no layoffs, 
terminations or salary reductions for STRF and NABET employees 
who were on strength as of December 31, 1983 and who are still 
employed on the date of signature of this collective agreement, 
provided they have completed their probationary period.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, a worker who joined the CBC after December 1, 1983 
may be laid off, have his employment terminated or have his 
salary reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But workers who joined before December 1 have job and pay 
guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is concrete proof that there are indeed orphan clauses in 
federal government agreements.  So the minister should stop 
telling us otherwise, because it is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Orphan clauses are not restricted to collective agreements. 
They are probably one of the most discriminatory clauses in 
Canada and can be found in the EI legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI clause, introduced in 1993, goes a long way towards 
explaining why the rate of coverage for young people between the 
ages of 20 and 24 has dropped from 49.1% in 1993 to 26.6% in 
1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision affects approximately 56,000 young people 
annually.  The clause that discriminates against young people 
can be found in section 7, Part 1, of the Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eligibility criteria for new entrants and re-entrants to the 
labour force are different.  This is a clause similar in every 
respect to the one found in certain collective agreements.  But, 
in this case, we are talking about the federal government's most 
important social safety net.  This clause potentially affects 
every young person in Canada. Not only does it create two 
classes of workers, but it also creates two classes of citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-212 seeks to put a stop, by eliminating any legal 
loophole, to any form of discrimination based on the use of 
orphan clauses, and should thus punish any violation of the 
principle governing intergenerational solidarity, without which 
a just and fair society cannot exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fight of the Bloc Quebecois against discriminatory clauses 
is a quest for equity. All workers in Quebec and in Canada are 
entitled to the protection that will be provided by Bill C-212. 
This fight is about ensuring a more just and fair society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 9, the hon. member for Charlesbourg introduced Bill 
C-470 which, like Bill C-212, sought to prohibit discriminatory 
clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, the federal government refused to debate the 
proposed measure. Today, I am coming back with Bill C-212. 
I do hope that the government will finally open its eyes and 
recognize that the use of orphan clauses creates social 
inequalities, something which must be condemned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the other opposition parties will support the Bloc 
Quebecois legislation. We should not engage in petty politics, 
as the Liberals really enjoy doing, when we are dealing with 
such an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also ask those Liberal members who have a social conscience to 
break ranks with their party and to support my bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evolution of society must not be viewed strictly with the 
present generation in mind. We must look further ahead and think 
about the future generations that will ensure our social, 
economic, political and cultural development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-212 seeks to give hope to young workers in Quebec and in 
Canada who work in a federally legislated business, and who are 
entitled to the same benefits as their elders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With its Bill C-212, the Bloc Quebecois wants to send to the rest 
of Canada a clear message that young workers, and those who are 
trying to join the workforce or are preparing to do so, must be 
considered full-fledged citizens, like all the other citizens of 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to make a couple of points with particular regard to 
the comments by the hon. member who just spoke in support of her 
private members' bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would take some exception that this is about 
having or not having a social conscience.  Frankly, this is very 
clearly an issue about labour relations.  To suggest that because 
a member on this side of the House, or of another party, does not 
support this means that somehow we do not have a social 
conscience is not an acceptable remark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clearly about the relationship between Canada and the 
provinces.  The Minister of Labour in the province of Quebec has 
introduced a bill that this one mirrors.  In fact, this one is 
drawn primarily from that bill.  It is Bill 67 in the province of 
Quebec.  I understand the minister in that province held a number 
of public consultations where people, including young people, 
gave their advice and opinions on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has admitted that she was unable to arrive at a 
consensus within her own province of Quebec, yet she is going 
ahead with introducing it into the national assembly.  I presume 
that is because there are fundamentally only two parties of 
strength in the legislature and it will carry.  I assume that Mr. 
Bouchard's government will pass this into law.  This is a 
provincial labour issue they are dealing with and they have every 
right to do that within the rights and the boundaries of their 
particular jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it strange though that a member of the Bloc would stand 
and say that because this is good for her province that this 
should necessarily expand to be good for all Canadians.  It is 
quite an unusual day to see a separatist defending anything 
outside the borders of the province of Quebec.  I have some 
difficulty with the rationale that somehow this should be good 
for all of Canada.  In fact, this is gerrymandering and political 
manipulation with the socialists who are obviously chirping away 
and who are obviously in bed with the separatists.  So we have 
the socialists and the separatists, the separatists and the 
socialists, together once again.  Philosophically I understand 
that.  I know where they come from.  They believe that all the 
collective bargaining and contracts should be done by mother 
state as opposed to allowing the collective bargaining process to 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is fundamentally the difference of philosophy between this 
side, the government, the NDP, and in this case the Bloc.  The 
Bloc members are fundamentally socialists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about my dad who the member went on about.  My 
father, when he was national director of the United Steelworkers 
of America, in all of Canada by the way, negotiated an agreement 
with Inco in Sudbury.  He negotiated a seven year collective 
bargaining agreement, the longest collective bargaining agreement 
in history.  That agreement put into place the protections that 
were necessary for the employees of the day and for new hires who 
came along as the seven year process expanded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what people like Bill Mahoney or Larry Sefton would say 
about the parliament of Canada telling the unions and the union 
leaders, who are duly elected by the rank and file of their 
union, who have a mandate given to them by the men and women who 
are in that union, what they should do to protect the men and 
women in their union.  Not only people like my father and Larry 
Sefton, but I think of old time, hard working union leaders like 
Joe Morris, Dennis McDermott and Johnny Barker from Sault Ste. 
Marie, who had a great saying. The socialists will love this. 
Johnny used to say, “Don't let your bleeding heart run away with 
your bloody head”. 
I always thought it was a classic.  Johnny understood that if 
there was not a plant in Sault Ste. Marie that was functioning 
and creating steel products, there would not be jobs for the 
members.  Johnny understood that this was not a sector of society 
where the government should be sticking its palmy, greedy little 
fingers.  Allow the union leaders and the executives who work in 
the industrial part of this country to come together and to work 
out agreements that make sense.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am on that subject, the labour movement is big business. 
We think about it in terms of being a union.  Let me tell the 
members it is big business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was 16 years old I drove the getaway car for my dad when 
we went to Sudbury with the steelworkers leading the raid on mine 
mill.  Why?  We wanted to get the communists the heck out of the 
labour movement.  There were too many of them infiltrated in the 
mine mill and we wanted to get them out.  We needed a getaway 
driver because it was dangerous stuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was scary stuff. They attempted to assassinate him on a 
couple of occasions. There were brawls in the hall of the 
President Hotel in Sudbury.  There were police in the streets. 
It was violent stuff, and I did not understand.  I said “Dad, 
what the heck are you doing this for?”  I did not understand 
what he was doing.  I thought this was a lot of scary stuff and I 
would rather be back home in Toronto, in Etobicoke, in my 
comfortable home than up here with all these tough mine workers 
and steel workers and all the fighting and everything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do the hon. members know what it was about?  It was about money. 
Let me tell the members why.  I did not know it then, but the 
mine mill people were paying monthly dues into their union and so 
were the steelworkers.  We had two unions, both negotiating 
directly with the company in Sudbury.  They were negotiating. One 
would get a deal, then the other one would come in and say “I 
want a better deal” and the other one would come in and say “I 
want to one-up those guys”.  There were conflicts.  There were 
more fights between the unions in Sudbury in those days than 
there ever were between the company and the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really interesting to hear the NDP members going on.  They 
have no understanding of the relationship, the positive, the 
pragmatic relationship that could be developed between a 
pragmatic labour leader representing the constituents, not 
walking around saying “I am vice-president of the New Democratic 
Party.  Hear me roar”.  What a bunch of nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NDP members should ask themselves a question.  If all people in 
the labour movement are socialist, how come those guys never get 
any votes?  How come the New Democratic Party does not form a 
government?  How do we elect federal Liberals in Sault Ste. Marie 
and Oshawa?  How do we do that?  How do we elect, God forbid, 
provincial Tories in places like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP have to get elected somewhere.  NDP members have to get 
a job somewhere.  I understand that.  We know that they are in 
trouble.  They have gone from two, and what are they up to, half 
a dozen or a dozen or whatever it is.  Joe who?  Joe what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really an interesting thing.  Why is it that the people in 
the labour movement in Windsor—think about it, Windsor—why do 
they not elect New Democratic Party members?  I do not know. They 
have even tried getting together to do strategic voting and they 
get thrown out of office.  Maybe they should understand that the 
men and women who work in the industrial heartland of this 
country have the same problems that we all have.  They want to 
put their kids through school.  Their VISA bill is about to 
explode.  Christmas is coming and they have to find the money to 
buy gifts for their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are concerned about their future.  They are concerned about 
their pensions.  They are not concerned about political 
manipulating and gerrymandering by any level of government to 
interfere in what is a true, great democratic process in this 
country called collective bargaining. It works.  We should 
support collective bargaining and we should stick to what we need 
to do as a government which, I would say to the hon. member 
opposite, is to keep this country united as the greatest country 
in the world in which to live.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to participate in the debate on this private members' bill 
brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois member for Laurentides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill seeks to ban the so-called orphan clauses or 
grandfather clauses from being included in collective agreements 
bargained for under the jurisdiction of the Canada Labour Code, 
the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act and the 
federal Public Service Staff Relations Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These clauses allow older workers or senior workers and long 
time employees to keep their acquired rights and privileges such 
as hours or pay rates.  These clauses are needed whenever a new 
collective agreement is reached which changes the previous 
conditions of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem that is created with this is that new and mostly 
young workers begin a job that, for example, pays less in the new 
agreement than it did in the old.  It could be that an employee 
who has been with a company for 10 years is making more money 
than a new employee doing the same job.  This would happen if a 
10 year veteran had his or her pay rate from a previous 
collective agreement protected in a subsequent collective 
agreement that applies to a new employee coming on to the job 
after that new agreement takes effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the problem that the hon. member is trying to address. 
At face value it seems a noble pursuit.  She is fighting a 
seemingly discriminatory two-tiered wage scheme.  If the workers 
who are generally young people start at lower rates, it can take 
longer for them to catch up.  I believe that these things should 
be worked out at the bargaining table during collective agreement 
negotiations between the employer and the employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those who are listening, Reform Party policy 
on employment and labour management relations states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A. The Reform Party supports the right of workers to organize 
democratically, to bargain collectively, and to strike 
peacefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>B. The Reform Party supports the harmonization of 
labour-management relations, and rejects the view that labour and 
management must constitute warring camps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>C. The Reform Party supports the right of all Canadians, 
particularly the young, to enter the work force and achieve their 
potential.  Unions and professional bodies may ensure standards 
but should not block qualified people from working or from 
gaining the necessary qualifications. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things regarding labour relations and collective 
bargaining, this is what the grassroots members of our party have 
written as our policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for bringing Bill C-212 before the 
House.  She has no doubt done a great deal of work on her bill. 
I asked her office to provide me with further information, 
further to the bill itself, for my information, knowledge and use 
in preparing to speak today.  But the member refused.  She told 
her assistant to tell my assistant that she would not provide me 
with explanatory notes or any other information related to the 
bill. This was most peculiar.  Why the secrecy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, I did my own research on this bill.  I have spoken 
with Labour Canada and the Professional Institute of the Public 
Service of Canada.  I contacted the Action démocratique Québec in 
the Quebec legislature and I have done research including a 
search of the media to find out what other people are saying 
about this issue and this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is similar to Bill 67 introduced by the Quebec 
separatist government.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This explains why the hon. member is bringing this matter before 
the House.  She wants the federal government to apply the same 
laws that the Quebec separatists are going to apply in their 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The separatist government in Quebec tried to pass this 
legislation before the last Quebec provincial election but it 
failed.  It is trying to pass it again and it is having problems 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultations were held throughout Quebec.  Employers were 
accused of not treating young people fairly and unions were 
accused of bargaining for less favourable working conditions for 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A report prepared by the Quebec labour department and tabled by 
the Quebec labour minister in the Quebec legislature says that if 
Quebec passes the law it will cost thousands of jobs.  I might 
add that the Quebec media reported that the labour minister 
tabled the report without even knowing if it concluded that these 
jobs would be lost.  Not only does this uncover the incompetence 
of the separatist minister, but it also points to the 
difficulties of accomplishing what this bill is trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder that one is hard pressed to find any other 
jurisdiction that has this legislation.  This legislation is not 
found anywhere because it is not needed.  Even if we give the 
hon. member the benefit of the doubt and try to justify the 
federal government becoming involved in the collective bargaining 
process, we find that we would place the government in the 
position of micro-managing things.  These kinds of policies lead 
to a crippled, ineffective government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to remedy a phenomenon that took place in the 
1980s.  The recession caused two tier wage schemes to be adopted 
as a means of fighting the economic recession and saved jobs from 
being lost.  These two tiered systems were not resorted to 
everywhere, and where they were, we hope they will be negotiated 
away by the arrival of the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stagnant Quebec economy, almost entirely ruined and soon to 
be entirely ruined by the minority separatist movement, appears 
to be continuing to suffer from the two tier wage scheme.  This 
is to be lamented.  Jobs in Quebec are indeed extremely valuable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The separatists should learn from this debate.  They should 
learn that in their economy there have been unique problems 
because of the political separatist movement.  Their economy 
cannot grow because investors do not want to risk their money in 
a place that could plunge into turmoil and chaos at any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Problems that are at least 20 years old continue to persist as 
the separatist political leaders stubbornly continue on their 
mission at the expense of workers and young Quebecers.  It is 
sad, but true.

hon. member for Laurentides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would amend the Canada Labour Code, the Parliamentary

employees hired after a specified date do not receive the same 
employee or pay benefits or conditions of employment as those 
received by other employees covered by the collective agreement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill provides that these workers will receive the same pay 
and conditions of employment as those received by other workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill addresses the issue of what is commonly called the 
orphan clauses. These clauses provide for workers hired after a 
specified date conditions that are lower than those set out in 
the collective agreement for other workers, in terms of pay, 
probationary period, social benefits, employment security of 
retirement plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These clauses may be temporary or permanent, depending on 
whether or not the new workers will be able in the short, medium 
or long term to enjoy the same working conditions than the older 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four main types of orphan clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first ones are permanent clauses dealing with pay scales. 
Under these clauses, the pay of older workers and the pay of new 
ones increase according to different pay scales, and the new 
workers cannot reach the same pay ceiling as the older workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also permanent clauses concerning flat rates of pay. 
Under these clauses, older and new workers are paid according to 
a flat rate, the rate for new workers being lower than the one 
for older workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there are permanent clauses dealing with both a flat rate 
of pay and a pay scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two possible scenarios under this scheme: either the 
older workers are paid according to a flat rate while the new 
workers are paid according to a wage scale without having the 
chance to ever reach the top rate given the older workers, or 
the older workers are paid according to a wage scale while the 
new workers are paid according to a flat rate which never 
reaches the pay ceiling granted to the older workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there are the temporary formulas applicable to wage 
scales, where the pay of old and new employees increases 
according to separate scales whose higher levels are established 
at the same rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that no matter what formula is applied, 
discriminatory clauses are causing a lot of frustration, are 
creating a cleavage between old and new employees and are 
generating tensions within businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discriminatory clauses can also affect the solidarity of union 
members, while undermining the credibility of unions with young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill addresses these legitimate concerns toward these 
discriminatory clauses that guarantee the working conditions of 
employees who are now in their position but that provide for 
reduced benefits for future employees. 
Discrimination toward new employees, mainly young people, is the 
direct consequence of these agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill recognizes and supports the seniority principle. 
However, it would prevent the implementation, in a collective 
agreement, of other discriminatory clauses that would allow 
employers to fill vacant positions by giving reduced salaries or 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people already have so much difficulty in the labour 
market without facing this additional discrimination. First of 
all, it is quite a challenge to find a job. Too often young 
people come out of universities and colleges, but cannot find 
work because they do not have the experience required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a vicious circle where our young people are trying to gain 
experience but do not have the opportunity to enter the job 
market. Right now, once again, some people want to punish them 
and discriminate against them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand, having been a union negotiator in the past, 
that union representatives are sometimes pushed to the wall. 
They are being told that if they do not want this or that they 
will not have a collective agreement. Some governments have used 
blackmail, saying “if you do not want that, everybody will be 
fired”. So they did not have a choice and were caught in this 
war to try to keep the jobs of their employees or their members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate to see that the member for Mississauga West 
has so little respect for unions when his brother worked for a 
union for years and his union salary allowed him to put food on 
the table. He was able to eat thanks to the steelworkers union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should be ashamed to rise today in the House of Commons and 
not be able to make a speech in all honesty and not even have 
respect for his own brother and for all the work he has done in 
this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who manage to find jobs, they are always temporary 
contract jobs that provide no security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once their contract is over, these same young people are left 
without a job and most of them are not eligible for employment 
insurance because of the 910 hours rule for new entrants. Once 
again, this is the fault of the Liberals and the Conservatives, 
who just keep hammering young people. That is what happened and 
today they still want to hammer young people by offering them 
salaries that are different from those of other employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, only 15% of young people who are unemployed receive 
employment insurance benefits. 
For young women without a job, the situation is even more 
precarious. Only 10% of them get employment insurance benefits. 
As if the situation of young workers were not difficult enough 
as it is, we have multiplied the number of orphan clauses 
according which new employees are paid lower wages and get lower 
benefits than their fellow workers who perform the same duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must put an end to such discrimination. Our young workers 
deserve the same wages and benefits as their fellow workers who 
perform the same duties. After all, it is a matter of equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a union representative, I even refused that a student 
be paid differently than another worker who had more seniority 
in the business. 
Our young people must not be discriminated against, as they are 
our children. Any member who is unwilling to support our 
children does not deserve to represent his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I noticed that the member for Laurentides asked a 
question to the Minister of Labour on this subject. The minister 
answered this, and I quote “All collective agreements are 
drafted by management and the union. Therefore, it is up to them 
to include appropriate clauses in theses agreements”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Minister of Labour adopt such an attitude toward 
our young workers?

mostly talking about the public sector. Does the Minister of 
Labour really want the future generation to lose everything we 
fought so hard for for so many years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people's lives should get easier from one generation to 
the other. However, for the current generation they are getting 
worse. Post-secondary education is more and more expensive even 
if the quality of education is diminishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said before, jobs are more difficult to find and 
working conditions are getting worse. We are now faced with 
orphan clauses which deal directly with our young workers' wages 
and working conditions. The Minister of Labour says that she has 
nothing to do with it. If she really wants to protect the rights 
of young people and workers, she should support this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, we should ensure that future generations 
will benefit from a better quality of life than what we have 
now. However, we often consider only the short term and in so 
doing we neglect the needs of our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative of the member for Laurentides is a good 
opportunity to begin to correct this situation. It is a good 
occasion to tell our young people “You are important to us and 
we will make sure that your interests are taken into account”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all my colleagues to support Bill C-212 and to end this 
discrimination against our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And to the Reform Party, which keeps talking about separation 
and separatists, I say that right now, on a Friday in the month 
of December, Quebec has not yet separated from Canada and we 
should not be talking about separation. We should work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for Laurentides for having introduced 
this bill in the House. I support it.

too would like to associate myself with the comments of the 
member for Acadie—Bathurst and say, yes, I am delighted that on 
December 3 Canada and Quebec are still partners in this great 
Confederation.  I am sure that this is the way it will stay for 
many generations to come.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate the member for Laurentides for bringing 
in any piece of legislation, private members or otherwise, that 
tries to protect the rights of workers in this country.  In this 
country, albeit we do have great difficulties on occasion, one of 
the difficulties we have is making sure our workers are treated 
fairly and properly in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at some of the things that are happening to the 1.3 
million Canadians who are unemployed, it is a case where in many 
ways they are the forgotten members of Canadian society.  There 
are 1.3 million Canadians unemployed every given day, December 3, 
December 4, January 3, January 4, the year 2000, the year 1999, 
the year 1998.  It seems to make little or no difference that we 
have this stagnant high unemployment rate of 1.3 million 
Canadians, over 8% across the country. In Newfoundland, something 
like 17% of our workforce is unemployed.  We will be more than 
happy to support any piece of legislation that will increase the 
chance of workers to earn a decent livelihood and be treated 
fairly in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being treated fairly in the workplace means that the government 
has to do a lot more than what it is doing now for the unemployed 
and the workers.  If we are unemployed in Canada, we seem to be 
forgotten by the government.  If we go work, we seem to get 
gouged by the government at every opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI fund is one example of where workers are abused and 
discriminated against in the country, where they are taxed above 
the norm and the tax goes into the employment insurance fund. The 
fund has a surplus in excess of $30 billion which is owned 
primarily by the workers and the employers of Canada.  Whether 
people are unemployed or working in the country, they can be 
discriminated against in many different ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party thinks that the EI fund has to rectified. Workers' 
rights have to be preserved and enhanced in any way possible. 
Bill C-212 does some of that and we are more than happy to 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people are or are not working in Newfoundland, they find 
that there are no training dollars.  People do not realize it but 
the HRDC office in Atlantic Canada and in Newfoundland, in 
particular, continually flaunts the statistics which say that the 
better educated and better trained we are the more opportunities 
we will have to get a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland there is not one solitary cent of discretionary 
spending that can now be approved for training in January of this 
year.  All of the training money that was allocated has been 
committed up to August.  The new budget starts on April 1 and by 
August all the training money will be committed. This means that 
a large number of Newfoundlanders who are among the 17% 
unemployed and who would like to get into the workforce, pay 
taxes and contribute to Canada, have no opportunity to do so 
because the Government of Canada has not seen fit to put some of 
the money, that it is taking from the working public of Canada 
through the EI fund, back into the training and education 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are examples of discrimination against workers.  This 
morning I asked some questions of the Minister of Transport, or 
his parliamentary secretary, about the InterCanadian employees. 
Today we have 900 employees whose lives are in a state of chaos 
because they do not know if they have a job.  Of those employees, 
700 in non-management have not received a paycheque this week 
because InterCanadian has had to cease business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did it have to cease business?  It had to cease business 
because the Minister of Transport said that the Canadian airline 
industry was in crisis.  As a result, InterCanadian lost a 
significant share of the market and was not able to effectively 
conduct their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a crisis created by the Minister of Transport who said 
something and then did not get involved in finding a solution. 
Today there are 700 families with no paycheques coming in from 
InterCanadian in Quebec and in Atlantic Canada.  It is a shame. 
This was caused by the Government of Canada saying one thing and 
not being willing to get involved to the same degree that it was 
in an earlier deal when some big shots, some very well-connected 
people, were going to use Onex, as a Canadian company, for a 
foreign-based takeover of Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is discrimination against workers in the workplace.  We 
saw the same thing happen with Air Atlantic when it moved out of 
Newfoundland and Atlantic Canada without any warning.  The 
Minister of Labour for the Government of Canada gave it relief 
from a 16 week severance package proviso that is in the labour 
code and had to be followed unless the Minister of Labour gave an 
agreement not to have it so done, which meant it took money out 
of the pockets of every worker who used to work for Air Atlantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member for Laurentides brings up Bill C-212, a bill 
that promotes equal treatment of employees within the workforce, 
allowing for the provisos of seniority, then we in our party are 
more than happy to support it.  If it equalizes wages, benefits 
and opportunities for people in the workforce, then we are more 
than happy to do it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We congratulate the member for bringing forward the bill.  It is 
one more way to make the workplace somewhat more fair.  It takes 
into account the concerns relating to seniority which are in all 
workplace agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative caucus will be happy to support the 
legislation because it makes the workplace somewhat more fair for 
those who are lucky enough to be in it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak to Bill C-212, although I cannot 
see myself supporting it.  As far as the government is concerned 
the bill is not good public policy.  It is an invitation to 
micromanage complex employment-employee relations from afar.  If 
experience has taught us anything, it is that government is not 
good at micromanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not consistent with the intent and philosophy of the 
Canada Labour Code which sets the framework and fundamental 
principles governing free collective bargaining in federal 
jurisdiction.  The Canada Labour Code has served the workers of 
Canada for in excess of 100 years.  Canada's philosophy 
concerning relations is based on notions of freedom of 
association and free collective bargaining, no micromanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in an approach to industrial relations that allows 
parties in the workplace to determine the terms and conditions 
that best govern their situation.  The heavy hand of government 
should not be present in all relations between employers and 
employees.  We do not believe government should regulate the 
relationship.  We do not believe the Canada Labour Code should 
intrude unnecessarily into the collective bargaining process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members will recall, our government brought forward 
amendments to part I of the Canada Labour Code last year.  The 
legislation was passed in January of this year.  Amendments 
improved and modernized the code, making the provisions governing 
collective bargaining in the federal jurisdiction more efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before bringing forward the new legislation extensive 
consultations were undertaken.  The consultations took many 
forms: public consultations, written submissions, informal 
meetings, consultations with interested groups, academic round 
tables, consultations with the Canada Labour Board, and labour 
management consensus groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultations addressed four key issues including ways to 
improve the collective bargaining process, methods to ensure the 
effective and efficient administration of the code, ways to 
facilitate labour-management co-operation, and changing workplace 
and employment relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A total of 87 submissions were received from a broad spectrum of 
stakeholders in the federal jurisdiction.  They included employer 
groups, unions and labour organizations, academics, provincial 
governments, territories, and other interested parties.  Each 
part of the country was represented including many organizations 
from the member's home province of Quebec, but none of the 
submissions asked for the kind of changes the member is asking 
for in the proposed bill.  In hockey parlance, it did not make 
the cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, based on such an extensive consultation process 
involving such a wide variety of persons there does not appear to 
be a widespread concern within the labour community for the 
changes proposed in the bill.  As a member of the government 
party of Canada I am opposed to the bill because it is not 
consistent with the philosophy and objectives of Canada's 
industrial relations system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the Government of Quebec has introduced amendments 
to Bill 67 which amends Quebec's labour standard legislation. The 
bill has an objective that appears similar to Bill C-212.  It 
also came to our attention that the original bill introduced by 
the Quebec minister of labour last June has run into some 
difficulties.  We saw in the media, for example, that there was a 
growing opposition to the Quebec bill from some groups, even 
those who advocate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On balance there does not seem to be consensus on what needs to 
be done in Quebec.  Organizations representing students and young 
workers have expressed concerns about a situation which according 
to them discriminates against younger workers who do not receive 
the same wages and benefits as older workers.  They have pressed 
for a legislative answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, 
but, as he knows, our rules allow the mover of the bill five 
minutes to wrap up at the end of the hour provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the hon. member for Laurentides has the floor for 
five minutes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, after having 
heard all the speakers, I would like to summarize the situation 
and say a few more words about Bill C-212. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals, the governing party, have once again buried their 
heads in the sand. Once again, they have ignored the problem 
caused by orphan clauses. It is a if it did not exist as far as 
they are concerned. Instead they indulged in petty politics, 
answering me almost rudely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said that all Quebec talked about was separation and that 
we should not get involved in the orphan clause issue. I have 
been sitting as an elected member of this place for six years 
already. I deal with federal issues, not with Quebec issues at 
the National Assembly; I do sit in the Parliament of Canada. The 
orphan clause issue is related to the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I find it unfortunate that this bill got so little 
attention.  Then, what really distressed me was the fact that 
the Minister of Labour, present in this House, did not even 
respond.  She did not even dare to rise and say what she really 
thought or at the very least give her opinions, even if they 
differed.  We could accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we cannot accept is having people say nothing because they 
are afraid, or for whatever reason, perhaps because they do not 
consider the matter important enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tabling a bill involves a whole procedure.  It takes a lot of 
time to move it from A to B or to C.  It is a long and difficult 
process, worthy of the importance due it.  What I saw today was 
a shrug of the government shoulders meaning forget that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not surprised by the reaction of my colleague in the 
Reform Party.  I know that, nothing to do with unions and 
employee and employer relations, excites them—and I choose my 
words to be kind.  So, I am not surprised by their reaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, I am very happy that my colleague from the 
NDP and my colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party 
understood the importance of reacting at this point.  A reaction 
is vital, because there has long been discussion of 
discriminatory clauses.  The government has long had its head in 
the sand and done absolutely nothing in this matter.  It is time 
to move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of young people in the labour market who want to 
join big companies or the public service and who will not enjoy 
the same rights as their elders.  Their education alone has put 
them in debt over their head. 
Nowadays, they are given jobs in areas where they will be 
penalized by discriminatory clauses that will prevent them from 
progressing as fast as their elders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, one out of four children lives below the poverty line. I 
believe it is time to open our eyes. We have huge budget 
surpluses, a projected $25.3 billion, but we are unable to 
provide fair working conditions for our young people. The 
minister could act immediately, but of course, she will not. As 
a matter of fact, she did not even dare to speak on the bill 
although she was here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we give our young people working conditions equal to 
their elders by giving them as good a career start as others 
enjoyed in their youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have we ever thought how rotten the atmosphere must be in a 
firm, a big company where there are dissimilar pay levels and 
working conditions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is utterly unacceptable nowadays. If the minister really 
wanted to make a difference, first she would have risen in the 
House today to at least face the music, and second, the Liberals 
would not have played politics with such an important piece of 
legislation as this bill on discriminatory clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time provided for the consideration of 
Private Members' Business has now expired and the order is 
dropped from the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 2.30, the House stands adjourned until Monday next at 
11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 2.30 p.m.)
