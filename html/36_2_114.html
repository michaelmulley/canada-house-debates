introduce you to the circle of patronage in the Department of the 
Solicitor General. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reward his voters, the solicitor general builds a 
multimillion dollar research facility in his riding.  Old 
fashioned Liberal politics at its finest.  In turn, the 
Commissioner of Correctional Service Canada uses his facility as 
a meeting place for his international corrections; good for the 
local economy and good for the solicitor general.  In return, the 
commissioner's reward was absolute authority.  He does not have 
to answer to anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the story gets bizarre.  To reward the solicitor 
general for staying out of his way while he paves his golden road 
to retirement, Ole Ingstrup has created an award in the name of 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the commissioner buttering up to the solicitor general this 
blatantly, we had better steel ourselves for the next bombshell 
to come.  What could it be, a private plane for Ole? No, he has 
that.  A driving range for inmates?  No, he has that too.  A boat 
cruise on a coast guard ship?  He has done that.

parental leave available under the employment insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only one province in Canada offers a program of preventive

Quebec.  When he was a Canadian MP here in Ottawa, Lucien 
Bouchard never did anything about such program for expectant 
mothers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the Government of Canada has doubled the duration of 
parental leave, effective December 31, 2000, while Lucien 
Bouchard wants his own program, but only in the year 2002.  This 
is a program that will $10 million to workers, $14 million to 
employers and $20 million to the self-employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has been administering parental leave for 
close to 30 years.  Thanks to those years of experience, all of 
the mechanisms are in place to ensure that parents benefit from 
this improved federal program, starting December 31 of this 
year, not the year 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is essential today is that Canada and Quebec work together 
to find the real solution to making more resources available to

reproductive system.  It affects women of all ages, particularly 
those over 30.

Indian Affairs and Northern Development is negotiating a flawed 
self-government treaty with the Westbank Indian Band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The B.C. treaty commission process, though far from perfect, 
allows for some third party input and includes the B.C.

the Westbank Indian Band excludes any input from the citizens of 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Union of British Columbia Municipalities along with 
concerned landowners are troubled that the federal government is 
negotiating a treaty in a veil of secrecy that will ultimately 
entrench preferential rights for certain Canadians at the expense 
of others.  Not only that, it will arbitrarily assign resources, 
tax dollars and crown property to a distinct group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the concern expressed in B.C. over the Nisga'a final 
agreement, it is essential that the remaining negotiations be 
opened to all concerned parties in B.C. and then be put to a 
British Columbia referendum.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 30

<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
will take a look at the Employment Insurance Act.  At section 
69, it provides, among other things that “the Commission shall, 
with the approval of the governor in council, make regulations 
to provide a system for premiums where an equivalent provincial 
program exists”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the Prime Minister's statements, the commission cannot 
refuse to negotiate, it has to reach a settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister realize that his own legislation 
requires him not only to negotiate but to reach a settlement? 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the law provides that reaching a settlement is required but also 
stipulates with the approval of the governor in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We negotiated with them in good faith a few years ago, but we 
could not reach an agreement.  We assumed our responsibilities 
and we believe that it was important to increase parental leave 
benefits so people could have children without losing their job. 
We extended the period to 12 months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, as I said earlier, the provincial government finds that it 
should inject more money, that there are social problems it is 
responsible for, it should assume its responsibilities.  We have 
assumed ours. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the parental 
insurance matter is not a complicated one.  We are dealing with 
two programs— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> —one of which is more advantageous because 
it applies to all young families, while the other excludes a 
very large number of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Setting aside the confrontation with Quebec and his short-term 
political interests, does the Prime Minister not find that the 
best choice, the most obvious choice, the required choice, is to 
be on the side of these young families, by offering them the 
best program, that is the one that is part of Quebec's family 
policy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the two are not mutually exclusive.  We cover those who have 
contributed to employment insurance.  If there are people who 
have not contributed to employment insurance and who are having 
problems, that comes under the social policy of the provincial 
government, and it is up to it to solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all the more the case because we transfer funds to the 
provinces to help them in this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien: </B>Yes, we do, Mr. Speaker, but the only 
thing is that they do not always apply them to social programs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we cannot 
understand the Prime Minister's attitude in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that we are asking him to do is to sit down and negotiate, 
in keeping with subsection 69(2) of the Employment Insurance 
Act.  The more involvement he has in this matter, the less we 
understand where he is headed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is he opposed to doing what is best for Quebec's young 
families? 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member would like us to intervene in the social policy 
of the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they want to look after families who are not covered by 
employment insurance, that is their choice; they have the power 
to do so, and they have the opportunity to do so.  They should 
thank us for covering a goodly proportion of families.  They can 
cover the rest if they think that there is a problem that is of 
great concern to them.

is the government now prepared to say that $400 for an operating

Mr. Speaker, speaking of all talk and no action, the government

This Liberal government undermined Canada's international

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>   Mr. Speaker, proving once again that 
the Liberal government is the world's worst project manager, 
evidence has come forward that undermines Canada's international 
reputation, again due to the bungled effort to remove 
land mines in Kosovo.  Bureaucratic delays, contract squabbles, 
political interference and poor housing undermined Canada's 
effort and led to CIDA's confirmation that Canada is not living 
up to its commitment to remove land mines in Kosovo.  Amid much 
fanfare, Canada was supposed to take a lead role in this 
humanitarian effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was our effort so ill-equipped and ill-prepared that a 
senior UN diplomat called it a joke and a laughingstock? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in fact it is not as bad as the hon. member 
says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there were 800,000 refugees on the move back to Kosovo. 
The United Nations asked for emergency action on the part of 
Canada.  There were some problems at the outset of the program 
and that was why CIDA commissioned an internationally recognized 
consultant to look at the projects.  We implemented every 
recommendation.  In fact, the UN even wrote to CIDA asking that 
both projects be extended by a month, stating that they had 
“provided the UN mine action program with a much needed 
capability”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, that does not have a lot of credibility coming from 
this minister because high ranking UN officials and Canadian 
consultants accused CIDA, the minister and foreign affairs 
officials of shoddy planning which resulted in ill-equipped 
Canadian de-mining crews. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Delays in the most recent contract awards mean that work cannot 
begin until late this summer, more than halfway through the 
removal season.  Our international reputation has been

First of all, Canada is not out of the de-mining situation in 
Kosovo.  We gave $500,000 in core funding to the UN mine action 
committee early this spring to assist.  As well, a team that was 
chosen will be on the ground within two weeks and in operation 
within the next month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process has been a very good process.  When we went through

The rest are either still in detention—and now some are

parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pages of the House of Commons for 1999-2000, today we the 
parliamentarians of Canada bid you farewell.  It seems a little 
strange since the House is still sitting and we are all still on

thank you and congratulate you on the work you have done for us 
over the past year, the first of the new millennium.  Your job 
has not always been an easy one, but you have all behaved 
professionally and we appreciate it.

receive our collective thanks and our best wishes for your future

</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps some day soon we will have the pleasure of seeing you 
sitting at these desks and thinking perhaps it was your 
experience with us that gave you the desire to serve as a member 
of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank you very much for what you have done for us.  We have 
paid you I think the greatest compliment we can pay our pages, 
that is we have trusted you so implicitly that we have virtually 
ignored you in all of our conversations.  We treat you as one of 
us.  We treat you as part of the family, which you are now and 
always will be.

to come in to say a personal farewell to them.  It will be 
continuing until 5:30.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MOTION NO. 425 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order with regard to Motion No. 425 
standing on the order paper in my name.  The motion reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a message be sent to the Senate to acquaint their honours 
that this House wishes to convey its dismay regarding the undue 
delay in the Senate's progress on Bill C-247, an Act to amend the 
Criminal Code and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. 
Members of the House of Commons have expressed their distress at 
the unnecessary delay in dealing with this legislation and in the 
interest of co-operation between the two chambers, and, 
ultimately service to the Canadian public, the House feels 
compelled to express its serious concerns regarding the handling 
of Bill C-247 by the Senate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the notice paper this motion is listed as a private member's 
motion. 
I intended this motion to be placed on the order paper so as to 
be moved at Routine Proceedings under the rubric motions.  I 
believe this is the only way a private member can realistically 
and practically deal with the Senate with respect to a private 
member's bill.  I will also argue that placing this motion on 
notice for Routine Proceedings is in keeping with our practice. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 16, 1996, a number of members raised questions of 
privilege to complain that the Standing Committee on Justice was 
not dealing with Private Member's Bill C-234.  It was argued that 
while a government could use time allocation to dislodge a bill 
from committee, a private member had no means to do this except 
by way of introducing another private member's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was pointed out that a second private member's motion dealing 
with the issue would have little chance of being considered by 
the House because of the complex and sometimes awkward process of 
private members' business.  It would be like lightning striking 
the same place twice and very unlikely to ever happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members felt that since the majority sent the bill to committee, 
the committee should respect the will of the House.  This 
principle was so important to members that the standing orders 
were changed to ensure that this situation would never happen 
again.  Before this change was instituted, the Speaker felt that 
one way of dealing with the matter was to allow a motion to be 
moved by a private member during Routine Proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles regarding the fate of Bill C-234 in 1996 are 
similar to the principles regarding Bill C-247 in this 
parliament.  In both cases the government leadership was out to 
kill a private member's bill.  Fortunately both bills enjoyed the 
support of the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Bill C-247 it was gutted at committee by the 
government leadership.  Thankfully it was restored by the power 
of the backbench and opposition members when it was reported back 
to the House.  Through all its stages and despite the efforts of 
anyone else the majority supported the bill, and finally the 
House sent it to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the Senate has unduly held up Bill C-247.  I 
suspect this hold-up is due in part to the many friends that the 
government side may have over in the Senate, possibly because of 
the appointments that have been made there.  Sadly this may cause 
more problems for private members' bills that do not enjoy the 
support of the Prime Minister in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 23, 1996, the Speaker made his ruling on the 
questions of privilege regarding Bill C-234.  He did not rule the 
matter to be a prima facie case of privilege but he did make the 
following comment and suggestion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should a member or a minister be of the opinion that a committee 
charged with the review of a bill is defying the authority of the 
House, he or she may choose to bring it to the attention of the 
House by placing on notice a motion to require the committee to 
report by a certain date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, this can indeed be done under Government 
Orders or Private Members' Business, but such a notice of motion 
could also be placed under the rubric motions and be dealt with 
under Routine Proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Speaker Fraser ruled on July 13, 1988, at page 17506 of the 
<I>Debates</I>, referring to the then Standing Order 56(1)(p), 
which is our current Standing Order 67(1)(p): 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“This Standing Order lists as debatable items usually raised 
under Routine Proceedings motions concerning the management of 
the (House) business (and) the arrangements of its proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The rubric motions usually encompasses matters related to the 
management of the business of the House and its committees, but 
it is not the exclusive purview of the government, despite the 
government's unquestioned prerogative to determine the agenda of 
business before the House.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under our current practices the Chair may well accept, after due 
notice, such a motion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 67 lists motions that can be moved during Routine 
Proceedings.  They are: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—for the observance of the proprieties of the House, the 
maintenance of its authority, the appointment or conduct of its 
officers, the management of its business, the arrangements of its 
proceedings, the correctness of its records, the fixing of its 
sitting days or the times of its meeting or adjournment. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate's failure to deal with Bill C-247 in a timely manner 
relates to the proprieties of the House, the maintenance of its 
authority and the management of its business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are talking about a private member's bill, it stands to 
reason that a private member should be allowed to move a motion 
under the rubric motions and send a message to the Senate 
regarding the progress of the said bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a government bill was stuck in the Senate, the government 
could move a motion under motions to send a message to the 
Senate.  Mr. Speaker, as you ruled on September 23, 1996, motions 
are not for exclusive use by the government.  Therefore, I should 
be allowed to move my motion under motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Prime Minister has been talking about an 
election perhaps in the fall, certainly within 12 months.  If the 
Senate does not deal with Bill C-247 it will die.  This 
government, through its power to send a message to the Senate and 
through the leader of the government in the Senate, can easily 
set the government's priority in the other place.  Private 
members cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the eve of an election, if we are on the eve of an election, 
this House should be allowed to send a message to the Senate 
without going through the many hoops and the impossibility of 
timing of the private member's system.  There is not time to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interests of the people who elected us to this House and 
those who want Bill C-247 to become law, which is a majority of 
people in this place, the House has an obligation to communicate 
to the Senate its concern about the fate of Bill C-247.  Once 
again, the motion says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a message be sent to the Senate to acquaint their honours 
that this House wishes to convey its dismay regarding the undue 
delay in the Senate's progress on Bill C-247, an Act to amend the 
Criminal Code and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, 
members of the House of Commons have expressed their distress at 
the unnecessary delay in dealing with this legislation and in the 
interest of co-operation between the two chambers and, 
ultimately, service to the Canadian public, the House feels 
compelled to express its serious concerns regarding the handling 
of Bill C-247 by the Senate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would ask for your consideration of that point of 
order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. House leader for the 
official opposition has made a plea that the situation of Bill 
C-247 was, in his view, substantially similar to that of Bill 
C-234 and therefore the judgment of the Speaker on Bill C-244 
applies equally to Bill C-247. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues are not at all the same.  In the case of the other 
bill that the hon. member referred to, it had to do with the 
House exercising its authority over one of its committees.  In 
this case, the situation is totally different.  This does not 
take away from the merits of the bill in question and so on.  I 
am not pronouncing myself on that.  This is a procedural argument 
as to whether or not what was used in the case of one applies to 
the other.  I submit to your honour that it does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also referred to 67(1)(p) of the Standing 
Orders.  Standing Order 67(1)(p) refers to: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>such other motion, made upon Routine Proceedings, as may be 
required for the observance of the proprieties of the House,— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not of the Senate.  That is not covered by that particular 
item.  The order goes on to say: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the maintenance of its authority, the appointment or conduct of 
its officers, the management of its business— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Its authority” means the authority of the House.  “Its 
officers” means officers of the House not the Senate.  “Its 
business” is the House's business, and so on and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reference to the Senate, there are only two applications 
under the standing order where it applies.  This has to do with a 
conference of the Senate which only applies in the case where a 
bill has been passed by the House, refused by the Senate, sent 
back to the House, the House has disagreed with the Senate and 
then a conference is necessary in order to re-establish how to 
deal with the matter.  That is the only place where it applies to 
the Senate.  It has to do do with a conference stage of the bill 
which is about three steps away from what we have now, in any 
case, a very long time from the period that we have in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing order in question applies only to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one minor exception where it could apply and that 
is Standing Order 67(1)(g) when we are considering Senate 
amendment to a House of Commons bill.  Again, that proposition is 
not before us.  Although the hon. member may have made an 
interesting point, I do not believe that the reference to motions 
as being applicable for this particular case works at all.  I am 
convinced that it does not.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is an interesting procedural argument, but I would just like 
to say that whatever its outcome, I would think all members of 
parliament, no matter how they voted on the particular private 
members' bill in question, should be concerned about any 
developments which tend to sanction or portray an inability on 
the part of the House to have the Senate deal expeditiously with 
things that have been passed here in the House of Commons.  This 
is, after all, the elected Chamber in this parliament and the 
Senate should not take upon itself the role of deliberately 
withholding the appropriate procedural passage of anything that 
has already gone through the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not want to get into a debate, but if 
the opposition House leader has something to offer for my 
consideration, then I want to hear it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do realize that the 
Standing Order 67, which I quoted, does only refer to the Senate 
and how we can handle House business and so on and does not 
necessarily refer to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader has pointed out that we are probably 
three steps away before the normal process of dealing with 
business coming back from the Senate.  Of course, that is the 
essence of my argument.  We will never get those three more steps 
going if the Senate continues to wilfully block it in that place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is allowed to continue, the logic is that the Senate 
could take a bill and we would never see it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Let me understand this.  First, the Senate 
is the master of what it does in the Senate and we are the master 
of what we do here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand the member's point of order, he is suggesting 
that this item, which he has brought forward in a private 
members' bill, should be moved over into motions.  Is that 
correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Thank you. I have received advice from both 
sides and I will deal with that specific point.  What is in the 
bill is of no concern to me at this point.  I am dealing with 
that procedural issue.  I will deal with that, have a look at it 
and come back to the House if necessary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, community 
television, which has developed throughout Quebec in recent 
years, has been a response to community needs and has focused on 
local identity, a sense of community, providing emergency 
information, and generally bringing the community together. 
Today, it is experiencing serious operating difficulties, even 
threats of having to close down.  This is all because of 
ambiguity in the interpretation of its role and mission between 
the community television corporation on the one hand and the 
cable company on the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a petition to table, signed by 1,575 people on behalf of 
the population of Châteauguay.  The petitioners call upon the 
government to intervene with the CRTC in order to restore 
community television to our community that is dictated by its 
needs and not by the economic imperatives of the cable company.

to the attention of the House that the cable company Vidéotron 
is not respecting the community programming slot it promised the 
CRTC it would preserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are asking for CRTC intervention in order to 
obtain the re-opening of our community television channel as soon 
as possible, as well as asking the CRTC to carry out the public 
examination of broadcasting distribution that was promised in 
January 1998.

comments on Motions Nos. 3, 5 and 6.  Motion No. 3 is put forward 
by the Canadian Alliance to make sure that there is an 
accountability factor in the issue of shipping and that the 
definition of shipper is clarified in the legislation.  This 
amendment would do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5, also put forward by the Canadian Alliance, would 
make this act precede over all others.  Anybody working under the 
auspices of this act could not go to another one to seek 
loopholes and to find ways of getting exemptions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well Motion No. 6 is put forward by the Canadian Alliance. It 
is a motion that would make clear that the government would move 
to a commercially accountable contract based system.  Of course 
the whole bill should have done that in a more dramatic manner 
than it has. 
<P><A NAME="LINK300"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise today to address 
Motions Nos. 2, 3, 5 and 6 put forward by the member for 
Brandon—Souris and the member for Lethbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 2 and 3 seek to add a new definition of shipper to 
the Canada Transportation Act.  One proposed definition states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“shipper”, in respect of a contract for the movement of grain, 
means the person who is identified as the shipper on the bill of 
lading. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other states that a shipper means the person responsible for 
transferring the grain to the carrier.  Let me point out that 
there is already a definition of shipper in the current 
transportation act.  The act already defines the shipper as a 
person who sends or receives goods by means of a carrier or 
intends to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-34 the government did not change that definition.  If 
we were to accept the proposed definitions, we would end up 
having two definitions of shippers in the act.  Similar motions 
were debated at committee stage and were not supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adding a special definition for grain shippers would be 
confusing, should an interested party wish to file a complaint 
with the Canadian Transportation Agency.  It seems that this is a 
back door attempt to get at the issue of the Canadian Wheat 
Board's transportation role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that the Canadian Wheat Board's transportation role 
is being addressed through a memorandum of understanding that was 
shared with the Standing Committee on Transport last week.  A 
memorandum of understanding is a document to be signed by the 
minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board and the 
Canadian Wheat Board itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MOU reflects the government's decision, which was made after 
very careful consideration of the recommendations made by Mr. 
Justice Estey and Mr. Kroeger, and the extensive feedback from 
many stakeholders.  The changes move to a more commercially based 
system involving tendering while at the same time addressing the 
concerns of producers about the ability of the wheat board to 
successfully fulfil its marketing mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5 states that if there is a conflict between the 
Canada Transportation Act or any regulations made under this act 
and any other act that applies to the movement of grain, or any 
regulations made under that other act, the Canada Transportation 
Act prevails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw attention to subsection 4(1) of the Canada Transportation 
Act.  This section already addresses the issue of conflicts 
between orders or regulations made under the Canada 
Transportation Act and orders or regulations made under any other 
act in respect of a particular mode of transportation.  The 
Canada Transportation Act states that the order or regulation 
made under the Canada Transportation Act shall prevail.  I 
believe that this is once again an effort to change the 
government's policy decision on the transportation role of the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Motion No. 6, it would preclude the Canadian Wheat Board 
from entering into contracts with the railways for the movement 
of grain, beginning no later than July 31, 2005.  The Canadian 
Wheat Board's transportation role has been covered in the 
memorandum of understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of its decision on grain handling and transportation, 
the government will establish a mechanism of continuous 
monitoring, measurement and reporting to provide information to 
the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat 
Board on the impact of these reforms and the overall performance 
of the reformed grain handling and transportation system.  Should 
the monitor identify any problems or opportunities to improve the 
system further, the government will be in a position to act.  I 
do not support the motions as presented.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will speak very briefly to the proposed amendments.  I must stand 
after those last comments made by the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments were put forward by witnesses and by 
organizations that appeared before the committee.  They were 
amendments that were, in most cases, approved and suggested by 
those organizations in order to make the legislation better than 
what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak specifically to the amendment that was put forward 
by myself as well as the member from the Canadian Alliance Party, 
that being the definition of shipper.  That speaks to the essence 
of the bill which was to have a true commercial system. 
Unfortunately, the Canadian Wheat Board once again got its wish 
and its way in order to manipulate the process to the point where 
this will not be a true commercial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the memorandum of understanding, we wanted to have that 
open and transparent, as the government has always indicated that 
it should be.  The fact is that now the memorandum of 
understanding need not come before parliament and need not come 
before members of the committee.  It need only be dealt with by 
the Canadian Wheat Board and the minister, as well as the 
monitor. It goes specifically to the minister as opposed to 
parliament. I believe that speaks specifically to not having it 
open and transparent and having a system in place that is not 
only the same as we had before but in fact worse than what we 
had.  I will speak to that on third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments are solid, good amendments.  Unfortunately, they 
are not going to be passed because the government does not want 
to see better legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK302"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I too 
want to rise at report stage on this group of amendments and run 
through the position of the New Democratic Party.  I will be ever 
so brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Motions Nos. 2 and 3, I agree with the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, these are 
fundamental to the whole debate.  Implementation of either of 
these amendments would weaken the Canadian Wheat Board and result 
in more power to the railways.  We believe that being recognized 
as the shipper is fundamental and a key for the wheat board to 
negotiate overall rail capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this caucus believe that the Canadian Wheat Board does 
maximize returns for farmers through meeting sales commitments 
and by holding railways and grain companies accountable for their 
service obligations.  The board can only continue to perform 
these vital functions if it remains the shipper. We are opposing 
those two particular motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are, however, supporting Motion No. 4 submitted by the member 
for Brandon—Souris on rural prairie roads and what happens when 
railways exceed the revenue cap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that the changes to the grain transportation system 
will increase the pressure on roads.  Indeed, the government 
recognizes that as well and has announced that it will be 
contributing $175 million over the next five years to help to do 
something about improving the condition of those roads.  It is 
noteworthy that Bill C-34, in and of itself, does not deal at all 
with funding for rural roads and this amendment simply implements 
the government's announcement concerning funding.  We concur with 
that and will be supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the revenue cap, the amendment says that if and 
when the railways exceed the revenue cap in any given year the 
railways will have to pay to producers the amount of their 
revenue that exceeds that cap.  This too will help producers, and 
we will be supporting that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5, which was put forward by the Canadian Alliance, 
would ensure that the Canadian Transportation Act prevails over 
the wheat board.  If implemented, we believe that the railways 
could argue through the CTA against the board's ability to 
provide grain transportation services to producers on a train, at 
a station or on a branch or shortline.  The railways could argue, 
therefore, that providing these services affects its ability to 
meet their common carrier and level of service obligations.  This 
too, we believe, would have a negative impact on the wheat 
board's ability to return the best possible value to producers 
through providing access to the system. 
The amendment attempts to use the Canada Transportation Act, 
in our opinion at any rate, to regulate the Canadian Wheat Board 
Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  It is a Trojan horse, as my colleague 
for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar reminds me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CTA is intended to regulate transportation providers with 
regard to rates and how those providers conduct business with 
shippers.  The purpose of the CTA is not to regulate other pieces 
of legislation, such as the Canadian Wheat Board Act.  Regulating 
the Canadian Wheat Board Act is accomplished through the 
regulations in the act itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP caucus will not be supporting Motion No. 5, nor will we 
be supporting Motion No. 6 which says that by August 1, 2005 
there will be a fully commercial system to move grain from 
elevator to port.  In our opinion, that would obviously leave the 
Canadian Wheat Board with no role whatsoever in transporting 
western grain to port.  We believe that this is another excessive 
gift to the railways and the grain companies that will ultimately 
be injurious to producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board cannot be an effective marketer of grain if it 
is unable to fulfill its sales contracts by ensuring an adequate 
supply of that commodity.  This can only be accomplished if the 
board maintains a significant role in grain transportation from 
the country elevator to the port spout. There can be no 
protection for producers without wheat board involvement in grain 
transportation.  We will be opposing that motion as well.  I will 
have more to say on this at third reading.

found in the bill.  I want to take this opportunity to 
acknowledge the extensive work done by the Standing Committee on 
Transport which took written submissions and heard testimony from 
about 30 different organizations in the short space of one week. 
I congratulate the members of the committee, in particular the 
hon. member for Hamilton West who was the chair, and my 
parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for Thunder 
Bay—Atikokan who did an outstanding job at the committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This committee has worked wonders in this parliament.  They had 
the airline restructuring proposals last fall, the airline bill, 
this grain bill, plus three other bills.  They have certainly 
worked extremely hard.  I want all Canadians to know that members 
on this side of the House and on the other side of the House have 
worked with due diligence on behalf of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The western grain industry is one of the largest segments of the 
Canadian agri-food sector.  In dollar terms, it ranks close to 
the forestry industry, the automobile industry, the mining 
industry and the fishing industries.  Total Canadian grain 
production averages 60 million tonnes a year, with about half of 
this amount being exported.  Production which is not exported is 
consumed domestically by the livestock industry, flour milling 
and other value-added processing activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efficiency of the grain handling system has been the subject 
of much debate over the past few years.  Most contend that the 
current system cannot continue to operate as it is and still 
allow for the industry to maintain its competitiveness in an 
international marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present system is managed centrally, making it difficult to 
hold anyone accountable when things go wrong.  Freight rates do 
not vary to encourage more efficient use of the transportation 
assets over the crop year or during peak periods.  The majority 
of wheat board business is allocated to grain companies and to 
railways by historic shares rather than by competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years ago, as I said earlier when I spoke on this at 
second reading, I went with my colleagues to Winnipeg to meet 
with all the stakeholders.  We agreed that we would try to do 
something about the breakdown of the system that occurred in the 
winter of 1996-97.  I feel particularly good about the process 
that has been followed.  We appointed an eminent jurist, Mr. 
Willard Estey, a native of Saskatchewan, who gave us a very 
comprehensive report advocating reforms toward a more competitive 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then asked the former distinguished deputy minister Arthur 
Kroeger, a native of Alberta, to take the theory of Mr. Estey and 
put it into practical form, to put some bones to the framework, 
as it were, and both of those gentlemen worked exceptionally hard 
and brought forward their recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been criticized for not entirely following the 
recommendations of those two gentlemen.  However, it was always 
assumed that those gentlemen would give us the overall conceptual 
framework and some ways that the framework could be implemented. 
However, ultimately it was government and parliament that had to 
make the political decisions.  We have to make the political 
trade-offs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have done that successfully.  The fact that even 
though members on the other side are not entirely happy with 
every aspect of this bill, the fact that there are really no 
dissenting voices on the other side, means that we have it right. 
I like to be accurate, but I cannot believe that there is 
actually one member of the Canadian Alliance in the House that 
would say no to a measure that will put money in the pockets of 
the western farmers.  I am sure that I have not heard any dissent 
on the other side.  I am not used to covering up for anyone, and 
certainly not for the misdemeanours of the opposition, but I take 
them at face value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that everyone in the House agrees that we have it right, 
that we are putting money in the hands of the producers and that 
there has been significant changes made throughout the system. 
The bill will not be proclaimed unless the MOU is satisfactory. 
We are still holding consultations on the MOU.  I have talked 
with the presidents of the railways.  We have talked with the 
grain companies.  My colleague, the minister responsible for the 
wheat board, who was here a few minutes ago, has worked very hard 
at trying to calibrate that MOU so that it deals with the 
concerns of the various stakeholders.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this shows that we are sensitive.  We are trying to get 
this particular measure right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four main measures within the bill which have a large 
impact on the problems that were uncovered over three years of 
discussion.  First, there is the annual limit on railway grain 
revenue, what we now call the revenue cap.  Second, there have 
been enhancements to the final offer arbitration.  Third, 
enhancements have been made to the branch line process.  Finally, 
we have added measures to help obtain and share information 
required for the monitoring of the grain system in a secure 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to unduly hold up the passage of this bill at 
third reading, but I would be remiss if I did not emphasize once 
again that the bill does contain a limit on rail revenues of $27 
a tonne for the crop year commencing August 1, which is 18% lower 
than the effective revenue per tonne in 2000-01 under current 
law, announced recently by the Canadian Transportation Agency 
after its deliberations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Railways will have the flexibility to vary individual grain 
rates at any time to reflect efficiency and to offer more 
innovative services to shippers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also designates the agency as having the responsibility 
to monitor compliance based on actual grain movements and 
distance hauled.  If the agency at the end of the year determines 
there are any railway earnings in excess of the cap, the excess 
amounts will be repaid with a penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The revenue cap will be adjusted annually to reflect railway 
inflation, starting in 2001-02.  Shippers whose traffic starts 
from branch lines will have an assurance that the tariff rates 
for single car movements originating on branch lines will not be 
allowed under this bill to exceed main line tariff rates for 
similar movements by more than 3%.  I think that is an effective 
guarantee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments to the CTA in Bill C-34 will also make significant 
improvements to the final offer arbitration process.  It will 
require shippers to submit their whole proposal as part of the 
application, excluding dollar amounts.  After 10 days the shipper 
and the railway will exchange their complete final offers 
simultaneously, including dollar amounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A simplified arbitration mechanism is proposed for arbitration 
involving freight charges that total no more than $750,000.  In 
this faster process the time between the shipper filing the 
initial submission and the final decision will not exceed 30 
days.  At the request of the shipper or for arbitration of 
disputes above $750,000 a 60 day process will be followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill allows the establishment of a three person panel on 
agreement by both parties to hear more complex disputes.  Of the 
three arbitrators, one would be chosen by the shipper, one by the 
railway and one by the two arbitrators.  Failing that, the agency 
could select the third arbitrator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were many members of the House on both sides who were 
concerned with the provisions of the CTA in 1996 which allowed 
the railways a certain procedure for the abandonment of branch 
lines without recourse to the governor in council.  I know this 
is going to be an ongoing discussion as we start the review of 
the act on July 1.  I will be announcing the appointment of 
prominent people to conduct that review very shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have included in this bill, because of the urgency and the 
need for balance in the system, specific provisions that would 
not only allow the two railways to reduce their costs, but 
facilitate the transfer of branch lines for continued operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main goal of these provisions was to ensure that a community 
could maintain the rail line, which is so often the lifeblood of 
the town.  I am proud to say that since the act came into effect 
in July 1996 about 80% or 9,200 kilometres of track are operated 
by short line railways and only 1,800 kilometres of track have 
been discontinued.  This process has resulted in the creation of 
36 new short line operators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this success, Justice Estey identified some issues 
related to branch lines.  Some of the problems included the 
ability of railways to transfer grain dependent lines in small 
segments, making a viable short line operation very difficult, 
and the fact that when a community does lose a grain dependent 
branch line it is not directly compensated. 
I believe the bill addresses these particular issues.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are extending the notice period before a railway can take 
steps to discontinue a rail line from two months to twelve 
months.  This would give more time for potential short line 
purchasers to come along.  It would also allow a community based 
group which is ready to proceed with an offer to trigger an early 
curtailment of the twelve month notice period and extend the 
negotiation period from four months to six months.  Also, either 
party may request the Canadian Transportation Agency during this 
stage to provide its estimate of the net salvage value of the 
line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-34 requires that both parties negotiate in good faith. 
The Canadian Transportation Agency may order the railway to enter 
into a commercially fair and reasonable agreement, or it may 
allow a railway to end negotiations and continue to abandon the 
line if parties are not negotiating in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all grain lines will be retained or transferred.  Therefore, 
the bill requires a railway that abandons a line to make three 
annual payments of up to $10,000 per mile to each of the 
municipal governments located along the line, related to the 
length of the line that falls within each municipality.  This 
will ensure that the municipalities which are feeling the impact 
of the changes will see the benefits from these railway payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the monitoring provisions, I believe that these 
measures will ensure that we obtain information that is critical 
to a full and fair assessment of the results from the changes to 
the grain transportation and handling system.  The bill ensures 
that the information can be forwarded to a third party monitor. 
The confidentiality of the information obtained for monitoring 
purposes is ensured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee adopted an amendment that calls on the 
minister to table an annual report on the monitoring of the 
system to parliament no later than January 31, which is six 
months after the end of each crop year.  The Minister responsible 
for the Canadian Wheat Board, the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and I support this amendment.  We are very confident 
that there will be much progress to report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the decision we announced on May 10, the issue of more 
open access to rail lines will be referred to the upcoming review 
of the Canada Transportation Act for priority consideration on 
effective ways to enhance competition in the railway sector, 
including enhanced running rights, regional railways and other 
access concepts.  This review will be launched within the next 
few days and will be ready by July 1.  In the mandate letter for 
the review I will request that an interim report be provided on 
the open access issue no later than six months after the start of 
the review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three of the government's measures on grain are realized through 
non-statutory means.  First, a memorandum of understanding will 
be put in place to guide changes to the wheat board's 
transportation role.  Second, a mechanism will be put in place to 
ensure the continuous monitoring, measurement and reporting of 
the changes by a professional private sector third party.  Third, 
the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food will provide for a five 
year, $175 million grain roads program at the rate of $35 million 
per year from 2001 to 2005-06.  This grain road program is to be 
modelled on the Canada agri-infrastructure program, as 
implemented in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole, the statutory and non-statutory measures are 
designed to turn a new page in Canada's grain transportation and 
handling system.  I think they create a significant opportunity 
for the parties to commence a different set of relationships and 
to work together to build a more commercial, more accountable and 
more effective system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I sit down I would like to thank all members on both 
sides of the House who have worked really hard on this measure. I 
know that it came late, but as I said at second reading, this was 
a very tough measure to adjudicate and to do things properly. The 
fact that there is no significant technical opposition to the 
bill underscores the fact that we have gotten it right, that the 
producers will benefit and that productivity gains will be 
shared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that while producers may be happy, the railways and 
the grain companies may not be as happy.  We are trying to work 
out modalities in the MOU with the wheat board to address some of 
their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have done justice to the railways by moving the open 
access provisions and the regional railway provisions to the CTA 
review to allow for a broader debate which will allow all 
shippers, not just shippers of grain, to have an influence on the 
decisions and an impact on policy changes which are coming 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the coming year will be an interesting one because the 
review will deal with some of the unfinished business.  I am firm 
in my view that we have started on the road to true 
commercialization and reform of the system.  I applaud members of 
both sides of the House who have agreed that this objective will 
be met.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is with some sadness that I 
stand at this time.  I want to join with the minister, however, 
in congratulating the men and women who served on the transport 
committee.  I think it was a very good committee.  The hearings 
were good, we heard good witnesses and we had good discussion and 
good debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would ask for the unanimous consent of the House 
to share my time with the hon. member for Lethbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent for the 
hon. member to share his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  As I was saying, 
this was a good committee, but I want to point out and make it 
very clear that the passage of this bill, and why we are 
supporting this bill, is not so much the content but the 
emergency that goes with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Justice Estey said in committee, there is no choice.  He said 
it is like having a gun at your head.  When I asked the hon. 
justice what he thought about what the government had done to his 
recommendations, he said that it had every right to do so, but 
only 1 per cent.  The government did exactly the opposite of what 
the hon. justice wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to make it abundantly clear that our support for 
this is for the short term gain, but there is going to be long 
term pain.  Make no mistake about it.  This bill will be back 
before the House within a year.  The way the bill stands now, it 
does not address agriculture in the year 2000 on the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even members in the caucus opposite knew what was wrong.  They 
wanted a complete and open commercial system, but somehow through 
the back door they said “No, no, no”.  It is all right for the 
potash companies to have an open agreement with the railways.  It 
is all right for the coal companies to have an open agreement 
with the railways.  But over 50% of all the money realized from 
the sale of farm commodities on the prairies today does not come 
from board grains handled by the wheat board.  No consideration 
was given to that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was even an attempt to blame us for bringing in 
amendments, such as that brought by the member for 
Brandon—Souris, to bring the meaning of shipper into the year 
2000.  They said “No, we are trying to get at the wheat board”. 
The wheat board does not handle the goods whatsoever for which 
we wanted that meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of the poem about Casey at the bat.  There was 
no joy in Mudville because mighty Casey struck out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was home on the weekend.  There are some very disappointed 
producers who really thought the Estey and Kroeger report was 
going to go through.  There is no joy in the producers, those 
same producers who appeared before the committee, the canola 
people who lost millions of dollars because for some reason there 
were four or five long trains backed up in Vancouver and their 
goods could not get to port.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked in committee whose fault that was, there was no 
question it was the wheat board's fault.  That is what they said; 
I did not say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the opinion of the majority of the people who came 
before the committee?  The vast majority of people who came 
before our committee, the five major grain companies, basically 
said we should scrap the whole bill.  That is why I say that this 
bill will be back before this house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The individual producers, and there are going to be more of 
them, are worried because now the wheat board is taking on more 
of a role even to control the transportation industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The railways said if what is wanted is to save the farmers a lot 
of money in freight, as well as the grain companies, the five 
major grain companies which handle over 90% of all the grain, 
then let us go to an open accountable freight system.  Somehow 
the wisdom opposite was to say no, they do not trust the people 
who handle more than 90% of the grain.  They do not trust the 
pulse growers. They do not trust the canola growers.  They do not 
trust anyone but themselves.  And they do not trust the railways. 
Which stakeholders are left? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government promised money for roads.  I want to put it on 
the record that the money that has been allocated for prairie 
roads is going to be a pittance to what the government should 
have done with this bill and gone to an open commercialized 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day will come when those same people will not grow products 
that go to the wheat board because they do not trust it.  That 
was the reason for Estey in the first place.  I am not trying to 
condemn the wheat board.  I am not trying to come through the 
back door or anything.  All I am saying is I respect the grain 
producers, the barley producers, the pulse growers and the canola 
growers.  I respect all of those farm organizations, the majority 
of which said to scrap the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes good sense to get those points across.  The majority of 
the witnesses and the majority of the stakeholders disagreed big 
time with this bill.  We do have a gun at our heads. Therefore, 
we have decided that for temporary gain and the long term pain 
that could well be experienced by the producers, we will support 
the bill.  But let the record clearly show that the Canadian 
Alliance pointed out the need to bring grain transportation into 
the year 2000 and not take it back to 1945. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going backward; we are not moving ahead, as the minister 
said.  The move that was put into this bill is a concession by 
those people who want full commercialization.  Those people said 
they will concede that and give a little bit of money and have 
25% going into a tendering process and then it is not between the 
grain companies and the railways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been living with this issue since 1996, a good year 
before I came to the House.  No one in the House has been around 
and watched the failures of the grain handling system more than I 
have.  I am not bragging, it is just a fact.  It is just my age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had an opportunity to do something.  We had an opportunity to 
move into the new century, but no, we had to play a little 
politics here.  That is exactly what we did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am still around and I suspect that I will be, we will be 
back debating this bill within a year's time because it is doomed 
to fail.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will take the blame the next time the canola or pulse 
shippers' cars cannot get to Vancouver because of unnecessary 
grain cars with no boats in the harbour?  Who will take the blame 
for that?  Nobody took the blame last time. It is always the 
railways' fault.  The railways were told to take the grain there, 
but there can never be anybody but the railways to take all of 
the blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not here to support the railways.  I am simply saying that 
for centuries now, when anything goes wrong it is blamed on the 
railways. As I said in a speech over a year ago, in our part of 
the country when the kids are in grade 6, part of the curriculum 
is how to hate the railways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we became honest with ourselves and with all of the 
stakeholders.  This bill has not been honest with all of the 
stakeholders.  This bill scrapped what the government spent 
thousands and thousands of dollars on simply because it was a 
good idea.  We were ready for the 20th century, but somebody was 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be back; I will be back.  And let me say that the next 
time we are back on this issue, we will do it right.  That will 
be the last time.  We did not do it right the first time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would certainly like to commend my colleague, the 
member for Souris—Moose Mountain, for all the work he has done 
on this issue, his understanding of it and the hours and hours of 
endless committees where he carried the ball for the Canadian 
Alliance.  I thank him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons we are looking at the grain transportation 
act and grain movement is that our primary producers in the grain 
and oilseeds sector are suffering.  We need to look at ways to 
give them a little more cash in their pockets because it is a 
desperate situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been groups that have said that as much as $300 
million could be left on the prairies if the grain transportation 
system was commercialized.  That is $300 million. The estimate of 
the government as a result of this bill is $178 million.  We will 
not stand in the way of any dollars flowing to the primary 
producers because they do need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter which was sent to me today by an organization 
which represents 90,000 farmers in western Canada, the Prairie 
Farm Commodity Coalition.  The group represents the Alberta 
Barley Commission, the Alberta Canola Producers Commission, 
Alberta Marketing Choices Implementation Group, the Alberta Rye 
and Triticale Association, the Alberta Winter Wheat Producers 
Commission, the Prairie Oat Growers Association, the Saskatchewan 
Canola Growers Association, the Western Barley Growers 
Association, the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association and 
the Western Producer Car Group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group represents 90,000 primary producers.  Instead of 
giving some words here that could be construed to be just those 
of the Canadian Alliance, I would like to read the letter from 
the chairman of the group, Greg Rockafellow: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 8, 2000, the Prairie Farm Commodity Coalition was invited 
to make a submission to the House of Commons transport committee 
on Bill C-34 which is part of the government's so-called 
“reform” package on grain transportation. The position taken in 
the PFCC submission was that the grain transportation reform 
package put forward by the federal government is a sham, and will 
do precisely nothing to resolve the problems that have been 
studied for almost three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences of the federal government's inaction on these 
problems will have profoundly negative effects on farmers, the 
grain industry and the federal government. The consequences for 
the federal government will come to bear during the next tie-up 
in grain movement, when vessels are once more lined up in 
Vancouver harbour, sales are lost, and Canada's reputation as a 
reliable supplier is further tarnished. The responsibility for 
this event, when (not if) it occurs, will rest fully on the 
federal government's shoulders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our position that this package of so-called reform is in 
fact worse than the current situation.  It moves the grain 
industry and the farmers back towards the old Crow rate regime 
which gave us nothing but inefficiency, system breakdowns and 
restricted investments. If the federal government was motivated 
in the smallest degree by principle, this package would be 
withdrawn.  If members of parliament on both sides of the House 
wanted to do what is best for western farmers, they would vote 
against Bill C-34. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More serious than the loss of three years of study and 
discussion is the shabby political games that have been played in 
Ottawa by the government over the package.  Putting forward this 
backward looking and empty set of proposals, and then accusing 
anyone who opposes it of “denying farmers $178 million in 
freight savings” is itself symptomatic of a government which is 
bereft of ideas and principle. This trap, however, is only one 
way among several in which the federal government has abused 
parliamentary democracy campaign over the last few weeks: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Railroading the package through with no opportunity for debate; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having the farmers' presentations to the transport committee 
occur after the deadline for any amendments to be submitted to 
the committee for clause by clause consideration; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bringing in the party whip to sit at the committee table, 
driving Liberal members who dared to criticize the package off 
the committee at the last minute, and replacing them with other 
MPs who had not heard the presentations of any of the witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find it repugnant in the extreme that the federal government 
has put political gains ahead of the interests of farmers, has 
abused the democratic and parliamentary system, and has insulted 
the farm groups who travelled to Ottawa on their own time and at 
their own expense to provide their views on this disgraceful 
package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmer representatives from the PFCC organizations spent all of 
last summer working in good faith on the Kroeger facilitation 
process.  Each devoted considerable time and personal expense on 
the premises clearly stated on May 12, 1999, that the federal 
government had accepted Justice Estey's recommendations and Mr. 
Kroeger was to develop an implementation plan.  Clearly, the only 
party that was not operating in good faith was the government, 
which had no intention of implementing the Estey report. The 
federal government's actions on this file over the past year have 
completely undermined any trust that we will have in the future 
in any consultation process.

put in the government has been totally destroyed.

comes back the next time, it will be done right. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois to Bill C-34, which is intended to govern the 
transportation of grain, particularly in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right off, for the benefit of those watching, I will point out 
that our party, the Bloc Quebecois, will vote against this bill 
at third reading.  We will do so for on simple reason, a matter 
of equity, or perhaps I should say a matter of inequity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want the members from out west to assume that this 
is another chapter in the unending dispute between eastern and 
western Canada.  On the contrary.  It is our view that the 
government has once again decided, using this bill, to pit the 
east against the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill is passed, western producers will enjoy a 
considerable reduction in the cost of transportation, on the 
order of $178 million.  This reduction will be achieved in the 
form of discounts that the two railway companies—Canadian 
National and Canadian Pacific—will be required to give western 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my party, I say that this is unfair to eastern 
producers.  When I say eastern producers, I am talking about 
producers from Quebec, but also those from Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal majority across the way often tells the members of 
the Bloc Quebecois, the Canadian Alliance or the Progressive 
Conservative Party that they are regional parties.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind our Liberal friends opposite that we might ask 
ourselves whether the same is not true of them.  We know that 
there are 155 Liberal members— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> There are 157. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> —the member from British Columbia tells me 
there are 157—and that 101 of these 157 members come from 
Ontario.  We might therefore wonder whether the Liberal Party of 
Canada is not a regional party too—the regional party of 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to Ontario's farmers.  Do they feel that they are well 
represented by the federal Liberal members from Ontario, the ones 
who are supporting this subsidy for western producers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, my colleagues of the Canadian Alliance were certainly 
delighted to learn that this bill was rushed through a few days 
before the summer adjournment.  This is a totally vote-seeking 
bill, one introduced literally to buy the votes of western 
farmers.  They are being given some nice little goodies in order 
to win them over and to get their votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance will have to deal with this matter when 
the election comes around, which appears to be imminent for this 
fall. However, it seems obvious that this is a program aimed at 
buying the western farm vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes to return to the $178 million 
cut the two rail carriers, Canadian National and Canadian 
Pacific, will be forced to make. I had the opportunity in the 
Standing Committee on Transport to question directly Mr. Tellier, 
the president of CN, and Mr. Ritchie, the president of CP, and 
their responses leave me concerned and confused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I asked them was this: we know that the rail carriers have, 
for the past 10 years, made the railway workers bear the brunt of 
their lack of productivity.  As a result, when the financial 
reports were not to their liking, they announced major staff cuts 
when releasing their annual financial statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to say that my Bloc Quebecois colleagues share those 
concerns. 
We are concerned that the companies, Canadian National and 
Canadian Pacific, not to name them, will be very tempted to have 
railway workers bear the brunt—because their job will be cut—of 
the $178 million drop in revenues the railroads will have to 
absorb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should remember today, June 14, 2000, because I am warning 
you that I will point out once again—I will no doubt have 
another opportunity to talk on this issue—that I predicted on 
June 14, today, that the railways will not absorb this $178 
million within their operating costs.  They will not pass it on 
to their shareholders through considerable dividends.  They will 
not deprive their shareholders. They will deprive railway workers 
of their jobs because of the number of cuts resulting directly 
from Bill C-34. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason we oppose this bill is that it changes the role 
of the Canadian Wheat Board without our knowing how these changes 
will affect its ability as a marketing agency to honour its 
commitments to grain producers and its clientele worldwide.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board is strange beast.  It is an independent 
agency.  A number of the members of its board are appointed by 
the government, as political payback.  The Canadian Wheat Board 
tries to make us believe that it will, with this legislation, 
attempt to find the most cost effective shipping point and port 
for producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give an example.  My colleague from Thunder Bay 
and I were members of a sub-committee on the future of the St. 
Lawrence Seaway.  One of the Bloc Quebecois' demands has always 
been to have Manitoba wheat pass through Thunder Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is a member of the Bloc Quebecois defending the Port of 
Thunder Bay?  The answer is obvious.  Because every tonne of 
wheat that goes through Thunder Bay has to go through the ports 
on the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway.  This means that 
wheat that goes through Thunder Bay stands a good chance of being 
redirected into other bigger ships, in the ports of Montreal, 
Sorel, Trois-Rivières, Quebec City, Baie-Comeau or Sept-Îles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Bloc Quebecois called on this government—and 
the government has not agreed to do this in Bill C-34, which we 
are debating today—to give preference to Thunder Bay and the St. 
Lawrence Seaway as an efficient way to move wheat to European 
markets in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the hearings on privatizing the St. Lawrence Seaway, 
which I attended in 1995 with the member from Thunder Bay, the 
then commissioner of the Canadian Wheat Board admitted to us that 
wheat headed for Belgium and Luxembourg went through the Port of 
Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it more cost effective to ship a tonne of wheat out of the 
Port of Vancouver, when it has to travel down the west coast of 
the United States, go through the Panama Canal and travel back up 
north on its way to its final destination in Luxembourg or 
Belgium, essentially shipping wheat to western Europe through 
Vancouver rather than through Thunder Bay, when the ports of 
Montreal, Quebec City or Sept-Îles are a few hundred kilometres 
from western European ports? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such thinking is the reason for a bill like this. That is why we 
in the Bloc Quebecois cannot support Bill C-34, because, for one 
thing, it does not help ports on the St. Lawrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another feature of this bill with which the Bloc Quebecois has 
major difficulties is the fact that it contains provisions for 
$175 million worth of highway infrastructures for rural roads in 
the western provinces—yet another sop to western producers.  I 
am sorry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we have a double standard.  Once again, Quebec is 
treated differently.  The government will hand over $175 million 
to improve rural highway infrastructures in the west. 
Does this mean that the roads used to transport grain, the 
highway infrastructures for rural roads, are adequate? To ask 
the question is to answer it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois cannot accept bills such as Bill C-34, which 
create inequities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, since I am running out of time, I will have to 
rush. The Minister of Transport himself recognizes that the 
reforms affecting the grain transportation and handling system 
will increase pressure on rural roads. I spoke about this issue 
already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will oppose Bill C-34 for the three reasons we have 
mentioned, the first one being the $178 million income reduction 
for railroad companies, both CN and CP, which will necessarily 
result in railway workers being laid off; the second is that 
nothing in this bill guarantees that there will be an increase 
in grain traffic, via the port of Thunder Bay, on the St. 
Lawrence ports network; and the third reason why we oppose this 
legislation is the $175 million budget allocated to upgrade rural 
roads, while no money is provided for eastern Canada. Quebec 
gets nothing, and nor does Ontario for that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the chief government whip, who comes from the Cornwall 
area. There must be agricultural producers in that region and 
there must be rural roads around Cornwall. I am convinced that 
Ontarians could team up with Quebec on this issue because the 
situation is the same for both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will vote against Bill 
C-34 at third reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour to take part in this important debate today on Bill C-34. 
My only wish is that we had more time to debate and discuss this. 
I think we all felt that it was terribly telescoped, which is not 
to take anything away from the witnesses who presented to us last 
week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in all honesty and clarity, I must say that for the 
government to have brought in background notes, a major press 
release on May 10 and then require a full three weeks before the 
House, the parliamentarians and the transport committee ever got 
to see the legislation was, it seemed to me, a strange way to run 
a railroad, if I could use that metaphor in this context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the thrust of my remarks, I want to comment 
briefly on the remarks made by the transport critic for the Bloc 
Quebecois and also the remarks made by the transport critic for 
the Canadian Alliance Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just say, first to the Bloc member, that he seems to be 
saying, if I understood him correctly, that this is legislation 
or a bill for western Canada and nothing for the people in 
Quebec. I would say to him, with respect, that the Crow's Nest 
Pass freight rate agreement predated the entry of Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan into confederation.  We in those provinces are a 
long way from tidewater, whereas in Quebec, I would submit that 
most of the agriculture that is carried out in that province is 
very close to the St. Lawrence Seaway system and, indeed, to 
tidewater.  One of the problems we have always had in western 
Canada is getting our product to market, which is why we have 
needed help for more than a century in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the member for Souris—Moose Mountain, the 
transport critic for the Canadian Alliance, I congratulate him on 
getting the only amendment that anybody got through that 
committee last week, in the rush, rush, rush that we were in, 
that I do not understand.  He spent most of his speech 
denigrating this bill.  The words that he used to emphasize it 
were short term gain for long term pain.  However, at the end of 
the day the Alliance appears to be going to vote for this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party caucus will not being doing that. 
We took the position at second reading that we oppose the bill. 
We wanted to see some amendments.  As I mentioned we received 
none.  Specifically the only amendment that was acceded to was 
the one by the member for Souris—Moose Mountain and his party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just do not feel that the bill is deserving of support, 
notwithstanding what the Minister of Transport said about the 
taunting about $178 million and how it would look if we stand 
opposed to it on behalf of the producers who will be supposedly 
in receipt of the $178 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our concerns is that the memorandum of understanding 
between the government and the Canadian Wheat Board was not part 
of this process.  The joint running rights open access question 
to be negotiated involves the CTA doing a review of it.  It will 
be another shoe that will drop later on, some months from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in committee seemed to get very exercised about the 
fact that MOU was not a public document.  Everyone seemed to be 
upset and wanted to point a finger at the Canadian Wheat Board 
for the delay.  I suggest that procrastination on the part of the 
government in bringing forward the legislation should not result 
in a crisis in terms of due diligence on the part of the Canadian 
Wheat Board on this very important memorandum of understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to some of the amendments we moved that were all 
rejected by members opposite, we note that there is no 
productivity gains sharing.  It has been identified by usually 
reliable sources that some $700 million have accrued to the 
railways since 1992 as a result of more fuel efficient 
locomotives, larger hopper cars, and particularly a significant 
downsizing in the workforce of the railways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the dismantling of the Western Grain Transportation Act 
those productivity gains, those windfall profits, were shared 
between producers and the railways.  They have not been shared 
since 1992, and there is nothing in the legislation which 
suggests that they will be shared in the future.  That is one of 
our major concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also no rate differential disciplines are mentioned at all.  It 
is single cars on branch lines versus single cars on main lines 
and the 3% differential.  We have some real concerns about that. 
We believe it will come back to haunt people on main lines.  It 
does not deal with single cars versus multi-cars on main lines. 
There are darn few single cars these days loaded on main lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also concerned about who will get the price premium. 
Depending on the calendar and what commodity is being shipped, 
there is nothing to ensure that we will be able to deal with that 
in an adequate way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need clear rules for short line revenue sharing.  I thought 
we needed something on salvage.  The Canadian government and 
Canadian taxpayers have spent many millions of dollars on 
upgrading railways.  When a branch line is being sold off we 
think it should be net of any federal taxpayer money that has 
gone into it.  It was an amendment moved by our caucus but not 
agreed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much to say on the bill, but I will keep my remarks as 
brief as I possibly can.  Another member wants to participate in 
this debate and I do not want to shorten his time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate a very interesting remark was made.  Someone 
who appeared before the committee quoted William Lyon Mackenzie 
King and said that the problem with most countries was that they 
had too much history and too little geography.  King apparently 
said that in Canada we had too much geography and too little 
history.  Frank Scott, a great Canadian poet, also said that 
Mackenzie King never did by halves what he could do by quarters.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how I feel about Bill C-34.  All members in the House 
are being asked to accept the bill on blind faith.  The transport 
minister said they got it right.  I am not sure that they got it 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if the five, six or seven major grain companies that are 
around these days go through a streamlining process and are 
reduced to two or three in the future?  What if the two railroads 
are merged into one, perhaps dominated by the United States?  How 
will competition work, which is the be-all and end-all according 
to the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned.  The minister responsible for the wheat 
board said that it was time to stop the bickering, that it was 
time most people agreed.  Most of the expert witnesses that came 
before the committee had many concerns about the bill.  I think 
the concerns are growing rather than diminishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also disturbed when the Minister of Transport said that 
they had it right but recognized that the railways and the grain 
companies were not very happy with it.  Mark my words.  We will 
be back here in a few months and there will be additional sops to 
those two institutions because they have perhaps not been treated 
as fairly as the government would want.  It will be making the 
necessary adjustments to correct that in the near future.  Those 
are my remarks.  Our caucus will be opposing Bill C-34 at third 
reading. 
<P><A NAME="LINK309"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
extend my thanks to the member for Palliser who has allowed me to 
speak as the last speaker to this bill.  We can get on with life 
after my few comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the onset of my seven minutes or so I thank the transport 
committee.  I do not normally sit on that committee.  Nor does 
the member for Palliser.  Nor does the member from the Canadian 
Alliance.  Normally we sit on the agriculture committee, but we 
sat on the transport committee specifically because we had a bit 
more knowledge with respect to western grain transportation than 
perhaps my own colleague who was sitting on the transport 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the chairman of the transport committee who is in the 
House today.  I thought he did a very commendable job.  He was 
fair.  He was honest.  He was open in the process.  I also thank 
members of the government who sat on that committee.  They were 
very attentive.  They listened to the petitioners and the 
witnesses that came forward with very logical presentations and 
points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that point on it sort of went downhill, but let us talk 
about the process itself.  I must spend a couple of seconds 
dealing with that.  The process is certainly a prime example of 
the manipulative process the government has put into place with 
respect to this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was mentioned earlier, this was not something that snuck up 
on us.  This was not an issue that jumped out of the hall closet. 
We had to fix this problem.  Rail transportation in western 
Canada has been an issue for years and decades.  As a matter of 
fact, for three years now the particular issue has been studied 
by what I consider to be two of the best known experts in the 
industry, a gentleman by the name of Justice Willard Estey and 
another gentleman by the name of Arthur Kroeger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These individuals put forward a process that was very gruelling 
and grinding.  They came forward with what they thought were the 
necessary changes to the system.  A systemic change was 
necessary.  Mr. Kroeger came forward in September 1999 with his 
report based on the Estey report.  Mr. Kroeger said that in order 
to make it work we would have to change the system.  It had to 
become a commercialized system.  On May 10 the three ministers 
came together at a press conference and told us what they would 
put together with this piece of legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened between September 1999 and May 10, 2000, is kind 
of a black hole.  I suspect the Canadian Wheat Board had a lot of 
ongoing negotiations with the minister responsible for the 
Canadian Wheat Board to try to fix the problem to the best of its 
advantage, not to the advantage of producers, not to the 
advantage of what Mr. Kroeger and Mr. Estey saw was a commercial 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between May 10 and when we received this piece of legislation is 
again kind of a black hole, a bit of a vacuum.  All of a sudden 
there is an urgency and a necessary 11th hour demand that the 
legislation had to be passed before the House rose for its summer 
recess.  We had to have it in place by August 1, the crop year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not disagree that we need to have the legislation in place 
so that it can take effect for the next crop year.  What I 
disagree with is the process the government followed to get it 
there.  There was an 11th hour requirement.  All stakeholders 
were asked to come together for two grinding and demanding days 
of committee hearings so they could tell us what was right and 
what was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Transport is either delusional or is totally 
under a misconception.  He stood before us and said that they 
must have got it right, that everybody liked the legislation.  I 
sat through those two grinding days of hearings.  Not one person, 
not even the Canadian Wheat Board, said that what was being 
proposed was the right legislation for the system.  Out of the 30 
witnesses that appeared nobody came forward and said 
“Hallelujah, you got right”.  In fact I heard quite the 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organizations like the Hudson Bay Route Association said to 
scrap it, that it was not good.  I heard other producer 
organizations come forward and say that what had been done would 
exacerbate the problem of rail transportation in western Canada. 
A rail coalition came forward and said nothing in the legislation 
indicated who would be accountable for transportation.  We would 
still have the finger pointing of the past and the system would 
still break down.  Not one organization or producer group said 
that it was the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about what is not right.  What is not right is the 
fact that this is not a commercial system.  The legislation 
allows 25% of the business now performed by the Canadian Wheat 
Board to be tendered.  That is wonderful.  It also says, and I 
have also heard it, that the Canadian Wheat Board will control 
not only the tendered portion but the untendered portion.  It 
will rebalance that tendered and untendered portion to the two 
railways.  That is not a commercial system.  It is a manipulated 
system between the Canadian Wheat Board and the railroads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a monitoring process that is very positive.  The 
monitor is a third party that will be chosen by the government. 
The monitor will report to three ministers.  It will not report 
to parliament, except for once a year which was a minor amendment 
that was put through.  Unfortunately it will not be open and 
transparent like the government said it would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened when we got to the amendments at committee level 
turned my faith off with respect to the particular process.  We 
listened to some very good people make some very good 
presentations.  The government then decided to take some members 
from the committee who I believe were very understanding, 
knowledgeable and supportive of some of the changes.  It replaced 
them with individuals who had never listened to the presentations 
and never understood what was going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Believe it or not, we had the wonderful opportunity of having 
the whip of the government party sitting in during the voting on 
those amendments.  I have a lot of respect for the whip, but why 
was it necessary for him to come in at the 12th hour to make sure 
government members would toe the party line?  Was it necessary?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support this legislation not because the government got 
it right but because there is a carrot being dangled to my 
producers who desperately need some financial recompense.  One 
hundred and seventy-eight million dollars may—and I stress 
may—go back to them from the revenue cap on the railroads.  That 
is not a given in itself.  We do need that $178 million to go 
back to producers, plus much more.  If we had a truly commercial 
system, I believe that $178 million could have been $350 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Earlier this motion was moved by one hon. 
member in the name of another hon. member.  I think the author of 
the motion should have a chance to pronounce himself in the

<P><A NAME="LINK316"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to participate today in the third and final hour of 
debate on Motion No. 298.  To clarify the meaning of the motion, 
I will read it.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should provide 
initiatives to deliver natural gas to unserviced regions and 
address environmental concerns and high energy costs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, it is our duty and our responsibility to 
act in the best interests of our specific constituencies and for 
the betterment of Canada.  It is our elected duty to represent 
the best interests of all Canadians.  It is our actions in this 
House and in the everyday legislative process that will affect 
this and future generations.  What we debate and decide impacts 
on the country as a whole, whether it is a bill, an act or, as in 
this case with Motion No. 298, a motion to provide guidance to 
this House in its vision and understanding of Canada's best 
interests.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of this motion is not to interfere with free market 
enterprises.  The motion's purpose is not, and I repeat not, for 
the federal government to build pipelines to every corner of this 
vast and great country.  The purpose of this motion is to provide 
recognition of the economic disparity that some regions face 
without access to clean and efficient energy sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While citizens in most cities can enjoy the benefits of natural 
gas energy, there are entire regions of this country that do not. 
There are entire unserviced regions that are being limited in 
their opportunities for sustainable development.  There are 
regions in this country that are not only enjoying access to 
clean fuels but are reaping billions of dollars of revenues, 
royalties and profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when the Prime Minister states to the country that one 
of our core values is the principle of sharing our wealth and 
opportunities, neglect and short-sightedness are hampering our 
efforts as parliamentarians to utilize this 36th session of 
parliament to improve the lives of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not here to ensure the multinational corporations have 
the first and exclusive access to the very raw resources that are 
shared and owned by all Canadians.  We are not here as 
parliamentarians to ensure that disparity between regions 
continues. We are not here as parliamentarians to ensure that our 
natural resources are plundered by outside nations and our 
citizens forced to repurchase our birthrights at inflated rates 
of foreign currency exchange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are sick and tired of watching our natural resources 
flow south with little in return for ourselves except for federal 
royalties.  Canadians are sick and tired of listening to 
governments state that there is nothing unfair or obscene with 
fluctuating energy prices and overflowing corporate coffers. 
Canadians are sick of dirty air and polluted water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion that we are debating today is about a vision of where 
we want our country to be in a year, in a decade, several 
decades, as every tonne of carbon saved and cleaner energy helps 
in our successful Kyoto protocol challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current federal policy in relation to natural gas is to 
assist big pipelines with incentives and write-offs to ship our 
natural gas, Canada's natural gas south for foreign markets. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Order, please. I am sorry 
to have to interrupt the hon. member, but even sitting close to 
the hon. member who has the floor I can barely hear him.  I would 
therefore request a bit more quiet and co-operation from hon. 
members. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is part of the 
free market economy.  The NDP are not anti-business or 
anti-trade.  As long as it is fair business on a level playing 
field that will benefit Canadians, the NDP will support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of jobs are tied to the natural gas resource sector. 
This is good.  We believe that thousands of more jobs could be 
created by increasing access to unserviced areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of this motion is to contribute to value-added 
enterprises in the forestry sector, in the agricultural sector 
and all sectors of industry across this country.  As harvesting 
moves further and further north in mining and forestry, there are 
opportunities for kilns and processing centres scattered across 
the Boreal forest.  It is wasteful energy to expend energy to 
have access to raw matériel only.  Let us make sure that this 
energy is used for value-added products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased jobs come with access to natural gas.  Following the 
principles of sustainability, it ensures long term and constant 
profitability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of this motion is a better future rather than today's 
cap and ship policy, a policy that dates to the past century and 
encouraged by unfettered free trade markets where domestic 
concerns and issues are secondary to invisible shareholders, the 
Bay or Wall Streets speculative markets, or the whole term of 
colonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should avoid speculation, and the facts are too real.  Forced 
to go head to head at outlandish inequities of foreign exchange 
rates, many opportunities for Canadian enterprises are lost even 
before they begin.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion does not state to turn off the taps or put a 
definitive domestic cap on natural gas.  It asks that we as 
parliamentarians recognize the disparities and provide 
initiatives to level the playing field for Canada and its 
citizens. It is our gas.  Why endorse policies to strip our 
children and future generations from their birthright?  Indeed, 
the future is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forced to go head to head with American rates of consumption, 
our natural gas rates for heating Canadian homes in the winter 
are expected to rise by 50% to 100%.  Chicago is being placed 
before Selkirk, Burlington or Wascana.  In the north, including 
in my own riding, the gas flows right under our feet and away to 
southern regions but not into our homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The north is about to enter into unrivalled natural gas 
exploration and development and exports in the several decades to 
come.  What message will parliament send on our vision of the 
future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that the government is now moving forward on 
energy efficiency initiatives partly because of Canada's 
international responsibilities with Kyoto.  The main reason to go 
forward into a cleaner century is not the limitations but the 
basic fact that clean energy and efficiency means profits for our 
country.  Monetary gain and precious savings from cleaner air and 
reduced costs will be a lot less of a burden on our health care 
system.  Cleaner lungs for our children and the next generation 
will reduce the impact on our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this premise of efficiency the current federal policy, lies. 
We recognize that efficiency savings over time create benefits 
for action.  Not all communities can proceed on this premise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example is the often repeated concern in the Churchill River 
constituency where excellent community efforts are bringing 
natural gas across the distances to provide economic opportunity 
in regions that did not have it before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call special attention to the Anglin Lake natural gas 
committee led by its outstanding member, Alice Tatryn.  It has 
achieved success, but national initiatives would have accelerated 
this promise years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call attention to the outstanding efforts of my constituency 
assistant Judy Bridle.  Day in and day out she listens to the 
concerns of constituents who want natural gas.  Residents know 
and trust her judgment.  They know very well that the resources 
are under their feet but not in their homes. A disheartening fact 
and reality is that many Canadians who want natural gas 
extensions are forced to go without access to clean energy 
because of minor percentage points in access to capital and 
related endeavours. This portrait is repeated across Canada in 
unserviced areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians would like to do their part for energy efficiency in 
their homes and workplace. In Labrador and New Brunswick, Nunavut 
or the Yukon these advantages do not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We acknowledge that the Bloc Quebecois and the Progressive 
Conservatives support this motion.  They demonstrate the vision 
necessary to go beyond the shortsighted profiteering as reflected 
in the agreements between Quebec and New Brunswick to encourage 
regional natural gas access for better development opportunities 
for their citizens and future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that other parliamentarians recognized and 
contributed their support in a similar manner by voting for this 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK317"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
happy to speak to the motion.  I spoke to the issue earlier in 
parliament before the member for Churchill River had an 
opportunity to introduce his motion.  It is a well thought out 
and timely motion as events are unfolding in the history of the 
country and how we deal with our future energy needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So everyone understands what we are debating here, Motion No. 
298 put forward by the hon. member for Churchill River reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should provide 
initiatives to deliver natural gas to unserviced regions and 
address environmental concerns and high energy costs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion speaks to more than just that.  Many regions in 
Canada already have natural gas distribution. 
In much of Alberta, which was government assisted, there is 
natural gas distribution, as well as in much of Ontario and 
Saskatchewan.  There is less in Manitoba; there certainly is some 
but most of it is close to the pipeline.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion speaks to a more comprehensive federal plan to assist 
that distribution of natural gas throughout the country. On the 
east coast of Canada at the present time, we are just beginning 
to understand and enjoy the benefits of natural gas usage.  There 
is a pipeline now from Sable Island, on which I had the good 
fortune to work as a driller on the offshore from 1980 to 1988 on 
Sable Island, Newfoundland and the Gulf of Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That natural gas is being delivered into Goldboro going into the 
Maritimes & Northeast pipeline, throughout the riding represented 
by the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, throughout the 
riding represented by the member for Cumberland—Colchester, 
through New Brunswick into Maine and down into the northeastern 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand that certainly those areas close 
to the pipeline will be fed automatically.  There are many other 
areas including northern New Brunswick, the 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac riding, and the South Shore riding which 
I represent, that will not benefit immediately from the natural 
gas in the pipeline, natural gas off our own shores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at what is going on in this country as far as energy 
requirements and the major gas and oil players in Canada.  The 
Alliance pipeline, when it is built, will go from northern B.C. 
and northern Alberta to the Peace River district all the way to 
Chicago.  It will feed the energy needs of the mid-central 
industrialized United States, but will not necessarily benefit 
the energy needs of northern Alberta and northern B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a more holistic look at this.  How do we deliver natural 
gas to the outlying and more remote areas of Canada? That is what 
the motion speaks to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are trillions and trillions of cubic metres of natural gas 
in the Canadian Arctic.  There is drilling for natural gas in the 
Canadian Arctic today. There is drilling for natural gas in the 
Northwest Territories.  We hold tremendous potential to fill 
Canada's energy requirements of Canada and much of the rest of 
North America, but while we are doing that, and it is certainly 
profit motivated, let us take a look at meeting our own energy 
requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take for example the branch line that will come off the 
Maritimes & Northeast pipeline.  Sempra Gas has already won the 
bid to supply gas to Nova Scotia.  I think it has a pretty solid 
plan and will be able to deliver on that plan.  That branch line 
will go into the Musquodoboit area, feed into Halifax, Dartmouth, 
Sackville, the Burnside industrial park area.  That is the main 
area it will be supplying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need another branch line that does not just go down the 
Annapolis Valley and feed that area all the way to Yarmouth, but 
two branch lines, one down the Annapolis Valley and the other one 
down the South Shore. The last time I spoke to this issue, I 
talked about the development of that branch line, the possibility 
of running it down the abandoned railroad lines that are being 
used for recreational purposes as walking, hiking and biking 
trails.  That is a realistic opportunity for Sempra Gas to 
develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the South Shore area there is a very real opportunity that we 
may get gas into Bridgewater.  We may be able to run it down the 
abandoned rail line past East River and feed the hardboard plant 
in East River.  We may get to Michelin Tires.  We may get to 
Bowater Mersey in Liverpool.  From there on we are going to have 
to squeeze government a lot harder in order to get that natural 
gas into the other areas of the province.  There is the little 
community of New Ross which I come from, and communities like New 
Germany, Caledonia, Lockeport, Shelburne, Barrington and Gunning 
Cove.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in this room has heard of clear water lobster.  I am 
sure it is no surprise to anyone.  Only a handful of people in 
this room would understand that 60% to 70% of the lobster 
exported out of southwest Nova Scotia comes from Cape Sable 
Island.  All the lobster is held in holding pens.  A lot of it is 
refrigerated.  Natural gas can be used to produce refrigeration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hundreds of fish plants in South Shore and West Nova 
and the southwestern region of Nova Scotia.  Natural gas could be 
a primary driver of those plants.  It could be a primary driver 
of the refrigeration units that are required to run those 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion speaks not only to a requirement in rural Nova Scotia 
and other rural and remote areas in Canada, but to a requirement 
for cheap energy costs, a requirement to meet our Kyoto 
obligations, and a requirement to meet our acid rain obligations. 
If we feed natural gas into the United States, obviously it will 
have cleaner energy and there would be less acid rain coming up 
north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has looked at endangered species legislation. I am 
astounded when I talk to members of parliament that they do not 
understand the threat to Atlantic salmon stocks.  We had 1.2 
million Atlantic salmon returning to the rivers in eastern 
Canada.  Today, 80,000 Atlantic salmon return to the rivers in 
eastern Canada including Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live near the Gold River, a small river which runs into Mahone 
Bay.  Twenty years ago 1,000 or 2,000 fish would come up that 
river but today we would be lucky if there were 70 or 80 and 
maybe fewer.  Atlantic salmon is an endangered species. We talk 
about legislation but we are doing nothing to protect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The easiest way to bring back our salmon stocks is to get rid of 
acid rain in the northeastern United States.  The easiest way to 
bring salmon stocks back in Europe, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and 
Greenland is to get rid of acid rain coming out of industrialized 
Europe.  One way is to feed the power generators with natural 
gas. It is clean, efficient and fairly cheap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen rising fuel costs straight across North America and 
not just at the gasoline pumps and not just for furnace oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the member for Churchill River for 
introducing the motion.  It was timely and it was put forward in 
good faith.  It is incumbent upon parliament to support this as 
much as we can.  There is a real need and it is not just to 
supply natural gas to remote and rural areas of Canada, but to 
also meet the energy requirements under our Kyoto obligations and 
to meet the needs of our children in the future, to keep Atlantic 
salmon in eastern Canada and other species of fish, plants and 
wildlife in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the motion and I congratulate the member for bringing it 
forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central 
to participate in the debate on Motion No. 298. The motion calls 
for the government to provide initiatives to deliver natural gas 
to unserviced regions in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As always in private members' business, it is appropriate to 
commend the hon. member for raising a matter in the House that 
otherwise would not be raised. The matter the hon. member for 
Churchill River has raised shows clearly that his heart is in the 
right place.  The availability of environmentally friendly clean 
fuel for the remote areas of Canada is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member from one of the largest metropolitan centres in 
Canada, one of the fastest growing in population, our hearts go 
out to the small towns and villages and very remote areas in our 
country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many of us who can only imagine what it is like to not 
enjoy the conveniences and easy access to things that we frankly 
take for granted in our busy cities.  These things include many 
types of infrastructure, such as roads, water, sewers, 
electricity, telephone and other things that become very precious 
when we talk about Canada's communities bordering on our 
hinterland.  The member can be assured that the people of Surrey 
Central respect and acknowledge what this motion is trying to 
address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We take for granted the natural gas that heats our homes and 
cooks our meals.  It is not our fault.  In our daily lives, with 
all of the hustle and bustle, we consider certain things as 
given, but Canada's northern climate creates unique heating 
needs, not only in homes but also in schools and workplaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians we would like to help provide areas 
unserviced by natural gas with initiatives to reduce heavy oil 
and diesel dependency.  Where natural gas is available, a variety 
of energy efficiency opportunities are possible.  Coal generation 
and mixed fuel power production are two examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Energy efficiency in Canada will be a contributing factor in our 
ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Natural gas is the 
cleanest burning and most acceptable carbon energy source. 
Canadian natural gas is distributed to more than four million 
customers in six provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Natural gas provides 26% of Canada's energy needs, and this 
percentage is increasing each year.  In addition, Canada's 
natural gas exports are experiencing exponential growth.  Canada 
has plenty of natural gas.  It is an economical source of energy 
and it is clean, but it is under provincial jurisdiction.  The 
provision of natural gas is a matter for the provinces to deal 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be sure that justification exists for bringing in 
natural gas over a significant geographical hurdle.  We need to 
ensure that there is considerable demand for the commodity.  To 
fulfil what the motion is asking may require that a remote 
community have a special need, or at least more of a need than 
normal business activity and activity in the residential sector 
would ordinarily demand.  This may mean that remote communities 
with a potential major consumer, for example a large business, 
would be seen to have a greater demand than another community. 
What is the solution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is room for governments to regulate rates so that 
averaging would make services and commodities more affordable and 
increase total demand by making them more attractive for more 
consumers.  The provinces and the territories have a very 
important regulatory role to play in these activities.  All of 
these things are already happening where they are needed, where 
demand is sufficient and where they are not a burden on the 
taxpayers.  They are market sensitive and regionally sensitive 
and they properly allocate our energy resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments of Quebec and New Brunswick recognized the need 
for regional natural gas distribution.  They signed an agreement 
in February for improved services and allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is opportunity in northern and other remote areas for 
natural gas exploration incentives that would place the source 
close to unserviced communities.  This would create a whole new 
affordability index in terms of servicing remote communities.  In 
these situations there is opportunity for provincial and 
territorial governments to put incentives in place to try to 
expand the servicing area of natural gas distribution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is an entirely different matter from what this 
private member's motion contemplates.  This motion contemplates 
federal spending when the jurisdiction is almost exclusively 
provincial or territorial.  In other words, the motion 
contemplates a massive intrusion of the federal government into 
provincial and territorial affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, Canada is a major global natural gas producer 
and a major exporter to the United States.  Canadian companies 
are at the forefront in developing natural gas alternatives to 
traditional engine fuels.  Many people are aware of this, as much 
attention has been paid to the stock market and publicly traded 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major environmental benefit is that this reduces vehicle 
pollutants.  The economic benefits come from the reduced fuel 
cost, as well as reduced maintenance costs and increased engine 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Natural gas is an excellent fuel source and Canada, as we know, 
is blessed with large reserves.  It is important that we properly 
manage our wealth in this respect.  We must do it right in terms 
of how we develop, distribute, market and creatively manage our 
legacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in the spring, the foreign affairs committee travelled 
to Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkey and Armenia.  There is a great 
deal of oil and gas in these parts of the world and there exists 
a well-knit pipeline in the region.  There is a potential for the 
rest of the world, particularly Canadian companies, to explore 
those possibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada gas prices increase because we rely on Middle East 
countries for our supply, among other factors.  Whenever the 
Middle East decides to jack-up its prices, it affects the prices 
at home.  We now see the average Canadian paying more at the gas 
pumps because the prices are fluctuating significantly.  We do 
not want to be susceptible to the gulf crisis of the early 1990s 
or other kinds of crises that occur in that region of the world 
which cause our energy costs to rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government takes on an initiative to help construct more 
natural gas pipelines to remote areas in Canada, we would hope 
that it would work with the provinces, the territories and the 
private sector.  The private sector could take over the pipelines 
once they were up and running and allow market forces to prevail. 
That would be sustainable development.  That would accomplish the 
intent of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I appreciate the intent of the motion and I 
appreciate the work done by the hon. member from the NDP on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Pursuant to order

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK322"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, about a month ago I raised a question in the House 
of Commons with the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development concerning a $10,000 grant to the Ottawa Tulip 
Festival.  So far I have not had any answers that I like the 
sound of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked how the general progress and welfare of poverty stricken 
people were promoted by making a $10,000 grant to the Ottawa Tulip 
Festival.  The minister replied that every single department, 
including his, had an education component to make Canadians aware 
of what aboriginal culture is all about and that is what his 
department was doing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1840"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT52"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT52"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1840

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I doubt that every department of the government is making 
grants to make Canadian people aware of aboriginal culture.  If 
every department in government is making such grants, then of 
course that is completely out of line with any common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $10,000 grant story did not end there.  Then there was a 
contract given to Poirier Communications for $3,538.60 to set up 
a tent and take it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We looked into the price of setting up tents and taking them 
down and we found that people we knew had two tents set up on the 
same day, a 40 foot by 70 foot and a 20 by 20, for $3,000. That 
is a little better price, but it is sort of in the ballpark. We 
do not know whether this tent was the size of this room or 
whether it was a pup tent, but it cost over $3,000 to have it set 
up and taken down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden the cost jumped to $13,000.  That was in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous year there was no grant that I am aware of, but 
there was a $25,000 contract for reservations for a booth at the 
tulip festival from May 8 to May 18.  That is $2,500 a day.  I do 
not know if that is a reasonable price to make a reservation or 
not, but the reservation for a booth at the tulip festival is a 
maximum of $650.  We are wondering what became of the other 
$24,350.  I wonder if I could get an answer to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, we were wondering, would this not be better 
spent by Heritage Canada, if it has to be spent at all?  Why is 
the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, whose 
mandate it is to see to the general progress and welfare of 
Indians, promoted by the use of this money?  Surely Heritage 
Canada is the agency that should be making these kinds of 
expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some things for the minister to think about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had put another question to the minister concerning the 
situation on Canada's reserves.  According to RCAP, 23% lack 
water, 65% of on reserve housing falls below standards, and the 
health of many, many people on reserve is not good.  I asked the 
minister what the people who have to carry water to their rundown 
houses would think of this grant approval.  His answer was that 
these people are the ones who applied for the grant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main question I would like to have answered is:  Can the 
minister table in the House any documentation that will prove to 
me and to members of the House that it was poor people who live 
in rundown housing who approved the grant? 
<P><A NAME="LINK323"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the hon. member for Prince 
Albert on behalf of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development concerning the department's $10,000 grant to the 1998 
National Tulip Festival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the theme “A Celebration of Canada's Provinces and 
Territories”, the 1998 National Tulip Festival was intended to 
mark and commemorate the wide range of cultural diversity in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's north, especially the Northwest Territories and 
Nunavut, was a significant highlight of this particular 
celebration, particularly in the context of the creation of the 
new territory, which occurred, as members know, on April 1, 1999. 
Members of the House and most Canadians will recall the large and 
vast celebrations which occurred at that time in the northern 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to his responsibility for the department, the 
minister also has responsibilities in relation to Canada's north. 
The grant was allocated by the minister under the northern 
affairs program budget to contribute to and support the 
activities of the 11 day presentation of Nunavut and the 
Northwest Territories, especially Northwest Territories Day on 
May 14 and Nunavut Day on May 16.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The festival provided a significant opportunity to raise the 
awareness of the public and the media of the upcoming creation of 
this territory, as well to heighten the understanding about the 
unique and diverse cultures of northerners, especially aboriginal 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also served to broaden knowledge about the north, the 
potential visitors and tourism, in this sense an investment.  The 
funds allocated to this project were entirely consistent with the 
mandate and authorities of the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development and supported national objectives for the 
territories.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked my question of the Minister of Finance, I quoted an 
expert who had worked along with Lester B. Pearson in his day. 
According to this expert, the federal government's behaviour, 
and that of the Minister of Finance in particular, made it 
extremely difficult to understand the logic used in determining 
transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again today, I was amazed to hear the Minister of Health's 
announcement, made in Ontario with great fanfare, of initiatives 
aimed at rural Canadians.  That means another $80 million that 
will be taken away, over the heads of existing structures, such 
as the Government of Quebec, its department of health, and all 
the health infrastructure in place in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be much more simple to have the Minister of Finance 
tell us why he is refusing to reinstate the transfer payments at 
1994 levels.  This situation is causing major headaches to 
provincial health ministers. For example, in the case of Quebec, 
it involves a shortfall of $1.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government really wants to show it still has a social 
conscience and is concerned about health care, it will release 
the funds needed to reinstate the transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I insist.  Perhaps with all the rumours going around 
at the moment, with the health summit approaching in September, 
we can expect the government to be more open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, however, we go with the current reaction of the Prime 
Minister on parental leave, I have my doubts about the Minister 
of Finance's willingness to reinstate transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will transfer payments be reinstated soon?  There is an urgent 
need for them everywhere, especially in Quebec.  This money does 
not belong to the federal government.  It belongs to taxpayers 
who paid it.  Taxes are higher than usual.  The middle class is 
hit hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government refusing to reinstate transfer payments at 
their 1994 levels?  Could the Minister of Finance, in accordance 
with the party line, take the word of the many experts who have 
criticized his action since he became Minister of Finance, 
especially his calculations?  Already, major budget surpluses 
have been announced.  With the minister there are often 
discrepancies between the forecasts and reality of between 50% 
and 60%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will transfer payments be reinstated?  What new policies 
could the government announce to make things just a little fairer 
for Quebecers?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Total CHST, that is cash and tax points, will reach an all time 
high of close to $31 billion in the year 2000-01, and it will 
continue to grow.  This is up $900 million from the previous peak 
in 1995-96 and up $1.8 billion since the government took office 
in 1993-94. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's strong economy has also significantly increased the 
value of other major transfers to the provinces.  Equalization 
payments to less prosperous provinces are estimated at $9.5 
billion this year.  Total transfers will reach an estimated $40.6 
billion this year and will continue to grow over the next four 
years.  This increase in total transfers means that provincial 
governments can strengthen social programs that are important to 
Canadians, programs such as health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does all this mean for Quebec?  In 2000-01 transfers to 
Quebec will exceed $11.5 billion.  They will account for about 
25% of Quebec's estimated revenues.  They are expected to total 
about $1,566 per person, which is about 18% above the national 
average.  Over the next five years Quebec will receive about 
$58.9 billion in federal transfers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, on March 23 I raised the matter of the new farm safety 
net agreement announced earlier this year.   My riding of 
Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, the true heart of agriculture in 
Ontario with Lambton county alone producing more than the entire 
province of New Brunswick, the safety net agreement came as 
welcome news to those confronting historically low commodity 
prices and mother nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After meeting with the local federations of agriculture in 
Lambton, Kent and Middlesex, and hearing from many farmers, 
whether it was in a grocery store on a Saturday morning or calls 
to my three constituency offices, they were unanimous on one 
point.  Farmers in my riding, indeed across the country, were 
looking for a solid, national, effective and equitable long term 
safety net program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it was the corn, wheat or soybean growers, or the 
cattle, hog or lamb producers, they told me that fairness must be 
the end result.  No one province or no one region of the country 
should be treated differently than any other with regard to the 
farm programs.  I heard that loud and clear from my constituents 
in the farm belt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore pleased that our agriculture minister, with his 
provincial counterparts, established the new three year agreement 
that will be proportionately based on the size of the industry in 
each province.  That is eminently fair and supportable by all 
concerned.  Farmers need useful, long term safety nets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $3.3 billion agreement reached in March is a fine example of 
federal and provincial co-operation and is a step in the right 
direction, but we must keep up the fight on behalf of farmers in 
Ontario and across the country who are hit with the double effect 
of chronically low commodity prices and huge U.S. subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The announcement builds on the work of the standing committee on 
agriculture.  We released our report in February entitled 
“Making the Farm Income Safety Net Stronger and More Responsive 
to the Farmers' Needs”.  We heard from farmers and their 
organizations in every province.  The input was from those most 
affected and the most knowledgeable about exactly what is 
happening on the farm today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After two years of intense negotiations our federal minister of 
agriculture has shown great leadership by compelling all 
ministers to pull together and overcome the challenges of 
Canadian agriculture and the challenges of the federal-provincial 
discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reaching consensus with the provinces that represent such a 
diverse group of farmers is no easy task at any time.  I am 
pleased that the agreement is designed to prove the maximum 
degree of farm income stabilization possible.  By working 
together, the provinces, the federal government, members of 
parliament, farmers and their organizations can shape a truly 
national vision for agriculture in the 21st century.

on my answer of March 23 to the question she posed on that date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food has worked very hard 
with his provincial counterparts and the industry.  He has 
announced a tentative agreement with all 10 provinces on a long 
term safety net plan.  This will provide producers across Canada 
with the stability they need to thrive.  The work before all 
governments now is to iron out the details of the agreement 
including the details of a disaster program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is pleased that an agreement has been 
achieved that provides for a three year farm income framework. We 
are confident that the plan will be ratified by each of the 
provinces as soon as possible.  They have each committed to seek 
the authorities they need from their respective cabinets and 
provincial legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tentative agreement provides annual federal funding of $665 
million for basic safety net programs and access to $435 million 
in income disaster assistance in each of the next three years. 
When the agreement is finalized the federal commitment to safety 
net funding will be more than $3.3 billion for the next three 
years.

debate on this next to last day of the session, which was marked 
by the scandal at Human Resources Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the federal government lost control over $1 billion 
in grants. 
We found very serious problems, administrative management flaws 
and a total lack of control by the ministers responsible, both 
the former one, now the Minister for International Trade, and 
the current Minister of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse, the government shamelessly used public funds for partisan 
purposes during the last election campaign. As we know, the RCMP 
is currently conducting 12 investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet is the fact that the effectiveness of the job creation 
program was questioned. Today, newspaper headlines are to the 
effect that the Liberals are considering eliminating these 
programs. All this because of the mismanagement of public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make a clear distinction between the relevancy of the 
job creation programs and the way they are managed. But this 
government will certainly be held responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What sort of solution did the government propose?  With respect 
to the issue of administrative management: dismantling the 
department.  I would be in favour of that, and in fact I was the 
one who suggested it to the committee.  But there has been no 
proposal from the Prime Minister or from the government for a 
department that is truly accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was the present minister not asked to resign so that another 
minister could be appointed to oversee the dismantling of the 
department?  This minister's mandate could be for a specific 
period of time.  At the end of the road, there would be a new and 
clear situation.  The problem would not be carried over to future 
new departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the use of money for partisan purposes, that is very 
serious on the eve of a federal election.  We have the same 
situation we had four years ago. If it wants to, the government 
will be able to use public money to try to win the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see the same scenario all over again.  Money became 
available, particularly in the ridings of Bloc Quebecois members 
who were here in the 1997 election:  63% of the money spent under 
the transitional job fund over three years was spent during the 
election campaign, which is utterly shocking.  The government has 
put no measures in place to correct this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the government does not have the political will 
to do something about this?  Are there secret groups behind this? 
Is it because this was how the election was won in Saint-Maurice 
that the government does not want to sort this out for the 
future?  Why did the government refuse to conduct an independent, 
public inquiry, as the opposition parties unanimously called for 
it to do?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP): </B>Mr. Speaker, on this next

a question I asked in this House back in April. I said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, 300 people gathered on the Acadian 
peninsula to ask the federal and provincial governments to 
assume their responsibility in the matter of the black hole 
created by the changes to unemployment insurance in 1996 by this 
government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This black hole, or gapper as it is called, is the time between 
the end of the EI benefit period in January and May, when 
fishing resumes, when forestry workers can start working again 
and when construction employees can find work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my question, I also said this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the Premier of New Brunswick told a group of 200 
people that New Brunswick was not responsible for the black 
hole. 
What is the Minister of Human Resources Development going to do 
to resolve the problem of the black hole once and for all? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's reply was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, we are very sensitive to the plight of seasonal 
workers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Liberals be sensitive to the plight of seasonal 
workers, when they are the ones who, in 1996, put them in that 
black hole? It is the federal Liberal government which put 
workers and seasonal workers in a black hole, and the minister 
says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, we are very sensitive to the plight of seasonal 
workers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet it was the Liberals who put seasonal workers in the black 
hole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is disgusting. That is the word I will use. 
I had a private member's motion, which was introduced in the 
House of Commons and passed by 100% of those present.  The 
Liberals voted in favour of my motion, indicating that they were 
going to review unemployment insurance.  But they have not yet 
had the gumption to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March, at the Liberal Convention that was held here in 
Ottawa, the Prime Minister said “We lost the Atlantic provinces 
because of the changes to employment insurance.  The law has to 
be changed if we are to win their support back”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say to the Liberals across the way, however, that the 
people of the Atlantic provinces cannot be bought.  The 
Liberals' changes to employment insurance are not going to buy 
them votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they need to do, in all honesty, is to make changes to 
employment insurance.  They are supposedly not happy with the 
changes that have been made, and upset about the situation of 
the seasonal workers.  I would therefore ask them to do the 
honourable thing, and make real changes in employment insurance 
for the seasonal workers, whether in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, 
Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, Northern Ontario—in Timmins, 
Kapuskasing or Hearst—or in Windsor, in Edmonton, Alberta, or 
anywhere else.

changes to employment insurance.  All the Liberals did.

parliamentary secretary rise in this House and tell us “Yes, the 
Liberals are going to make changes to employment insurance, not 
to buy votes, but because the situation we have put seasonal

situation, and because it is unacceptable, from the humane point

government is very sensitive to the plight of seasonal workers. 
That is exactly why we modernized the EI system so that it can 
help get people back to work as quickly as possible.  We also 
negotiated labour market agreements with the provinces to ensure 
that our job programs better meet the local needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year's monitoring and assessment report of those changes 
shows that frequent claimants, such as seasonal workers, benefit 
from the new EI system.  These claimants now have an average 
entitlement period of 32.8 weeks, which is three weeks longer 
than it was before the changes.  Frequent claimants also continue 
to receive 42.9% of all benefits paid.  Their share of benefits 
paid has actually increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember that EI benefits are just one 
solution available for seasonal workers.  Our priority is to work 
with our partners to improve job opportunities and economic 
development for individuals and communities that rely on seasonal 
work.  It is the end result that really counts.

it is a pleasure to rise this evening to speak to this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-82 of the previous session and Bill C-18 of this 
session, the government will have implemented every 
recommendation for a specific criminal code change that the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights made in its report 
toward eliminating impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a distinct pleasure to observe the non-partisan approach 
taken by all parties during the committee's review of the 
impaired driving provisions.  I believe the collegial atmosphere 
in committee was an extension of the unanimous support given by 
the House to the motion of the official opposition in October 
1998 which initiated the committee's review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain that all members agree that impaired driving is a 
totally unnecessary behaviour.  The consequences of impaired 
driving are tragic precisely because, in hindsight, other actions 
so shocking in their simplicity could have avoided the 
heart-rending results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we can easily agree on the pernicious problem, we are not 
always agreed on the solutions.  I accept that we will not always 
fully agree on the appropriate solutions.  Most importantly, I 
would not want to diminish our unity concerning the 
unacceptability of driving while impaired because that bedrock 
message needs to go out from this House. 
That message is best supported when we show respect for views on 
impaired driving solutions that differ from our own but which are 
just as sincerely held.  I say this because there are some 
differing opinions on one particular clause in Bill C-18.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is concerned that raising the maximum penalty 
for impaired driving causing death from 14 years imprisonment to 
life imprisonment, as proposed in Bill C-18, is too harsh.  I 
respect the Bloc's view.  However, I believe that this amendment 
would enhance deterrence and denunciation of impaired driving 
causing death.  The amendment would harmonize the maximum penalty 
for impaired driving causing death with the maximum penalty for 
manslaughter and for criminal negligence causing death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment in Bill C-18 addresses only the maximum 
penalty that may be imposed.  I again remind all members that a 
maximum penalty is reserved for the worst offender and the worst 
offence circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments, private and public organizations, families and 
individuals play key roles in the struggle against impaired 
driving.  I want to acknowledge the successes that such combined 
efforts have achieved.  I am happy to note that there has been 
significant improvement over the past dozen years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fatally injured drivers whose blood alcohol concentration was 
over the criminal law limit comprised 43% of all fatally injured 
drivers in 1987.  By 1997 this dropped to 32%.  This occurred at 
the same time that the number of road deaths from all causes was 
decreasing.  Therefore, the lowered statistic of fatally injured 
drivers who were over the legal limit, as a percentage of all 
fatally injured drivers, is very significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we have seen progress in reducing alcohol involved road 
fatalities, we should not forget that impaired driving behaviour 
remains a very great challenge.  A Traffic Injury Research 
Foundation survey published in 1999 suggested that in Canada 
there are some 12.5 million impaired driving trips taken each 
year.  Some 2.6% of drivers account for 84% of impaired driving 
trips.  In British Columbia in 1998 more than 80% of alcohol 
involved road fatalities were persons in or on the alcohol 
involved driver's vehicle, including the alcohol involved driver. 
In 1997 it is estimated that there were 1,350 alcohol involved 
impaired driving deaths nationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Impaired driving has shown itself to be a persistent problem. 
Parliament first introduced a driving while intoxicated offence 
in 1921.  In 1925 it introduced the first intoxicated driving 
offence related to a drug.  Prior to 1969 there were several 
significant changes to the impaired driving provisions, including 
the creation of an offence for driving while impaired by alcohol 
or a drug.  In 1969 the offence of driving with a blood alcohol 
concentration exceeding 80 milligrams per cent was added. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were significant changes in 1985 that created the offences 
of impaired driving causing bodily harm or death.  Since 1985 
parliament amended the impaired driving provisions on at least a 
half dozen occasions.  These changes address interpretations in 
the case law and drafting difficulties.  The need for Bill C-82 
and Bill C-18 remind us just how persistent a problem impaired 
driving is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also bear in mind that every five years we have a new 
cohort of young people aged 16 to 21 who are entering the driving 
population.  It is estimated that by 2010 the percentage of 
Canadians aged 16 to 24 will return to levels not seen since the 
early 1980s.  Even if we could eliminate all impaired driving 
today there would be much work to be done for new drivers of the 
future.  It is important to reach out continually to new drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we enter into this happy period of graduations and school 
proms, I urge our students not to drink and drive.  Students are 
loved and cherished by their families and friends and should not, 
under any circumstances, become tragic statistics.  Those who 
must drink should respect the designated driver tradition.  All 
Canadians will be glad for that, especially the moms and dads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal law is an important measure amongst a combination 
of measures that can be brought to bear upon the problem of 
impaired driving.  However, while criminal legislation must do its 
part, criminal legislation by itself cannot be expected to 
eliminate impaired driving.  The conviction rate for criminal 
charges of impaired driving, at 77% in 1997, is amongst the 
highest, if not the highest, for any criminal code offence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to lend my support to this very important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we can get lost in statistics and they can become very 
impersonal.  However, I will never forget the day that one of my 
colleagues at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology, where 
I worked, phoned to say that he would not be coming to work that 
day because his sister had just been killed.  It turned out that 
she had been killed by a drunken driver.  I believe she was 18 
years old at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When something like that happens, we realize that this is 
something that is very serious and something that we must take 
great action to stop.  As the parliamentary secretary just said, 
we probably cannot pass laws that will eliminate this totally. 
What we need is a massive overhaul of public attitude toward 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be an automatic given that if a person is impaired, or 
anywhere near impaired, that they decline to drive.  There is 
always another way of getting from point <I>A</I> to point <I>B</I> 
if they are not able to drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember one day—and this person probably does not remember 
who did it to him—I was driving behind a driver who literally 
was bouncing off the curbs where there were three lanes in the 
road.  He was going from one side to another.  I was heading out 
into the country where my family lives, and he was going onto a 
two lane country road.  Fortunately, the very last light before 
he left the town that I was in was red.  I pulled up behind him, 
threw on my four-way flashers, jumped out of my car, ran up, 
opened the door and took his keys away.  He was very surprised. 
In a way, I guess, I made a citizen's arrest.  Maybe I could get 
charged for doing something illegal now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I always think that perhaps what I did that day was not 
only to save him the anguish of knowing that he had injured or 
killed someone, but that I had also saved the life of some person 
who could have been his victim.  I knew that I had to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, today we have the opportunity to strengthen 
the law with respect to impaired driving.  This is a bill which I 
believe is long overdue.  It is a very important bill.  We must 
send a crystal clear message to people who contemplate driving 
when they are impaired that it is something they just do not do 
because the risks are too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just thought of an example, Mr. Speaker.  You just mentioned 
that your grandchildren were watching on television.  The 
government whip just said that it was his twin grandkids' 
birthday today.  I have four grandchildren.  None of us would 
have a place, say a catwalk in a store, where we would take away 
some of the railing that prevents kids from falling down and 
hurting themselves.  If that railing was broken, we would block 
that place off and not allow anyone to go there until the risk 
was removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have an opportunity to remove the risk or at least 
reduce it, thereby saving lives and saving the anguish of those 
people who go through life knowing that they have taken someone 
else's life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is long overdue.  As I have said, I would like to give 
a little credit to our colleague from Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley, who has headed up the campaign to improve the law in the 
area of impaired driving.  I would like to give him accolades for 
having done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a responsibility to the victims of impaired driving to 
legislate this very important amendment to the criminal code. 
This is an amendment that will give judges the means of imposing 
a life sentence for impaired driving causing death, a very 
serious crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will also speak on Bill C-18, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code (impaired driving causing death and other matters). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 amends the criminal code by increasing the maximum 
penalty for impaired driving causing death, which is presently of 
14 years of imprisonment, to life imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will allow a justice to issue a warrant authorizing 
the taking of a blood sample in order to establish the presence 
of drugs in the blood of an individual involved in an accident 
causing bodily harm to himself or to another person or the death 
of the latter. Formerly, blood analysis was only authorized to 
determine the presence of alcohol in the blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois strenuously objects to increasing the maximum 
penalty for impaired driving from 14 years to life imprisonment. 
The Bloc Quebecois believes that this bill would deny the 
characteristics of this offense and create a serious imbalance in 
our criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now explain the reasons for our opposition to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts, which are presently the most competent to analyze 
the characteristics of each offender, have not exhausted the 
resources of the criminal code, which presently sets at 14 years 
the maximum penalty for impaired driving causing death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, so far the heaviest sentence handed down by 
a court for impaired driving causing death was 10 years of 
imprisonment. The percentage of individuals sentenced to 
imprisonment for impaired driving dropped from 22% in 1994-95 to 
19% in and 1997-98. Prison sentences given in those cases were 
mainly less than two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the rather serious nature of impaired driving causing 
death, it is false to claim that we are presently facing a rash 
of crimes of this type. 
In 1998, 103 persons were charged with impaired driving causing 
death, the lowest number of charges since 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has become a leader in incarceration.  Its rates of 
incarceration are right behind those of the United States.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada imprisons twice as often as most European countries.  In 
this regard, Justices Cory and Iacobucci of the Supreme Court of 
Canada recently criticized, in <I>Gladue</I>,  the considerable ease 
with which the federal legislator has recourse to imprisonment in 
dealing with delinquency problems.  Here is what they said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a world leader in many fields, particularly in the 
areas of progressive social policy and human rights. 
Unfortunately, our country is also distinguished as being a world 
leader in putting people in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the United States has by far the highest rate of 
incarceration among industrialized democracies, at over 600 
inmates per 100,000 population, Canada's rate of approximately 
130 inmates per 100,000 population places it second or third 
highest. Moreover, the rate at which Canadian courts have been 
imprisoning offenders has risen sharply in recent years, although 
there has been a slight decline of late. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A careful reading of the criminal code reveals the legislator's 
clear preference for imprisonment, because the sentences 
indicated for most offences are maximum sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of the community have noted that imprisonment is 
not only extremely expensive but does not have the desired 
dissuasive and rehabilitative effects. 
The comments made by the Canadian Sentencing Commission are along 
that line. In a report entitled “Sentencing Reform in Canada: A 
Canadian Approach”, the commission says the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada does not imprison as high a portion of its population as 
does the United States. However, we do imprison more people than 
most other western democracies. The Criminal Code displays an 
apparent bias toward the use of incarceration, since for most 
offences the penalty indicated is expressed in terms of a maximum 
term of imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of difficulties arise if 
imprisonment is perceived to be the preferred sanction for most 
offences. Perhaps most significant is that although we regularly impose 
this most onerous and expensive sanction, it accomplishes very 
little apart from separating offenders from society for a period 
of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past few decades, many groups and federally 
appointed committees and commissions given the responsibility of 
studying various aspects of the criminal justice system have 
argued that imprisonment should be used only as a last resort 
and(or) that it should be reserved for those convicted of only 
the most serious offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, although much has been said, 
little has been done to move us in this direction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given these extremely convincing comments by qualified people, 
one wonders what the minister hopes to achieve by increasing the 
maximum penalty for impaired driving causing death from 14 years 
to life imprisonment. We think this government is trying to 
please voters it is afraid to lose to the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an article published on June 3, 1999 in <I>La Presse</I>, 
editorial writer Pierre Gravel clearly explained what is 
happening with the Liberals when it comes to criminal issues. Mr. 
Gravel wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when the government, as it is currently the case, faces an 
ultra-conservative and populist opposition such as the Reform 
Party, which always advocates harsher sentences to ensure law and 
order everywhere, there is inevitably the risk of having the most 
radical solutions, which do not always reflect the reality and 
whose greatest value is to calm down an exasperated population 
whose desire for retaliation is constantly exacerbated by 
demagogues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When, in addition to that, the party in office feels the 
imperious need to become more popular with a group of citizens 
who applaud the uncompromising attitude of the opposition, we 
find ourselves with an unacceptable bill such as the one that 
triggered the out-and-out and, in this case, fully justified 
opposition of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By introducing Bill C-18, the Minister of Justice is showing her 
inability to manage complex problems without resorting to 
dangerously repressive measures.  There is no justification for 
this attitude, because crime has been on the decline in Canada 
for many years.  Furthermore, there are no studies showing the 
effectiveness of such an approach.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois views impaired driving causing death as a 
very serious offence.  We believe that the gravity of this 
offence is correctly reflected in the maximum sentence possible, 
which right now is 14 years in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois feels that prison is the worst tool for 
raising people's awareness, and that is why we are opposed to 
Bill C-18, which unjustifiably increases the sentence for 
impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, penitentiary is seen as the ideal school for 
crime and a person who does not start out with the profile of a 
hardened criminal could show severe behavioural problems after a 
prolonged stay behind bars.  Prison must be the last solution 
for dealing with the problem of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this legislation, a drunk driver, whose negligence is not 
in any doubt, could be given a heavier sentence than a hired 
killer who, having deliberately set out to assassinate someone, 
gets a reduced sentence for being an informer.  Should someone 
who has gone overboard on New Year's Day be treated in the same 
way as a member of organized crime?  Both individuals have 
admittedly committed very reprehensible deeds.  However, their 
profiles are very different and Bill C-18 does not address this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Bill C-18 is passed, the penalty for dangerous driving causing 
death will not be as heavy as for impaired driving causing 
death.  In the case of dangerous driving causing death, the 
criminal code provides for 14 years in prison and, since 1995, 
Canadian courts of appeal have handed out jail sentences 
averaging 19 months for this type of offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister justify a shorter sentence for someone who 
cold-bloodedly and in full possession of his faculties kills 
someone while driving recklessly than for someone driving under 
the influence of alcohol?  Logic would call for a life sentence 
for the offence of dangerous driving causing death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give more examples of serious crimes committed by people 
who are fully aware of what they are doing, and who would be 
less severely punished than drunk drivers if Bill C-18 were 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take murder, for example. Attempted murder would be less 
severely punished than impaired driving causing death, which, 
under section 463(<I>a</I>) of the criminal code, carries a sentence of 
up to 14 years in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second example is that of an individual who is an accessory 
after the fact by helping a murderer escape. Our justice system 
would be more lenient with this individual than with one charged 
with impaired driving causing death, for which the criminal code 
provides a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminals involved in gang activities and organized crime are 
subject to a maximum sentence of 14 years in a penal 
institution. What utter nonsense. An individual who commits 
aggravated assault, by wounding, maiming, disfiguring or 
endangering the life of another person is liable to imprisonment 
for a term not exceeding fourteen years, under section 268 of 
the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will staunchly oppose 
Bill C-18. It is jeopardizing our justice system through a more 
repressive attitude in sentencing. This is both useless and 
futile, and the Bloc Quebecois is against this.

Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of my constituents and all those 
people who are affected by impaired driving.  Bill C-18 is an act 
to amend the criminal code with regard to impaired driving 
causing death and other matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has been long overdue and this weak Liberal government 
may not have introduced it if it were not up to hon. member for 
Prince George—Bulkley Valley, the proud point man of the 
Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediately after the election in 1997 I was contacted by one of 
my constituents and friends who told me the story of a couple of 
young men that had just graduated.  They were having fun at a 
party.  They got together in a pub and may have had a couple of 
beers.  They decided not to drive home but to walk, which was the 
right thing to do.  Their home was about one kilometre away. 
These youths were walking on the sidewalk on their way home when 
some drunk driver came from behind and lost control of his car. 
He ran over one of those kids and killed him on the spot.  This 
incident did not affect only the family but it affected the whole 
community.  It personally touched me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 was brought to the House in a timely fashion by the 
justice minister.  I congratulate the hon. for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley for his efforts.  The bill amends the 
criminal code by increasing the maximum penalty for impaired 
driving causing death to life imprisonment.  It provides for the 
taking of blood samples for the purpose of testing for the 
presence of drugs and makes other amendments.  I believe my 
constituents and all other Canadians will feel relieved that the 
bill has been introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by simply saying that I appreciate the efforts of 
the hon. member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley.  I thank him

to protect society from the hard core drinkers who are resistant 
to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tragically most people have experienced or have known a person 
whose life has been affected due to the careless actions of a 
drunk driver.  Criminal offences involving drunk drivers have 
declined 23% between 1994 and 1997, but how many do not get 
caught? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High school proms and summer vacation time are upon us.  MADD 
statistics state that one in every eight deaths and injuries in 
road crashes is a teenager.  More teenagers die each year as a 
result of road crashes than any other cause of death.  Teen 
statistics have declined in recent years but recent progress has 
stalled.  In 1997, according to the most recent statistics 
available, 404 youths aged between age 15 and 19 were killed and 
another 28,780 were injured in road crashes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also troubling that 40% of the teenage drivers killed had 
been drinking, three-quarters with alcohol levels in excess of 
the legal limit of 80 mg per cent and 44% with levels in excess 
of 150 mg per cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dangerous habits that develop at an early age become the 
problems of chronic impaired drivers in later life.  Groups like 
MADD are working hard to deal with this problem at an early age, 
trying to raise the minimum age for drinking, the minimum age for 
driving, and introducing SmartCard technology to verify the age 
of an individual trying to buy alcohol.  Yet MADD has not been 
getting enough co-operation from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hoped that the year long push of the PC Party for Bill 
C-18 to be passed will benefit the MADD members for all their 
hard work in stopping impaired driving among all ages of the 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continuing with the get tough approach, the Nova Scotia Tory 
government is considering whether it can charge room and board of 
$100 or more per day to incarcerated drunk drivers.  This idea is 
only in its initial stages with many details which would need to 
be ironed out.  It along with the results of Operation Christmas 
shows the positive tough steps the Nova Scotia Tory government is 
taking to solve this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have in New Brunswick what we call Operation Red Nose in 
which volunteers drive people during the Christmas and New Year's 
holidays.  It certainly works.  We also need to have our young 
people involved in it so they learn that it is not right to drink 
and drive.  As parents we have a responsibility to show our 
children that it is not right and to set the right example.  Not 
only teenagers drink and drive.  We all know that a lot of adult 
parents set the wrong example.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the federal government to follow the lead of 
other provinces.  The most horrific side of impaired driving is 
when we see and hear of the fatalities, the innocent victims who 
are killed as a result of the thoughtless, selfish act of an 
impaired person who decides to get behind the wheel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer I had the opportunity to go to a high school in my 
riding, LJR, to see a play about a car accident which involved 
alcohol.  Everyone was there, including the ambulance, the RCMP 
and the kids.  According to the play, some kids had been killed 
in the accident.  It was interesting to see these high school 
students acting out a very serious accident involving alcohol. 
It is very important that events like that take place in high 
schools so the teenagers see firsthand the impact of drinking and 
driving, of not wearing seatbelts and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has an opportunity to send the message 
that drinking and driving will no longer be tolerated.  Bill C-18 
is a great step in the right direction, but we must continue.  I 
commend the all-party justice committee that is sending a clear 
message through Bill C-18 that if a person drinks and drives and 
kills an innocent victim, that person is no better than someone 
who walks down the street with a loaded gun, chooses a victim at 
random and shoots the person dead.

drivers, education will only prevent future impaired driving 
fatalities.  Currently the biggest problem is not with youth, but 
with a generation that should know better.  This generation has 
to take a lot of responsibility for what is happening.  A lot of 
us may be showing the wrong example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Automobile Association has said that the message of 
the danger of drunk driving is getting through to drivers aged 16 
to 21, but impaired driving remains a startling problem for the 
age group 35 to 45.  Thus, hand in hand with Bill C-18 we need 
more education.  It is very important that our provincial 
counterparts also realize that there is a role to play in our 
school system and that they should make the time to speak to our 
students to explain the dangers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Insurance Bureau of Canada has said that over a two year 
period an impaired driving conviction costs at least $5,000 in 
additional premiums to the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly support this piece of legislation.  It is long 
overdue.  We have to send a very strong message that drinking and 
driving is not right.  It kills and it will no longer be 
tolerated in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a very brief question.  In the course of her 
speech the hon. member indicated that hers was the only party 
that had the lives and the well-being of Canadians at heart. 
Anybody in the House knows that is inaccurate.  I would like to 
give the member the opportunity to correct the record and to say 
that she is one of many, in fact probably all MPs, who have that 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I made that statement 
I probably read my notes wrong.  I am hoping that the Reform 
Party also has a conscience and is aware of the problem of 
drinking and driving.  I have no doubt that those members support 
this legislation.  I believe I mentioned in my speech that there 
was all-party support for the legislation.

<P><A NAME="LINK350"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Raymond Chan (for the Minister of National Defence)</B> 
moved that Bill S-18, an act to amend the National Defence Act 
(non-deployment of persons under the age of eighteen years to 
theatres of hostilities), be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK351"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to lend my 
support to this important proposal to amend the National Defence 
Act. This government is determined to send a strong message of 
opposition to the use of child soldiers in conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern over the use of young children for purposes of 
violence, exploitation and warfare stems directly from our 
commitment to human security. In the Speech from the Throne, the 
government pledged to give increased prominence to human security 
in Canadian foreign policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This commitment is an important expression of the values held by 
Canadians. Values that this government has pledged to promote and 
protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize that the threats to human security are many. We 
know that all too often, and in too many parts of the world 
today, governments ignore basic human rights. In societies 
wracked by civil conflict there are warring factions all too 
ready to exploit, intimidate and threaten the most innocent, the 
most vulnerable. Our television screens are filled with terrible 
images of people who are so victimized.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one would argue that the international community has the 
resources or the ability to bring an end to all of these terrible 
deeds. But this does not justify inaction or indifference. We 
must take action where we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government believes that the shameful use of children in 
conflict is as distasteful a practice as anyone can imagine. We 
can show leadership on this issue. We must. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to inform this House that Canada is showing 
leadership and action. We will host a conference on child 
soldiers in Winnipeg this September. It will focus on ways and 
means to prevent such conflicts and to protect the children 
caught in the middle of hostilities. It will also examine how to 
reintegrate the children of war into the post-conflict 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this conference is an important contribution, we in Canada 
and in the international community nevertheless have our work cut 
out for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics tell a chilling tale. The UN reported in 1996 
that during the preceding decade, nearly 2 millions children were 
killed and more than 4 million were disabled from violent 
conflict. Another 1 million were orphaned. More than 10 million 
were left psychologically scarred by the trauma of violence 
committed against them and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, an estimated 300,000 children are serving in regular 
armies or as guerilla fighters. They are also pressed into 
service as mine layers, spies, sexual slaves, cooks or porters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the problem of child soldiers is a global one, the worst 
cases are in Africa and Asia. The Coalition to Stop the Use of 
Child Soldiers estimates that, in Africa alone, 120,000 children 
under the age of 18 are direct participants in armed conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These young people are being denied the kind of childhood that 
we in Canada expect our children to have as a matter of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be no doubt that this is a problem that demands our 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As appalling as the child soldier problem is, I am heartened by 
the efforts of the international community. The UN has been 
working diligently to focus attention on the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989, the UN developed a convention on the rights of the 
child. This convention established the age of 15 as a minimum 
standard for the voluntary and compulsory recruitment of children 
into military forces and participation in hostilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, the UN Human Rights Commission established a working 
group to prepare a protocol to the original convention in order 
to raise this minimum age standard. This effort has met with 
success, thanks to the efforts of Canada and other like-minded 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 25 of this year, the UN General Assembly adopted the 
optional protocol to raise the minimum age to 18 years of age for 
compulsory recruitment into the armed forces of state parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, state parties commit to taking every feasible 
measure to ensure that any member of their armed forces under 18 
years of age does not take part in hostilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protocol also sets standards for 16 and 17 year olds who 
join voluntarily. This form of recruitment is to take place only 
with parental consent and reliable proof of age. And each recruit 
is to be made aware of duties involved in military service. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2000"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the protocol urges all state parties to co-operate in 
ensuring that the victims of acts contrary to the protocol 
receive appropriate physical and psychological assistance to deal 
with their trauma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has worked hard towards agreement on this protocol and we 
fully support it. And we have made our support clear by our 
actions. I am pleased to inform the House that on June 6 Canada 
became the first country to sign the optional protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our signature on the protocol will not result in any change to 
current recruiting practices by the Canadian forces. Canada does 
not practice conscription or any other form of compulsory 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Canadian forces do recruit volunteers under the age 
of 18. I want to assure all hon. members that our practices in 
this area do not contravene the protocol in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first provide some background on our recruiting 
activities for those under 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year, approximately 1,000 16 and 17 year olds join the 
Canadian forces. The majority of these men and women serve in the 
Reserve. Of those in the regular force, most are taking their 
university education at the Royal Military College of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These young Canadians are given a valuable range of educational 
experience in both military and non-military subjects. The 
leadership training they undergo exposes them to concepts of 
accountability and ethics. Their military training provides them 
such valuable skills as fire fighting, basic medical training 
and mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These kinds of employment opportunities are important for our 
youth. In the Speech from the Throne, the government also 
pledged to provide young Canadians with access to work 
experience and learning opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few people realize that the Canadian forces are, in fact, the 
largest youth employer in Canada. For example, members of the 
Canadian forces reserve parade daily on Parliament Hill during 
the summer as part of the prestigious Ceremonial Guard. 
And hundreds of 16 and 17 year old reservists—part of a primary 
reserve of over 20,000—take part in military training from 
coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recruiting these young Canadians for the regular force and the 
reserve is vital to ensuring that the Canadian forces can 
attract top quality high school and university graduates. 
Their recruitment complies with the provision of the optional 
protocol. They join voluntarily with the consent of their 
parents. They are made aware of the responsibilities of military 
service. And unless they have reached 18 years of age, they are 
not considered for deployment to hostile theatres of operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are long standing practices for the Canadian forces. They 
clearly demonstrate Canada's already existing full compliance 
with the terms of the optional protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's proposed amendment to the National Defence Act 
would strengthen the Canadian forces' policy of not deploying 
anyone under the age of 18 to a hostile theatre by including it 
in legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has never been part of the child soldier problem but we 
believe that it is vital to take a strong stand on this issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is intent on making it clear to the international 
community that our refusal to send children into hostile 
theatres is not merely our belief or our policy, it is against 
our law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of this House to support this amendment. Such 
support will send a strong unmistakable signal that Canada and 
Canadians will never condone the use of child soldiers and the 
victimization of children in conflict neither morally nor, with 
this amendment, legally. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK352"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of 
Okanagan—Coquihalla to speak to Bill S-18, an act to amend the 
National Defence Act.  Of course this follows the government 
agenda as we have heard the parliamentary secretary speak about 
soft power. In this debate I want to make sure that we also do 
not lose sight of the fact that in order for soft power to work, 
we have to make sure that we maintain our military and have hard 
military assets available to use when needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-18 amends the National Defence Act by preventing the 
Canadian armed forces from deploying a person under the age of 18 
to a theatre of hostilities.  This is a personal thing for me and 
maybe for you too, Mr. Speaker.  I joined the Canadian armed 
forces when I was 17 years old.  I was an ordinary seaman in the 
Canadian navy. I think my hon. friend Mr. Speaker was an ordinary 
seaman as well.  I enjoyed that experience in the Canadian armed 
forces and in particular in the navy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually it takes about a year to train a 17 year old to a combat 
capable standard.  In my case I think it was at least a year. The 
point I want to make is that my ship was deployed to Vietnam.  In 
1974 the HMCS <I>Gatineau</I> was on its way to oversee the 
removal of American troops as part of that UN mission. 
Unfortunately I was in Halifax on marine electrical training and 
had two weeks left on course so I was not able to go.  When I 
came back to Esquimalt, from where my ship was being deployed, I 
had to go on another ship that was in refit, the HMCS 
<I>Kootenay</I>.  I will never forget it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a very depressing time in my life because in my eyes, at 
just 18 years of age, I was ready to go.  I wanted to serve my 
country and be part of that.  Therefore I have a special interest 
in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make the point that the Canadian Alliance does support 
the spirit of the bill.  We support the idea that it is 
unthinkable, especially now that I am 44, that we would agree to 
send a 17 year old into hostilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of Bill S-18 is to strengthen Canada's position with 
respect to the optional protocol to the convention on the rights 
of children on the involvement of children in armed conflict 
which was finalized by the United Nations working group in 
January 2000. The optional protocol is intended to address issues 
of child soldiers, those children in less developed countries who 
are often sent into battle as soon as they are able to lift a 
weapon. Although I support the concept and the spirit of the 
bill, I wonder, and I think Canadians are probably asking 
themselves, how do we enforce this and make it work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 I had the opportunity to travel with the special joint 
committee to Bosnia and Croatia.  That was at the height of the 
war.  The experience there was that entire villages were being 
attacked by militia groups and ethnic groups. Ethnic cleansing 
was going on.  Oftentimes young men were taken out and they and 
their families were killed.  Or the other circumstances were that 
the militia would come in, take the young men and tell them they 
were now in the army. 
That situation is one of fight or die.  I just wonder if the 
government has really thought this one through.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting also that the government would introduce this 
bill in the dying days of this session of parliament. The 
designation <I>S</I> on the bill denotes that the bill is from the 
Senate; it is not from the House of Commons.  The Senate is the 
place of sober second thought when it comes to looking at 
legislation.  Senators are not really there to write legislation 
and introduce it for us to debate, but here we are tonight. I 
simply make the observation that if the government had as its 
number one priority only to allow people who were 18 years old 
and over to go into an area of conflict, probably the Minister of 
National Defence would have introduced the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary also mentioned that approximately 
1,000 16 and 17 year olds join the Canadian armed forces through 
the reserve or the regular force.  I know he cannot answer a 
question, but I want him to think about this issue. If we have 
limited resources in the Canadian armed forces, which everyone 
knows we do, why would we put our efforts into training 16 and 17 
year olds for combat missions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary did point out that they are trained 
in the medical fields, they are trained as mechanics and they are 
trained in all kinds of support positions. The fact is those 
support positions go into combat.  Let us look at our history in 
Croatia and Bosnia.  During the battle of the Medak pocket in 
Croatia, the worst firefight that Canadian soldiers have 
witnessed since the Korean war, 50% of those people were 
reservists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have limited resources.  This bill has been introduced 
through the back door, through the Senate.  The government has a 
history since 1993 of cutting defence expenditures and reducing 
the number of personnel.  I really wonder, and Canadians do too, 
if this is really a priority of the federal Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really motherhood and apple pie, is it not?   Would we 
rather see our 16 and 17 year old in schools or going off to 
Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo or somewhere else?   Of course every 
member in this House is going to support this initiative.  Sure 
we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hair stands up on the back of my neck when I see a 
government that has a history since 1993 of not supporting our 
Canadian armed forces.  Now it is supporting a bill to ensure 
that people cannot get into the armed forces if they have a 
desire to.  Enough said on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That we are talking about youth and the Canadian armed forces 
gives me the wonderful opportunity to tell Canadians about one of 
the most fantastic programs Canada has.  It is the cadet program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aims of the Canadian cadet program are to develop in youth 
the attributes of good citizenship and leadership, to promote 
physical fitness and to stimulate the interest of Canadian youth 
in the land, sea and air elements of the Canadian armed forces. 
It is a unique program.  No other country in the world has a 
program like it.  It is a partnership between the Department of 
National Defence and civilian organizations, such as the Air 
Cadet League of Canada, the Sea Cadet League of Canada, the Navy 
League of Canada and the Army League of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, for five years I had the distinct privilege 
of being a commanding officer and I started a cadet program in my 
hometown of Summerland, British Columbia. That organization was 
an air cadet corps and had the privilege of being sponsored by 
the Kiwanis Club of Summerland.  Currently I am trying to start a 
sea cadet corps in Penticton, another town in my riding. Another 
civilian organization, the Army, Navy, Air Force Association of 
Penticton has said it will financially support the sea cadets in 
Penticton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cadet program is a fabulous way for Canadian youth to get 
experience about the Canadian armed forces. 
It is not a way to recruit young people into the armed forces. It 
is very separate from that.  It has a very distinct and different 
approach to how it attracts young people between the ages of 12 
and 19.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These cadets participate in mandatory weekly training.  There 
are 1,140 sea, army and air cadet squadrons for coast to coast to 
coast.  This means that there are over 54,000 cadets in Canada. 
Each squadron is led by a group of officers who are usually but 
not always employed in other professions.  I was in the 
advertising profession, but for five years I worked part time as 
a commanding officer of an air cadet squadron. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another area where I think the government is failing 
Canadians.  This is a fabulous program.  The government should be 
putting more money and resources into cadet training.  It should 
also be looking very closely at the issue of these officers. 
There are some 4,500 cadet instructors-cadre officers in Canada. 
In fact the parliamentary secretary can check this, but I am sure 
it will be found that out of the officer corps in the Canadian 
armed forces there are more officers in this segment of the armed 
forces than any other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite a responsibility to step up to the plate and be a 
real supporter of youth projects in this way.  They are 
responsible for safety, supervision, administration and the 
training of cadets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to bring this issue forward because there are so very 
few times that we have an opportunity to talk about the cadet 
program and that wonderful interaction between the Canadian armed 
forces and the youth of the country.  It is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that the Liberal government had failed the 
Canadian armed forces since it took office in 1993.  While Bill 
S-18 protects our youth by not subjecting them to combat 
situations, the Liberal government has failed to protect those 
over 18 in the Canadian armed forces and reserves through its 
shameful treatment and inadequate funding of the Canadian armed 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence budget cuts is a prime example.  We can look at that 
over the last seven years.  The Liberal government has pursued a 
defence policy that has stripped the Canadian armed forces of 
much of its combat capability.  The Liberal government slashed 
defence spending 24% to just over $9 billion, far below that 
which was recommended by the special joint committee.  Less 
money, less personnel, less equipment, less training, and 
ultimately less combat capability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government side will argue that there was an increase in 
defence spending in the last budget, but the fact is all that 
defence increase did was maintain the status quo.  The people at 
national defence headquarters were talking about putting some of 
our brand new frigates alongside, shutting them down, taking the 
crew off and sending them home.  They were talking about reducing 
the size of the army and reducing the size of the reserves.  All 
the increase in the last budget did for the Canadian armed forces 
was to maintain the status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian armed forces needs an injection of about $2 billion 
to meet some of its current objectives.  The Conference of 
Defence Associations said that the Canadian army was only combat 
capable at the company level, which is about 150 troops.  That is 
very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem we are facing is rust out of our equipment in 
the Canadian armed forces.  Last year the auditor general 
determined that equipment requirements of the Canadian Armed 
Forces exceeded the planned budget by $4.5 billion.  We only have 
to look at the situation with the replacement of the Sea King 
helicopter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact today in the House a report was tabled by the Standing 
Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs.  One of the 
recommendations is that government finalize its procurement 
strategy and proceed immediately to tender a contract for the 
replacement of the Sea King helicopter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of that report because it was a unanimous report.  It 
was agreed to by all members of the committee on which I sit as 
vice-chair.  It is very important, but let us look at the 
government's record.  Its white paper in 1994 promised and made 
it policy in 1994 that the Sea King helicopter would be replaced 
by the year 2000. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my recollection we are now six months into the year 2000 
and to date not even the statement of requirements for the new 
Sea King helicopter has been issued to the industry that needs to 
look at it.  It must compete for the tender.  It probably has 12 
to 18 months work just on the contract alone before it gets to 
actually delivering a Sea King.  It will take some three years 
just to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has revised its white paper commitment to the 
Canadian people.  It now says that it will be 2005 before it will 
be able to meet its commitment to replace the Sea King.  All the 
while young Canadians are flying those machines.  It is no joke 
when we hear the people who train the Sea King helicopter pilots 
say that the rule of thumb is only to fly them as high as one 
wants to fall.  That is not funny.  That is a desperate situation 
that has been created by the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2005 those machines will be over 40 years old.  The 
Sea Kings are just one example.  The chief of defence staff 
issued his annual report.  There are three pages of priorities 
for replacing equipment.  It just goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I only have 40 minutes tonight.  I do not want to take up 
the whole time because other members want to speak to the issue, 
but it is an important enough issue that we must talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian armed forces is also faced with the new changing 
world of technology and what is called the integrated battlefield 
as we face the costs related to the revolution of military 
affairs, the RMA.   The Canadian armed forces must do it. 
Otherwise it will be left behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not operate as a single force when we go into Kosovo or 
other theatres of operation.  We go in as part of an 
international group usually through NATO or the UN.  We must be 
interoperable.  We must make sure we can talk to the people.  We 
must make sure that we have the best equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the points we heard reported on in Kosovo with 
our CF-18 pilots.  They did a great job.  They did the best job 
they could with the equipment they had, but let us face it.  The 
onboard computers in our CF-18s have been compared to a Commodore 
64 computer.  Did any member ever have a Commodore 64?  It is old 
stuff.  The CF-18s did not have night vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put our fine pilots in peril each and every time we send them 
on a mission.  Yes, they did a great job, but that is not the 
point.  If we are to send young people out on dangerous missions, 
we had better give them the best possible equipment we can.  We 
in the House have an obligation to ensure that happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area is the national missile defence program.  The 
Liberals are waffling on this issue.  It is vital for Canada to 
support the establishment of an effective NMD system for North 
America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is required for three reasons.  The first is to maintain the 
effectiveness of NORAD, one of our very important bilateral 
defence agreements with our closest ally, the U.S.A. The second 
is to counter ballistic missile threats from rogue states armed 
with weapons of mass destruction.  The international community 
has recognized that ballistic missiles are now a threat to North 
America.  The third is to ensure that Canadian companies can 
benefit from future contracts to develop and improve this system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would argue that the missile defence system will break the 
1972 ABM treaty.  I would submit that ballistic missiles are as 
much a threat to Russians as they are to Americans.   The 
Americans have said on several occasions that technology would be 
shared.  The cold war is over.  There is no reason these type of 
things cannot be shared.  It is not star wars.  The deployment of 
such a system would not destabilize a strategic balance between 
the United States and Russia.  The Liberal government is failing 
to protect Canada's vital interest in ensuring the continued 
effectiveness of NORAD.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason it is very important is that 90% of all Canadians 
live within 500 kilometres of the U.S. border.  If the United 
States says that ballistic missiles are a threat to U.S. 
security, they are also, by extension, a threat to Canadians and 
Canadian security.  We must be a part of that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know hon. members across the way are wanting to go home 
tonight and I know that this is very important meaty stuff.  I 
have but a few more pages to relay to the government before we 
close off and I know other members want to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the reserves.  <I>In Service of the Nation: 
Canada's Citizen Soldiers for the 21st Century</I> is more 
commonly known as the Fraser report just released last week. 
Speaker Fraser used to sit in the House of Commons.  He is a very 
well respected person on military and environmental matters and 
an honorary colonel of one of the units in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fraser states that the militia is currently at less than 60% 
of the strength that was directed by the Liberal government in 
the 1994 white paper.  It is less than 60% of the strength that 
was promised by the Liberal government to Canadians in its 1994 
defence white paper.  The Liberals proposed 23,000 by 1999, of 
which 18,500 were militia.  The militia is the army reserves. Now 
the numbers equal less than 14,500 in the militia, far lower than 
what was promised by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all Canada's allies, excluding Iceland and Luxembourg, Canada 
has the smallest reserve force.  Most of our allies maintain 
reserve forces several times that of their regular forces.  I 
will give the House some examples.  Belgium, with a population of 
10 million, has a regular force of 41,000 and a reserve force of 
152,000 people.  Canada, with a population of 30 million, has a 
regular force of 58,000 and a reserve force of 32,000.  That 
number includes the supplementary ready reserve list, people long 
retired from military service who once a year go in for a medical 
and make sure their uniforms still fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is pretty pathetic, especially when we consider that if 
Canada were ever forced into a situation where it would have to 
mobilize its troops and respond to an international crisis with a 
large number of trained combat capable soldiers, we would not be 
able to do it.  Canada has a four point mobilization plan, but it 
could not get past point number two in the four point plan.  No 
concrete mobilization plan has been put together by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, while Bill S-18 protects our youth by not 
subjecting them to combat situations, from an international point 
of view it is impossible to enforce.  What is truly embarrassing 
and a real shame is the fact that the Liberal government has 
failed to protect those over 18 in the Canadian armed forces and 
reserves through its treatment of inadequate funding of the 
Canadian armed forces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK353"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, very 
young Canadians have no place in combat.  I am sure every member 
of the House would agree that one of the greatest tragedies of 
human history is the death and injury of children due to 
decisions of adults to go to war.  No story, no accounting, no 
photos, no listing of the savaging of our children by war could 
ever begin to encompass this tragedy, for children who are killed 
and injured in war are killed and injured by us as adults and 
especially as federal legislators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are the ones in the country responsible for the actions not 
only of Canada but to some degree of other countries, for it is 
our actions and sometimes even more so our lack of action that 
give silent credence to acts of war and aggression by other 
countries.  Children die as a result.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do more to protect all children in the world. 
Therefore, we should be doing much more to strengthen the 
capacity of UNICEF in particular and the UN in general to have 
greater strength and influence in moving toward an end to both 
the use of children in war—and surely this is the most 
despicable form of the term “use”—and, in turn, the impact of 
war on children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the federal New Democratic Party I stand in support 
of this bill to prevent any person under 18 years of age from 
becoming deployed by the Canadian forces to a theatre of 
hostilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Graca Machel was appalled that Canada, of all countries, had not 
raised the minimum military age to 18.  In September 1998, when 
visiting Canada with her husband, Nelson Mandela, she said “This 
is one of the things that breaks my heart”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While passing this bill is important, Canada should do much 
more.  We should play a much stronger role in working within the 
United Nations to raise to 18 the minimum age of recruitment in 
the convention on the rights of the child.  This age is currently 
set at the absolutely unacceptable age of 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Graca Machel, as part of her work on the global partnership for 
children, stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that world-wide, some 300,000 children world-wide 
are involved in some phase of armed conflict.  And that each year 
between 8,000 and 10,000 children are maimed or killed by 
anti-personnel mines. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a technical point with regard to this bill, I would be 
happier if the bill had said that a person who is under the age 
of 18 may not be deployed by the Canadian forces to any hostility 
or to a theatre of hostilities.  I feel such wording may be more 
encompassing and inclusive; however, I understand that the 
wording used in this bill may in the last instance suffice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation should pass for two reasons:  one, to protect 
our own children and, two, to send a message to the international 
community.  Having said that, I fear that all too often this 
parliament passes motions and bills about which we can feel proud 
and good, but the work stops there.  In this case, passing this 
bill is simply not enough.  We must do more.  For all 
the children who are suffering and who will suffer in war, we should 
be doing much more as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has the opportunity to become a leading character on the 
world stage on this issue.  Failure to support this bill would be 
abominable, but failure to take more action on the world stage 
would be an atrocity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
tonight on behalf of the people of Saint John, New Brunswick, and 
the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to speak in support 
of Bill S-18, an act to amend the National Defence Act with 
respect to the non-deployment of persons under the age of 18 
years to theatres of hostilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few hours ago it was my pleasure to help present an all-party 
unanimous report prepared by the Standing Committee on National 
Defence and Veterans Affairs.  It is the view of our committee 
and all of its members that where it concerns the Canadian forces 
our politics must always be placed on the back burner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-18 may not seem like a very controversial piece of 
legislation, but it is extremely significant to our country, our 
world and our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen firsthand the battlefields of the last century, 
where our young Canadian soldiers gave their lives for our 
country and our freedom.  I had the honour of going to Vimy Ridge 
in France to bring back the remains of the unknown soldier. While 
I was there we went down into one of the trenches.  What did we 
see but a little YMCA mug, a mug where they had picked up all the 
little pieces and put them together.  Yes, one of our young 
persons in the first world war, who was a member of the YMCA, 
went overseas so that we could be here with our freedom today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many of our sons and daughters have been taken from their 
families by war long before their time.  This legislation 
trumpets the end of that old world when our country needed to 
send every able-bodied person it could find, irrespective of age, 
to the front lines of armed conflicts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-18 legislates the current policy and practice of the 
Department of National Defence, where young people—and 18 year 
olds are still children—are not asked to offer their young lives 
to face the dangers and threats we now thankfully see in decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world is still ripe with hostility and anger, but the type 
of warfare and the types of enemies we now face are different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-18 will also put Canada in compliance with the recently 
negotiated optional protocol to the United Nations convention on 
the rights of the child.  The United Nations convention on the 
rights of the child was adopted by the United Nations in 1989 and 
has been ratified by 191 countries.  I am proud that the former 
Conservative government under the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney was 
an important actor in these negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken in this House in the last two nights and I have 
seen a House of Commons seized with issues of political concern 
affecting a small percentage of our country's population.  I am, 
therefore, especially proud to stand here tonight to offer my 
support and the support of the Progressive Conservative Party for 
Bill S-18, as I know that we are doing a great measure of good 
for our nation as a whole and for all of our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House know very well that I had brothers who 
fought in the second world war.  I will never forget the day that 
my five brothers came home.  My mother was standing in the 
kitchen and I was a tiny little girl of six years old.  They said 
“Mom, we all signed up today”.  She looked at them, and I can 
still see her little face when she said “Oh, but not Glenny”, 
and they said “Yes, Mom, Glenny too”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Glenny was my youngest brother.  Glenny would have been one of 
the ones who would have been protected under this act.  He was in 
the armed forces throughout all of the conflict in the second 
world war, but God was kind to us and brought Glenny back home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am so pleased to see Bill S-18 in the House tonight.  Bill 
S-18 will not end war, but it will end war for our young people 
under the age of 18.  It will keep us from placing our youngest 
into harm's way at a time of crisis when our judgment might not 
be the very best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, we may not be doing more here tonight than confirming 
the existing practice of our armed forces, but we may exit these 
doors tonight knowing that what we have done is both noble and 
right for all of our people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
this important amendment to the National Defence Act. This 
amendment will clearly show that the government is concerned 
about the issue of child soldiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recruitment of children for the purpose of sending them to 
war is a problem which cannot be ignored. Statistics on that are 
depressing, and the images regularly shown in the media 
strikingly remind us that we are facing a serious problem with 
regard to human security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last throne speech, the government clearly indicated that 
our foreign policy would put more emphasis on human security. 
Our desire to play a leadership role in the international 
campaign against child soldiers is part of a broader program to 
promote human security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, our Canadian forces recruit young people 
of 16 and 17 years of age, but that is done in a way which is 
fully in line with the protocol. Some may say that we must put 
an end to this kind of recruiting practice. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not necessary or wise.  It is not necessary because, as 
I stated a moment ago, recruitment of 16 and 17 year olds is 
fully in line with the new protocol.  It would not be wise 
because of the benefits these young Canadians derive from their 
attachment to the Canadian forces.  They volunteer because they 
want to serve their country.  They are interested in a career in 
the Canadian forces that will provide them with valuable skills 
and which in some instances will pay for their post-secondary 
education. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of this House can help the cause of child soldiers. They 
can do it by supporting this amendment to the National Defence 
Act, which will make the deployment of children to theatres of 
hostilities illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I explained, this is not done in Canada. Nevertheless, in 
entrenching this policy in law, we are sending a clear message 
to the other members of the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I urge all members to help us by giving their full 
support to this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the constituents of Surrey 
Central and on behalf of the Canadian Alliance to participate in 
the debate on Bill S-18.  The bill originated in the Senate and 
that is why it is numbered S-18.  Usually the bills we debate 
originate in the House of Commons, but the weak, arrogant Liberal 
government which lacks vision did not have the stamina to 
introduce the bill in this House.  The bill started in the other 
house which normally gives sober second thought to what we debate 
here and send there for senators to comment on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government proposes to amend the National Defence 
Act by adding a section declaring that a person who is under the 
age of 18 years may not be deployed by the Canadian forces to a 
theatre of hostilities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports the intent of the bill.  All 
Canadians support protecting our children from harm.  We do not 
like to see children in contact with aggression.  We see this all 
the time in many parts of the world, particularly in the 
developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my eldest son will be 17 years old this year, I can 
understand the state of health, the mental maturity and the views 
of a 17 year old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a nation we feel helpless watching the images of sometimes 
very young children trapped in combat situations.  We have 
watched on TV the young children used or abused in civil wars in 
third world countries, such as in Africa, Liberia, Sierra Leone, 
Rwanda and many other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some kids who are in the combat role cannot even lift the heavy 
weapons they are using.  A loaded AK-47 is too heavy for some of 
the children who are shooting and killing people mercilessly. 
This causes us to want to do something to protect our own 
children in Canada and send a strong message to the rest of the 
world, particularly to the countries I mentioned where the 
children are used and abused in the civil wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sentiment of the bill is understandable.  We do not want 
minors serving in combat.  In that sense, the Alliance agrees 
with the objective of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces has a policy that precludes members under 
the age of 18 from participating in hostilities or from being 
deployed to hostile theatres of operation.  Bill S-18 proposes to 
print this policy in the National Defence Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes that Bill S-18 should be amended 
to say the following, “A person under the age of 18 years may 
not be deployed in a combat unit which has been placed on active 
service and deployed to a theatre of hostilities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Active service under the National Defence Act means service: (a) 
by reason of an emergency, for the defence of Canada; or (b) in 
consequence of any action undertaken by Canada under the United 
Nations Charter, the North Atlantic Treaty or any other similar 
instrument for collective defence that may be entered into by 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ensures that minors will not be deployed in combat but 
still allows for flexibility in employing soldiers in support of 
active operations.  As my hon. colleague from 
Okanagan—Coquihalla has mentioned, soldiers are employed by 
support units like engineering, signals or other support 
activities in defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The genesis of Bill S-18 is an optional protocol that has been 
proposed for adoption at the United Nations.  By the end of this 
year, once this optional protocol is adopted, the United Nations 
will want member countries to sign on.  Clearly, the deployment 
and recruitment practices and policies of the Canadian armed 
forces satisfy the provisions of the United Nations optional 
protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terms of Bill S-18 are left completely undefined.  What 
constitutes a theatre of hostilities?  It is not defined in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the Prime Minister, a theatre of hostilities may be a

in rear area duties in theatres where hostilities may be taking 
place?   Certain terms or definitions in this bill remain 
undefined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I was debating another bill, Bill C-19.  Many terms in 
that bill, even the procedures and rules of evidence, were not 
defined, but the government still rushed it through because it 
did not want to wait.  There will probably be an election so it 
wanted to do something in a rush without properly monitoring and 
taking care that the bill would serve its intended purpose. It 
tried to put the horse before the cart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that again here in this one line bill.  There are no 
details and no definitions.  If we are going to expand the 
reserves, we should not place artificial and ill-defined 
restrictions on the use of personnel in theatres of operation. 
We should try to convince the government to amend the bill to say 
that a person under the age of 18 years may not be deployed in a 
combat unit which has been placed on active service and deployed 
to a theatre of hostilities.  This would ensure that minors would 
not be deployed in combat, but would still allow for flexibility 
in employing soldiers in support of active operations.
