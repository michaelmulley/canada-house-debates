RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Yesterday the hon. member for 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville rose in the House to 
address the question of personal privilege which he previously 
raised on February 15 and subsequently withdrew. The hon. 
member claimed, at that time, that his ability to function as a 
member of Parliament had been impeded. He shared with the 
House a series of events relating to his academic credentials and 
qualifications, comments made about him by the media, as well 
as a threat by an anonymous telephone caller.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	Let me begin my ruling by defining for the House just what 
constitutes parliamentary privilege. Erskine May in 
<I>Parliamentary Practice</I>, 21st Edition, page 69, defines privilege 
as:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-The sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed by each House collectively- and 
by Members of each House individually, without which they could not 
discharge their functions, and which exceed those possessed by other bodies or 
individuals. Thus privilege, though part of the law of the land, is to a certain 
extent an exemption from the general law. Certain rights and immunities such as 
freedom from arrest or freedom of speech belong primarily to individual 
Members of each House and exist because the House cannot perform its 
functions without unimpeded use of the services of its Members-.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When any of these rights and immunities is disregarded or attacked, the 
offence is called a breach of privilege and is punishable under the law of 
Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Pursuant to our practice and convention, when the Speaker 
rules on a matter of privilege all that is being decided is whether 
the facts and evidence laid before the House are, in a prima facie 
case, sufficient to allow the usual motion to be proposed and 
debated over all other business leading to a decision of the 
House thereon. This is clearly explained in Beauchesne 6th 
Edition, citation 26:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) A question of privilege- is a question partly of fact and partly of law-the 
law of contempt of Parliament-and is a matter for the House to determine. The 
decision of the House on a question of privilege, like every other matter which the 
House has to decide, can be elicited only by a question put from the Chair by the 
Speaker and resolved either in the affirmative or in the negative, and this question 
is necessarily founded on a motion made by a Member.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) It follows that though the Speaker can rule on a question of order, the 
Speaker cannot rule on a question of privilege. When a question of privilege is 
raised the Speaker's function is limited to deciding whether the matter is of such a 
character as to entitle the motion, which the Member who has raised the question 
desires to move, to priority over the Orders of the Day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In other words my duty as Speaker is to decide whether the 
hon. member for Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville has 
presented sufficient argument to convince me that debate on his 
situation should take precedence over all other House business, 
and that the House should therefore consider the matter 
immediately.
<P>
	In coming to my decision on this matter I have reviewed the 
decisions of many former Speakers.
<P>
	Speaker Jerome in dealing with a similar case on June 23, 
1977 ruled that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the protection of an elected person against unwarranted or intemperate 
publicity, even abuses or defamatory publicity, is precisely that which is 
enjoyed by every citizen before our courts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	He went on to add that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As elected people we can and do expect to be the targets of attack. When those 
attacks seem offensive I think it is appropriate the Hon. Member is offered the 
courtesy of the House to extend to his hon. colleagues an explanation of the 
circumstances.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	He concluded that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-when these matters do take place, if they go beyond the point of being 
offensive to the point of being defamatory in a legal sense, certainly members 
ought to and will I am sure pursue matters through the courts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Speaker Jerome ruled there was no prima facie privilege in 
that instance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2706"> 2706 </A></B>
<P>
	A further case was raised on September 19, 1973. At that time 
the member for High Park-Humber Valley stated that he had 
received anonymous telephone calls warning him to cease 
raising questions on a certain subject. He suggested these calls 
amounted to attempts to intimidate him and prevent him from 
carrying out his duties as a member.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Speaker Lamoureux in ruling on the matter stated the 
following:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The House will appreciate there is some difficulty in finding a prima facie case 
of privilege in circumstances where no charge has been made and there has been 
no suggestion in the House of any irregularity or impropriety. There is really 
nothing for the House or one of its committees to consider under the heading of 
privilege.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	He further stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am sure the hon. member for High Park-Humber Valley does not suggest 
that his conduct should be sent to the committee for consideration or 
investigation by it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-The hon. member has indicated what the facts of the situation are- I 
suggest that nothing at all would be gained by having a debate, either in the 
House or in a committee, on the matter raised by the hon. member for High 
Park-Humber Valley.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To return to the present case, I have carefully reviewed the 
statement made by the hon. member for 
Markam-Whitchurch-Stouffville. Threats of blackmail or 
intimidation of a member of Parliament should never be taken 
lightly. When such occurs, the very essence of free speech is 
undermined. Without the guarantee of freedom of speech, no 
member of Parliament can do his duty as is expected.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While the Chair does not in any way make light of the 
specifics that have been raised by the hon. member for 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville, I cannot, however, say 
that he has sufficiently demonstrated that a case of intimidation 
exists such that his ability to function as a member of Parliament 
has been impeded. I cannot therefore find prima facie privilege 
at this time.

	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> 
Madam Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 32(2), I have the 
honour to present to the House, in both official languages, the 
report entitled ``Guiding Principles and Operational Policies for 
Parks Canada''.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Following the tabling of this document, I will make a 
ministerial statement to inform members of this House of the 
government's vision regarding the future of national parks and 
historic sites, as well as the promotion and development of our 
identity and national heritage.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, this is a special day for all Canadians. With 
the tabling of the Parks Canada ``Guiding Principles and 
Operating Policies'', yet another step is taken in entrenching 
and securing the national heritage of Canada.
<P>
	It is a rare day in any democracy when a minister can table 
principles and policies for a nation in the full knowledge that 
two other colleagues now sitting on the side opposite have 
participated in their formulation.
<P>
	I would like to acknowledge the roles played by the Leader of 
the Opposition, the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean, and the 
hon. member for Sherbrooke, now the leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party. To have such a consensus regarding a policy 
is a rare occurrence indeed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As Canadians, we value our freedom, our clean environment, 
the beauty and natural wilderness and the paths of human 
endeavour which have brought us to where we are today. The 
sense of wonder and reverence we feel as we learn about past 
human activities that have laid the foundation of our country 
stimulate a profound concern for ensuring the survival of 
historic places, artefacts and structures.
<P>
	Despite pressures on our environment and on our heritage 
resources Canadians should be assured that our national parks 
and national historic sites will be protected and well managed 
for future generations to enjoy. Our national parks and national 
historic sites will not be worn down or worn out through overuse 
or neglect.
<P>
	Of course since the last policy statement in 1979 there has 
been a greater sense of urgency in the Canadian public on 
environmental, ecological and heritage matters. There has been 
a swell of public sentiment nationally and internationally creat-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2708"> 2708 </A></B>
<P>
ing an expectation of leadership  in the care of the environment 
and preservation of natural and cultural heritage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	According to recent surveys, 90 per cent of Canadians want to 
have more information about our country's history. The national 
historic sites and related heritage programs go a long way 
toward filling this knowledge gap.
<P>
	Each year, one-third of Canadians travel to participate in 
heritage activities across the country. Canada's national parks 
and national historic sites are cornerstones of our domestic and 
international tourism industry. More than 30,000 jobs are 
associated with Canada's national parks and historic sites. They 
make a contribution to our national economy in excess of one 
billion dollars per year.
<P>
	Parks Canada, through its application of the principles and 
policies, will maintain the integrity of natural and cultural 
heritage, while ensuring that parks and sites continue to play a 
major role in the local, regional and national economy. It will do 
this by ensuring that the management decisions affecting these 
special places are made on sound and scientifically based 
knowledge.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The programs administered by Parks Canada will continue to 
have positive impacts on local communities. They will create 
jobs and assist sustainable land use and ecotourism.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	Highlights of the new Parks Canada policy include:
<P>
	First, an update of the Parks Canada mandate to include its 
responsibilities for national parks, national historic sites, 
historic canals, heritage railway stations, Canada's heritage 
rivers, marine conservation areas and federal heritage 
buildings;
<P>
	Second, guiding principles stressing that natural and historic 
qualities will be maintained, that Canadians will be involved 
and consulted, and that an orderly framework is provided for the 
addition of new heritage areas; and
<P>
	Third, a renewed emphasis placed upon partnership and 
co-operation with other levels of government, communities and 
the private sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This does not mean shifting the responsibility for preserving 
and creating Canada's heritage to others. Our history, traditions, 
and the environment require partnerships for implementation of 
successful heritage programs and, ultimately, a stronger 
leadership role for Parks Canada, nationally and internationally, 
that will demonstrate and advocate environmental and heritage 
ethics and practices.
<P>
	National parks and national historic sites are symbols of the 
Canadian identity and make all Canadians proud. In fact, I am 
making this speech in what is designated as one of Canada's 
national historic sites. And next to the Parliament buildings is 
one of the ends of the Rideau Canal, one of Canada's heritage 
waterways, administered by Parks Canada and subject to these 
new policies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On that positive note I conclude my remarks on the Parks 
Canada guiding principles and operating policies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity, as we 
debate Parks Canada ``Guiding Principles and Operating 
Policies'' tabled today in this House, to reaffirm that the Bloc 
Quebecois will spare no effort to ensure that the beauty of 
Quebec's and Canada's wilderness is preserved.
<P>
	The minister was so kind as to remind the people of Quebec 
and Canada what a key, positive role the Leader of the 
Opposition has played in protecting our national heritage, and I 
thank him for that.
<P>
	But the minister is no doubt aware that the Bloc Quebecois 
does not intend to just stand by if the government is remiss in 
preserving the cultural heritage of Quebec and Canada. I am 
convinced that, now more than ever, he knows that the Bloc 
Quebecois will be every bit as vigilant with respect to natural 
heritage.
<P>
	When the Leader of the Opposition was minister of the 
environment, he stated and I quote: ``One of the areas in which 
the department is involved that I always find rewarding is the 
parks system. Parks Canada represents such beauty and positive 
things and is such a success that it is always encourages me to 
carry out my duties. It is one of Canada's greatest achievements, 
one which is recognized throughout the world. People must 
realize that our parks system is not only a beautiful sight for us. 
Other countries envy our national parks system''.
<P>
	In fact, Canada with its parks system is considered as a leader 
by conservation agencies world-wide. It is fitting for Parks 
Canada to be a source of inspiration for all future Canadian 
environmental policies.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will make sure that the government 
fulfils its commitment to implement the concept of sustainable 
development, as stated in the final report of the World 
Commission on Environment and Development, the Brundtland 
Report, entitled ``Our Common Future''.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that, based on the concept of 
sustainable development, economic development must be 
compatible with the long-term preservation of unmanaged 
ecosystems and survival processes. In Quebec and Canada, we 
have known for over a century that this wilderness must be 
preserved, not only for its unmistakable aesthetic beauty, but 
also because of the causal relationship to be made between what 
we do in that area and the benefits to be derived in terms of the 
environment.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="2709"> 2709 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	We therefore had to reconcile tourism and economic 
development with environmental protection. Parks must be 
developed to create jobs in tourism, of course, but never at the 
expense of future generations.
<P>
	As you know, there is still a lot to do. The national park 
network must be completed. Canada's 39 ecoregions attest to its 
riches and diversity. It would therefore be advisable to establish 
a park representing every ecoregion.
<P>
	We will improve and extend the national park network and 
pay particular attention to the protection of the Arctic 
environment. As you know, some planned park sites in the 
Arctic had to be given up because of mining concessions. We 
must take environmental repercussions into account every time 
a government project or program is undertaken.
<P>
	Thousands of jobs are tied to the preservation of this natural 
heritage. We must also ensure that these sites are impeccably 
managed, that expenditures are justified, and that includes 
official residences, of course.
<P>
	Finally, we emphasize the minister's commitment regarding 
partnership and co-operation with other levels of government. 
As he probably knows, Quebec did not get its fair share of 
national parks. The government must step up its efforts to give 
Quebec its fair share while respecting its prerogatives and 
priorities.
<P>
	The government must resolve all jurisdictional conflicts by 
co-operating with Quebec, the other provinces and the 
territories, particularly by taking into account the concerns of 
local communities. It must seek the direct involvement of 
Natives when it is needed.
<P>
	In closing, regarding Parks Canada's updated mandate, may I 
remind you that the Bloc Quebecois is happy that the mandate 
has been updated and that the ten guidelines on protecting our 
historic and natural heritage are being tabled today. We will, of 
course, examine this document carefully.
<P>
	Finally, let us recall that this work was undertaken at the 
Department of the Environment under the leadership of the 
Opposition Leader when he was minister. He put his stamp of 
quality on it. His successor only has to follow in his footsteps.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I too would like to congratulate the hon. Minister of 
Canadian Heritage on his presentation of the Parks Canada 
guiding principles and operating policies. It is a result of a much 
needed process. We agree that with the stress on the preservation 
of the natural and cultural heritage and the care of our 
environment, it is now of all times crucial to Canada to have 
fresh insight into our identity and our vision as a country. This 
indeed will be inspired by a fresh appreciation of our lands and 
the recognition of the importance of exploring and  developing, 
renewing and conserving our natural resources and the physical 
environment.
<P>
	Any discussion of the management and preservation of our 
natural heritage though leads us to the complex relationship of 
the healthy environment and the human activity that must go 
around that relationship. Federal leadership is necessary in the 
integration of the economic, the human and the environmental 
factors.
<P>
	I suggest three considerations should be kept in mind: First, 
the development of the ideas and the directions of this proposal 
must be a balanced approach with equal weight in any decision 
given to the economic, the social and the technical 
considerations. Second, the operational and management 
decisions of any mandate should be based on sound management 
philosophies, structures, procedures and planning. Third, the 
very great importance of communication and partnership with 
any mandate with all provincial governments equally, with 
private industry, with educational institutions and the public 
itself to maximize the benefits to all of these.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	Parks Canada now has a mandate that should be an example of 
environmental stewardship and of economic stewardship both 
nationally and internationally because as we seek to serve all 
Canadian taxpayers, we need wise management. Those 
Canadians are wage earners and consumers, therefore we need 
consideration for jobs and resource management. Those 
Canadians are citizens of a proud country that has been blessed 
with a rich heritage and with amazing beauty.
<P>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">*  *  * </H4>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ELECTORALBOUNDARIESREADJUSTMENTSUSPENSIONACT">ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES READJUSTMENT 
SUSPENSION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from March 21, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-18, an act to suspend the operation of the 
Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
finished my speech the other night at 6.42 and I am certainly 
open to questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest the other night to the speech of the 
hon. member for Beaver River who talked extensively about her 
riding. We all remember the time she was first elected in the 
House to represent the new riding of Beaver River. I had the 
honour of being her assistant at that time and of assisting her in 
planting the flag of Reform in the House of Commons. That was 
a momentous day. Obviously she feels very strongly about  some 
of the proposed changes under the current scheme for her riding.
<P>
	I was concerned during her speech on Monday. Some 
comments were hurled across the way which maybe do not 
appear in the <I>Hansard</I> transcript. They really raised questions 
about the partisanship or lack of partisanship and integrity of 
Elections Canada and its senior officials. There were a number 
of comments hurled across the way to the effect that Elections 
Canada was a partisan body. Its members have strong 
affiliations to another political party which is no longer 
recognized in the House.
<P>
	The hon. member for Beaver River has been a member since 
1989. She has run in two elections and a byelection. Could she 
comment at some length on her experiences with Elections 
Canada as a candidate and as a lone member of Parliament for a 
good deal of time? Did she find that Elections Canada was a 
partisan organization, that it had that kind of orientation, or was 
she happy with her dealings with that organization as an 
independent member and now as a Reform member?
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey (Beaver River):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his remarks. It is nice to have him as a colleague 
again in the House of Commons, this time as a fellow member of 
Parliament.
<P>
	He has asked me to address the issue of how I feel about 
Elections Canada. Before I answer the question I might just 
answer how I felt about some of the remarks that were being 
hurled across the House. I suppose I was partly amused but also 
partly saddened by the consistent comments of the member for 
Vancouver South. He kept saying loudly across the House as I 
was speaking the other night: ``I will lose my riding as well. It is 
not just Beaver River that is going to be dismantled''. The 
member for Vancouver South was saying that his riding would 
also be dismantled.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	That is all well and fine, but we need to draw the distinction in 
the House that it could be one reason the government is trying to 
ram the bill through so quickly, because he stands to lose his 
seat. I am in the position of standing to lose my constituency as 
well. In other words I will not have a place to run in the next 
election if I choose to run again.
<P>
	That is why I think it is more important for someone in this 
party who stands to lose a constituency not to be so self-serving 
as to say: ``Yes, let us put the whole process off''. Then I would 
be serving my own interests and saying: ``Whew, I am safe. I can 
carry on''. There is a real discrepancy when someone from the 
other side was hollering: ``I will lose my seat''. It would be 
perfectly natural then for him to support his government on 
railroading the bill through Parliament and putting the whole 
process on hold. There is a real difference of opinion there. As a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2712"> 2712 </A></B>
<P>
matter of principle I am against it even though I stand to lose as 
well through this process.
<P>
	My dealings with Elections Canada have always been very 
good. I have run in two general federal elections as well as one 
byelection in the spring of 1989. Even though I was treated as 
somebody who was almost literally a kook in western Canada 
because I represented a new political party that nobody had ever 
heard about and nobody knew anything about it, I must say the 
people at Elections Canada were most fair with me in the general 
election of 1988 and in the byelection of 1989 when we 
surprised Elections Canada and the whole country of Canada 
from sea to sea when I took 50 per cent of the vote.
<P>
	Since then obviously my party has gained a great deal of 
strength and steam across the country. When I ran as only one of 
200 and some candidates in the general election of 1993 we had 
undergone the process which is very general and very basic. 
People were appointed as returning officers in their 
constituencies. We underwent that in Beaver River because the 
previous returning officer had retired. We were subject to a new 
returning officer, Mr. Lorne Assheton-Smith from St. Paul. 
Those are political appointments, as we all know. I will send this 
comment in Hansard to Mr. Lorne Assheton-Smith, the 
returning officer from Elections Canada in Beaver River, 
indicating that he treated me fairly as a candidate and I have 
absolutely no criticism whatsoever of Elections Canada.
<P>
	The criticism I would have is not of the whole situation. 
Maybe it is political to an extent with the Electoral Boundaries 
Commission, but the question on everybody's lips is: if they 
think they are replacing Tory hacks with something better, 
heaven help government members who are ramrodding the 
legislation through. They will do so at their own peril if they 
replace them with hacks of another political party who they 
think might serve their interests better. I think all of us would be 
ashamed to see that happen.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State 
(Parliamentary Affairs)): </B>Madam Speaker, I can assure the 
hon. member for Beaver River that we certainly will not do what 
she assumes we will do when it is time to appoint people to these 
commissions, because this is a very independent process, and 
we certainly intend to abide by this principle.
<P>
	However, if I remember correctly what she said in her speech 
a few days ago, she did not entirely agree with the current 
process. She also said that in her presentation to the 
commissions, she would also express her dissatisfaction and 
mention certain changes she would like to see.
<P>
	She invited her constituents to do likewise. The hon. member 
must know that the commission appointed to review the 
boundaries of her electoral district does exactly that, in other 
words, it receives submissions on new or existing boundaries 
and is not at all concerned with the current process.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	My point is that if the hon. member comments on the process, 
it will be a waste of time. Giving hon. members an opportunity 
to do so, and the public as well, because the committee that 
reviews the entire process will certainly ask members of the 
public to come and testify, is the whole purpose of this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Madam Speaker, we are talking about particulars 
the commission has come up with. Yes, I make no bones about it. 
I think there are real weaknesses in that and I think Beaver River 
deserves a longer life than it has had.
<P>
	As I mentioned in my remarks the other day, it was a brand 
new constituency in 1988. Will it just evaporate into thin air? I 
do have problems with that. We have had negotiations with the 
government but I have no guarantees. What guarantee do I have 
that the system the government is talking about will be better? It 
has not given us any options. It has not said that it wants to move 
in this direction.
<P>
	Yes, it makes me nervous. I am not going to sign on to 
something with my party and say: ``Sure, let us come up with 
something that may be just as politically motivated''. Canadians 
would be really frustrated with that. Even though I am frustrated 
with the proposals that are in place and I said that I would be 
going to the hearings, I suspect now I am not going to have a 
chance when I see the government bringing in time allocation. If 
it is talking about the process it wants to take part in being so 
important, why do we need to have it shot through Parliament 
faster than the speed of light?
<P>
	I sat in the House and my friend from the riding of Kamloops 
has sat here too, listening to dozens upon dozens of members 
who are on the government side now screaming against the 
Tories last time all the dreadful things about time allocation. I 
can hardly believe it when I look across the aisle now. Is this the 
most important thing in Canada right now? Is this what this 
government is going to be proud of down the road? Will it be 
saying: ``This is what we forced time allocation on. The biggest 
issue of the day was electoral boundaries''? I hardly think so.
<P>
	I wanted a guarantee that some better process would be in 
place. If this is going to take place, as I suspect the government 
will be ramming it through, I would like a guarantee as a 
Canadian citizen and as a member of Parliament in the House 
that whatever changes the government makes it may grandfather 
them and put them into the life of the next Parliament after this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2713"> 2713 </A></B>
<P>
one so its fingerprints will not be all over it as the author of 
perhaps what might be its own demise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to 
make sure the preachers on that side of the House have the 
benefit of what I have to say. Unlike the last two occasions I 
certainly hope they will actually ask me some questions.
<P>
	Just to touch on the comments of the member for Beaver 
River, she said she was amused and saddened. She wants a 
guarantee that whatever the government comes up with will be 
better. That is what the bill embarks on.
<P>
	Let me say to the member that the reason we have to deal with 
the issue this week given our recess is that if we do not do so we 
will put in place a very costly process of having reviews on 
boundaries that will not decrease the number of seats in the 
House or maintain the number of seats in the House but will 
increase the number of seats in the House by a total of six. I say 
that because much is being said by the big R Reformers about 
this bill being rammed through. What we have is a filibuster. 
The local media in my community was very upset by what was to 
transpire even though under the present situation Ontario would 
gain four more seats. We want to look at the number of seats in 
this Chamber. I can tell members that we should have the 
opportunity to do that.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	We do not get the light every day on this side of the House. 
Therefore we are unable to take a complex issue such as this and 
give the members from the big <I>R</I> Reform Party assurance that we 
can do it that speedily. We will send the bill to committee where 
the members of the Reform Party can come forward as well as 
every other member in every party in the House. They will be 
able to bring us the reaction of their constituents. They will be 
able to ask some of their constituents to be witnesses and over a 
period of time we will come up with something better.
<P>
	As I was looking at making a presentation today, I took the 
opportunity to review what all members who spoke on the issue 
had to say this past Monday. I can tell members that I feel 
somewhat amused on the one hand and saddened on the other.
<P>
	It never ceases to amaze me how the members of the big <I>R</I> 
Reform Party, the ones that always preach free votes go ahead 
and do the opposite and vote as a block. One would think they 
were tied together with Krazy glue. Perhaps when they go 
through the exercise of coming up with a code of conduct, one of 
the things they will definitely do is use Krazy glue.
<P>
	Watching them in the House, I am very much reminded of 
another great neo-Conservative, Margaret Thatcher, who is 
passé now. I am reminded of another person. The Reform Party 
members very much have a soulmate in the former President of 
the United States, Ronald Reagan. He got elected promising to 
cut the deficit and the debt. Of course the United States of 
America became the biggest lender nation in the world  when the 
new right took control as the Reform dream about. He took the 
country from the biggest lender to the biggest debtor. However 
something that Ronald Reagan said is applicable here. It is that 
phrase he always used so well, ``there they go again''.
<P>
	Any time I review debates by the Reform Party that certainly 
is the impression I get, there they go again. Let them preach. Let 
them be sanctimonious. Do not give credit on any of the 
initiatives.
<P>
	When I reviewed the debates one of the things I found was that 
for the most part they admitted they do not want to change the 
size of the House of Commons.
<P>
	Interestingly enough, there was not one person who would 
support it because if we stay with the status quo, we will 
definitely change the House of Commons by six members which 
will cost us a million dollars a member. If one starts multiplying 
$6 million by 10 years one has $60 million. Then one continues 
on and keeps adding members to the House of Commons.
<P>
	Certainly that was not what my constituents told me they 
wanted to see done. My constituents told me they want us to do 
more with less and to make the House operate more effectively.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	Let us be very clear we are talking about ramrodding a bill, 
and we are talking about that. If we did not use time allocation 
on the bill, we would not have the opportunity to change those 
costly hearings that are going to take so much time and energy 
on the part of Canadians. I think that is an important point to 
know.
<P>
	The suggestion has been made that the bill by the government 
came through the back rooms of the Liberal caucus, that it did 
not see the light of day with constituents, that somehow it was 
all politically manipulated.
<P>
	As soon as the electoral boundaries readjustment proposal for 
the province of Ontario was put in place I received numerous 
calls from constituents. I have had discussions with people 
representing local governments. I was in the process of drafting 
a private member's bill on this issue which called for 
representations by members of the House of Commons without 
increasing the total number of members. I was reflecting what 
my constituents were telling me which was restricting the 
number to at least the present size.
<P>
	We also wanted to talk about making sure that the community 
of interest represented by ridings was maintained. When I read 
through the debates, I noted that the member for Beaver River 
said that her riding would disappear and it only had the 
opportunity to go through two elections.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2714"> 2714 </A></B>
<P>
	I read some other contributions from members of the Reform 
Party who said that there is not one Canadian, not one 
constituent that is upset with the proposals. I have to tell them 
that they are wrong.
<P>
	Back on December 17 the local paper, the 
Kitchener-Waterloo <I>Record</I> stated in a story ``if you live in 
Kitchener, Waterloo or Cambridge and think you have trouble 
now figuring out who your MP is, just wait until the new election 
if proposed riding boundary changes come into effect.
<P>
	If the changes proposed by the Federal Election Boundaries 
Commission for Ontario are accepted parts of Kitchener will be 
tacked on to Waterloo riding, parts of Waterloo will be attached 
to a largely rural riding, North Dumfries will be cut away from 
Cambridge and part of Cambridge riding that used to be part of 
the Kitchener riding will go back to Kitchener''. I am going to 
spare you by not reading the whole story but it goes on and on.
<P>
	Let me talk about what some of the civic leaders have to say. 
Waterloo Mayor Brian Turnbull said he is really disappointed in 
a redistribution that would see a large part of the city included in 
largely a rural riding that has no historical ties to this part of the 
province.
<P>
	Woolwich township Mayor Bob Waters said he intends to 
fight redistribution. I was talking to Mayor Lynn Myers of 
Wilmot township which by the way was taken out from the 
Waterloo region in the last redistribution process. I would like to 
see a joint submission.
<P>
	Now what did Mayor Myers say, whose riding was taken out 
of the Waterloo region? Lynn Myers bluntly said ``Wilmot is not 
happy in the riding of Perth-Wellington-Waterloo''. Now he 
is worried about being lumped into a new urban riding that has 
no natural ties, has an unholy alliance and it would be an 
unhistoric alliance. He said that ever since redistribution he 
hated every minute of it. That certainly is reflective of many of 
the constituents involved.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	There was a story in the K-W <I>Record</I> yesterday that headlined 
that Reform is filibustering, which is exactly what they are 
doing. The editorial reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Common sense does take hold in Ottawa from time to time. Thank goodness it 
has finally asserted itself over the issue of federal electoral redistribution. The 
public is in no mood to pay millions of dollars to implement new boundaries 
that, as far as the Waterloo region is concerned, make no sense. Nor are people 
eager to shell out more money to expand the number of members of Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The ruling Liberals have wisely asked the Bloc Quebecois and Reform Party 
to consider a joint suspension of redistribution until a parliamentary panel can 
study the desired size of the House and the number of seats for each province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It certainly does not sound like a community where nobody is 
upset.
<P>
	I know my friends in the Reform Party like petitions. We have 
thousands of signatures on a petition which supports the 
proposals in my private member's bill. As this thing goes 
through over the course of the next two years there will be, I dare 
say, thousands and thousands more. Who knows, maybe the 
members of the Reform are just waiting for that one phone call 
from a Canadian to be inspired. Maybe one Canadian will phone 
and inspire them to start thinking about the issue, start thinking 
about the actions we are taking today.
<P>
	I would like to reiterate this because I think it is important. If 
we did not act this week we would have those costly and useless 
hearings held, if it were ever suspended, which would 
inconvenience civic politicians, citizens and certainly every 
member of the Chamber would be spending time at those 
hearings.
<P>
	Therefore, it is not a question of whether we agree with the 
electoral commission in the sense that we think it did a good job. 
Given its mandate it has no choice in holding the line on the 
seats in the House of Commons. That is not an option. That 
option belongs to politicians.
<P>
	I despair to a large extent when I listen to the member for 
Beaver River. She talked about the dirty fingerprints of 
politicians. Every member of the House is a politician. Some 
would like to be preachers and have their Sunday sermons and 
others would like to spend their time on codes of conduct, but 
Canadians elected them to bring their best judgment here. They 
were elected as politicians. I can only say to them that by forever 
questioning the ethics of this Chamber they do a great disservice 
to this Chamber which is the greatest Chamber of debate in the 
country.
<P>
	I do not know what happens in the strategy room of the 
Reform Party but I do know what happens in caucus at the 
Liberal Party. First, let me state that in the Liberal Party we do 
not spend our time looking at codes of conduct for our members. 
There is the assumption that we are equal and that we know how 
to run our lives. We do not pretend to be holier than the average 
citizen. We are here to try to reflect and represent this country. I 
hear my friends say that we should.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Let the Reform Party be unanimous in their code of ethics. Let 
them have a free and open debate on it. We would be very much 
entertained. I am sure it would remind us of the great Jimmy 
Swaggart hour on Sunday mornings.
<P>
	I mentioned before that funny things happen during election 
campaigns. In my riding of Waterloo a person who ran for city 
council and did not succeed-actually he came after me in the 
election-was a Reform candidate. This individual now fills my 
seat on Waterloo city council.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2715"> 2715 </A></B>
<P>
	I have a great deal of respect for him. I could not quite 
understand what happened to him that he was a Reform 
candidate. Certainly some of the things he said did not make a 
great deal of sense.
<P>
	However he has supported the infrastructure program for the 
city of Waterloo. He found good reasons to support it because he 
saw that the work being done was good for the community and 
good for the country.
<P>
	Let me share this with you. It was moved by Councillor 
Connolly, seconded by Councillor Hoddle at the February 21 
meeting of council in Waterloo, that the present 
recommendations of the Federal Elections Boundary 
Commission for Ontario, of boundary changes to ridings in the 
Waterloo region be redrawn and new boundaries be discussed 
with all Waterloo regional municipalities and its members of 
Parliament to arrive at a solution that keeps our region in tact. It 
was passed unanimously.
<P>
	Therefore there is a great deal of support for what this 
government is doing. If we did not have to forever listen to and 
argue with members on the preaching of sanctimony versus 
reason we could have a committee composed of members of the 
House of Commons. In the period of two years we could 
certainly come up with something better. In that way this House 
would work much, much better.
<P>
	I am supporting this bill because not to do so would mean 
supporting the status quo. That is why I call them big <I>R</I> 
Reformers; they do not act like reformers even though they call 
themselves Reformers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena):</B> Madam Speaker, I heard the hon. 
member casting disparaging remarks about the Reform Party. 
He likens us to Ronald Reagan who was elected as President of 
the United States on the promise of reducing the deficit and 
trying to get the massive debt under control.
<P>
	There is a different system of government in Canada from 
what the Americans have in the United States. In Canada the 
executive branch and the legislative branch sit together whereas 
Mr. Reagan had to contend with the Democrats who dominated 
the Congress. In this government and in this Parliament the 
executive and the legislative branches are one and the same. 
Therefore they have much more power and ability to deal with 
deficits and debt than Mr. Reagan did.
<P>
	Does the member recognize and acknowledge that fact?
<P>
	I listened to the hon. member's remarks on fighting 
redistribution and heard that there was an uproar in his 
constituency over this proposed redistribution. I do not hear that 
uproar in my riding nor do I hear it in Canada. I do not see it on 
the front pages of the newspapers; I do not hear it being 
discussed. I continue to believe mightily it is an issue for 
members of Parliament much more so than it is an issue for 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	I agree that one issue which is important to Canadians is the 
expenditure of money. The almost $5 million which has been 
spent to date will be lost if this government motion succeeds.
<P>
	Furthermore, if the government is serious about capping the 
number of seats then why is it not clearly stated in the bill that 
the number of seats will be capped? If that were stated, the bill 
would probably have the support of the Reform Party but it is 
not. There is just a vague acknowledgement that the steadily 
increasing number of MPs will be looked at, but there is no 
commitment to stop it.
<P>
	I ask the member for his comments on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Madam Speaker, I certainly know of the 
separation of powers in the United States of America. I also have 
had the good fortune to read the book by the leader of the Reform 
Party. I certainly understand there is a close attachment to the 
new conservatism that has died out in Great Britain and the 
United States. Certainly the president had a great deal of 
monetary policies to do with the incredible increase in the debt 
of the United States. Let us be very clear on that.
<P>
	The other point raised suggests that I cast aspersions that were 
demeaning to the Reformers. I get <I>Quorum</I> like everybody else 
and I see reference to their code of conduct. There is a member 
of Parliament who refuses to dine alone with a woman even on a 
professional basis. Another columnist talks about the pious 
Reform caucus with a score of MPs more righteous and apt at 
sermonising than Preston Manning. Another columnist writes 
that now some holier than thou Reformers are putting together 
their own code of behaviour. Who am I to say? I just read it and 
some of it must be correct.
<P>
	I have nothing against Reformers personally. Mr. Connolly 
was a candidate against me in the last election. We got along 
great on many issues and personally we get along very well, but 
something does happen when they get into that group, close the 
doors and decide on debate.
<P>
	The member also raised the matter of money. He said that $5 
million had already been spent. That is correct, but if we 
continue with this process we are going to spend $3 million 
more. If we put in six new members of Parliament we are going 
to spend $6 million more every year.
<P>
	If we continue with the process in the longer term we are 
going to keep adding members to the House of Commons. We 
would be knocking out those walls and the Reformers would 
need binoculars to see the Speaker. Therefore time is of the 
essence. We have to deal with this issue very quickly. However I 
will be fighting very strongly to maintain the number of 
members of Parliament at 295.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2716"> 2716 </A></B>
<P>
	I mentioned the subject of my private member's bill. I am 
willing to have everybody in this House and in committee sit 
down to see how we can improve this place to better reflect the 
constituents whom we represent. This must be dealt with in a 
serious fashion. It must not be used as an opportunity to 
filibuster. My wish and my hope is that we will come up with a 
bill that is a great improvement over the one we presently have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> It always makes me wonder 
when a member of the House stands up and criticizes other 
parties and other members as to what their motivation is rather 
than defending the bill his party has put forward.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	It reminds me of question period when the Official Opposition 
presses the government too closely on an issue. It continues to 
drag up the old story that the Leader of the Official Opposition 
was a member of the former government. Whenever that 
happens it tells me that they are getting close to something the 
government does not want to discuss and the pressure is being 
placed on it by the Official Opposition.
<P>
	When the member stands up and spends at least 50 per cent of 
his time criticizing the Reform Party it makes me wonder what 
he is afraid of. If the big <I>R</I> Reform movement in his constituency 
is not already pressing him a little too closely, four years from 
now he really will have something to worry about.
<P>
	Nevertheless if this bill contained the means by which the 
number of members in this House would be capped, then as my 
colleague who asked the question before me stated there would 
be support for that in the Reform Party caucus. That is what we 
stand for. We do not need more representation across this 
country; we need better representation, representation that we 
have not received from either the Liberal or the Tory 
governments.
<P>
	When we talk about debt it is his government that began that 
enormous slide into the debt hole. It left us with over $200 
billion and another $300 billion was added by the Tory 
government. Now we are at a point where organizations like the 
Fraser Institute will not advise us. They say we may have gone 
too far and we may face a debt crisis that is beyond our control.
<P>
	Will the member address the reason the capping of the number 
of members in this House is not within the bill itself. To me it is a 
farce when he stands up and talks about capping the number of 
members in this House because it ought to be in the bill but is 
not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Madam Speaker, we do not govern by divine 
right. We are mortals. We on this side of the House recognize 
that anyway.
<P>
	We understand it takes time to put a bill together that will 
stand up to the scrutiny of time. That is what we are doing. We 
are starting the process toward it. Many members in my caucus 
and I very much wish that is what we are going to be looking to 
do.
<P>
	We can possibly come up with a plan saying that for whatever 
constitutional consideration and to recognize some of those 
agreements we are going to cap the size of the House of 
Commons at, let us say, 300 members. I could live with that as a 
final cap on numbers. It is very important to get this bill moving 
so we can get to that.
<P>
	If the big <I>R</I> Reformers want to improve this place, then please 
listen to a small <I>r</I> reformer. Let us get moving in that direction.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
try to keep my contribution to this debate as relevant as possible 
to the subject before the House: Bill C-18, am Act to suspend 
the operation of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.
<P>
	I had some trouble following the train of thought of the hon. 
member for Waterloo, since his speech covered a variety of 
topics, including some criticism of the behaviour of Reform 
Party members. That is not the intent of my speech today.
<P>
	First of all, I must say, it is always distressing to see a 
government using a motion for time allocation, for closure, to 
put an end to debate.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	It is always, or nearly always, a distressing moment for 
parliamentarians to see this desire to gag a democratic debate. 
We did not support the motion, because it is the very essence of 
our parliamentary system that debate should take place without 
undue haste, and with as much for reflection and consideration 
as possible.
<P>
	In the case of Bill C-18 before the House today, the debate 
started on Monday this week, after notice given Friday last 
week. And after one day of debate, they imposed closure. Why 
the hurry, when the government could easily have scheduled the 
tabling of this bill a week or two earlier?
<P>
	I have somewhat mixed feelings when I speak to Bill C-18, 
because I strongly object to restricting the debate on a bill in this 
House, especially after only one day of debate. It is not a matter 
of life and death, and the government could have taken steps to 
avoid this.
<P>
	On the other hand, and this is why I have mixed feelings about 
the substance of Bill C-18, I share a number of views held by 
members of the government majority. Bill C-18 asks us to 
suspend the current process for electoral boundaries review and 
would refer the issue of representation in this Parliament, 
including section 51 of the Constitution Act, 1867, to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs; but more 
about this later.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2717"> 2717 </A></B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, 1867 was a landmark, an historic date, since 
on July 1, 1867, the constitutional system in this country 
changed and became a so-called Confederation, although it was 
actually an extremely centralized federation, witness the 
constant debate and struggle, every day and every moment, to 
ensure that provincial legislatures are able to operate in their 
fields of jurisdiction. Before 1867, Quebec had half the seats in 
the Legislature of the Union Parliament; 65 out of 130 for Lower 
Canada, and of course the remaining 65 for Upper Canada.
<P>
	It was a dramatic change, and no wonder the Liberal 
government never consulted the population. Why did the 
government that was in power just before the Union-and I must 
make a correction here, because it was not the Liberal 
government, since it was the Liberal Party which requested a 
referendum-why did it not conduct a referendum in Quebec, in 
Lower Canada, on the institutional changes in 1867? Because, 
according to most historians, the referendum would have been a 
lost cause.
<P>
	We started our journey into the institutional desert in 1867, 
when we lost the equality between two nations: Quebec and 
English Canada, which itself was seeking its own identity. And 
as we went on, decade after decade and decennial census after 
decennial census-since the present Constitution requires a 
census every ten years-we saw Quebec's political power being 
eroded.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Seventy-five members out of 181, and now, 75 out of 295. If 
the proposed redrawing of the map now before the people, as 
submitted by the provincial commissions, is approved, we 
would hold 75 of the 301 seats. Our representation would 
continue to be eroded!
<P>
	Over the years, there has clearly been a collective loss of 
memory in some circles. Yet, we must constantly remind people 
that in 1867, Quebec held half of the seats in Canada's 
parliament. What could be more legitimate than to seek a status 
that would allow us to manage our own affairs, according to the 
wishes of the majority of our people. In fact, just prior to 
Confederation in 1867, the Parliament of the united Canada of 
1840 operated according to the double majority rule, which 
meant that decisions made required the backing of a majority of 
the members representing Upper Canada and a majority of the 
members representing Lower Canada. Quebec enjoyed de facto 
a veto over all decisions affecting it. On this score, we have 
certainly lost ground.
<P>
	I can speak openly about Bill C-18 without any ulterior 
motives since I campaigned right up until October 25 as a 
candidate who was seeking to become the last federal member of 
Parliament for Bellechasse. And this has continued to be my 
position. Therefore, I can allow myself great latitude when it 
comes to this bill to readjust or redraw electoral boundaries.
<P>
	During my speech the other day, I mentioned that the Bloc 
Quebecois, which is dedicated to defending Quebec's interests 
and to promoting Quebec sovereignty, will never support the 
empty chair policy or the scorched-earth policy, regardless of 
what the future holds for Quebec, and that the decision 
ultimately rests with Quebecers and with Quebecers alone. In 
this regard, we must see to it that our future is protected, 
regardless of the decisions that will be made.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, there does not appear to be 
a quorum in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Call in the members.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The quorum has been 
attained.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker. Since 
there are people watching, when the member of the Reform 
Party asked if there was a quorum, there was only one member of 
that party in the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker I thought that the House 
was suspended and the members were to be called in because 
there were only 16 members in the House, which is not a 
quorum.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We have now attained a 
quorum and I have said so.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thought that it was inappropriate, as Beauchesne says several 
times in his book on parliamentary procedure, to point out the 
absence of members in this House. My hon. colleague from 
Beauséjour, no doubt in a fleeting moment of distraction, forgot 
this rule of which he himself would have reminded me.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	When the request for a quorum count was made and you 
checked according to the rules, I was talking about the leeway 
we might have in the Official Opposition since we do not really 
intend to use the new electoral maps. But in any case we have to 
defend this legislation. We have to defend it for the voters of all 
of Canada, from the Atlantic to the Pacific to the Arctic. It is our 
duty as Official Opposition to do so.
<P>
	The other day, strangely enough, I heard the member for 
Kamloops say that the Official Opposition only defended 
regional interests. Madam Speaker, you heard us on the link 
between Prince Edward Island and the mainland, we supported 
the constitutional motion. We spoke up on the lockout in the Port 
of Vancouver. Who spoke up on Ginn Publishing? This is not a 
strictly local problem concerning the suburb of Ste-Foy or the 
riding of La Prairie; control of Canadian culture is a federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2718"> 2718 </A></B>
<P>
problem. We spoke up, as did our colleagues in the Reform 
Party. Strangely enough, our friends in the Liberal caucus,who probably had problems and were all coming back fromMr. Muffler, were completely silent on the subject.
<P>
	I will now return to the subject being debated, before I am 
called to order. Bill C-18 must be passed, because the rules for 
setting electoral boundaries were laid down 30 years ago. From 
time to time, with specific bills, electoral reforms were stopped, 
changed or given a different direction, but the process as a whole 
was not thoroughly debated. I see the member for Beauséjour 
who seems to share my point of view; I believe that we can come 
to fairly unanimous agreement on this point. I would like to 
thank the hon. member for the consent he has just given.
<P>
	So we can review the various provisions in the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs in an unbiased way. 
Since I myself am on this committee, I think that it would be 
inappropriate for me to take a position when we have a motion to 
refer it to the committee on which I sit. I will participate without 
prejudice as the committee hears witnesses. The motion of 
reference presented provides that the committee can hear 
witnesses and travel as required across Canada and also hear 
witnesses by teleconference.
<P>
	A very broad procedure has been established. I think that this 
might answer the concerns of the hon. member for Calgary West 
who felt that Bill C-18 excluded the people from the debate. On 
the contrary, it is an inclusive process. In no way do we want to 
keep the people out of the debate; we do not want to have 
completely pointless hearings by provincial commissions that 
would be suspended in a few days because of Bill C-18. The 
people will have a chance to be heard by the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	I would also like to talk about the position of the hon. member 
for Beaver River, which I have trouble understanding.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	I listened carefully to the hon. member's speech, and since 
she started it on Monday, I was able to read it over in <I>Hansard</I>. 
My understanding is that the hon. member was not trying to 
defend the Beaver River constituency, that her riding had been 
created in 1988, and that it would disappear if the proposals 
presently before the provincial commissions are passed.
<P>
	Strangely enough, the hon. member is the same one who 
tabled Bill C-210, an Act to provide for the recall of members of 
the House of Commons. I think the hon. member for Beaver 
River should be pleased that her bill has still not been passed, 
because I presume it would not take long for the registers in her 
riding of Beaver River to open, asking for the recall of the hon. 
member, since she does not want to defend her constituents' 
interests. I find her attitude strange, to say the least. I guess the 
hon. member must have her own reasons.
<P>
	In the two minutes left, I want to discuss the last point, which 
deals with section 51 of the Constitution Act of 1867. Section 51 
states that electoral boundaries readjustments will take place on 
completion of each decennial census. However, that same 
section also excludes the Northwest Territories and the Yukon 
from the process. Consequently, the redistribution takes place 
once constituencies are specifically allocated to these very vast 
but sparsely populated areas.
<P>
	I think that, on top of the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, 
we should also look at the case of the Magdalen Islands in 
Quebec, a distinct community remote from the continent, with 
its own specific problems-and I am pleased to see that the hon. 
member for Kingston approves-and also Labrador. That region 
forms a very large territory which should be represented by 
someone. There have to be ridings with a larger population, so as 
to enable Labrador to have its own local representative.
<P>
	At least four exceptions should be made, and that does not 
include other representations which could be made. I am 
referring of course to the Yukon and the Northwest Territories, 
but also to the Magdalen Islands and to Labrador.
<P>
	It is with a very open mind that I will take part in the work of 
the committee, since I only made general comments which will 
certainly not keep me from listening with an open mind, free of 
any bias or preconceived idea, to the representations which will 
be made to the Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, of 
which I am a member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario):</B> Madam Speaker, I would also 
like to congratulate the hon. member again on his remarks. At 
the beginning of his speech, he commented on Quebec's 
numerical disadvantage, with regard to representation in 
particular.
<P>
	This kind of argument or historical reasoning is not new. 
Besides, over the past 25 years, every government elected to the 
House of Commons has been led by a Prime Minister from 
Quebec. Does the hon. member not agree with me that Quebec 
has historically been well represented in this federation?
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> I will be pleased to respond, through you, 
Madam Speaker, to the comment by the hon. member for 
Ontario.
<P>
	Of course we have been represented in this House by members 
from all political affiliations since 1867, often distinguished 
men and women, with the likes of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Prime 
Minister Louis Saint-Laurent. I will not talk about more modern 
times, and events which have not yet found a definitive place in 
history, for fear of sounding partisan, but I do believe that 
Quebec has had distinguished parliamentarians. That is not the 
point.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2719"> 2719 </A></B>
<P>
	The point I am making is that, however distinguished our 
representatives, we remain a minority in this place. However 
great the speeches made in this House by Quebec members from 
whatever political party, when a vote is held-and the hon. 
member for Ontario has seen it for himself as well as we all 
did-the majority rules and the vote from the quietest of 
member cancels that of the most talkative and convincing one. 
In that context, I can agree with the hon. member only as far as to 
say that very distinguished representatives from Quebec have 
sat in this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have a comment and a question for my hon. 
friend.
<P>
	As we know the current bill suspends the Electoral 
Boundaries Redistribution Act simply because government 
members are not happy with the outcome of the act. That is very 
frightening. Just because they are not happy with the outcome 
they take Draconian measures such as introducing time 
allocation after only four hours of debate on a bill and pushing 
the agenda through the House without giving adequate time for 
debate.
<P>
	I really believe that every member should have an opportunity 
to speak freely and reasonably in this House. What if the whole 
focus of this bill was different and we were in effect restricting a 
party in this House whose views were not agreed with by the 
other parties in the House. It could very easily happen because 
as a member of Reform I disagree with the separatist views of 
the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Suppose we decided because the rules of the House offer a lot 
of privileges to the Official Opposition we wanted to restrict 
those and introduced time allocation to do so and rammed it 
through the House.
<P>
	I just wonder how the hon. member would feel about that type 
of reaction and program.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member's question 
reminds me of question period in the afternoon or on Friday 
morning when a government member plants a question for his 
minister. I thank the hon. member.
<P>
	We voted against the time allocation motion and against 
closure because it is unacceptable, particularly in a 
parliamentary government. The hon. member for Kingston and 
the Islands is right to insist, especially since it would have been 
so easy to make plans in the parliamentary agenda to table the 
bill ten days or two weeks earlier. I share the hon. member's 
concerns on this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Madam Speaker, as I 
follow the debate, it would appear that the situation here is not a 
vote so much to do something as opposed to maybe stopping 
something which may put us into a situation which would be 
unacceptable to Canadians.
<P>
	Members have asked for time to discuss and time allocation 
would restrict that. Is it not the intent of the overall motion and 
the process to allow more time for members throughout the 
entire House to have a fuller discussion about the criteria for 
boundary setting and to ensure that Canadians are going to be 
well represented in the House through these major changes?
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	There is time to do this. I wonder if the member would agree 
that taking the time to do this job properly is the right course of 
action.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Madam Speaker, I find it quite strange and 
somewhat unacceptable as a parliamentarian to see the hon. 
member for Waterloo refer to the relevance of the debate in the 
question and comment period, when he spent all his time 
attacking our colleagues from the Reform Party, not on the 
substance of the motion but on their behaviour in the House, 
which we refrain from doing. This is my only comment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like 
to say that this is indeed a dark day for democracy. It is a dark 
day for the parliamentary system.
<P>
	I remember it took the Conservatives at least a few months 
before they brought in the heavy hand of closure or time 
allocation. I know that the previous Prime Minister, Mr. 
Mulroney, held this place in contempt. For him Parliament was a 
nuisance, something that he had to put up with as he imposed his 
agenda on the people of Canada.
<P>
	In opposition the Liberal Party would often join with the New 
Democrats and criticize the government for using the heavy 
hand of closure so flippantly, so easily. I know we do not hear 
jackboots in the hallways of Parliament yet and I know we do not 
see brown shirts around this place, but I will tell you, Madam 
Speaker, the people of Canada should consider this to be an early 
warning. Once again we have seen a government that is prepared 
to change the standing orders to give almost exclusive powers to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2720"> 2720 </A></B>
<P>
the executive, to make this institution of Parliament almost a 
joke.
<P>
	If the government executive decides that it is time to finish 
debate, it is finished. If it decides that it is going to impose some 
new initiative on the legislative agenda, it can do that instantly.
<P>
	This is a good example. Two or three weeks ago did people 
hear that a major pressing issue that would require some vote of 
closure was required in terms of the boundaries of our federal 
constituencies? It was not even discussed. I suspect most people 
in Canada are still shaking their heads wondering what this 
debate is all about. Here the government says: ``This is so 
important and it is so critical that we are going to use closure''.
<P>
	I can understand the previous government doing something on 
the GST or the free trade agreement where there were vicious 
and deep divisions. Surely to goodness this is not the kind of 
thing that we ought to rush through this House.
<P>
	I want to ask my friend who just spoke whether or not he saw 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I> this morning and noticed that the parts of 
Canada that would be most adversely impacted by not 
proceeding would be the far western part, Alberta and British 
Columbia, where their representation is so skewed because of 
population increases? Did he recognize that and does he realize 
that this initiative is really going to short change western 
Canadians?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Madam Speaker, the comments made by the 
hon. member for Kamloops are quite relevant and, as I said 
earlier, I felt a little uncomfortable taking part in the debate 
since I am against the closure motion but for the substance of 
Bill C-18. I understood that he was in a rather similar situation 
because, in some regions of British Columbia, the people who 
drew up the electoral map visualized the Rockies as a vast plain, 
according to the speech he made in the House on Monday.
<P>
	As for what he said about the increase in population, 
particularly in Western Canada and his province, British 
Columbia, we are, of course, aware of the data and hope to do the 
necessary work in time. That is part of the reason why the 
referral motion includes a deadline, so that the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs can hold hearings 
and table its report as soon as possible.
<P>
	As you are indicating to me that I have very little time left, 
there is one thing I hope for, Madam Speaker: that we will be 
able to listen to people before electoral maps are tabled 
everywhere and that only minor changes are made.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We are resuming debate 
with 10-minute speeches and no questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am sorry I will not be able to get into the friendly 
banter back and forth. I did not want to speak on the political 
diversity of our parties but on the redistribution in Bill C-18 and 
how it affects my riding of Victoria-Haliburton, because that is 
really what we are here for.
<P>
	I disagree there is no outcry against redistribution. My riding 
is one that is second in geographic size in southern Ontario. It is 
being torn apart by redistribution. My riding takes in Victoria 
county and Haliburton county. It also takes in the township of 
Brock, which is really in the region of Durham. It takes in the 
south end of Peterborough county and the north end of 
Peterborough county from beautiful Buckhorn all the way to 
Bancroft.
<P>
	Geographically it is the same size as Prince Edward Island. It 
is a large area to cover and has a lot of people. My riding will be 
reduced in size which I should be applauding, but in the fashion 
that I feel is important to the House I went and consulted with 
the area that is being taken away and the area that is being added. 
Neither one of them wants to move.
<P>
	Brock township is an area that would be well served by being 
added to Victoria-Haliburton. It would be taken and added to 
the top end of Newcastle or Clarington which has absolutely no 
geographic similarity other than they are both in Ontario. It 
would be taken away from the central region of 
Victoria-Haliburton, a populous area. Keeping in mind that I 
have a population of 101,000 according to the 1991 census, it 
would be reduced to somewhere around 94,000.
<P>
	There are many reasons to support the redistribution or not 
support it. My reasons are strictly based on my own riding and 
the effect redistribution will have on it. I am heartened when I 
hear the member for Beaver River speaking because I also have 
a Beaver River in my riding. It runs through Brock township and 
Beaverton and into Lake Simcoe. On Monday of this week I 
went to Beaverton to meet with the Brock township council. We 
discussed among other things the redistribution aspect but also 
the rejuvenation of Beaverton harbour. Hopefully that harbour 
will be part of the government's beautification program and, in 
looking at the economic problems that exist, Brock township 
will be enhanced by having a good harbour in Beaverton.
<P>
	When we talk about the press not coming to the fore on this 
matter, as I read the Lindsay <I>Daily Post</I> in my riding it starts out 
with an editorial that says: ``John O'Reilly is right''. For the 
press to say that in itself is something that strikes right at my 
heart, but I am opposed for two reasons: first, my riding is 
affected in a way that is not beneficial to it and, second, there is a 
great cost involved in redistribution.
<P>
	The cost of adding six members of Parliament is something I 
think the Reform Party, and myself included, should look at very 
hard. Why would we want to add that kind of money? Why 
would we even think in these  tough economic times of adding 
millions of dollars to taxpayers' expenses? I can understand 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2721"> 2721 </A></B>
<P>
Reformers saying that they would like to know what the rules are 
before the game starts.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	We have to look at the issue and say that we cannot strike a 
committee in the government and tell it what its conclusions are 
to be. If the committee is to investigate redistribution and the 
reasons for redistribution it has to go in with a clear mandate. It 
cannot be something that is driven by politics. It has to be 
something that is driven by economics and the times we live in. 
It is not just the drawing of lines on maps that eliminate Brock 
township and add Ennismore. I will speak on Ennismore also. 
Ennismore being added to my riding makes less sense than 
taking Brock away.
<P>
	My riding now runs across the eastern end to above the village 
of Norwood, which makes absolutely no sense. Once again it is a 
large geographic riding and very difficult to cover. Ennismore is 
above the city of Peterborough. Redistribution takes the city of 
Peterborough, makes a doughnut out of it and gives the rest of 
the area around it to the surrounding ridings. Adding Ennismore, 
which is steeped in Irish Catholic history, should obviously be 
an advantage to me.
<P>
	I am not speaking strictly on partisan terms. The fact of the 
matter is that Ennismore is being added to the centre of 
Victoria-Haliburton where my constituency office and the 
town of Lindsay are located. Ennismore is above the city of 
Peterborough. Most people in Ennismore gravitate to the city of 
Peterborough to work. All government services are in the city of 
Peterborough. As these areas are added to ridings like 
Victoria-Haliburton and as Brock township is taken away and 
added to something else, the whole boondoggle, as I call it, 
makes absolutely no sense. I oppose it. Also I am not 
comfortable with closure. I must say that I do not find closure to 
be a comfortable way to do government. I say that quite heartily.
<P>
	I have looked at the problem. Maybe it is minuscule; maybe it 
is not. The commission is out right now. Besides the $5 million 
it has already spent or wasted, as I would put it, it is going to 
waste more money in booking rooms, hiring staff, holding 
meetings, putting me and my constituents into a position where I 
am preparing on one side to oppose redistribution of my riding 
and on the other side supporting closure so that I do not have to 
go to the meetings and waste more taxpayers' money.
<P>
	I talked to some Reform members and when I was through the 
comment one of them made was that I was more Reform than 
they were. I must agree with that because money and the 
spending of taxpayers' money are close to my heart. I came out 
of municipal politics where I instituted a system in my 
municipality that stopped debenturing and started reserves. 
Now I see that the municipalities in my area that have followed 
the  procedure are able to take advantage of the infrastructure 
program because of planning they started in the past.
<P>
	We all realize there are no more taxpayers' dollars to try to 
get. We have to save at every opportunity. Besides the process 
that is ongoing, a way of saving taxpayers' dollars would be by 
stopping the process. April 14 will be the first date under the 
process we could actually see the bill go through, cut off the 
hearings and bring redistribution to a halt. Then it should be 
restudied and looked at along the lines of Canada as a whole.
<P>
	When I talk about my geographic area being the same size as 
Prince Edward Island, I do not mean to talk about four members 
from Prince Edward Island handling the same area that I handle 
as one member. Obviously I am already saving money under the 
program. The fact of the matter is that redistribution for my 
riding does not make sense. It will not benefit the voters of 
Victoria-Haliburton whom I represent. I hope other members 
represent their voters in the same way. I worry about that interim 
period where a huge amount of voting power is taken away from 
one riding and put into another. Does the member then spend 
less time there and more in the one that is being added? Those 
are questions I have not been able to answer.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	I know my 10 minutes is coming to an end, but I hope 
members realize that stopping the hearings saves money. Five 
million dollars has been wasted; let us not waste any more. Let 
us look at the ridings that are adversely affected like mine and 
the damage it does to the system I have to work in. Let us stop in 
any way we can and take a hard look at redistribution and its 
effects on my riding and on other ridings in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will try to condense a 20-minute speech into 10 
minutes to conform with the time allocation motion which 
restricts the time I have to address the House.
<P>
	It is a sad day to be speaking, about two months into a new 
Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
member who has just risen referred to the time allocation motion 
limiting his speech to 10 minutes. It has nothing to do with that. 
According to the rules, after a certain amount of debate speeches 
are reduced to 10 minutes. It has nothing to do with time 
allocation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard debate on Jimmy 
Swaggart, codes of conduct and a number of irrelevant issues. I 
did not sense that they related at all to the motion today. I would 
appreciate if the Chair would be fair in its application of those 
sorts of matters.
<P>
	This act would suspend the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Act. Why should we suspend an act that is 
currently in place and the process it enables is halfway through 
being completed? Certainly there are some things that would 
justify suspending the act. If we could  find some illegal 
activities by Elections Canada or if illegal activities were being 
undertaken 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2722"> 2722 </A></B>
<P>
by the commissions themselves, certainly that would draw 
attention to the House. Perhaps we would have to put forward 
legislation to suspend the act so that we could review what had 
taken place to find out if there had been any misproprieties 
involved in the carrying out of the mandate of the act.
<P>
	I have heard no such allegations from the government or from 
anywhere else, for that matter. I have heard a number of 
members of Parliament who are deeply upset with the results of 
where the boundaries are drawn. They are not prepared to let the 
public have input but want to suspend the process before it 
reaches that point.
<P>
	Another reason we might want to suppress or suspend the 
mandate of the act is if it were seeming to violate the 
Constitution. Supposing they had drawn boundaries in such a 
way that they violated the Constitution or had changed the 
numbers of ridings in provinces in such a way that it was against 
the enactment of our Constitution. Certainly we would have to 
take action. However that has not happened.
<P>
	If under the act there had been refusal to allow public input 
into the process we would have a basis upon which to debate the 
bill today, but that has not happened. It will happen if the bill is 
enacted and the suspension takes place because we are at the 
point where the public hearings are about to take place.
<P>
	It really concerns me when I hear members of Parliament, 
particularly from the other side, talking about their ridings, 
being totally upset with where the boundaries are drawn and 
saying: ``I have to stop this. My riding is not unfolding the way it 
should''. This is before they have had a chance to hear what the 
public in their ridings are saying and what is the general 
consensus of the process in each province. Certainly that is not a 
reasonable approach or reason for suspending the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	If this process had gone way over budget perhaps we should 
review it, but as I understand there was about $8 million 
allocated in this budget to the commissions to do their job. I 
understand that they are reasonably on track. They have spent 
about $5 million to this point and will spend the remaining $3 
million through the public hearing process, a very important 
process that would be eliminated by the approval of Bill C-18. 
What a shame to have wasted $5 million.
<P>
	I just heard the hon. member on the other side suggest that we 
needed to pass this act to save money. I cannot understand how 
investing $5 million and seeing that all go for nought because 
the work of the commission ceased to exist and is thrown out 
into the garbage heap is in fact good stewardship of taxpayers' 
dollars. It sounds to me like it would be just the opposite.
<P>
	As nearly as we can determine, at least there has been no 
evidence brought forward by the government that there has been 
a misappropriation of funds or that the commissions have gone 
severely over their budget. This certainly does not seem to be a 
reason why we should suspend the act that we are suspending 
today.
<P>
	Maybe if they had refused to hold the public hearings we 
should be introducing the bill that we are introducing today but 
these public hearings are already scheduled. In the province of 
Saskatchewan the first one is slated for May 2. Certainly as a 
member of Parliament I was prepared like any other Canadian 
citizen to go to that hearing and present my case for changes that 
I think should be made in my riding of 
Kindersley-Lloydminster. Like my hon. colleague for Beaver 
River we are seeing our ridings disappear.
<P>
	Mine gets divided into three ways. Certainly I would like to 
make some comments about that but I would respect the wisdom 
of the public to also have input into what they think the redrawn 
map of Saskatchewan should look like, especially as it affects 
my riding of Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	Second, perhaps we could look at suspending this act if we 
had a plan in place to cap seats, a plan to deal with some of the 
constitutional implications that would take place if we did cap 
seats. If we had a plan to undertake to provide the provinces with 
the proper representation in the Parliament of Canada, should in 
fact capping of the seats mean a reduction of seats for certain 
provinces?
<P>
	This plan is not in place. There is nothing in the Liberal red 
book. There has been no discussion in this session of the House 
as to what that plan might be. All I have seen is a very broadly 
based motion that talks about reviewing a number of issues with 
no definite plan in place.
<P>
	I would say without this plan the number of seats in this House 
could be expanded beyond the six that we would see if the 
current process were allowed to continue. It has happened in the 
past. This is not a wild accusation by any stretch of the 
imagination.
<P>
	The problem is without redistribution the growing provinces 
are penalized. We cannot continue to expand seats in the House 
of Commons and so the smaller provinces will be penalized if 
we do not look at a new process and new way of bringing 
representation to the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	Of course the obvious way to remedy this situation is to 
reform the Senate. I have not heard one word of Senate reform 
from members opposite that would give the provinces the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2723"> 2723 </A></B>
<P>
regional representation they would need if they were to lose 
seats in the House if we did cap the seats and keep this House 
from being expanded. The government has absolutely no plan.
<P>
	If we cannot justify this bill what would we do? Why are we 
debating this bill? The reasons are few but they are not very 
good. MPs are not happy with the boundaries. To me that is not a 
good enough reason to suspend an act. MPs are not happy with 
the personalities. I have heard reference to some of the 
commissions and the commissioners saying that one 
commissioner in New Brunswick had complained about the 
process and the people he was involved with and working with. 
That is not a good enough reason to suspend the whole process.
<P>
	I have heard some complaints even about Elections Canada 
which have acted properly within the mandate provided it. 
Again this justification for suspending the act is not a reasonable 
one at all.
<P>
	I have heard of MPs saying they do not want to permit the 
public hearings. They think that is a waste of money. I would 
think it reflects very badly upon a government if it is not 
prepared to allow the public to have input into this process 
before it decides to change the whole process. This has already 
been delayed once and now we are talking about a second delay. 
The current boundaries are based on the 1981 census. We may be 
into the next century, in fact the next millennium before we 
redraw the boundaries.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	There is also a danger that if we suspend this act it may give 
the opportunity for MPs to be involved or to try to influence the 
formation of the new commissions with patronage like the old 
days, patronage in the commissions, perhaps even patronage 
appointments at Elections Canada.
<P>
	I would like to read a letter that was addressed to the Prime 
Minister regarding Bill C-18 from the Brampton Board of 
Trade. It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Brampton Board of Trade felt that your government had turned the pages 
on the old style of governing and opened the process to inclusive government by 
asking for input from the Canadian people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, we are quite concerned that the Hon. Herb Gray would introduce a 
bill in the House to suspend the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment process for 
24 months. At this point in time the commission struck last September is now at 
the stage of public hearings. Further, the commission has already spent $5 
million of the budgeted $8 million for this study and continues to prepare for the 
public hearings in April and May.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The board feels it is not appropriate nor necessary for a review committee to 
step in at this time and shut down the public process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If Bill C-18 is passed we ask what are the additional costs to the taxpayers? 
We already know what the current commission has cost.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Szabo)</B> I regret that the member's 
time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. It 
appears by my count that we do not have a quorum present.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Call in the members.
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I><B></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I now see a quorum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this debate has been prefaced by individual hon. 
members referring to their own situations. I should perhaps 
indicate that I won my own riding with what was the largest 
majority for a Liberal candidate in British Columbia and, 
second, we have examined the basis of the proposed electoral 
changes and our inquiries confirm that while my constituency 
seat is divided in two I would have a comfortable majority in one 
part and a very large majority in the other.
<P>
	This having been said, I would say that having knocked on 
10,000 doors in the process of seeking a nomination and then 
winning an election, I have formed a tie of intimacy with my 
fellow Canadians in the riding and I would be very sorry to lose 
it.
<P>
	However, let me get on to the substance of this debate. I speak 
with experience as a former electoral commissioner for British 
Columbia. The then Speaker of the House, Madam Sauvé, 
telephoned me and said that Parliament was very anxious to put 
the commissions on a non-partisan basis and would I serve for 
what was by the way a very nominal remuneration and I served.
<P>
	I do have some comments from my experience there. The first 
very obvious thing for these electoral commissions is an 
absence of continuity and therefore of shared experience which 
is the basis of any law-making in the commissions. It is the habit 
to replace each commission with a change of government. I 
would say that when there was a change of government my own 
commission was summarily replaced and the successor 
commission made no attempt to contact us or to find out if we 
had any shared experience we would want to pass on.
<P>
	The second thing that struck me was an absence of 
co-ordination between one commission and another. That is to 
say, in British Columbia we were unaware of what the 
commission in Alberta was doing or what its philosophy was if it 
had a philosophy. I think this goes back to one of the interesting 
aspects of the present system.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Everybody fulfils their mandate honestly and with all due 
skills that they bring to the task, but there is an absence of 
overall direction partly because the federal electoral 
commissioner, as a civil servant, under the act in which he is 
established construes his role narrowly so as  not to get into 
policy issues 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2724"> 2724 </A></B>
<P>
and I think he is correct in that, but partly also, in comparison 
with other countries because our Constitution supplies almost 
nothing in the way of motor principles to guide the electoral 
commission.
<P>
	If we look at the United States constitution there are detailed 
and specific provisions as to elections, as to the electoral 
processes, supplemented by those great amendments 13, 14 and 
15, the post-civil war ones which give very clear directives that 
were not in the first years fully observed and a succession of 
amendments right up to the present day.
<P>
	The third factor of course is that the United States supreme 
court in relationship to congress, to the legislature, and to the 
state legislatures which under the American constitution 
actually make the allocations, has developed some 100 or so 
cases establishing the limiting parameters of electoral 
distribution.
<P>
	We have virtually no jurisprudence at all from our Supreme 
Court for two reasons. The court has viewed these as political 
questions beyond its technical competence and, second, we have 
not had that litigation orientation that is present in the United 
States and which explains the fact that the Americans much 
more than Canada have taken note of changes in electoral 
sociology.
<P>
	Electoral laws no more than other laws are not graven on stone 
tablets fixed once and for all for all time. They have to change as 
a society evolves. If we look at the Canada of 1964, not simply in 
its population distribution but in terms of effective participation 
in the political processes by interest groups, ethnic groups and 
other communities it is a quite different Canada. Yet the 
electoral law unlike the law of the United States does not reflect 
this. I think this is a pity. There has been a certain vacuum or 
lagging in our development not merely in comparison to the 
United States but in relation to countries like Germany, Japan 
and India which to a considerable extent have tried to follow 
American jurisprudence.
<P>
	I made a study for the Canadian Institute for the 
Administration of Justice which as members know is a 
professional group bringing together the chief justices and 
judges of Canada. I made an address in 1989 which is available 
in which I compared American, German, Japanese, Indian and 
other modern democratic countries and Canada. The conclusion 
was we badly needed updating constitutional electoral 
principles. We needed to restructure. I think it should have come 
10 years ago. In a sense we are approaching it today.
<P>
	My own feeling as an electoral commissioner was that we 
were guided by the past. I think one very obvious principle is 
that a commissioner is not a philosopher king. He or she is not 
God. One has to respect the expectations of the people to whom 
the member is addressing his report.
<P>
	We have 205 new members in this House. I would have 
thought that it goes beyond the prudent bounds of an electoral 
commission as it is presently constituted under the present law 
to change the ridings in a dramatic revolutionary fashion.
<P>
	We assumed in 1980 to 1984 when I served that change should 
be incremental land and that revolutionary changes should be 
suggested for the future for an incremental process. I worry 
when my Newfoundland colleagues tell me that although 
Newfoundland has hardly changed demographically since the 
last election all the seats have been redistributed. Why? What is 
the rationale for it?
<P>
	If we look across the electoral commissions we will find that 
some of them have a clear philosophy.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	It is very evident in the way the distributions occurred. Some 
are moved by concepts of affirmative action that one finds in 
United States Supreme Court jurisprudence. Others are more 
traditional. These are both legitimate considerations but it is a 
matter on which civil servants, as such, and casually appointed 
commissioners with the best of intentions and the best of 
qualifications, should not be making decisions. These are issues 
of constituent power that is superior even to the Constitution 
itself. It is time that Parliament expressed itself and established 
the principles.
<P>
	In my seat of Vancouver Quadra, by accident or by deliberate 
design over 30 years we have a constituency that represents 22 
different ethnic communities. It is one of the rich experiences of 
my life to make the acquaintance of all such groups and to build 
an electoral consensus, which means building an intellectual 
and philosophical consensus among the groups.
<P>
	Under the proposed redistribution, that multiplicity of 
representation of communities disappears. The philosophy 
seems to be to produce integral constituencies. That again is an 
approach that can be justified philosophically, but I do not think 
it should be made by commissioners in the interstices of what 
purports to be a simple administrative inquiry and distribution 
according to statistics.
<P>
	It needs debate in Parliament. I would like to see the 
structured system that I have spoken of in terms of the United 
States where constitutional law is not made by any one actor 
alone, but as Jeremy Bentham said, it is made by the 
constitutional company.
<P>
	The greatness of the American system is that Congress, the 
legislature, the administrators and the courts work together and 
that is the objective we should be aiming at.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate today on Bill C-18.
<P>
	As several members have mentioned, this bill is an act to 
suspend the operation of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment 
Act in Canada.
<P>
	The Act, which will cease to be in effect if Bill C-18 is passed, 
provides for the creation of 75 new constituencies in Quebec. 
This act also provides for the setting up of a federal electoral 
boundaries commission in each of the ten provinces, as well as 
in the Northwest Territories.
<P>
	The proposal resulting from this legislation was to have been 
the object of public consultations in the weeks to come. This 
proposal, which seemed to me to be serious and well articulated, 
was based on the following principles, as is normally the case 
with this type of exercise or review: The geographical size, the 
density of population, the size of urban and rural centres, as well 
as other factors such as the common interest, the cultural 
identity and the historic evolution of the various regions and 
communities involved.
<P>
	Except for unusual circumstances, the population of a 
constituency should more or less represent 25 per cent of the 
province's electoral quota. As you all know, this quota is 
calculated by dividing the province's population by the number 
of ridings allocated to that same province.
<P>
	This whole review was based on data compiled in 1991, 
during the last federal decennial census-an exercise which 
takes place every ten years-conducted by Statistics Canada, a 
highly professional organization.
<P>
	What is the impact of this review under the current 
legislation? Four ridings would be added in Ontario and two in 
British Columbia, while the number of Mps representing the 
other provinces would remain the same.
<P>
	Quebec would still have 75 ridings, but most of these would 
undergo significant changes. The Montérégie, which is the 
region on the South Shore of Montreal, would gain one riding. 
Indeed, electoral boundaries are based on population changes, 
and Montreal's South Shore is currently experiencing the 
highest population growth in Quebec, particularly in its central 
and midwest sectors.
<P>
	The riding most affected by this review in the Montérégie is 
Laprairie, which I have the honour of representing here in this 
House.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	A new riding, called Saint-Lambert, is created around the 
town of Saint-Lambert, where I live. To Saint-Lambert are 
added Greenfield Park, LeMoyne and the western part of 
Longueuil, which together form the new riding of 
Saint-Lambert. The western part of the existing riding becomes 
the new riding of Brossard-La Prairie. The result is that the 
riding I now represent will be divided into two entirely new 
ridings.
<P>
	The riding of Brossard-La Prairie will consist of the towns 
of the same name, plus Candiac and that part of the regional 
county municipality of Roussillon which is included in the 
parish of Saint-Philippe.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the Montérégie will now have eleven instead 
of ten ridings. This seems sensible and consistent with the 
guidelines I described earlier.
<P>
	The Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission for Quebec 
has, in my opinion, done a good job, and is to submit the results 
for public hearings very shortly. This proposal is well founded 
in terms of geography, population density, the size of outlying 
areas and other factors I mentioned earlier.
<P>
	Why, after two years of work and spending $5 million, does 
the Liberal government want to stop the work being done by this 
commission? Is it because of lobbying by a number of 
backbenchers whose ridings will otherwise be drastically 
changed or will disappear altogether? Is it because it wants to 
postpone all this work for two years, which means that, 
considering the need for new public hearings and a repeat of the 
legislative process, the next election in Canada would, as far as 
electoral boundaries are concerned, follow the status quo?
<P>
	The best way to avoid upsetting a large caucus is to change 
nothing, and the government is a past master at this sort of thing.
<P>
	I think one principle is particularly important: we should not 
increase the number of electoral districts in Canada. Two 
hundred and ninety-five electoral districts for 27 million people 
is already too much, compared with what we see in the United 
States and many other western countries. Each new member of 
Parliament costs more than $1 million per session. Reducing the 
deficit also extends to considerations of this nature.
<P>
	Bill C-18 would suspend for 24 months the operation of the 
present Act. The eleven electoral boundaries commissions 
would be dissolved and new commissions would be created 
within 60 days after the Act ceases to be suspended.
<P>
	In our opinion, the 11 commissions have done a consistent and 
creditable job, but the electoral quota, in Quebec as well as 
elsewhere in Canada, will have to be increased in order to reduce 
the number of members of the House.
<P>
	We are told that the process has not been studied in depth for 
30 years, but should we redo everything, abolish the present 
commissions, name new ones and start all over again?
<P>
	Why freeze the process for two more years? Is it to fight the 
next election with the present boundaries?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2726"> 2726 </A></B>
<P>
	By passing Bill C-18 we would condone the waste of five 
million dollars, the shelving of another government study and 
the sweeping under the carpet of conclusions that do not seem to 
please the government.
<P>
	Why should we start from scratch all the time? Even if we 
proceed with new studies, I can assure the House that the future 
ridings will be very similar to the ones proposed under the 
present Act. Why? Because the base will be the same, it will be 
the census of 1991. Regions and cities will be the same. The 
framework for analysis and apportionment will remain the 
population of each county, and the number of voters per riding in 
each province will not change. Geographical areas, population 
densities, community of interest and cultural identity do not 
change overnight, and this means, according to me, that the 
conclusions will be similar.
<P>
	Being based on the same given quantities and qualities, the 
conclusions of the second exercise cannot differ markedly from 
those arrived at under the present Act. One thing only would 
produce noticeably different results, that is if the density of 
population in one specific riding could diverge by more than 25 
per cent from the provincial ratio; that could be advantageous 
for rural communities. If that percentage were closer to 10 or 15 
per cent, it would benefit urban areas and would increase 
considerably the surface of rural areas.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	However, identical premises will only give us more or less 
identical results. Is it worth it to start this exercise all over again 
if we are to get similar results in the end? What is the 
government's intention? Do they want to save time or please the 
caucus members who want to be reelected whatever the cost to 
taxpayers?
<P>
	In conclusion, what is important for Bloc Quebecois members 
is that all Quebec constituents are well represented in this 
House, whatever the distribution of the federal electoral 
boundaries for the province. As for the next federal election, the 
Bloc now hopes above all that the Parti Quebecois will be 
elected in Quebec in 1994 and that the referendum which will 
follow in 1995 will lead to sovereignty. Since the redistribution 
of the federal electoral map will be implemented only at a later 
date in canadian provinces, it could very well never apply in 
Quebec.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to add that I also agree with my 
colleague, the member for Bellechasse who said in this House 
earlier this morning that Quebec lost its sovereignty in 1867. In 
fact, the link that existed between Upper Canada and Lower 
Canada before 1867 was really a sovereignty-association type 
of relationship very similar to the one the Bloc Quebecois is 
advocating today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario):</B> Madam Speaker, once again, 
I welcome this opportunity to say a few more words regarding 
the redistribution of seats in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I need no lesson in what redistribution will mean for this 
member of Parliament. The Ontario riding is one of the largest, 
most populace ridings in the country. It has approximately 
205,000 people. If projected census information is correct, by 
the turn of this century, the time at which I will reach the ripe age 
of 37 years, my riding will be in excess of 300,000 people.
<P>
	However, I want to point out that my reasons for supporting 
the government in this initiative are many. Why do we need new 
seats? It seems to me that we have just gone through a long 
election process in which we described to people unequivocally 
the need to look after our financial House. We took the message 
from Canadians that we must work with that which they have 
provided us.
<P>
	The cost associated with adding new seats to the House of 
Commons is estimated to be in excess of one million dollars per 
year. At a time when all of us are looking for opportunities to 
make sure that we keep our fiscal house in order, it seems to me 
that proceeding with the addition of new seats without regard to 
better distribution of the resources that we already have flies in 
the face of the hard earned tax money that Canadians tell us is so 
hard to come by.
<P>
	I want to point out that in my riding of Ontario, and I do not 
want to speak from a parochial point of view of what it does to 
me, but given the significance and the load which I take in my 
riding of some 205,000 constituents it seems to me that is a 
threshold that I think is manageable. We should be looking at a 
process here-and this is certainly something that the 
committee can assign to itself-to look at a better distribution of 
the seats that we already have. I note some of my colleagues here 
from the other parties from around Ontario. We have a 
tremendous opportunity at this point to perhaps look at where 
ridings are relative to mine.
<P>
	In the riding of Oshawa next door there are 95,000 
constituents. In the riding to the north of me there are 130,000 
constituents. In my riding there are 205,000 constituents. Rather 
than adding a new seat why do we not simply redistribute some 
of the regions within those three ridings so that we have a 
platform of some 120,000 or 130,000 on average? We can do the 
job. We have the resources to do the job. We really do not need 
any new seats.
<P>
	I want to point out some of the flaws I saw in the electoral 
districts supplement to the Canada <I>Gazette</I> proposals for the 
province of Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	On reading the section dealing with Durham region it seems 
patently unclear for a committee that has spent a lot of time on 
this what they really mean in terms of distribution. It indicates 
that for the regional municipality of Durham the population is 
expected to be some 401,000. They are proposing that the 
district of Durham remains the same except for the inclusion of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2727"> 2727 </A></B>
<P>
the  township of Brock and the removal of parts formerly within 
the enlarged Oshawa district and the entire town of Whitby. The 
new riding of Ontario would include the town of Whitby.
<P>
	There is a contradiction. It seems to me rather than go through 
the exercise of pointing out all the flaws that are evident when 
not enough time is put into such a proposition, maybe we should 
rethink how we want to assign the distribution of seats in the 
House of Commons in years to come.
<P>
	We want to talk about the need for flexibility, not rigidity. 
This process of automatically increasing seats over the next few 
years seems unreasonable. We are not taking into account 
current realities, the fiscal realities, as I indicated earlier. We 
are not even looking at the need for balance in terms of the 
federation which is represented in this House.
<P>
	I heard some hon. colleagues discuss the importance of 
having their regions better represented. My colleague for 
Bellechasse made comments to the effect that Quebec as a 
region in Canada has a numerical inferiority problem with the 
distribution of seats. Guess what? So does Ontario with virtually 
10 million people represented by 99 seats. If any region has been 
left out in terms of the distribution of seats perhaps we should be 
looking at Ontario's case.
<P>
	There are 205,000 residents in my riding. Prince Edward 
Island for example may only have as many as 30,000 yet we are 
given exactly the same amount of resources to do the job for the 
people.
<P>
	I am not complaining about that but I am making the point that 
if we want to talk about fairness we truly should talk about 
fairness in terms of numbers. I do not think the current 
redistribution act really takes that into account.
<P>
	I want to talk specifically about the physical nature in which 
my riding would be divided into two regions. As I indicated the 
three principal cities of Ajax, Pickering and Whitby in my riding 
are a whole community.
<P>
	Under this proposition Ajax, a town of some 65,000 people, 
would be cut in half. In fact the boundaries go up a secondary 
street. There is no rhyme nor reason other than the fact they have 
looked to satisfy a numerical average that simply puts into 
disregard the needs and long term historic interests of the 
community. The community of Ajax grew out of the second 
world war. Over the years it has produced a number of members 
of Parliament. It would be a real tragedy if under this proposal 
by the electoral commission the town of Ajax was cut in half.
<P>
	This is one of the major reasons I commend the government 
for its position in moving ahead with the suspension of the 
redistribution as set out in this guideline.
<P>
	Although there may be some controversy over the question of 
how quickly we move to a vote on this issue, we really do not 
have a lot of time to deal with it. If we were not to correct this 
today, we might find ourselves in the situation on April 10 where 
we are raising problems with this document which for all intents 
and purposes will be redundant anyway. Proceeding in this 
manner makes a heck of a lot more sense than proceeding full 
steam ahead with something that is very uncertain.
<P>
	There was a comment a little earlier about replacing hacks 
with hacks. I believe it was from the member for Beaver River 
and I understand her frustration. I find it actually very curious 
there would be a defence for the proposal as it is since her riding 
would suddenly disappear.
<P>
	I do not think that is the intent of this government. In fact, if 
that were the intent of this government I would be one of those 
who would be most severely affected. It is my belief the 
government is going to proceed in a judicious way taking into 
account common sense principles, taking into account the 
community and taking into account the compassionate nature 
under which we have representation in this House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	My riding is one of the weightiest in this country. If I can 
sacrifice a few good years to make sure we have an electoral 
boundaries readjustment system that make sense, then I think all 
members of this House can do the same. Therefore I am placing 
myself as an example not to the country but to the taxpayer who 
has been hard hit. We do not need more seats; we need a better 
distribution of the seats and the infrastructure and the resources 
that go along with that.
<P>
	I look forward to participating on the committee with 
members from the other side of the House in making good 
policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, thank you very much. I am in favour of the 
passage of this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena):</B> Madam Speaker, I have been 
listening with interest to the comments and arguments raised by 
members opposite.
<P>
	Today I rise to speak against Bill C-18. As has been pointed 
out by my colleagues on this side for the last two days of debate 
on this, the passage of this bill will terminate the work of the 
electoral commissions. It will effectively prevent redistribution 
from occurring in time for the next election. Also a budget of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2728"> 2728 </A></B>
<P>
$7.8 million was allocated to the commission. Approximately 
$5 million of that has already been spent, the benefit of which 
will be lost if this process is terminated at this time.
<P>
	Members talk about the effects on their ridings. I must agree 
with my colleague from Calgary West that these are not our 
ridings. We tend to take ownership of these ridings as 
politicians. If anything the ridings own us, we do not own them. 
In that sense we have a duty to represent the interests and the 
wishes of those people in the riding we represent.
<P>
	A number of questions arise for me on that note. Many of my 
constituents would wonder why we are effectively throwing $5 
million of taxpayers' hard earned money down the drain to 
suspend this process. There should be some good reasons for 
doing so.
<P>
	I hear arguments about trying to cap the number of MPs in the 
House of Commons. That is a valid point and I agree with it. 
However there is nothing in this proposed legislation that would 
cap the number of seats. Getting away from some vague wording 
about reviewing the increasing number of seats, let us talk about 
capping the number of seats. If members opposite had included 
that in the proposed bill then I think they would have found 
support from the Reform Party, but they have not. They have 
only proposed to talk about it. I have a great deal of difficulty 
with that.
<P>
	My background is in small business. When we say we are 
going to do something, we do it. We do not talk about doing it. 
We do not say we are going to review and study it. We say we are 
going to do it. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the 
government could not have included that in the bill.
<P>
	The boundaries of my riding-I am talking as if I owned it but 
I do not-the boundaries of the riding I represent, Skeena, will 
be affected greatly if this current proposal by the electoral 
commission goes through. Right now my riding is probably one 
of the largest geographically in Canada and my boundaries are 
going to increase 20 per cent by my calculations.
<P>
	It is very difficult for members of Parliament to effectively 
represent geographically large ridings. A lot of travel is 
involved. Many small communities are far apart. Many 
communities in my riding are only accessible by air or water, 
some of them only by air. I know full well the kinds of problems 
members have to face in dealing with these ridings. Therefore 
when the boundaries of my riding expand it sends a lot of 
warning signals to me and I have some difficulties with it.
<P>
	I remind members that there is a process. My constituents and 
I can make representations to the commission when it holds 
public meetings in Prince Rupert. We can submit our objections 
or suggestions for changes to the proposals the commission has 
made. This is a matter of process and something I fully 
subscribe to.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I understand why many members may not like the proposals in 
front of them. I do not like the proposals that are in front of me. 
The ridings of several of my colleagues in the Reform Party will 
disappear altogether. Members in other parties are facing the 
same problem.
<P>
	However there is a process and I have not heard anyone 
question the process in these debates. I have not heard anyone 
say that what we have here is the work of a partisan commission 
which is out to do political damage to one party or another. That 
is not the case.
<P>
	What these commissions are doing by all accounts is 
non-partisan and unbiased. They are attempting to achieve the 
objectives they have been given under section 51 of the 
Constitution Act and the Boundaries Readjustment Act. If in 
fact that is what the commissions have been working toward, 
then I question why we want to suspend or get involved in the 
process. Why would we want to have political interference?
<P>
	We are talking about political interference. A process has 
been established and it is functioning. Members of Parliament 
do not like it. Members of Parliament are going to suspend the 
process so they can change it to something they like. That is 
political interference. There is no other description for it. What 
matters in this debate as far as I am concerned is what Canadians 
want, not what politicians want.
<P>
	As I said earlier, any of my constituents who do not like the 
proposals can make representations before the commission on 
May 31, 1994 in Prince Rupert. The real evidence of voter 
concern in my riding will become evident through this public 
forum.
<P>
	The bill before us if adopted is political interference at best. It 
opens the door for partisan manoeuvring. Indeed one would 
have to ask if this is not the real intent of the bill. Why would the 
government introduce it if it did not intend to gerrymander or 
play with the boundaries to the way it wants them rather than the 
way the commissions have proposed them.
<P>
	Every citizen of this country no matter what their occupation 
must play by the rules. That is the law of Canada. If you break 
the rules, you forfeit either your freedom or some of your hard 
earned money, or both. If you disagree with the validity of the 
rules or the laws of the land, if you do not like the processes that 
are in place, you are at liberty to work through lawful means to 
try to change them. That is a fundamental principle of 
democracy.
<P>
	We as members of Parliament are legislators. We make laws, 
we change laws, we amend laws. Sometimes we even strike laws 
from the books when we think they no longer represent what 
Canadians want. However we are not above the law.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2729"> 2729 </A></B>
<P>
	In our positions as members of this great House, the very 
cradle of our democracy, we are in positions of great power. We 
are the legislators. We have the ability to change laws. Nothing 
makes Canadians more cynical than to see people being put in 
these positions of power and then abusing that power when 
ordinary Canadians do not have the opportunity of using that 
power to their own ends. That is precisely what is happening 
with this bill.
<P>
	In recent years Canadians have become increasingly 
displeased with Parliament. They have expectations as to how 
public servants should conduct themselves. They become very 
cynical when they see politicians attempting to manipulate the 
system for their own personal gain.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	There is only one way for Canadians to interpret the passage 
of this bill. They must conclude that once again the politicians in 
Ottawa are circumventing due process, a process that most agree 
is fair and unbiased, for their own gain.
<P>
	When we all came to this House in January we were talking 
about conducting ourselves differently in the 35th Parliament. 
We talked about moving away from the practices previous 
governments and members engaged in.
<P>
	Canadians want to believe this. It is therefore vitally 
important that we back up what we are talking about now 
through our deeds rather than through our words. Many 
members are unhappy with the changes that the commission has 
proposed. Some fear these will impact on their future electoral 
prospects. Looking at it objectively, the displacement is felt by 
all parties and virtually all members. No one party or individual 
was singled out.
<P>
	As I said earlier, many members on this side of the House will 
be severely impacted if the current boundary proposals are 
adopted. Yet we maintain that the process must be allowed to 
continue and that those who are unhappy with the commission's 
proposals can make representations within the parameters that 
the process establishes, rather than voting in favour of this 
motion out of concern for their own personal political 
considerations.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The member has 
exceeded his time.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Madam Speaker, may I say that 
I am really very pleased to take part in this debate. I am 
particularly pleased to take part following my friend from the 
Reform Party-I am sorry but I do not know his riding-because 
there are a few home truths that need to be brought up here.
<P>
	Let us talk about some of the things that our constituents want 
us to do. First of all it is true that there are in some places, in 
some ridings in the country, people who are greatly dissatisfied 
with their representation. It is also true that there are some 
70-plus of us in this House-this is not to denigrate in any way 
any of the new  members from any party-who did get 
re-elected and got elected quite handily with quite large 
majorities.
<P>
	In my riding, so that members will know where I am coming 
from on this, I won every poll but one. Some polls had not been 
won by a Liberal since Confederation.
<P>
	In the riding next to me, and these are the two ridings that 
would be affected should redistribution take place, the same 
thing happened. The hon. member for Halifax West and I were 
both very gratified that we won by very large majorities at every 
poll. I believe the hon. member for Halifax West took every 
single poll in his riding and, as I said, I lost one. It was certainly 
remiss of me and I will try not to do it again.
<P>
	The point I am making is that the reason for this bill, it must 
be stated here and now, has nothing to do with the worry about 
boundaries changing and causing problems in the traditional 
gerrymander, if you will, that ridings are being changed and we 
might lose them.
<P>
	With the greatest of respect, I know the member of the Reform 
Party who is the sole member of his party from Ontario could 
say that Liberals in the province of Ontario are not particularly 
worried about the electoral losses of moving boundaries. What 
we are worried about-I am astounded that we do not have the 
support of the Reform Party on this-is the cost of increasing 
the number of members of Parliament to the public purse.
<P>
	There are 295 of us in a country of 27 or 28 million people. 
Look at the representation in the House of Representatives in the 
United States yet they appear to manage their representation 
very well. In these days when restraint is being urged on us by all 
fronts, not the least of these urgings coming from the Reform 
Party members across the way, should we really be considering 
increasing the number of members of Parliament? I am almost at 
a loss for words, which I can assure my hon. friend in the Reform 
Party is not something that happens very often.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> We noticed that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I am sure you did. You may learn from it too.
<P>
	Consider the fact that members of the Reform Party think we 
need more members of Parliament. It is unquestionably true that 
there are certain members for whom a lack of redistribution is 
creating a difficulty. I refer to my very good friend, the 
parliamentary secretary to the minister of human resources who 
has, as I understand it, the largest and most populous riding in 
the country. I believe that the parliamentary secretary's riding 
will soon hit a population somewhere in the vicinity of 300,000.
<P>
	My own riding has a population of somewhere in excess of 
100,000 which is larger than it should be. There are many 
ridings, particularly urban ridings, where this happens and it 
will be difficult for urban members. It may well be that we are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2730"> 2730 </A></B>
<P>
going to have to look at some  other way to ensure that people are 
getting the proper representation.
<P>
	I do not think the hard-pressed Canadian taxpayer wants to 
hear from us that we are going to increase the number of 
members of Parliament. Again, my shock really knows few 
bounds that the hon. members from the Reform Party could 
possibly be advocating this. They talk about the fact that there is 
a process in place. Yes, there is. But as the hon. member who 
spoke previous to me said, we are here to legislate. We are here 
to legislate when things are not working in their most optimum 
way to ensure that they do.
<P>
	This bill is part of our responsibility that we are exercising to 
ensure that the House does for the people of Canada what the 
people of Canada deserve and need, not follow a format that has 
probably outlived its usefulness.
<P>
	If the members of the Reform Party are worried about the 
money spent in getting to this point-as apparently they are, I 
believe I heard the hon. member for Beaver River talk about this 
yesterday-I can only say that perhaps the time should have 
come some years ago to put an end to this. Unfortunately we 
have not been in power for nine years. Now we are and now we 
say that this must stop. This is not the way to go. This is not the 
time to increase the number of members of Parliament and that 
spending the unconscionable amounts of money, a lot more than 
was spent already, I might add-perhaps it is the arithmetic that 
is the problem here-is putting good money after bad.
<P>
	Again I can only reiterate that it is utterly unbelievable, given 
what we have heard day in and day out since January 17. I know 
that my friends here are absolutely astounded as am I. I can see 
that the member for Scarborough-Rouge River just does not 
know where to turn at this stage of the game.
<P>
	That members of Parliament from the Reform Party in all 
seriousness are advocating that we continue this and increase 
these numbers is really beyond my comprehension. The time to 
undertake a comprehensive review of the process is now. I take a 
leaf from the book of my friend who spoke previously and say: 
This is what we are about. We are all legislators. It is our 
responsibility to ensure that the legislation that comes from this 
House is in the best interests of Canadians. It is time to review a 
great number of things but it is certainly time to review the 
electoral process and the way we decide representation and how 
representation shall be meted out. It is time to tackle this issue 
because we are still at an early stage in the process. It is time 
because the existing electoral boundaries commissions have not 
yet invested the time, energy and funds into holding public 
hearings.
<P>
	I wonder if my learned friends on the other side of the floor 
have any idea just how much that process will cost Canadians 
along with the addition of all those new members of Parliament. 
I am quite taken aback by the stand taken by the Reform Party of 
Canada. It amazes me, as I know it would certainly amaze my 
constituents. There are individual reasons why we do not want 
this redistribution, aside from the question of saving money, 
aside from the reason that Canadians do not think we need more 
MPs.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	I will close, Madam Speaker, by saying that in my riding of 
Halifax I would lose the section known as Halifax Atlantic. It is 
a wonderful section, the only part of my riding that has a rural 
element. It has five fishing villages. It has been in my riding 
since the redistribution that took place just before the 1988 
election. I did not win it in 1988, I lost it. In 1993 I won it and I 
won it in a big way.
<P>
	I am sure that those members on the other side of the House 
who are worried about this kind of thing. As a member who has 
been here for five years I can tell them that kind of change rarely 
makes a difference in the long run to your electoral majorities if 
you are a constituency person who works his or her riding. The 
people you represent are the people you represent, and the 
geographical ideas that some people put forward as being a 
problem do not really exist.
<P>
	The main issue here is saving the money of the Canadian 
taxpayers. I am appalled that the Reform Party does not want to 
do this.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today in this House to speak to Bill C-18, an Act 
to suspend the operation of the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Act.
<P>
	As you know, Madam Speaker, my party does not wish to run 
in the next elections. We hope that, by then, Quebec will be 
independent. Nonetheless, the proposals made by the Electoral 
District Boundaries Commission upset several of my colleagues 
across Canada.
<P>
	I am not the kind to shirk my responsibilities. When I saw that 
the commission had carved up my riding of Lotbinière, I did not 
have any other choice but to react strongly.
<P>
	In no time, it created an uproar in my constituency. Following 
the announcement of the proposed reform, around 20 articles, 
editorials and letters to the editor appeared in local newspapers. 
It is hardly surprising since the Bois-Francs area was split into 
three different ridings. The commission wanted to combine 
regional county municipalities into federal ridings, ignoring 
certain historical, economical, social and cultural factors.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2731"> 2731 </A></B>
<P>
	To combine RCMs into ridings is reasonable to a point but not 
if the cities themselves see no benefit in it. For instance, by 
being shifted from Richelieu to Lotbinière, Bécancour was 
being moved into the same riding as the other municipality in 
the Bécancour RCM but was being separated from Nicolet.
<P>
	In an article published on Thursday, February 24, 1994, in <I>Le 
Nouvelliste</I>, Mr. Jean-Guy Dubois, Mayor of Bécancour, said, 
and I quote: ``It is quite obvious that this exercise by the 
commission members was essentially a demographic one, and 
that they did not take into account the sense of belonging in 
these communities''.
<P>
	And Mayor Dubois added that the Bécancour-Nicolet area 
cannot be divided. And what about the city of 
Victoriaville-Arthabaska, the heart of the Bois-Francs area, 
which was being separated from several area municipalities 
such as Princeville with which it had real and tangible links.
<P>
	I can only congratulate the government on its decision to 
impose a two-year moratorium on this electoral boundaries 
readjustment process. We are talking about an $8 million 
exercise. Eight million dollars to move little lines around on the 
electoral map, displeasing the majority of national, provincial 
and municipal authorities in the process, all the while trying to 
preserve electoral quotas and in fact spending public funds 
needlessly.
<P>
	Of course a revision of the electoral boundaries is necessary 
when certain elements of the Elections Act are not adhered to.
<P>
	Factors to be taken into account, besides electoral quota, are 
described clearly in section 15 of the Act: community of 
interests of the inhabitants of a given electoral district in the 
province or its historical development. Also, care must be taken 
to ensure districts are not too large in sparsely populated, rural 
or northern regions of the province.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Recent revisions have shown that more often than not, 
commissions had used purely mathematical rules to readjust 
electoral boundaries.
<P>
	The intent, in this bill, to preserve the integrity of RCMs 
within districts is commendable but hardly immutable. As we 
have seen, in certain cases, others factors must be taken into 
account.
<P>
	In a commentary published on Tuesday February 22, 1994, in 
<I>L'Union</I>, the chairman of the CNTU Bois-Francs, Mr. Denis 
Champagne, gave a general idea of what people think: ``For an 
electoral map to be good, it must reflect the various 
communities and identify the connections between these well 
enough. Finally, the administrative structure has to adhere to it. 
Right now, we are in an undescribable administrative muddle''. 
And he adds: ``Boundaries now divide RCMs; they overlap 
different administrative areas. . . In a word, I cannot see the 
current revision meeting our needs in that respect''.
<P>
	That is what commissions must look at. It stands to reason 
that we should review the legislation governing this process. A 
parliamentary committee should oversee the review of the Act 
and electoral boundaries should be readjusted. It really needs to 
be done. It has not been done in 30 years.
<P>
	Sir John A. Macdonald himself recognized that electoral 
power parity was essential, while not being the only factor to be 
taken into account to ensure effective representation. He 
introduced the Representation Act, 1872, in recognition of this 
basic truth: ``Although the rule concerning the population of 
each district has been widely obeyed, other factors have been 
considered relevant to ensure a variety of interests, classes and 
communities can be represented and the rule of numbers is not 
the only one used''.
<P>
	This quote was used as part of a ruling made by the Supreme 
Court of Canada on June 6, 1991, in the case of the Attorney 
General of Saskatchewan against Roger Carter et al.
<P>
	It would therefore be worthwhile to review the Act to make 
sure that electoral boundaries commissions take all these factors 
into consideration rather than set arbitrary boundaries.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to participate in a debate that has gone on for some time 
now about the right or wrong of suspending the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act. As one who comes from the 
smallest province in Canada whose seats have been enshrined in 
the Constitution and where the numbers can neither go up nor 
down, people might ask me: ``Why would you want to 
participate in this debate?''
<P>
	I believe what we are proposing to do here is very worthwhile 
at this time. We have decided to suspend the act and have the 
committee look at what way we can change the distribution 
system to make it better. As my colleague from Vancouver 
Quadra alluded, I believe personally the change should be in line 
with the way it is done in the United States.
<P>
	At this time we are all talking about slowing down the 
spending of money and other things. The talk going around 
indicates that we have already spent $5 million but it is going to 
cost a lot more money if we look at the outcome of the 
redistribution.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	I am not necessarily saying that we should not redistribute the 
numbers or redistribute the seats, but I do not believe at this time 
in our history there is any justifiable need to add more seats any 
place in Canada.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2732"> 2732 </A></B>
<P>
	All kinds of institutions are looking at holding the line, 
reducing numbers or not going ahead with other plans. I notice 
new provincial electoral reform has just come forward in my 
own province. I have not spoken on what I think of it. They are 
reducing seats. The ridings in Prince Edward Island are held by 
two members. There are 16 ridings and two members for each. 
This is a throwback to the days when there were two houses. It 
was 100 years ago that one of the houses was eliminated but two 
members per riding were retained. They are now talking about 
changing to one member per riding. I do not know what the end 
result will be in the number of seats.
<P>
	It is not the best time for us to go forward and increase seats in 
the House with the added costs. The provinces that would gain 
are well represented in the House right now. This can continue. 
After the committee makes its recommendations we can look at 
the readjustments.
<P>
	At this time the whole process needs to be re-examined. It has 
been many years since it has been looked at. We have been using 
the same formula for approximately 30 years. Everything is up 
for review in Parliament, everything in our country. It is not 
such a terrible thing to do so.
<P>
	Many people have said that we should expand the number of 
seats or that we should go forward with redistribution. Again I 
agree with my colleague from Vancouver Quadra. Maybe the 
way in which the electoral system has operated for the last 
number of years has not been the best.
<P>
	For instance, we should have an automatic formula that kicks 
in after a census is taken and ridings need to be readjusted. Many 
times over the years ridings have been readjusted to make it 
better for some members and make it worse for others. This has 
always been a trend in our electoral system. As a member for 
some years now in this House and in the provincial legislature I 
have indicated that it should be done fairly for every person and 
for every riding. The people who should be getting the best 
arrangement are the voters. I do not think that has always been 
the case.
<P>
	When we conclude debate, vote on the bill and it goes to 
committee I trust it will be studied seriously. I am sure the 
committee will do so, with members from all parties in the 
House. Then the committee will report back to us and 
recommend that some changes need to be made.
<P>
	I am sure, as we go along in the governance of the country, 
there will be many more important issues that need to be tackled 
than whether we should change the boundaries and add more 
seats to this institution. There are now 295 seats. As I said a few 
minutes ago, the men and women who represent the provinces 
across the country and the two territories give good 
representation. Of course one would always like to see more 
members on his or her side of the House depending on what is at 
issue. I do not think that is what is intended by the motion 
although we all know that has happened in many cases in the 
past.
<P>
	This is a good time to tackle the issue of setting it aside, 
reviewing it and at the end of the day coming forward with a 
mechanism that will make it a better way of deciding on how we 
raise or lower the number of seats in given areas.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	As I said, in my own special case perhaps I should not be the 
one speaking on it, but I come from the smallest province in 
Canada. We have four members of Parliament and those seats 
were enshrined in the Constitution. That was one of the 
arrangements made in 1873 when the province of Prince Edward 
Island came into Canada. It was enshrined again in 1982 when 
the Constitution was amended and brought home to Canada. 
This is given to the smaller provinces so that they will not go 
below a certain level. It is the same in the United States. Every 
state is guaranteed that it will have representation in Congress.
<P>
	As we head to question period, I say that I had great concern 
about the way we were rushing into this matter. There were 
certainly representations made by many members across the 
country to put a hold on the process for the present time, let the 
committee have a serious look at it and let us see what needs to 
be done. I am sure all constituents in the country who are 
represented here will decide at the end of the day whether or not 
we do the right thing.
<P>
	As we look at what is to take place in the country over this 
period of time I am sure there are issues that can well be 
addressed just as easy as electoral reform. I am sure all members 
of the House will join with us when we vote on laying the matter 
aside and letting what is to happen in the future be determined. I 
know that Canada will be well represented by this action.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. It being two o'clock, pursuant to 
Standing Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to Statements

the litmus test of the government's commitment to 
parliamentary reform and to an open parliamentary process.
<P>

<P>
	The Liberals speak of an honest and open government but the

investigation at committee when there is no follow-through for 
such an investigation.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, on March 
20, 1992, the then Deputy Minister of Energy, Mines and 
Resources, Bruce Howe, made a formal commitment on behalf 
of the federal government to contribute $7.2 million a year for 
five years to the Canadian Centre for Magnetic Fusion. This 
centre conducts research on nuclear fusion in Varennes, using a

	This program funded equally by the federal government and 
Hydro-Québec is part of concerted international action on 
nuclear fusion, a process quite unlike conventional nuclear

	Despite the representations made to the Minister of Natural

Although the Conservatives started it, the Liberals could have 
stopped it but did not. The initial cost of the report was $150,000 
and has escalated to $200,000.
<P>
	It recommended severance pay for all MPs even though many 
have jobs to go to after their mandate. It recommended more 
money for senators and it recommended a 37 per cent pay 
increase for MPs. The Liberal Party suggests that MPs deserve a 
raise because they work so hard.
<P>
	Let us consider ourselves Corporation Canada and we are its

people often remark about grain farm subsidies, usually not in a

<P>
	In spite of this, some Manitoba elevators have not seen a rail 
car in over two months. Most elevators are full to capacity and 
April 1 road restrictions in Manitoba will restrict the movement 
of grain by farmers.
<P>
	There are currently 30 ships in Vancouver harbour awaiting 
grain. These ships get up to $20,000 a day in demurrage charges 
and this comes out of the farmers' pockets. Some ships have left 
empty after collecting as much as $350,000 in demurrage 
charges.

have lost approximately $200 million in grain sales and 
demurrage charges. Canadian farmers cannot afford this and

devastating if not more so when the economic state of the area is

	However, the communities of Mill Cove and Shelburne have

	Right now these communities are concerned that assets from

weekend more than 40,000 Canadians of Hellenic origin from 
all parts of Montreal will be in my riding of Saint-Denis 
celebrating the anniversary of Greece's independence day on 
March 25, 1821 and the establishment of the modern Greek

something more to celebrate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On behalf of my constituents of Hellenic origin I wish to 
thank our government for playing an important role in the 
Balkan crisis not only in providing peacekeeping forces in the 
region but for encouraging all neighbouring states to seek 
peaceful resolution to their conflicts.
<P>
	We are proud that Canada is supportive in helping to resolve 
the differences between Greece and its neighbours.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to conclude by offering my most sincere 
congratulations to the members of the Hellenic community in 
my riding, as well as to all Canadians of Greek origin, on this 
important day.

	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Mr. Speaker, the township of 
Uxbridge is a largely rural municipality in my riding. The 
municipality is currently being asked to rezone land to allow for 
an influx of migrant workers in order to harvest 1994 crops.
<P>
	These migrant workers are brought to our country under a 
program administered by the Canada Employment Commission. 
In the case of Ontario for the 1993 season this program was 
responsible for the importation of over 9,000 workers.
<P>
	Many farm organizations claim that they need this workforce 
to address the seasonality of their industry. I note that many of 
our industries have seasonal fluctuations such as construction 
and tourism and that these industries do not require the 
importation of labour. Others question the reluctance of 
Canadians to perform this type of work.
<P>
	I wonder with our current high levels of unemployment and 
social assistance whether farm organizations and the Canada 
Employment Commission could review this process with a view 
to hiring Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, not only has 
the business community reacted negatively to the budget 
brought down by the Minister of Finance, but we also learned 
this morning that three out of four Quebecers are disappointed 
with the budget because it will not make the economy stronger.
<P>
	The three major unions in Quebec have asked the government 
to delay implementing the measures restricting unemployment 
insurance until a genuine comprehensive debate is held on social 
program reform.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance intend to postpone, as requested 
by the three major Quebec unions, the UI measures announced 
in his budget until such time as genuine consultation on the 
reform process has taken place?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec):</B>
 Mr. Speaker, there is no question, and the 
Minister of Human Resources Development has repeatedly said 
so, that we intend to begin a process of fundamentally reforming 
unemployment insurance in order to better prepare workers for 
training and to create jobs. We have  embarked on a course that 
will enable us to achieve this goal and we will stay this course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
Minister of Finance recognize that he should reconsider his 
approach which has been to attack the unemployed rather than 
unemployment itself? And could he tell us if he intends to put 
genuine job creation measures on the table in order to help 
people get off unemployment by working, instead of forcing 
them off UI by cutting their benefits?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, not only have we rolled 
back the UI premium rate in our budget in order to create jobs, 
not only have we talked about funding a new training plan to 
provide more training to our workers, but yesterday-and it 
surprises me that the hon. member is not asking me a question 
about this-the Minister of Human Resources Development and 
New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna announced a program 
specifically designed to help Canadian workers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the main 
weakness in the Finance minister's budget is that is does not 
contain a single project of major significance that would help 
spur the economy. That is what is wrong with his budget. Does 
the Minister of Finance not recognize that he must introduce 
bold measures and join with the private sector in investing in 
forward-looking projects such as the high-speed train, projects 
which would give some hope and some dignity back to the 
unemployed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of his 
question, the hon. member quoted from a survey which was 
reported in this morning's edition of <I>La Presse</I>. I would like to 
quote the article in question: ``After leading the way in the 
House of Commons on the issue of the military college in 
Saint-Jean, the Bloc has chosen not to mention this matter at all 
in its review of the Martin budget. Instead, on the subject of 
defence, it criticizes the minister for not making deeper cuts''.
<P>
	How inconsistent, Mr. Speaker. How hypocritical!
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, Oh!
<P>

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when the Liberals were in opposition, they strongly denounced 
the policy of high interest rates pursued by the former Governor 
of the Bank of Canada, John Crow. Now the excessive increase 
of the Bank of Canada rate that we saw yesterday is another sign 
which shows that nothing has changed.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	My question for the Minister of Finance is this: Why did the 
Liberal Party of Canada promise in the election campaign to 
redefine the monetary policy, when it is acting exactly like the 
previous government by obsessively fighting inflation, which 
has been eliminated, instead of fighting unemployment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, we will maintain the 
strategy of pursuing an inflation target of 1 to 3 per cent, with a 
goal of 2 per cent. We will do so because we want to create jobs 
and we want the economy to grow. The hon. member, as a 
reputable economist, knows very well why and I wonder why he 
asks such silly questions.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order! The language is getting a little rough 
today. Perhaps more moderate words could be used. I would 
hope that we could speak to each other in a civil manner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Thank you, 
Mr. Speaker. Given what he just said, I ask the Minister of 
Finance if he could explain to us how his position is different 
from that of the Conservatives?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, our objection when the 
Conservative government was in power was the really savage 
way they wrestled with inflation to bring it down. But we paid 
the price and we are there now! After making such hard-won 
gains, now is not the time to give them up.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, for four 
and a half years I sat in the House and watched the Conservative 
government lose the respect of the Canadian people.
<P>
	During those years the Liberals promised that when they were 
in government things would be different.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, it has become apparent that the 
government is practising business as usual. The red book 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2738"> 2738 </A></B>
<P>
promised: ``A Liberal government will reduce grants to 
business''. Once elected that very same Liberal government 
begins shovelling money over to its friends in business.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. How does he 
justify the full blast operation of what Terence Corcoran calls 
the Ottawa grant machine in defiance of the government's own 
red book?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps the member 
ought to be a bit more specific in terms of what grants she is 
opposing. I read Mr. Corcoran's column.
<P>
	Is she opposing the infrastructure program? Is she opposing 
the program that every single province in the country has 
endorsed? Is she opposing the infrastructure program that every 
major municipality has requested?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Perhaps we should have recall.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> That is right, perhaps we 
should have recall, considering that every province and every 
municipality wants to have the infrastructure program. If she 
does not like it, maybe we should have recall.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, we would 
love a definition of what infrastructure is and if it includes 
Saddledomes and hockey stadiums, then we do have to ask 
questions.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question for the Minister of Finance 
also on the topic of business as usual.
<P>
	Two separate squadrons of members of Parliament and 
senators are lifting off for Paris in the springtime. One of those 
groups will be accompanied by spouses at taxpayers' expense.
<P>
	Will the minister explain to his colleagues that compounding 
the wastefulness of an already useless junket makes his efforts 
to cut the deficit that much harder?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alfonso Gagliano (Saint-Léonard):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all I would like to say that the trip does not involve the 
authority of the government. It is the executive of the 
parliamentary association that is elected by the members of this 
House.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	It is important for us who believe that parliamentary exchange 
with the rest of the world is important. This is a national 
Parliament and such exchanges should continue.
<P>
	Concerning the way delegations are formed and the expenses 
of such delegations, I would like to remind members that on 
January 17 this year we announced a plan to reduce costs to the 
House of Commons budget. In that plan was the way we should 
restructure our parliamentary association.
<P>
	I am sure that if the member has enough patience in the few 
months to come before this session adjourns we will have a new 
system of parliamentary delegation. I am sure that the 
representative of the Reform Party on the board will contribute 
to that new approach.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would point out to the hon. member that 
parliamentary trips or voyages, if I might call them that, come 
under the purview not of the government per se but from a 
committee of Parliament. With that I will go to the third 
question.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, those who 
travel with the parliamentary associations are not paying their 
own way. The taxpayers are paying their way.
<P>
	One final supplementary question for the Minister of Finance, 
still on the theme of business as usual.
<P>
	It is reported that a poll commissioned by the human 
resources department cost $250,000. Would the Minister of 
Finance in his efforts to trim the deficit, as I know he is 
concerned, investigate whether this was the lowest bid the 
department of human resources received or whether the most 
competitive bid which was recommended by the department was 
passed over by the minister in favour of his hometown pollster?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are bordering here on impugning motives. I 
am sure we would be able to lower the decibel level just a bit.
<P>
	I would hope that in both the questions and the answers we 
would not impugn motives to hon. members of Parliament.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	An Info Update sent to Regional Directors of Canada 
Employment Centres shows disturbing figures. Out of $2,355 
million worth of cuts, in 1994-95 and 1995-96, $630 million 
will come from the Maritimes and $735 million, each year, from 
Quebec. That is 60 per cent of unemployment insurance cuts for 
one third of the population.
<P>
	How can the Minister argue that his government's priority is 
job creation, when its only strategy is an attack on 85 per cent of 
the unemployed, and moreover in the poorest provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification): </B>Mr. Speaker, these figures are not correct. In 
fact, the changes to the unemployment insurance program will 
affect only 2 or 3 per cent of the beneficiaries. I would 
appreciate it if the hon. member would report true facts, not 
fiction.

was none too happy that we had these figures. For 1994-95 and 
1995-96, they are correct.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	How could we take seriously the job creation initiatives of the 
government when the only thing it does is wage war on the 
unemployed, while hiding reality behind programs like the one 
the Minister unveiled yesterday in New Brunswick, which will 
affect 1,000 persons and cost the federal government $40 
million over 5 years, when more than a billion is being syphoned 
out of the Maritimes in just two years?

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the hon. member 
of the opposition is beginning to suffer from an acute case of 
selective memory.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is we did not just announce one program 
for New Brunswick. We have also announced a major program 
that will affect young people. We announced an additional $20 
million for young people, 10,000 more spots for summer 
employment. Our red book put forward these initiatives. We will 
be making an announcement very shortly. Places will be 
provided for tens of thousands of young people in internship 
programs. We have announced programs whereby we would put 
people into a youth service corps by the tens of thousands.
<P>
	We have announced programs where we will provide the very 
major stimulus of $800 million right across the country for a 
wide range of new approaches to get people back to work.
<P>
	We said in the red book that the old programs were not 
working. The old ways were not getting people back to work. We 
are dedicated as a government to getting people back to work. In 
order to do that we have to make changes. I wish the hon.

not just defend the status quo.

my question is for the Minister of Finance. Yesterday the 
minister acknowledged that Tuesday's rise in the Bank of 
Canada lending rate is likely to result in higher than budgeted 
costs for servicing the government debt. He insisted the estimate 
for other budget items were conservative and that the overall 
deficit estimate would be achieved.
<P>
	It looks like business as usual. Does the minister admit that 
the high interest rates also will have a negative impact on 
economic growth and tax revenues and that therefore the overall 
deficit forecast is also too low?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows 
the current level of interest rates is substantially lower than the 
level we had six months or a year ago. Yesterday and today the 
vast majority of economists have said the current level will not 
in fact impede the economic growth we are now embarking on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
why was the Canadian dollar under such heavy pressure that the 
Bank of Canada on Tuesday had to increase its lending rate 18 
per cent, or 78 basis points, to a level of 5 per cent and the 
exchange rate today has dropped another four-tenths of 1 per 
cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

the Minister of Finance cannot engage in speculating on the 
reasons for interest rate increases or decreases. I know he also 
realizes that if the Minister of Finance were to do so, he would 
get himself into a lot of trouble. I am sure the member would not

to a Statistics Canada study, the income gap between

expense of francophones. In 1977, this gap in favour of 
anglophones was 4.4 per cent. In 1992, it had increased to 10.3

historical income gap between anglophones and francophones 
narrowed.
<P>

allocation and closure far less frequently than its predecessor. I 
challenge the opposition House leader to raise this again after a

this place run by the minority in the Reform Party.

<P>
	In the Liberal red book the government says it will take a 
series of initiatives to restore confidence in the institutions of

question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	According to many experts, the income gap between 
anglophones and francophones in every province except Quebec 
is due in large part to the educational difficulties encountered by 
francophones. This opinion is shared by the Liberal member for 
Ottawa-Vanier who told the TVA television network 
yesterday: ``We asked for the management of our own schools 
because it goes hand in hand with regular management. We still 
do not have it in Ontario after asking for it continuously for 30 
years''.
<P>
	Does the minister share the opinion of his Liberal colleague 
from Ottawa-Vanier and does he recognize that francophones 
outside Quebec do not enjoy the same rights and privileges as 
anglophones in Canada and Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, what I recognize above all is the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. I recognize the Supreme Court decisions 
defining these rights. I believe these rights should be enforced 
and respected. That is precisely why this government recently 
introduced a Court Challenges Program to help right the wrongs 
done to those who feel their rights have been violated.

that Supreme Court decisions should be implemented, but 
unfortunately they are not.
<P>
	Does the minister admit that the federal government 
miserably failed to ensure that francophone and Acadian 
communities in Canada manage their own schools, and to give 
them enough money to have proper schools, not like those in 
Kingston?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr.

country and we cannot do everything at once.

jurisdiction and what we can do is negotiate with the provinces 
to improve the situation. Negotiations are under way where the 
needs are greater and I hope they will succeed in improving the

	The Canadian publishing industry represents a $2.2 billion 
industry which directly employs over 12,000 Canadians. Many 
of these individuals are in my riding. However this is one 
industry that has been battered by recession, by globalization 
and by foreign competition.
<P>
	Will the minister tell this House what his department and this 
government are doing to support the Canadian publishing 
industry which is so vital to Canada and all our ridings?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> I 
share the concern of my colleague. It is indeed a vital industry. It 
is one we should support and we are doing so.
<P>
	I can indicate the amounts we are putting behind that industry. 
We are providing over $20 million in support to the Canadian 
book publishing industry under publication and distribution 
assistance for the coming fiscal year. We are also providing $24 
million in the coming fiscal year. The postal subsidy for the next 
two years will be over $77 million. That is a total of over $120 
million. That is the support we are giving to that industry.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services.
<P>
	On November 4 last year the Prime Minister promised to 
examine the process of awarding advertising contracts. As yet 
no guidelines have been produced.
<P>
	On February 1 a well known Liberal campaign manager who 
is also a close friend and former employee of the Minister of 
Human Resources Development became a director and owner of 
McKim Communications. Just three days later a federal contract 
worth $5.5 million was extended to him. On the surface this 
appears to be another example of business as usual. I assume the 
minister must approve all these contracts.
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	Besides the ownership of this company is the minister aware 
of an employee or an officer of McKim Communications who is 
closely related to a member of his own cabinet, and could he 
identify that person?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question because it gives us an opportunity to set the 
record straight.
<P>
	Not all that long ago the hon. member stood in the House and 
indicated to members of Parliament that it was a $184 million 
contract. Today it is a $5 million contract. The hon. member 
should know that the Minister of Health has responded to the 
specifics of a question that was raised by a colleague, perhaps in 
the hon. member's absence.
<P>
	However on the broader issue with regard to advertising, 
polling and communications, the hon. member is correct. The 
Prime Minister issued a directive. We are presently reviewing 
the policy and looking at the monetary sum allocated for the 
purposes of the particular program.
<P>
	I am sure the House leader of the Reform Party would concur 
because in the substance of the question he did not in any way 
disagree with the government using polling or consulting or 
advertising for those purposes. I want to assure the hon. member 
that the matter is under active review.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to hear that the matter is under active review, but I believe 
there are enough questions of integrity on the particular issue 
that I would ask the minister, in order to clear this rather 
confusing and muddling answer, if he would initiate a public 
inquiry into this advertising contract to see if there has been any 
improper or political interference in the wording of the 
particular contract.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am tempted to 
refer-however I do not think it would be politically correct in 
terms of the language of the House-to the question as silly.

to the House. I am sorry the hon. member does not like the 
information he is getting. I guess the hon. member would want 
me to say that it was $184 million and not something 
substantially less than $5 million.
<P>
	The facts have been provided by the Minister of Health. All 
the information is readily available. I indicated on a previous 
occasion that if the hon. member wants the details all he has had 
to do is ask, slip us a note.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Finance in 
his capacity as Minister responsible for regional development in 
Quebec.
<P>
	This morning, we learned that as part of its rationalization 
plan, VIA Rail is planning to cancel service on the 
Montreal-Gaspé and Montreal-Chicoutimi runs and to severely 
curtail service between Montreal and Abitibi. In other words, 
after denouncing the cuts to VIA Rail when they were in 
opposition, the Liberals are maintaining the policy of the 
Conservatives and abandoning rail passenger service.
<P>
	Does this mean that once again, VIA Rail will be streamlining 
its operations at the expense of Eastern Canada, and in 
particular, of Quebec which will experience far more drastic rail 
service cuts than Western Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the document to which my hon. colleague is referring is an 
internal VIA Rail document. There is no question that the 
negotiations currently under way will determine to a large 
degree where service cuts will be made.
<P>
	If there is no dramatic improvement in VIA Rail's ability to 
provide service within the budgets allocated by the federal 
government, then some major changes will certainly be made. 
However, no final decision has been made at this time because 
the negotiations are still ongoing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how will the minister responsible for regional 
development in Quebec be able to sanction cuts of this 
magnitude which will hinder regional economic development in 
Quebec by severing an essential link between the regions and 
Montreal?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the decisions that are going to be taken with respect to the 
rationalization of services provided by VIA Rail are going to be 
taken from coast to coast, not just in the province of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	The negotiations that are being conducted right now with 
employees and with the management of VIA Rail are going to 
have a significant impact on what we can provide in terms of rail 
passenger services for Canadians within the restrictions that 
were announced a year ago in a previous budget and confirmed 
in the budget brought down in the House in February.
<P>
	How well we do in these negotiations will have a direct impact 
on how much rail passenger service we can protect in the 
country, in Quebec and elsewhere.

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Revenue.
<P>
	Over the past number of months Greenpeace has been 
carrying out a misinformation campaign in Europe regarding 
forest practices in British Columbia.
<P>
	Canadians are sick and tired of their tax dollars being used to 
support special interest lobby groups. If groups such as 
Greenpeace wish to engage in political activities, they should 
rely solely on the contributions of their supporters and not on 
backing from Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	Will the minister undertake a full scale review of the criteria 
used to determine tax exemption status for Greenpeace and 
other non-profit organizations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the tax exempt status of many organizations is under 
close review by the department. There is a series of cases where 
we have withdrawn that privilege from an organization for 
misuse of funds or not abiding by the required rules.
<P>
	With respect to the particular issue of Greenpeace I will take 
the member's representation, but I know of no examination 
taking place at the present moment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is for the Minister of Natural 
Resources.
<P>
	Given that this misinformation campaign is costing the 
Canadian economy both in terms of lost revenue and lost jobs, 
what is the government doing to counter this misinformation 
campaign in Europe?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once more the member should recognize that we live in 
a democracy where people are expected to have differing 
opinions on many important issues. We have no intention of 
attempting to restrict free debate, provided of course that it does 
not violate the normal rules respecting liable or slander.
<P>

British Columbia and elsewhere in Canada, to follow the same 
types of processes as they have done in the past with respect to 
other Canadian products under attack in Europe, and at least to 
set the record straight.
<P>
	Once again, we do not expect German or any European 
authorities to adopt Draconian restrictions on freedom of speech 
simply to prevent the debate that may be taking place at the 
present time between some group and some industry. That is not

the President of the Treasury Board is responsible are studied by 
the relevant committees.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

today the House will conclude the second reading stage of Bill 
C-18. Tomorrow we will commence debate on Bill C-17, the 
budget implementation bill. If this is not concluded tomorrow 
we will resume debate on this bill after the Easter adjournment 
on April 11.
<P>
	After Bill C-17 is given second reading, we will call 
legislation as follows: report stage and third reading of Bill C-9 
regarding economic affairs, Bill C-4 respecting the NAFTA side 
deals, and Bill C-2 regarding Revenue Canada.
<P>
	We would then turn to the second reading debates on Bill C-7 
regarding the control of certain substances and C-11 respecting 
tobacco.
<P>
	If Bill C-18 were to be reported from the standing committee 
before we have completed this list, we would of course return to 
its consideration at the report stage and third reading. This 
would then put us in a position to proceed with the government's 
motion to ask the procedure committee to prepare a bill 
addressing issues connected with the redistribution process.
<P>
	Finally, it is our intention to devote a day soon after our return

work of the Standing Committee on Procedure which will 
receive Bill C-18 after this House votes second reading later 
today. Under the rules, I do not think that report stage could 
begin until after we return from the Easter break. Certainly we 
would want to call report stage and then third reading of C-18 as 
soon as possible after the bill is reported back to the House from 
the standing committee.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ELECTORALBOUNDARIESREADJUSTMENTSUSPENSIONACT">ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES READJUSTMENT 
SUSPENSION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today as many of my colleagues have to raise some concerns 
about the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Suspension Act 
that we are debating in Parliament.
<P>
	My own riding like everyone else's has come up for boundary 
readjustment under the current proposals. I saw a couple of 
weekends ago in the newspaper the boundary proposals. The 
changes to my boundaries are not putting a big smile on my face. 
I have an extension of the boundaries, way up into the 
Merritt-Princeton area. I now have a riding that encompasses 
everything from urban commuters to Vancouver, loggers and 
farmers in the middle of my riding, right up into 
Merritt-Princeton which is into ranching and mining and 
interior towns that have very little to do with the current 
constituency of Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	I have some problems. I have made presentations in writing to 
the electoral boundaries people to tell them that I will be making 
presentations to them when the opportunity arises to try and 
persuade them that perhaps those cities are better served in the 
Kamloops riding.
<P>
	I am not willing to suspend the boundaries readjustment just 
because my own personal boundary is not to my liking. There 
are several important principles involved here that need to be 
addressed and that have been neglected by the government.
<P>
	The first reason I object to the suspension act is that it thwarts 
the purpose of Parliament in the electoral process. The Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act requires the readjustment of 
federal electoral boundaries every 10 years. There is a 
commission made up of three people. Three people form this 
commission. The chief justice of each province appoints a 
chairperson and the Speaker of the House of Commons, 
someone who sits in your chair, appoints the other two.
<P>
	Both authorities who make up these commissions, the chief 
justice and the Speaker, share the characteristic of total 
impartiality. The commission that we are considering 
suspending is a completely impartial commission. We have to be 
careful in whatever deliberations we make in this House that we 
do not take away from impartiality where impartiality is 
necessary. We must make sure that any commission is not 
politically motivated in any way.
<P>
	My first concern is about this purpose of Parliament. What is 
the purpose of Parliament?
<P>
	I would put to you, Mr. Speaker, that the purpose of 
Parliament is not to interfere in independent judicial type bodies 
just because we do not happen to agree with the outcome. There 
is ample opportunity to make presentation to these boundaries 
commissions and I plan to do that, as I encourage every member 
to do. However, to step in at this stage and say that because some 
of the members of the government do not like the boundaries 
they are willing to thwart the entire purpose of the act is 
unconscionable.
<P>
	Nowhere in the red book is there any mention that this act 
needed to be amended. Nowhere in the speech from the throne is 
there any idea or thought that this needed to be adjusted. The 
first whisper of this that came out was when the boundary 
readjustments came to the members opposite. Suddenly a crisis 
of monumental importance hit this House. It must be changed, it 
must be suspended, the judicial process must be set aside. 
Members opposite for some reason feel that they have to step in 
and somehow make it right.
<P>
	I believe the public is going to see this very cynically. Why 
was this not an issue before? The reason, of course, is obvious. 
There is going to be political meddling in a judicial process and 
this political meddling is unconscionable.
<P>
	Second, this matter has already been thwarted once before. 
Already we have had suspensions on this. Every 10 years we are 
supposed to have new boundary proposals. It has already been 
suspended once before. Now again we are going to set aside a $5 
million commission, having already spent $5 million, when 
section 14 of the act says that each commission shall prepare 
with all reasonable dispatch a report setting out its 
recommendations.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	The last instance was in 1991. Here we are in 1994 and we are 
again not going to have a readjustment. The proposal seems to 
be to put it off for a couple of more years. We will likely go into 
the turn of the century running on a 1981 census. That is totally 
unacceptable, which brings me to my third point, the province of 
British Columbia.
<P>
	B.C. is the fastest growing province. Some 40,000 people 
from within Canada have moved to B.C., mostly from Ontario. 
The shift in the population is going westward. Thirty-five 
thousand additional people came from all other countries of the 
world. We received 20 per cent of Canada's immigration 
population. B.C. is a thriving region of the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2746"> 2746 </A></B>
<P>
	By the looks of it we are going to go into the next election, 
whenever that may be, with the same seat distribution as we had 
in 1981. That is totally unacceptable. I do not understand, even 
if they were the best of intentions, which I question, why we 
would be saddled with inadequate representation going right 
through to the turn of the century.
<P>
	There are other problems with this proposal. The proposal 
will increase the cost. Nowhere in the proposal by the 
government is there anything that suggests that this new review, 
another review, will save us money. It is just another review.
<P>
	Every time politicians get involved in reviews and making 
proposals and considerations, the costs continue to rise. What 
will be the possible advantages? There may or may not be. 
History tells us, precedent has been set, that this is likely to cost 
us more money. It is a tremendous waste of the commissioners' 
time and our money.
<P>
	Another point is the principle of openness. This needs to be 
dealt with openly. It needs to be seen to be open. It needs to be 
seen to be fair. It needs to be seen to be impartial. All of those 
things have been thwarted by this bill. This bill is a behind the 
scenes, I know better than you do attitude that we have seen, as 
we talked earlier in question period about business as usual. 
Instead of bringing this out for open discussion, instead of give 
and take on the floor of the House of Commons, instead of even 
bringing forward specific proposals, what we find here instead 
is a process that says: ``We know best. Not only do we know 
best, we are not willing to allow opposition members to raise 
their concerns to their own liking. We are going to invoke 
closure''.
<P>
	I wonder when this government handed the new shoes to Mr. 
Martin if the new shoes were to step on this, to squelch any ideas 
of democracy-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would just like to 
remind members to refer to one another according to the 
positions being held by the respective members and not their 
names.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I stand corrected and I will make no 
further reference to the boots.
<P>
	However it does appear that taking the boots to some of these 
representations appears to be the purpose of this bill. While I 
originally prepared a 20 minute presentation detailing the entire 
pros and cons of a review process, I find now that it has 
unfortunately been reduced to 10 minutes because of this idea 
that closure somehow is in the best interest of democracy.
<P>
	I think I need to summarize it in this way, since I have been 
restricted in my time. First, this thwarts the purpose of 
Parliament. Parliament is not to set boundaries to just jump in 
when members do not like what they see. Parliament is to set up 
a process. The process is in place. When it continually gets put 
off year after year it does nothing to enhance people's 
impression that this is truly  a democratic and hands off process. 
That is the first principle, the principle that alarms me the most.
<P>
	Second, as I mentioned, is this lack of proportional 
representation. I know the government says it is going to review 
it. It may have more, it may have less. Who knows what the 
review will come up with when the Liberals come up with these 
proposals? The fact is that we will go into the next election in 
British Columbia with fewer representatives than we deserve.
<P>
	That has been going on since 1981. It appears it will go on 
through to the turn of the century with the same disproportionate 
representation that we had to go with this last time.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	That is the second principle that is undesirable, the increased 
costs, the $5 million down the drain and the fact that we will not 
be able to use the extensive advertising. I have with me the sheet 
that describes the new boundaries which was delivered through 
the paper system to every household in Canada. Those costs are 
all for naught. Many of us prepared briefs and speeches for these 
advertised meetings. Our work is all for naught.
<P>
	The fact is it is no longer an open process but instead, when 
things are not going their way, the process has been cut off. 
Another nail in the coffin of openness. In conclusion, I have a 
couple of proposals that I would like to make to the government.
<P>
	First of all I would ask them to reconsider this whole idea of 
closure. I have sheets of <I>Hansard</I> that I dug up that I do not have 
time to read out today. I have almost three pages in the indexes 
from the last Parliament. It took three pages just to list the 
names of the speakers on the other side of the House that rose to 
speak against closure and time limitation.
<P>
	It is a shame that when something that should be impartial and 
above reproach that government members, many of whom are 
listed in the three index pages, have chosen instead to clamp 
down on democratic discussion on this judicial process. It is a 
shame.
<P>
	I cannot believe the government would use this bill to invoke 
closure to stifle free speech in the House. If it were not for the 
time constraints of Easter coming up the government would 
probably go on. It is a shame that to get a holiday they are going 
to invoke closure and clamp down on democratic free speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate. 
We have heard many strong negatives both from the government 
side and the opposition side about the way the revision of the 
federal electoral boundaries took place.
<P>
	The province of Ontario is about to gain four seats. I would 
like to talk a bit about why I am against it. It is not to stifle free 
speech. The body politic of Canada should have some input into 
saying where the boundary changes should be made. As a 
consequence everyone is looking at the House as the sole 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2747"> 2747 </A></B>
<P>
ownership of this. Let us give the public some say in its 
operation.
<P>
	Most Canadians and particularly residents of Ontario did not 
hear about the revision. It came as a shock to them and they had 
to respond in some cases as early as the next two weeks. So to 
mobilize, to liaise one with another, to communicate with those 
groups who have been disturbed, to question why such changes 
have taken place, the time was not there. We are talking a lot of 
people and we are talking the affect. I am talking of mobilizing 
and reacting to the changes in my own province of Ontario.
<P>
	Ontario presently has 99 seats. One of the rules under which 
this commission was to undertake change was that there would 
be a minimum of disturbance of existing boundaries.
<P>
	They talk about the ripple effect. I want to tell you that if there 
was ever a ripple it was a big ripple in Ontario to get four seats. 
Ninety-three of the ridings were changed rather significantly.
<P>
	The principle was that there be some approximation in size in 
the constituencies in Ontario. The commission's mandate gave a 
rather generous leeway. Twenty-five per cent is a rather large 
deviation from the norm.
<P>
	As a consequence, in Ontario the demographic computer 
crunched them out closely with its cookie cruncher to the 97,000 
to 100,000 range. Many ridings that were sitting well within that 
range and smack on 100,000 had radical change and it has upset 
the communities in which that change took place.
<P>
	In my riding the county council will be taking a bus to the 
hearing. The city councils and the township councils will be 
taking a bus to the hearing because traditionally a constituency 
has a community of interest. That community of interest is 
focused on its local governments whether they be township, 
town, city or county.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Many of these fundamental community of interests were 
hacked in half and for no reason attached to another half of 
another county that was hacked in half. The rationale of 
community of interest seemed to go by the board. That is why we 
are upset. I can tell members that my constituents are upset. This 
is the second major change in southwestern Ontario and only 
one riding escaped without any change whatsoever.
<P>
	As a consequence, I would like to make a point that the ripple 
effect in 93 of the 99 ridings was not acceptable to the residents 
of Ontario. These residents are not all Liberals although I would 
like to think they would be.
<P>
	I have received protests from people from all walks of life and 
it does not have anything to do with my being a Liberal member. 
They do not want to be associated with someone who has been 
connected with another township. There is a narrow gap and we 
go back into another base.
<P>
	It does not even have any sort of congruency or shape. It is 
stretched out to almost Lake Huron and on the other side, 
Waterloo county. It was a compact riding of 101,000 people 
meeting specific criteria where community of interest and size 
were dead on. The people in my riding want to know what the 
rationale was for the major surgery in the riding of 
Perth-Wellington-Waterloo.
<P>
	I would like to read from the direction and general notes given 
to the commissioners on their mandate. The act directs the 
commission to divide Ontario into 103 districts. On the basis of 
the population of each electoral district in the province, it shall 
be as close as reasonably possible to correspond to the electoral 
quota of that province.
<P>
	We all know that some of the ridings in northern Ontario, by 
their nature, by the ability to service the constituency, must 
necessarily be smaller than some of the ridings in the urban 
areas where one can contact and relate to their constituents in a 
speedier manner.
<P>
	For those of us who were in urban-rural ridings, the norm 
would be about 100,000. The commission may depart from this 
quota where necessary or desirable. The commission's 
judgment lay in directives and it has given the two 
commissioners for Ontario tremendous scope.
<P>
	First, the commission is to respect the community of interest 
or community of identity in the historical pattern of an electoral 
district in the province. That one has been shot out of the water 
in a big way.
<P>
	Second, it is to maintain a manageable geographic size for 
districts in sparsely populated, rural or northern regions of the 
province. I concur with that.
<P>
	In considering these factors, the commission must make 
every effort to ensure that except in extraordinary circumstances 
the population of each electoral district remains within 25 per 
cent, a reasonably grand margin of error I would say by any 
statement. The upper limit of the quota plus 25 per cent from the 
norm which is 122,000 to the lower limit of 25 per cent which is 
73,000 is very rarely reached. The first principle was totally 
compromised so that the second principle could crunch out 
ridings with populations of 97,000 to 103,000. The community 
of interest and the community of economic interest, which is 
just as important in most of those ridings, was shot out of the 
water, to use a colloquial term.
<P>
<B></B>

<HR>

<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	I dare say that with Ontario gaining four seats, I am not 
prepared to compromise that nor would I like to see my friends 
from British Columbia suffer any loss of seats. I would like to 
add a little comparison. Take a look at the House today. These 
seats have been moved so close together that if even I put on a 
little weight, which has not happened for a long time, it would be 
difficult to get between the seats.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> I am not a health nut.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson</B> I am sorry. I did not mean to reflect on any 
other member in the House.
<P>
	However, if some day in the future we approach the 
population of our neighbours to the south, we will need 3,000 
seats in the House of Commons. We are going to have to look at 
the size of ridings in the country so we can keep a reasonable 
number in Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been in 
politics for about 20 years, and I have never seen such a mess. I 
must admit this is the first time I been particularly aware of the 
social and economic impact of adjusting the federal electoral 
map.
<P>
	When I was quite young, my mother used to get bored while 
my father, who was a travelling salesman, was away, and she 
would do jigsaw puzzles. After looking at the proposed electoral 
map, my impression was that the people who drew this map must 
have been very bored indeed to perpetrate this proposal, pardon 
the expression.
<P>
	I found it hard to understand the logic involved in this 
electoral boundaries readjustment proposal, and I did some 
quick research on ridings in East Montreal that were affected by 
this proposal. One conclusion is be that the proposal ignores 
socio-demographic and socio-economic factors to all intents 
and purposes. The proposal shows a complete disregard for any 
concept of community. In other words, it was botched.
<P>
	A riding should first and foremost represent a community. We 
cannot get around this social fact. It is foolish to alter the 
boundaries of a riding and blindly carve up natural communities 
to satisfy the demands of fuzzy mathematical logic and 
administrative efficiency.
<P>
	A member of Parliament is elected to serve the interests of his 
constituents, not those technocrats who very often have no 
concept of the practical needs of community groups. A member 
of Parliament must defend the interests of individuals, 
community groups and businesses and promote the development 
of economic activity in his riding.
<P>
	The proposed administrative boundaries transform a number 
of communities into a meaningless expanse of statistical data 
and arbitrary geographic divisions. Let me explain. All this has 
no connection with the activities of these communities. I am 
talking about neighbourhoods, urban districts, people living in a 
naturally homogeneous environment, which may be cultural, 
ethnic, religious or  economic, a living community, organized in 
human terms and not for administrative purposes alone.
<P>
	As I said before, I made some enquiries among my colleagues 
in East Montreal to assess the impact of the proposed 
readjustment. Here are a few examples. I may recall that 
Montreal is divided into administrative units referred to as 
<I>arrondissements</I> or districts.
<P>
	In the riding of Mercier, the urban district of Mercier-Ouest is 
cut in two. This means breaking up a natural demographic unit 
for the sake of mathematical considerations. From now on, three 
federal members will be working to promote the interests of the 
same social groups and the same economic organizations, while 
at the provincial level, a single member is able to take care of the 
same needs in the provincial riding of Bourget.
<P>
	In the federal riding of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve we see the 
same lack of logic. Why cut the provincial riding of Bourget in 
two? This arbitrary division is as distasteful to the people of 
Mercier as it is to the people of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. Once 
again, this means fracturing a natural urban district.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the proposal adds onto the northern part of the 
riding a population which has no natural affinity, other than 
geographical, to the riding of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. It 
would be more appropriately added to the riding of 
Saint-Léonard, in terms of socio-demographic affinity.
<P>
	In Rosemont, the riding will get part of the riding of 
Saint-Michel which, again, has no social affinity to the 
population in Rosemont, while, the riding would welcome the 
annexation of part of Outremont, so that its boundaries would 
coincide with those of the LCSCs-local community service 
centres-and urban districts.
<P>
	The case of Papineau-Saint-Michel is rather peculiar. The 
riding of the Minister of Foreign Affairs has been struck off the 
map. What is the reasoning behind this decision? Part of the 
population of this homogeneous riding, which includes the 
former town of Saint-Michel, its parishes, recreation services, 
health care institutions and community groups, has been moved 
to the riding of Saint-Léonard, a riding which practically 
coincides with the town of Saint-Léonard. We now have a 
situation where the population of the former town of 
Saint-Michel will be a minority, in the new riding.
<P>
	The other half of Papineau-Saint-Michel has been moved to 
the riding of Saint-Denis, which will extend to Acadie 
Boulevard. People in Montreal realize how ridiculous this is. 
The community resources of two districts in Montreal's centre 
north will be disorganized as a result.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2749"> 2749 </A></B>
<P>
	In my riding of Ahuntsic, the results are positively outlandish. 
Parishes are being cut in two and communities divided, just to 
align the riding on the Laurentian Autoroute. For the sake of 
geographic convenience, part of the northeast corner of 
Ahuntsic is transferred to another riding. This area, which is 
isolated from all other areas with the exception of Ahuntsic, has 
a large Italian community, which in the process would also be 
isolated from its natural centre, the Italian parish of 
Notre-Dame-de-Pompéi. This community would no longer 
enjoy integrated federal representation. Between this area and 
its new riding lies the vast Miron quarry dump.
<P>
	Saint-Sulpice, where I live, is faced with a similar situation. 
The parish is separated from its community organizations, and 
so forth. Yet, this neighourhood portion is isolated from its new 
riding by the Metropolitan Boulevard, a high-technology 
centre, schools and recreational centres. The government is 
destroying an integration process that has been patiently 
developed for the last ten years.
<P>
	In the proposed project, we find the same lack of logic that 
appeared in the case of the riding of Laval-des-Rapides, 
between 1976 and 1989, when it overlapped Laval and Montreal. 
It had to be seen to be believed!
<P>
	May I also point out that the numerous divisions of 
employment centres do not fit electoral boundaries, which 
undoubtedly contributes to maintaining the confusion among 
people towards services provided by these centres and by the 
federal government.
<P>
	I would also wish to remind you that the very concept of a 
one-stop window implies harmonization, at all levels of 
government, of administrative divisions, so that we can provide 
services and grants from the same social, demographical and 
economic territories. That is a major demand by the economic 
and community development co-operatives, the CDEC of 
Montreal.
<P>
	We cannot ignore the map of disadvantaged areas that was 
drawn by the Island of Montreal School Board, major social and 
economic data. It is more than desirable that Montreal be given, 
at the federal level, effective electoral representation which 
takes into account the indicators of disadvantaged areas.
<P>
	In concluding, I would point out that the criteria for the 
division of these federal electoral maps have not been reviewed 
in almost 30 years. These criteria should be developed on the 
basis of social demographical and social economical data, rather 
than on the simplistic basis, should I say, of raw and blind 
mathematical data! On the basis of administrative and/or 
geographical convenience that has nothing to do with the real 
areas where people live.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Participating in public hearings on the basis of this 
redistribution would amount to saying that we view it as an 
acceptable basis for negociation while it is not.
<P>
	Negociating on an individual basis, county by county, would 
cause other Montreal ridings to lose their homogeneity.
<P>
	The overall proposal made by the commission is 
unacceptable. The parliamentary committee has to start from 
scratch again. Dealing with the same commission and doing all 
over again what has already been badly done would only lead to 
the same results.
<P>
	The system has to be changed and this is why I will vote for 
the bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, the riding of 
Halton-Peel was originally created by a gentleman many of us 
know: Gerrymander.
<P>
	One would think with the proposed boundary changes the 
member would be quite thrilled that a new riding would be 
created. I believe the new dividing line was created by his 
brother for it splits a community right in two in a line that is 
anything but straight. Some of it does not even follow road 
allowances but travels through the middle of farmers' fields.
<P>
	It is so ridiculous. Part of the farm on which I live is in the new 
proposed riding and the other part is in the other. There was 
immediate response from a returning officer, from a Chamber of 
Commerce and from a municipality exhorting an appeal of that 
line.
<P>
	As a bit of an aside, it is also interesting to note the borders 
printed on the map in the book the commission released. You 
will see that the new boundaries are printed upside down on the 
map. It puts part of the land mass in the southern part of the 
proposed riding in Lake Ontario. It was cause for some concern. 
We will have to enroll fish I suppose.
<P>
	Having said that I was prepared to launch an appeal trying to 
point out to the commission where changes could be made that 
might at least improve the situation.
<P>
	I was very disturbed with the proposal to create new ridings at 
a time when we consider ourselves to be in a period of extreme 
restraint. When we want less and less government spending it 
seems this process is creating more and more.
<P>
	In my region and others nearby school boards are considering 
reducing the number of trustees in an effort to save money. The 
last report I saw was that the region of Durham is proposing to 
cut five trustees saving $200,000 through that process. It does 
not really show a great deal of leadership to advance the cause of 
increasing the numbers in this House.
<P>

<P>

	Other countries operate reasonably successfully with much 
higher populations per member than Canada. Australia is one of 
them with actually double the population per member in its 
House.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	We have a lot of things to consider. If we are going to review 
legislation which is 30 years old, at least it is appropriate that we 
do it now if it has not been done in the past. As has been 
mentioned, it may be that it has outlived its usefulness and we 
have to reconsider what will be done in the future.
<P>
	In terms of the argument my friends in the Reform Party put 
forward about time allocation, I would like to point out the 
reality to them. I do not think it is the intention of any 
government to impose time allocation for frivolous reasons.
<P>
	Hearings were scheduled to begin in April on this proposal by 
the commission. We are now going into a recess for two weeks. I 
am not sure what the Reform Party would have preferred to do, 
whether it would have preferred to stay and debate this for 
another couple of weeks. We could have filibustered. However 
there is plenty of time in the time allocated to put the points of 
view across and make sure all of the arguments are on the table.
<P>
	I am sure the Reform Party is as interested in the reform of 
this process as the rest of us. I do not think any hon. members 
would disagree with the fact that it is time for a change. We 
cannot go on filling up the House especially if we have a few 
guys my size. If we went on without any changes we would be 
forced to knock out the back walls, or put another row in the 
front, or only elect lean people.
<P>
	I enthusiastically support this thrust. The time has come for 
change. The time has come to reconsider how the people of 
Canada are represented. The time has come to listen to those 
people and give them time to bring their views forward so we 
can truly represent the people of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
speak against Bill C-18, an act to suspend the operation of the 
Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act. I do that with some 
mixed feelings.
<P>
	My own riding is disappearing in this change which is going 
to take place across Canada and very significantly in the 
province of Ontario. There has been only one call into my office 
regarding this change and perhaps that is because they were 
anticipating going to the hearings, as I was. However I 
anticipate receiving many calls when the people in my riding 
discover what is taking place in this House.
<P>
	In no way was this a burning issue with the people in this 
country. There are far more important issues we should be 
dealing with. While I say I had mixed feelings about what was 
happening in the riding I represent, I was looking forward to 
making a representation at the hearings. We would have an 
opportunity to make representations again when the reports 
came back into this House.
<P>
	In looking at the changes I realized there were some winners 
and some losers. There are going to be winners and losers no 
matter where this comes out. We will not come up with a plan 
that will please everyone. That just is not possible. There is no 
evidence in this bill that will approach anything near that.
<P>
	There is the suggestion that politicians will be able to do a 
better job than Elections Canada. That is a leap of faith most 
Canadians would have a difficult time making. Our track record 
in the past has not been one of doing a better job.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	The decision was made 30 years ago to take this process out of 
the political arena. That was a good decision that was made back 
then. I think it is even more appropriate today, given the mood of 
the Canadian voter.
<P>
	We just have to reflect back to October 1992 at which time 
politics in the country took a dramatic turn for the better. The 
Canadian people said back then that they were no longer going 
to be led by the political parties. They were going to have a say 
in what was going on in the country. They sent out that very clear 
message.
<P>
	That message can be ignored in the House at our peril. The 
former government ignored the message that was given to it by 
Meech Lake. The former government ignored the message that 
was relayed to it through the Spicer commission at a cost of 
some $27 million in taxpayers' dollars. The government was 
told what the priorities of the Canadian people were and that the 
Constitution was not number one. In spite of that the 
government ignored it, went on with its own agenda and suffered 
its fate in the last election.
<P>
	The mood of the Canadian people that was evident in 1992 and 
1993 is still there. They want to be heard. They want to have 
their say. The process we are about to embark on will be a denial 
of that.
<P>
	We are not talking about process today. We are talking about 
product. We knew this was coming down the pike some time 
ago, but nothing happened until the proposed boundary changes 
hit our desks and hit the public. All of a sudden it became an 
issue. There was no secret about what was happening. It is not 
about the process. It is about the product and it is about 
self-interest: my fiefdom and what is going to happen to me. I 
think that is wrong.
<P>
	The issue is not new. It has been there but it is in the forefront 
now because some people's ridings will be affected by it. The 
government is going to circumvent the public hearings that were 
to take place so that the public could have input into the process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2751"> 2751 </A></B>
<P>
	How do we justify wasting the $5 million in taxpayers' dollars 
that have been spent to this point? The suggestion has been made 
that the $3 million we might spend in hearing from the public 
would be a further waste of taxpayers' dollars. I do not find 
spending $3 million to hear from the taxpayers a waste of 
money. Again I go back to the mood of the voters. They want to 
be heard and $3 million to allow them to have input will be 
money well spent.
<P>
	Time and time again I have heard from members on the other 
side about the number of seats. They are shocked that Reform 
would support anything that would increase the number of seats 
in the House. There is nothing in the bill that restricts the 
number of seats. Had that been in there, the Reform Party would 
have supported the bill. It is not there. I would ask members on 
the other side: Why is it not there? There is no intent. It is left 
out purposely so that avenue would still be there.
<P>
	Hearings were due to start in days and the process is being cut 
off. People were preparing to come to these hearings to state 
their case. Again it is an example of government knows best: 
``We will decide what should happen here and we will let you 
know''. That is not going to fly with the Canadian people.
<P>
	I was shocked at what was taking place. Really I should not 
have been because the government has a track record of no faith 
in the Canadian people. When we think back, this is the 
government that did not have faith in some Canadian people to 
select its candidates. The government had to go in because it did 
not trust Canadian people to pick the right candidates. This is the 
government that does not believe in recall. It does not trust 
Canadian people to have recall at their disposal.
<P>
	This party is led by a leader who finds referendum revolting. 
The thought of listening to the Canadian people on major issues 
is revolting. Those words will come back to haunt the 
government in years to come. The government can act when it 
wants to. When it has a self-interest it can get moving. There 
was something the Canadian people wanted it to get moving on. 
We wanted it to get moving on it and we were prepared to 
support it. I am referring to the gold-plated pension plans. This 
is something that we could have taken action on and should have 
taken action on, but nothing is happening. The words we hear 
are: ``What is the hurry? We are here for four years''. The 
government may not be in a hurry about that but the Canadian 
people are. The Canadian people want action. The government 
brought us action on this but not on the pension plan.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The question of the legality of the process was raised in the 
House yesterday. The answer given to that question bore no 
relationship to the question. I suspect because a legal opinion 
has not been sought the government does not have an answer as 
to whether the whole process is legal.
<P>
	I see some similarities here between the cancelled Pearson 
airport deal and what we are about to do today. The Pearson 
airport deal was cancelled, not because the project was not a 
good project but because of the process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Your 
Honour is well known for leniency on relevancy, but what do the 
points the hon. member is raising-he is covering the 
waterfront-have to do with the item being discussed?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do not believe the 
member has a point of order, so I will resume debate with the 
hon. member for Simcoe Centre.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, the point I was 
just about to make was on the similarity between the 
cancellation of the Pearson airport deal and what we are about to 
embark on here. The point I am making is that the deal was 
cancelled on the airport four months ago and nothing has 
happened. We are about to change this deal and I would suggest 
that nothing is going to happen. We will go into the next election 
with nothing having been resolved. That is one of the real 
dangers in this.
<P>
	Just let me summarize with a few comments. The government 
needs to have more faith in the Canadian people to look at this 
matter and do what is right. There will be some very interesting 
comments coming out of the hearings that were scheduled. The 
government should not throw away the millions of taxpayers' 
dollars already spent up to this point. That is what will be done. 
It is going to throw away $5 million of our taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	This process does not belong in the political arena. With the 
vested interest that politicians have, how can they address the 
issue objectively and do what is best for the Canadian people? If 
we support the bill we will kill any chance for change before the 
next election.
<P>
	With those remarks I will conclude. I thank the House for 
allowing me to make this presentation. I certainly will not be 
supporting Bill C-18.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I also rise to speak on the matter now before the House 
concerning the redistribution of the federal electoral 
boundaries.
<P>
	It is clear from all indications that Canadians are not happy 
with how the review and the proposals for change have been 
handled. Further, Canadians are reasonably consistent in their 
message as to why. They will not take judgments from on high 
without more consultation.
<P>
	The preliminary steps leading to the proposed boundary 
changes fail to include local level consultation. It is not enough 
to hold out the promise of public input later on, because people 
know how difficult it is to amend such proposals after they have 
been designed in the way they have. People have once again sent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2752"> 2752 </A></B>
<P>
out a clear signal that they will not accept another top down, 
arbitrary decision by government.
<P>
	Within my own constituency when a map appeared in a 
special insert in the local paper I heard a number of consistent 
messages from constituents. First, they were shocked to learn 
that the boundary changes were even being discussed. For most 
of them seeing the map in the paper was the first time they had 
ever heard of the exercise. Another common expression was one 
of disbelief. After we had all campaigned so vocally about the 
need to be more inclusive and since the government has 
practised this agenda so consistently since the election, people 
find it hard to believe that we would revert to the old style of top 
down governing.
<P>
	As members we have all worked hard to gain the trust of our 
electorate. I know many of us do not wish to see that trust 
jeopardized when the potential not to do so is so easily avoided.
<P>
	Another sentiment I have heard from my constituents is one of 
anger. People are angry, not only because the government had 
not bothered to consult with them but also because of the 
incredible amount of dollars invested in the exercise. People 
were shocked, wondering where was the need for this use of 
their hard earned tax dollars. Where did it come from? People 
were wondering why nobody had bothered to mention it to them 
earlier and why nobody had asked for their opinion.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	As the member for the riding of Fredericton-York-Sunbury 
I can assure the House that I felt the sting of this action when 
people questioned my involvement in and my responsibility for 
the proposed changes. People were not happy, and that is 
essentially why I feel compelled to rise today and encourage the 
government to have this process stopped.
<P>
	I want to acknowledge that riding boundary redistribution is 
in many respects necessary, but I take issue with the way the 
process for determining changes has occurred. I further question 
some of the present assumptions about how boundaries should 
be redefined. I addressed my concerns about the process earlier. 
I continue to believe that decisions should have been made 
based on consultation with the many people affected. I question 
how many Canadians know the criteria upon which decisions for 
change were even made.
<P>
	We must realize that decisions of this nature have an 
enormous impact upon the political culture of our country. 
People tend to feel connected to the regions and communities of 
which they are a part. We all belong to many types of 
communities, each of which has boundaries in its own way. In 
many respects we are defined by our professional communities, 
our religious and social communities, and for many we find 
comfort in defining ourselves by our political communities.
<P>
	My most recent witness of this assertion was during the last 
election. I watched and worked with people from all parties who 
travelled considerable distances many times over and who put 
parts of their own lives on hold because of their commitment to 
the electoral process. Last October became their focus.
<P>
	We do people an injustice when we suddenly tell them that 
they no longer need to feel committed to the region they have 
always known and that now they must suddenly align 
themselves elsewhere. Making such a transition is not difficult. 
In fact it is embraced when those who must make the change 
participate in the decision making that moves them from one 
location to another.
<P>
	If anything, commitment and investment are firmly 
entrenched from the start. It is this kind of stake in the social and 
political consciousness of our citizenry that we want to promote 
among Canadians. Imposing arbitrary political boundary 
changes upon people works counter to the fundamentals of 
inclusion and affiliation.
<P>
	I accept that redistribution becomes necessary when there are 
major demographic shifts. Sometimes this may mean that the 
entire country must face reoganization, or it may simply mean 
that certain regions must change.
<P>
	The changes proposed for New Brunswick in many respects 
fail to make any sense at all. With my own riding, for instance, 
all the rural areas have been disconnected from the constituency 
and given over to my colleagues' ridings. Were I selfishly 
motivated I would support the changes proposed since it would 
make my job much easier. I would not have to travel the 
considerable distances to reach the borders of my riding. I would 
only have to deal with concerns pertinent to an urban setting 
rather than worry about both rural and urban problems as the 
distribution now requires.
<P>
	That is not what being an MP is about. I do not want to lose the 
rich blend of rural and urban that makes our riding a most unique 
and inviting place to live. It is obvious that my reasons for 
supporting the motion to suspend the operation of the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act are not personally or politically 
motivated. I know this to be true of my colleagues with a view 
similar to my own.
<P>
	I know the people of my riding just as other members are 
familiar with the citizens in their ridings. We work hard to build 
communities with our constituents. The people of their 
respective ridings know the intricacies and peculiarities of their 
places as well. These are the people who should be deciding 
where boundaries should be drawn and on what basis changes 
should be determined.
<P>
	I do not question the competence or intentions of the 
commissioners but outside experts do not know our political 
regions or the people who live there. They cannot make 
informed decisions 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2753"> 2753 </A></B>
<P>
about changing the lives of so many citizens without starting 
with the involved people first.
<P>
	I worry as well that by following through with electoral 
boundary reform the government will not be seen as acting on its 
primary agenda of job creation and economic development. I 
also think the government will find it difficult to convince 
Canadians that it is acting prudently in its acknowledged need to 
practise sound financial management.
<P>
	I fear spending millions of dollars to redefine electoral 
boundaries is indefensible in the light of the economic trials 
faced by so many Canadians. The government is recognized as 
honest, hard working, concerned about citizens and known for 
practising sound fiscal management. We are not known for 
excessiveness. We are the ones with the plan to help Canadians 
through the difficult period in order to make this a strong, united 
and able country prepared to meet the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	We need to remind ourselves of our own priorities and in 
keeping with that, we should recognize our error without 
singling out anyone or pointing fingers in any direction. Simply 
put, we should cut our losses and move on from here. Canadians 
are tired of governments trying to justify their errors or failing 
to admit that a mistake has been made. We are bigger than that. 
We must move on.
<P>
	I join others in this House who have spoken against boundary 
redistribution at this time and I support the call to suspend the 
act until such time as Canadians have a greater opportunity to be 
a part of the process from the front end.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it seemed important to participate in this debate on 
a legislation which would postpone for 24 months the process 
initiated by the federal electoral boundaries commission. It 
seemed important to do so since the redistribution of electoral 
boundaries is not an operation one does for statistical purposes; 
it is not an exercise for an apprentice geographer who would like 
to practice his trade and increase his skill and knowledge. 
Redistributing could change the habits of the citizens and of the 
decision-makers in a given living environment.
<P>
	In my riding of Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, if the 
proposed reform were to be implemented, it would have 
disastrous effects. That is why, before we proceed with such a 
redistribution of boundaries, we must determine the basic 
criteria for changes which might be necessary under certain 
circumstances.
<P>
	In the present legislation, one of the main criteria is equal 
representation for each and every constituent. This is basically 
commendable since in a democracy, we must ensure that no 
group of individuals has more power or better representation 
than others. But we must also consider other principles; I am 
thinking here more specifically of respect for the living 
environment, in other  words communities of interests, as 
mentioned in the documents presented to us.
<P>
	When one undertakes such an exercise, one has to take into 
account the sense of belonging of the people, instead of 
separating them and creating a situation where it will be many 
years before this feeling emerges again. That is why I would like 
to take the next few minutes to explain in graphic details the 
impact the proposed changes would have in my riding of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead.
<P>
	I will first remind the members that, for the time being, as we 
speak, the Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead riding has a 
population of 75 000. It is nearly entirely located in 
administrative district No. 5, that is to say in the Eastern 
Townships, in Quebec. In this riding, there are two regional 
county municipalities, structures that were created about 20 
years ago now with a view to planning the social and economic 
development of some communities. Presently, the riding is 
made up of two whole RCMs and part of four others. I am talking 
about the RCM of Granit, which includes the Lac-Mégantic 
area, of which nearly all of the municipalities are in the 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead riding.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	There is also the RCM of Sherbrooke, two out of eight 
municipalities of which are in my riding, as well as the RCM of 
Memphrémagog, of which more than half the municipalities are 
now part of my riding, and some municipalities of which are part 
of the provincial riding of Beauce, next to Lac-Mégantic.
<P>
	According to the proposed reform, the 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead riding would be split into two 
new ridings, one called Mégantic-Frontenac and the other one, 
Compton-Stanstead. As for the district of 
Mégantic-Frontenac, this new district would be primarily 
comprised of the municipalities of Lac-Mégantic and the 
vicinity as well as municipalities around Thetford Mines.
<P>
	This would effectively jeopardize what I mentioned a minute 
ago, that is to say this sense of belonging developed over the 
years within the Lac-Mégantic area and the Eastern Townships 
as a whole.
<P>
	Let me give you a very concrete example. Recently, two 
RCMs from my district, namely the RCM of 
Haut-Saint-François, which encompasses East Angus, 
Cookshire and La Patrie, and the RCM of Granit which, as I said 
earlier, includes the Lac-Mégantic area, have agreed on a major 
economic development plan based on tourist activites around 
Mount Mégantic which straddles the two regional 
municipalities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2754"> 2754 </A></B>
<P>
	It took years of discussions to get these people to see their 
economic development as a common venture and come up with a 
joint action plan to develop this fabulous tourist site, thus 
contributing to economic growth in that area. If boundaries were 
to be readjusted as planned, Lac-Mégantic would end up in the 
same district as Thetford Mines and would be split between two 
administrative regions: on the one hand, the Quebec 
administrative region and, on the other hand, the Eastern 
Township administrative region, which includes Sherbrooke 
and Lac-Mégantic.
<P>
	This would make the political channels that much more 
complicated, with more members having to meet to promote 
issues and more officials having to learn to work together, and 
that, as I said earlier, is very important and takes years.
<P>
	This concrete example illustrates the effects a decision to 
make two new districts out of this one could have. Decisions 
made by electoral boundaries commissions do affect people in 
their everyday life.
<P>
	This kind of decision should never be made without proper 
consideration and not by officials alone. Time should be allowed 
to consult the people involved, the general public, to ensure that 
the result of the readjustment will truly be in the interests of 
these people.
<P>
	I spoke more specifically about the riding of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, but as chairman of the Bloc's 
Eastern Townships regional caucus, I must mention that the 
same exercise would considerably modify the ridings of 
Brome-Missisquoi, Richmond-Wolfe and Frontenac.
<P>
	I come back to what I said at the beginning: what is the main 
reason for making this change? It is to ensure that the number of 
people represented in each riding is more nearly the same.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I would like to give you some eloquent figures in this regard. 
If you compare the present situation to the one proposed in the 
reform, the riding of Frontenac now has 61,000 people; the new 
riding of Mégantic-Frontenac would have a population of 
about 72,000, so a balance is being restored here.
<P>
	In the riding of Brome-Missisquoi, the difference is barely 
8,000 and in Richmond-Wolfe, it is 10,000 at most. In the 
riding I represent, the change would be scarcely 2,000, so this 
argument does not hold for ridings in the Eastern Townships.
<P>
	That is why I will support Bill C-18, which would delay this 
process and provide for time to consult the people and involve 
the representatives and elected members of each of the ridings 
so that the change we finally come up with will benefit all the 
people we represent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to the closure or time 
allocation motion introduced today by the government.
<P>
	This motion refers to Bill C-18, an act to suspend the 
operation of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act. It is 
not good to have the government move to cut off debate so that 
this bill can receive approval quickly.
<P>
	I wonder if this is the tip of the iceberg, the arrogance and lack 
of respect for debate in Parliament. If it is this will be an all time 
record because even the previous Conservative government took 
longer than five months to reach these heights of disrespect for 
this institution.
<P>
	I am speaking in opposition to Bill C-18, an act to suspend the 
operation of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act. I 
believe we should allow the process which began some time ago 
under the old legislation to continue until it is completed. I 
submit that there has been sufficient time, energy and money 
invested in the process to date to make it irresponsible on the 
part of the government to suggest that the process be halted.
<P>
	I am aware of the criticisms of the present process which are 
contained in the report of the Royal Commission on Electoral 
Reform and Party Financing in relation to the boundary 
readjustment legislation. I am also aware that the present 
boundary readjustment process was delayed in the last 
Parliament with the idea that a new process could be put in place 
prior to the call of the general election in 1993.
<P>
	What happened was that the special committee of the House 
of Commons on electoral reform ran out of time and was unable 
to deal with this subject. Therefore, the process which we are 
now involved in began and has run until we now have boundary 
proposals from the provincial commissions before us and public 
hearings are set to being shortly.
<P>
	What will happen if Bill C-18 is passed? We know that the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs will be 
charged with reviewing the whole process and making 
recommendations for change. However, can we be assured that 
the process which will result from this study will be put in place 
prior to the next general election? I do not think so.
<P>
	We have a process in place now which if allowed to go to 
completion will bring into effect new boundaries before the next 
election. We are assured of that fact. Therefore, the next election 
will be fought under boundaries which are representative of the 
population distribution as presented in the last census. Doing 
anything to jeopardize this process does not make sense to me. 
At this time I want to endorse the position taken by the 
Brampton Board of Trade in a letter dated March 22, 1994 to the 
Prime Minister where it states: ``It is not appropriate nor 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2755"> 2755 </A></B>
<P>
necessary for a review committee to step in at this time and shut 
down the public process''.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	We as members of this House do not have ownership of our 
ridings. We should not feel threatened by changes proposed if 
these changes recognize representation by population. This is 
one of the main reasons for having our 10 year census so that 
boundaries can be drawn which accurately reflect population 
distribution.
<P>
	If Bill C-18 is approved we may be fighting the next general 
election on the boundaries which reflect population as it was 
distributed in 1980. If the government is so vitally concerned 
about the process of redistribution and whether it creates ridings 
which accurately represent rep by pop then there is nothing to 
prevent the procedure and House affairs committee under its 
mandate and under the new rules to study the matter at length 
and bring in a bill in due course which would replace the existing 
boundaries readjustment act.
<P>
	Why suspend the process of redistribution under the present 
act while this is being done? Surely the government is not 
thinking that it won a majority under the existing boundaries, so 
let us make sure there are no changes prior to the next election. 
Surely this is not the new politics described in the red book.
<P>
	If Bill C-18 passes and the process of redistribution is held up 
once again due to political manoeuvring and if as I suggest there 
is not enough time after the procedure and House affairs 
committee reports to put new boundaries into place, then we will 
be party to the kind of politics which the Canadian people 
rejected at the last election.
<P>
	Surely this is not the wish of the government. It is not the wish 
of the Reform Party of Canada. Therefore let us go forward now 
with the system we have presently in place. Let the public 
hearing process begin. If we do this we are assured that new 
boundaries will be in place prior to the next election. Money 
already spent will have been spent for results.
<P>
	However if the government is adamant that the boundaries 
readjustment process is flawed, and it may very well be, then the 
government members know what they can do. They can utilize 
the new rules, have the procedure and House affairs committee 
study the issue, report back and bring in a bill which we would 
consider. If it is reasonable, we could look at agreeing to it so 
that a new procedure will be in effect to accommodate the results 
of the next census.
<P>
	In closing, I again want to reiterate my opposition to the 
closure motion. We have not had a full debate on this motion. 
This is vitally important. It is a matter of principle for this 
House and for Canadians. Do we allow the government to limit 
debate so that Liberals have a chance to fight the next election 
with the boundaries unchanged since 1980 or do we take costs 
and work done into account and public pressure on politicians to 
clean up their act?
<P>
	Obviously the government is willing to ignore the wishes of 
the people. Well, we are not. That is why we oppose this motion 
and why we oppose the bill.
<P>
	This morning a government member found it 
incomprehensible that Reform would support a process that 
would see the House continue to grow in numbers. I find it 
incomprehensible that the member was not aware that this was 
one of the very reasons Reform could not support Bill C-18. 
There is not, I repeat, there is nothing in this bill that puts a cap 
on or limits the number of seats. Had it done that, the 
government might very well have had the support of Reform on 
this.
<P>
	I am concerned about one other thing. The member I believe 
from Waterloo mentioned that he and his constituents were very 
comfortable with their riding as it is and I can understand that, 
but I wonder, has his riding not grown in numbers. My riding of 
Mission-Coquitlam was 116,000 in 1991, having grown 26 per 
cent from the previous census and is now approximately 
125,000. Do I just forget that because I am comfortable with the 
way things are? What about representation by population?
<P>
	It is far past time that we started to be accountable as 
politicians.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am quite 
amazed at some of the things I have been hearing today. It is 
quite incredible that we see the opposition to this legislation that 
we are seeing from the Reform Party.
<P>
	Significantly, one of the first phone calls I got on this matter 
some weeks ago was from the Reform Party Association in my 
riding which was quite concerned that the changes that were 
proposed would so change the riding of Algoma that neither the 
present member nor any future member could adequately serve 
the constituents in a way that they have become accustomed to.
<P>
	It also was amazing to hear the Reform Party argue for 
continuing the process as it has been put in place. There is an 
expression in business and more than most, business influences 
Reform like no other group.
<P>
	There is an expression that says ``cut your losses''. Yes, 
several millions of dollars have unfortunately been utilized to 
start this process but what about the untold millions of dollars of 
mistakes that might occur should we allow this process to 
proceed? I say that we should cut our losses.
<P>
	We could ill afford to allow this process to proceed given a set 
of rules that do not adequately serve Canadians nor adequately 
serve Parliament. I do not mean that we should have rules that 
serve individual members of Parliament. I would be pleased in 
the new riding of Algoma-James Bay to serve communities in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2756"> 2756 </A></B>
<P>
the far north like Hearst and Kapuskasing, Dubreuiville, 
Chapleau and so on.
<P>
	I would be pleased but I am not sure they would be best served 
by a member of Parliament who in a new proposed riding has to 
serve an area that stretches from Lake Huron all the way through 
to James Bay.
<P>
	The changes proposed just for my riding alone are reason 
enough to quash the whole process. I am aware of many 
problems across this country. One only has to look at Algoma 
riding to see what, with all due respect to the commission-it 
did the best it could given the resources available to it-changes 
have been proposed and to see how frankly unrealistic and 
ridiculous they are.
<P>
	It would not serve the people of my part of northern Ontario to 
continue this nor would it serve Canadians at large. I respect that 
there are urban centres that have seen their ridings bloom to 
great numbers. We have to do something about that.
<P>
	It is just as difficult to serve a large geographic area as it is to 
serve a large population. I have in the neighbourhood of 40 
communities right now in my riding with 40 reeves, mayors or 
Indian chiefs. They need as much my personal attention in terms 
of my being available to visit with them and talk to them as the 
constituents in a large urban centre.
<P>
	I argue that notwithstanding the importance of representation 
by population, representation by geographic area is equally 
important. If one has 100,000 or 200,000 citizens in a confined 
geographic area one needs a lot of staff, I argue, to support the 
needs of those people. The member of Parliament can travel 
within that confined area relatively easily.
<P>
	If one has a riding such as in the case of the current Algoma 
riding, it is seven and a half hours drive from one end to the 
other. No amount of staff can take the place of the member of 
Parliament visiting the communities in that riding.
<P>
	If one would increase rural ridings because one is devoted 
mindlessly to population only representation, one forgets that 
individual communities spread out by great distances will lose 
access to their member of Parliament. In a way that does not 
happen in urban centres. It is a different kind of representation. 
If we do not stop this process and revisit seriously the subject we 
will never have a recognition that there is a shift that is going on 
from rural areas to our urban centres and an inexorable shift 
because of the current rules.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	In northern Ontario we currently have 12 ridings if we include 
the riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka. The proposal would 
reduce that to 10. We have lost seats in the past and if the trend 
continues next time it could be nine or eight. Where do the 
people who live in cities come from? Unless they are born there 
they come from the country. Why are they coming from the 
country, in rural areas? It is because of the economy of this 
country. When there is no work in the rural areas people go to the 
city even if there is no work in the city.
<P>
	We have seen a shift in the population from our rural areas to 
our urban centres partly because of the economy. Should we 
allow shifts in the economy to so gravely affect shifts in the way 
our ridings are distributed.
<P>
	We could have good times again and we will under a Liberal 
government. In fact I think the red book should be called the 
well read book because clearly the opposition parties have read 
it. I am sure we have done more for literacy in this country with 
the red book than any other document published in recent 
history. I encourage everyone to read it again because our 
commitment is to rural Canada. If we allow this bill to go 
through then we are recognizing that rural Canada is important. 
We are allowing Canadians the opportunity to have a serious say 
on how our boundaries are drawn and to get away from this 
notion that we can only have representation by population.
<P>
	Again with all due respect to the commission, I think it makes 
a lot more sense-and I will make this argument to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs-that not only do 
we have to revisit the subject of representation, but it makes 
more sense that the first draft of new maps be generated with 
some public consultation. At the very least, the representatives 
of the public at the federal level, the members of Parliament, 
should have some say. I have no problem with input not only 
coming from sitting members of Parliament but from candidates 
who fought the last campaign. It is not a partisan issue. 
Boundaries for ridings is not a partisan issue and should not be.
<P>
	All of the parties that fought the campaign in Algoma 
understand the need to have fair representation for the rural 
areas of this country. There is no argument that the urban areas 
need full representation too. If we have a riding that all of a 
sudden because of economic reasons and so on has grown to 
200,000 would it not make more sense simply just to carve a new 
boundary down the middle of that riding and make two ridings 
of 100,000? Rather than have a domino effect throughout an 
entire province why not simply look at the problems.
<P>
	We may want to add seats to Parliament but that is something 
we can debate later on. We cannot cap the number of seats here 
forever, but we want to consider how quickly the number of 
seats rises. However, if we are going to make corrections it is 
much better to look at the problem areas and do some fine-tuned 
adjustments.
<P>
	If we look at northern Ontario, the changes that have been 
proposed are so strange and so massive that it does not seem 
logical. I use the riding of Algoma and the proposed riding of 
Algoma-James Bay as classic examples of why this system 
does not work. I say to my Reform friends, and I have a lot of 
respect for my Reform friends, to consider what they are doing

here in arguing against rural Canada. We need a system that 
works.
<P>
	On that note, I would just say that this is not an issue of 
limiting debate. We want to give Canadians adequate time to 
consider new rules. The less time we take here the more time 
Canadians will have.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak today on this bill to 
suspend the operation of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment 
Act and to voice my support for the proposed legislation 
because, in my view, we are not prepared to make the changes 
that have been recommended by the electoral boundaries 
commissions.
<P>
	Several years ago, following a recommendation from a 
provincial electoral boundaries commission to eliminate a 
riding in the eastern part of the province of Quebec, we launched 
a study to determine the criteria by which a riding is defined. 
Our study took into account not only the population of the 
riding, but a number of other factors such as the overall size of 
the riding, the number of municipalities and regional 
municipalities and so forth.
<P>
	It is important that we endorse this bill today and that we 
reject the amendment moved by the Reform Party so that we can 
come to a clearer understanding of what the electoral map of the 
future should look like.
<P>
	Let me describe to you, for example, the situation in eastern 
Quebec. At present there are five ridings in eastern Quebec: the 
riding of Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine which is 
represented by a Liberal MP, Mr. Patrick Gagnon; the riding of 
Gaspé which is represented by Bloc MP Mr. Yvan Bernier; the 
riding of Matapédia-Matane held by Mr. René Canuel, the 
riding of Rimouski-Témiscouata held by Mrs. Suzanne 
Tremblay and lastly, my riding of 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. Under the proposed electoral 
boundaries reform, one of these ridings is slated to disappear.
<P>
	Some notable differences can be found as far as the four 
proposed ridings are concerned. For example, according to the 
new electoral map, in the riding of Gaspé, more than 330 
kilometres would separate the towns of Amqui and Gaspé. Or 
should I say a distance of 330 kilometres in the summer, and 
1,000 kilometres in the winter?
<P>
	Moreover, each of the existing five ridings has developed its 
own unique culture. These cultures have been in place for many 
years. They did not emerge suddenly when the ridings were 
created. They existed long before then. There is a certain 
homogenous quality to the social fabric of each riding, based on 
its socioeconomic calling, its distinctive geographical features 
and its history. The proposed redrawing of the electoral map, a 
process based solely on making a demographic calculation and 
on dividing the number of people by the number of ridings, in no 
way satisfies the development requirements of a region like 
ours.
<P>
	In my opinion, other factors must be taken into consideration 
or else we will remain locked in a vicious circle where each time 
a region's population declines, the number of elected 
representatives will be reduced. A region represented by fewer 
MPs has less influence in government. Therefore, our regions 
will continue their downward spiral. An electoral map drawn 
solely on the basis of population would be a virtual insult to 
rural areas.
<P>
	Therefore, it is important that we take the time to review the 
situation and find other criteria for determining electoral 
boundaries. All I can say is that we would prefer the status quo to 
a new electoral map which would wipe out a riding in eastern 
Quebec. If a riding was eliminated, future elected 
representatives would find themselves with ridings that are far 
too large. They would have to deal with new municipalities.
<P>
	For example, in my riding of Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup 
which would take in the regional municipality of Témiscouata, 
there would be over 60 municipalities grouped together in four 
different regional municipalities: Basques, 11 municipalities; 
Rivière-du-Loup, 16 municipalities; Kamouraska, 18 
municipalities; Témiscouata, 20 municipalities. Elected 
representatives might need longer parliamentary breaks just to 
travel to the various parts of their ridings.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	For instance, the population of the riding would increase from 
73,747 to more than 88,000 over a really vast area. But the 
disappearance of a riding like that one also has a negative 
economic impact because it would require additional financial 
resources. With the economic difficulties we are now facing, 
there is no guarantee that the four new ridings replacing the five 
old ones would get more money to pursue their economic 
development, which would in the end compromise 
representation for each municipality.
<P>
	If more money were made available, we would have to 
determine if the increase is significant and adequately meets the 
demands of the municipalities. This reform of the electoral map 
would have all kinds of administrative repercussions. For 
example, in the areas covered by Canada Employment Centres, 
various such elements do not seem relevant to us at a time when 
the population is feeling insecure regarding the effects of 
reforms, as it does in Eastern Quebec with respect to 
unemployment insurance. The increase in the number of weeks 
of work required to qualify for benefits is already something the 
region 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2758"> 2758 </A></B>
<P>
must respond to quickly and come to grips with, without us 
adding other contradictions like reducing the number of ridings.
<P>
	The commission's proposals to readjust the current 
boundaries of Eastern Quebec ridings raise many questions. I 
speak as the member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup but 
also as chairman of the Bloc Quebecois caucus from Eastern 
Quebec. I also think all members from the East are surely aware 
of the impact such a decision would have. We would much prefer 
to maintain the status quo and, in that sense, the bill would allow 
the elections commission to gain time, maybe to think of other 
criteria to be considered in future, and to come up with much 
more reasonable solutions.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would say that figures sometimes speak 
louder than words. Let us look at the geographical size of the 
existing constituencies: Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
would go from 8,155 to 11,375 square kilometres; Gaspé would 
go from 12,268 to 17,783 square kilometres and would become 
part of the new Gaspé-Matane constituency; 
Matapédia-Matane would disappear; Rimouski-Témiscouata 
would go from 6,367 to 8,564 square kilometres. In the case of 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, or Témiscouata, it would go 
from 6,367 to 8,564 square kilometres. Those are truly huge 
areas, which it would be almost impossible to represent 
adequately.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is pledged to protecting Quebec's 
interests. For us, that means promoting sovereignty, but we are 
also representing a population which will have to make a 
decision regarding its constitutional future. We certainly do not 
want to abdicate our responsibilities by saying that, according to 
our scenario, there will not be another federal election. We want 
to be totally honest and ensure that, regardless of their decision, 
those whom we represent will enjoy the best possible 
conditions, whether it is within the Canadian federation if they 
so choose, or in a different structure.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is important to support this bill, especially 
considering the savings involved, since the amendment 
proposed by the Reform Party would result in hearings being 
held and in a postponement of the debate. We would end up 
wasting money on a commission with no specific criteria, and 
we would still have to look at the whole issue later on. Let us be 
clear with the public. They just voted in an election, they can 
wait a little for electoral reform to be completed. It may be that 
the definitions of RCMs were taken into account in establishing 
the criteria and that is interesting. However, as regards the rest 
of this process, let us give ourselves some more time. That way, 
if we have to use that electoral map again, Canadians will be 
ensured of the best possible representation.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in support of the bill and the motion 
currently before the House.
<P>
	I am not surprised to see a number of the opposition rising and 
joining what has been called around here from time to time the 
ranks of the perpetually indignant. I know of what they speak 
because it was not but a few months ago I sat in opposition 
myself.
<P>
	They are upset or feign being upset because of the use of time 
allocation. I understand that too because I sat over there. There 
is a reason the government believes that the time should be 
allocated. I ask the members opposite, as we have debated this 
throughout today would the result be any different in the 
ultimate vote if we had extended the time for debate? Under all 
the circumstances I think not.
<P>
	I want to explain why I support the bill. Notwithstanding that I 
have a riding with over 150,000 people, I could sure use a 
smaller riding, as could my staff. So could many other members 
whose ridings exceed the norm of 90,000 or 100,000 people. 
That is one reason I might want to see this redistribution process 
go ahead immediately.
<P>
	I come from the province of Ontario which would get another 
four seats in the process. Therefore my Ontario colleagues and I 
would probably want to see the bill go ahead and we would have 
another four seats. Why do I not want that to happen?
<P>
	The reason is that the process as currently constructed will 
increase the membership in the House of Commons to 301. That 
is a very significant item because a close look at the statutes 
indicates that growth continues. It goes on and on over the years. 
MPs have realized it is time to put a stop to that.
<P>
	I want to correct one item. One of the members who spoke 
within the last half hour said the last time there had been a 
change in the electoral boundaries was in 1980. That is not 
accurate. The last electoral boundary change took place for the 
1988 election. I know because I was elected in 1988 on the new 
boundaries. The process took place in 1986-87. It is not long 
ago that redistribution took place. I have nothing against 
redistribution, in fact I am in favour of it.
<P>
	Getting back to what I was speaking on a few moments ago, I 
sit on the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
About a month ago the Chief Electoral Officer was before us 
describing the process.
<P>
	At that time I and other members spoke on the issue of the 
increase in the number of members. For every new member we 
add to this House, it costs the taxpayer roughly half a million 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2759"> 2759 </A></B>
<P>
dollars. Add six members and that is $3 million per year. That is 
an annual cost of $3 million forever. That is the financial issue.
<P>
	I have not even mentioned the cost of renovating the House of 
Commons. Every time a piece of carpet, a wire or a pipe is 
installed it seems to cost us $10,000. There just is not any more 
room in this House. There would have to be a significant 
renovation.
<P>
	In any event, 301 members is not what Canadians want. They 
want a Parliament that works. They want to see it work with 295 
members and not 301 or 310 or 320 as time goes on. In my view 
the position the opposition parties are taking seems to be a 
desire to show blind submission to a process that was put in 
place about 30 years ago and keeps on growing, keeps on 
causing the numbers of members of Parliament to grow and the 
costs to grow.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	A number of the interventions today were from members of 
the Reform Party. I would have thought there would be some 
element of reform in the way they are addressing this.
<P>
	I accept that the redistribution process is calculated to be fair 
and that it is there for a reason. But lying behind that is the 
growth in the numbers of MPs and I want to put a stop to that.
<P>
	Yes, $5 million has been spent on the current process. But how 
much more money would continue to be spend on the existing 
process if we did not stop it right now? If we do not stop it this 
month or next month we will continue to spend the rest of the $8 
million and I suspect, as per usual, it would not be a surprise to 
see them go away beyond budget. The process simply has to be 
completed.
<P>
	I will tell the House why I support this bill. It is because I want 
to cap the growth in the number of MPs in the House. The only 
way to do it is to grab hold of this process and stop it dead right 
now. Put it on ice because the changes to cap the growth in the 
number of members in the House involves a change in the 
Constitution. We do not make those overnight in this place. I do 
not think any country makes constitutional changes overnight.
<P>
	This is the way to do it. The matter is to be referred to the 
procedure and House affairs committee, an all-party committee, 
not a Liberal mechanism as was alluded to earlier by one of the 
Reform Party members. It is an all-party committee and it will 
study the issue and report back to the House where the issue will 
be debated. I cannot imagine that the government would want to 
put closure on that debate when it comes back. However, at the 
moment we have to do this piece of business to stop the growth 
and the procedure. If we do not do this, within a year or two it is 
going to give us 301 MPs running in the next federal election.
<P>
	I will end there. I hope the message is clear. I hope some of my 
colleagues opposite will understand it. We will redistribute the 
boundaries at some point. We have to. We certainly have to in 
my riding. However, let us get a handle on the number of MPs 
that are needed to serve the country as a whole, refashion that 
process, refashion that mechanism first.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wanted to rise in 
the House today and do something unusual. I wanted to 
compliment the Liberals across the way. I wanted to compliment 
them on the red book.
<P>
	In my view the red book is an unusual process in Canadian 
electoral politics. The red book is a departure from the standard 
fare of Canada's process. The red book actually lays out in front 
of all Canadians some promises which the party said was its 
platform and upon which its members would present their 
issues.
<P>
	I wanted to compliment them as well on their motives. I 
believe theirs are pure motives. They do have the best interests 
of Canada at heart.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	While we may have philosophical differences, the fact is we 
basically want the same things for our children. We want a good 
education and good jobs for our children. We would like safe 
streets for our kids and we would like safety nets if our children 
have serious problems in their lives.
<P>
	The government has a role to play in those goals. Our 
government probably has lost some popularity in Canada. I 
reflect upon some poll results I read the other day. In terms of 
occupations, politicians were on the bottom rung just being 
beaten by lawyers. I wondered how we could improve the image 
of politicians.
<P>
	I actually explored the red book wondering what my 
colleagues were attempting to do in terms of improving the 
image of politicians. I found that a Liberal government would 
take a series of initiatives to restore confidence in the 
institutions of government. That is on page 92 of the red book. I 
went a little farther and found that MPs would be more able to 
draft legislation. There would be a parliamentary review of 
some senior Order in Council appointments. I thought that was 
good stuff. My compliments for those things in the red book.
<P>
	I did find some inconsistencies. I am sure members did not 
think the compliments would last forever. There is a 
disadvantage to first being in opposition and subsequently 
occupying the government benches. The disadvantage is there is 
a visible and vocal record. That record is on the use of closure by 
time allocation.
<P>
	I refer to some documentation that expresses what the 
members opposite said not so very long ago: ``This government 
is trampling on the rights of Parliament. A Liberal government 
would never do such a thing. This is a complete breach of 
parliamentary practice. It is a shocking display of the inability 
of the government to come to grips with the fact that it was 
elected to be responsible to this House of Commons. It was 
elected to do so and it is not being responsible. It is trampling all 
over this House''.
<P>
	It goes on: ``One thing we are labouring under tonight is a 
closure motion. I could not go along with that bill without 
expressing my distaste at the activities of the government. It is a 
disgraceful performance. The government is obviously fearful 
of bringing its legislation before Parliament and having it 
exposed to the light of public scrutiny. If I had introduced 
legislation of the kind the government has, I would be 
embarrassed as well. I want to again say in the strongest terms 
that by using closure in this debate the government has shown 
complete contempt for democracy''.
<P>
	This is quite a fat document. I could go on but maybe I should 
stop.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> More.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> I hear a cry for more. That is the way the 
hon. member was talking about closure then, referring to 
another comment. He sits here deadly silent now. He does not 
dare discuss this issue now because he knows what he said then 
was right. This is talking about someone else from the other side 
who had crossed and had the same problem with closure.
<P>
	I want to make it very plain, the use of time allocation and 
closure is wrong. It is draconian. They both limit the debate on 
issues to a time period convenient to the government. They are 
like a calm and beautiful sea: very appealing to the senses, but a 
rocky reef lies just beneath the surface. I wonder what it is about 
crossing from this side to that side of the House. Suddenly the 
issue seems to be very different.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	I also have a great deal of difficulty listening to some of the 
arguments from members opposite saying that we should 
swallow the soup of this bill because in it the bill allows us to 
limit the number of parliamentarians. That one part of the 
proposal I wholeheartedly endorse. I do not think Canada needs 
more than 295 parliamentarians. I promise if my colleagues 
brought a bill to us which said that one thing, they would have 
wholehearted concurrence from this group of Reformers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2761"> 2761 </A></B>
<P>
	However when it is brought with a soup full of other things, 
one does not get concurrence. Referring to that one issue in this 
bill does not make the soup palatable because the soup contains 
the strychnine of closure. That is not correct. I repeat: Bring to 
us a bill that says Parliament will not need to grow. Bring to us a 
bill that says Parliament can shrink and support will be 
immediate and forthcoming.
<P>
	This brand new Parliament gives us the opportunity to change 
the way Parliament functions. We have the opportunity in this 
Parliament to say no to things like time allocation. We have an 
opportunity in this Parliament to say no to party meddling in 
boundary changes. We have an opportunity in this Parliament to 
say no to wasting $5 million of taxpayers' money on an exercise 
that need not be stopped completely. It could be modified. We 
have an opportunity with new parliamentarians to say no to this 
type of politics.
<P>
	In my riding there are problems with the boundary 
adjustments which are fairly major. However I would rather lose 
the next election because of boundary changes that were not 
proper. I would rather lose that election than be saddled with a 
parliamentary process like this one.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to express these things in the strongest 
way I can. If the issue of closure and time allocation was right 
when they were on this side of the House then it is right when 
they are on that side. You cannot change the colour of your 
underwear when you cross the floor. You have to have some 
basic principles. You cannot change the colour of your hat 
because you have gone from this side to that side. You have to 
have basic principles. It is not good enough to just espouse 
vocally from this side of the House to that side of the House. 
There must be some principle. We cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	I speak against this bill, this closure and this process and I do 
it as strongly as I can.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in 
this important debate on the motion for second reading and 
reference to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs of Bill C-18, an act to suspend the operation of the 
Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act. It is for several reasons 
that I have a special interest in the process of redistribution of 
electoral districts in our country which is now under way.
<P>
	First, the electoral district of Bramalea-Gore-Malton 
which I have the honour to represent in this House lies within the 
cities of Mississauga and Brampton in the regional municipality 
of Peel, one of the fastest growing areas in Ontario between the 
1981 and 1991 census.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, on the basis of the 1991 census, the combined cities 
of Mississauga and Brampton are entitled to two of the four 
electoral districts which are to be added to the total for Ontario, 
raising that number from 99 to 103.
<P>
	Third, Bramalea-Gore-Malton would, in my view, be 
changed without good reason by the current proposals of the 
Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission for Ontario.
<P>
	As all hon. members are aware, the Constitution Act of 1867 
requires that there be a readjustment in the number of members 
of the House of Commons after every 10 year census. The 
procedure for calculating the number of members of the House 
of Commons to which each province or territory is entitled is set 
out in sections 51, 51(a) and 52 of the Constitution Act of 1867. 
The procedure for establishing the boundaries of the electoral 
districts which will be represented in the House of Commons is 
set out in the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.
<P>
	I will not go into details of the procedures to be followed but 
would refer hon. members to the clear summary of those 
procedures provided by the hon. government House leader in his 
speech on Monday, March 21, 1994 which opened the debate on 
second reading and reference stage of Bill C-18. I would also 
refer hon. members to the excellent booklet entitled 
<I>Representation in the Federal Parliament</I> which has been 
prepared by and is available from Elections Canada.
<P>
	For the purpose of clarity of debate, it should be emphasized 
that the calculation of the number of members of the House of 
Commons and the establishment of the boundaries of electoral 
districts are based on the number of people in a given area, never 
on the basis of the number of voters.
<P>
	I would now like to turn from the general to the particular and 
describe how the electoral district of Bramalea-Gore-Malton 
would be affected by the current proposals of the Federal 
Electoral Boundaries Commission for Ontario.
<P>
	Let us start with the facts that as a consequence of the 1991 10 
year census it has been determined that the province of Ontario 
is entitled to 103 members of the House of Commons and that 
the electoral quota for Ontario is 97,912, the ideal population for 
each of the 103 electoral districts assigned to the province.
<P>
	The population of the cities of Mississauga and of Brampton 
have increased dramatically in the 10 year period between the 
1981 and the 1991 census. In 1981, the population of 
Mississauga was 315,056 and that of Brampton was 149,030 for 
a total population of 464,086 for the two cities. That population 
entitled the two cities to the five electoral districts established 
under the 1987 representation order, namely Mississauga East, 
Mississauga West, Mississauga South, Brampton and 
Brampton-Malton. The name Brampton-Malton was changed 
to Bramalea-Gore-Malton in 1990. The 1987  representation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2762"> 2762 </A></B>
<P>
order provided for the first division of the city of Brampton 
between two electoral districts. Brampton had previously 
always been entirely within one electoral district, either Peel or 
Brampton-Halton Hills or Brampton-Georgetown.
<P>
	The 1991 census disclosed that the population of Mississauga 
had grown to 463,388, and that of Brampton to 234,445, for a 
total combined population of 697,833. That population now 
entitles the two cities to two additional electoral districts, for a 
total of seven.
<P>
	As I stated earlier, the electoral quota for Ontario is 97,912. If 
one calculates an electoral quota for the combined two cities by 
dividing their total population of 697,833 by the number of 
electoral districts to which they are entitled, namely seven, the 
resulting quota for the two cities is 99,690.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	At page 13 of its proposals, the Federal Electoral Boundaries 
Commission for Ontario in the course of its comments with 
regard to Metropolitan Toronto, Etobicoke states that three 
districts within the city of Etobicoke would average about 
103,000 which is close to what the commission believes 
appropriate for urban districts. The city of Etobicoke lies 
immediately to the east of the cities of Mississauga and 
Brampton.
<P>
	The population of Bramalea-Gore-Malton according to the 
1991 census was 103,589 which is 5,677 above the electoral 
quota for Ontario and 3,899 above the electoral quota for the 
combined cities of Mississauga and Brampton. However the 
population of Bramalea-Gore-Malton is only 589 above 
103,000 which is close to what the commission believes 
appropriate for urban districts.
<P>
	It would therefore appear that there is no urgent and pressing 
necessity to alter the existing boundaries of 
Bramalea-Gore-Malton.
<P>
	However the commission was not satisfied with the situation. 
After deciding that the electoral district of Mississauga South 
should remain unchanged with a population of 96,208 and that 
Mississauga East should be altered in area to reduce its 
population to 101,300, the commission decided to perform 
major surgery on Bramalea-Gore-Malton to cut its 
population back to 96,360 from 103,589.
<P>
	The commission accomplished this feat by removing an area 
of Brampton lying east of Dixie Road and having a population of 
36,593 from the northern part of the electoral district and adding 
a piece of the northwestern corner of Mississauga with a 
population of 29,364, most of whom live south of Highway 401 
to the southwestern edge of the electoral district, for a net 
population reduction of 7,229.
<P>
	This exercise seems to me to resemble cutting one end off a 
blanket and then sewing most of it back on to the other end in an 
effort to make a small reduction in the size of the blanket.
<P>
	In addition the commission appears to have clearly violated 
one of its own operating principles. Highway 401 forms the 
entire southern boundary of Bramalea-Gore-Malton. In the 
course of its comments with regard to metropolitan Toronto, the 
area north of Highway 401, the commission states at page 15 of 
its proposals that ``the commission believes that Highway 401 
forms a physical barrier and should be used as a boundary 
wherever possible''.
<P>
	The proposed addition of the populated area south of Highway 
401 to the rump of Bramalea-Gore-Malton runs directly 
contrary to the commission's view on the role of Highway 401.
<P>
	The commission's proposal would create a distorted electoral 
district resembling a reversed letter <I>L</I> of which both extremities 
would have less in common and be further apart than is now the 
case within Bramalea-Gore-Malton, thus diluting the 
community of interest or community identity in the electoral 
district. Hon. members will thus understand why I have serious 
concerns as to how the Federal Electoral Boundaries 
Commission for Ontario is carrying out its mandate.
<P>
	Inequality of representation in this House has also been 
encouraged by the provisions of section 15(2) of the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act which provides for a maximum 
deviation of 25 per cent above or below the electoral quota for an 
electoral district in a province. In other words, if the electoral 
quota for Ontario is 100,000, meaning that each resident of the 
province would have equal representation in this House if the 
population of each electoral district was 100,000, it would still 
be perfectly possible and legal to have some electoral districts 
with populations as low as 75,000 and others with populations as 
high as 125,000.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. It is with 
reluctance that I rise but the member has used up his full 10 
minutes. If the member is going to be just a little longer we 
might ask the House if there is unanimous consent that he might 
conclude his remarks.
<P>
	Would there be unanimous consent to allow the member for 
Bramalea-Gore-Malton to conclude his remarks?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Malhi:</B> Mr. Speaker, the subject of what shall be an 
appropriate number of members of Parliament has been referred 
to frequently in this debate.
<P>
	At this point I would simply raise for consideration the 
possibility that perhaps this House would operate more 
efficiently and effectively if there were dramatically fewer 
members of Parliament than at present and that there be a fixed 
number. Those fewer members would have more extensive 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2763"> 2763 </A></B>
<P>
staffs and research facilities but I believe the long term savings 
could be significant. Such a proposal would certainly merit 
consideration by the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the member for his 
co-operation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure 
that I rise to take part, as member for Lévis, in this debate on Bill 
C-18 to suspend for 24 months the operation of electoral 
boundaries readjustments across Canada.
<P>
	You know it is not always easy to speak in a debate so late in 
the day without repeating what our hon. colleagues from both 
sides of the House have already said. I will speak anyway, 
because I think it is important to talk about democracy and its 
operation. We can never talk too much about democracy and 
truly democratic rules in this House. So, this bill gives me an 
opportunity to raise this extremely important issue.
<P>
	Like my fellow members of the Official Opposition, I support 
this bill. I will not go over all their arguments, although I agree 
with the points like the savings to be made by deferring this 
readjustment for one thing. Members opposite also mentioned it 
would give more time to do a more thorough job and to better 
target readjustments to the democratic reality. I will simply 
insist on one point.
<P>
	As you know, provincial elections are to be held this year and, 
normally, within 12 or 14 months of the elections, we should 
have a referendum in Quebec. So, if all goes well-and I 
honestly think, along with my colleagues, that it will-we are 
going to find ourselves in a totally new political context. Under 
the circumstances, what is the use of redesigning the electoral 
map when it may not be used by Quebec in future elections? It is 
therefore wise and perfectly advisable to wait and to defer the 
readjustment-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Perhaps the hon. member would like a drink of 
water? He would then be less disruptive.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Give him something to drink!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> As I was saying, it would be appropriate to await 
the outcome of this referendum before making changes.
<P>
	Personally, as member for Lévis, I would like to point out 
another reason why I think it should be deferred. Basically, to 
keep changing the electoral map all the time is 
counterproductive in terms of fostering a sense of belonging 
within a region or a community.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Some countries tend to keep the same electoral boundaries, 
despite shifts in population. This is done in France and other 
countries as well. There is evidence that it provides a certain 
stability and allows local communities to strengthen their 
feelings of solidarity and work more effectively to promote their 
economies.
<P>
	We should not make changes as a matter of course, every other 
election. We live under a federal system, which means federal 
elections, usually every four years, and provincial elections as 
well. Generally speaking the provinces adjust their electoral 
boundaries as well, before every other election, as in Quebec. 
Unfortunately, there may be a lag, so that some voters, 
especially in the urban ridings I am familiar with, do not know to 
which riding they belong. In some cases, they do not even know 
their members. That may be because the members are not always 
very efficient-I am referring to the past because there are more 
and more Bloc members in Quebec, and people know us and will 
get to know us even better, because we are going to be very 
active. Why do people have problems? Because things change so 
often.
<P>
	In terms of electoral boundaries, we have the territory 
covered by federal ridings and the territory covered by 
provincial ridings. Administratively speaking, voters want to 
identify with a territory. And what happens? Administratively 
speaking, although this may not be directly relevant to today's 
subject, the individual needs to identify with a given area. That 
is very important. It is very important for the individual to know 
to which area he belongs.
<P>
	In the riding of Lévis, we have the Lévis Regional County 
Municipality, the territory covered by the provincial riding, 
school boards and LCSC areas. Provincial departments usually 
provide maps indicating which areas are covered by various 
services. If we add to all that the areas covered by federal 
services, by all the departments, the local employment centre 
and the rest, we could look at all the departments, and we would 
find as many ways to divide the area as there are departments.
<P>
	Furthermore, there are a substantial number of federal 
government agencies and Crown corporations which also have 
their own areas. Imagine an individual trying to cope with these 
constant changes! People can get very confused-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B>There is a problem with the hon. member's 
microphone.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> I will not start all over, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Briefly, this is a very important issue. We have a federal 
electoral map, a provincial electoral map, and there are various 
what I would call administrative maps provided by provincial 
and federal departments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2764"> 2764 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. Since the 
microphone used by the hon. member for Lévis was turned off, 
we missed part of his speech. I wonder whether he could repeat 
the missing part.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> This is not a point of order 
as such. The hon. member has no text, so I think we will have to 
rely on <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, at least the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester will be able to read my speech tomorrow 
in <I>Hansard</I>, and I appreciate his interest. Speaking in the House 
is interesting when there are members who are interested in what 
one says, so I commend them for that.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, in the two minutes I have left, I do not want to 
appear to be opposed to change. On the contrary, those who 
know me in my community find that I am usually someone who 
identifies with change and who agrees with change. But I think 
that the commissions should consider two changes. The first 
change, which seeks a certain fairness in the number of electors 
represented per riding, is laudable. It is right in a democracy, but 
I was just talking about the disadvantages it causes when there 
are too many changes.
<P>
	Some countries have a system of proportional representation. 
I think this is something to consider. I looked at what the latest 
commission dealing with it had to say and it did not look into it 
much. Major reports have been written and we could review 
them.
<P>
	There is another change, Mr. Speaker, and I think it is the most 
important one we should make here in Canada or in any 
democracy, namely financing of political parties. It would be a 
better way to strengthen and improve democracy than to change 
electoral maps left and right, I think.
<P>
	In 1977, Quebec passed Bill 2, as a result of which political 
parties are financed by individuals and not by corporations, 
unions, companies and businesses. What has this achieved? It 
has eliminated a lot of-in politics, often perception is what 
counts. Since then, people feel that their government is less 
subject to undue pressure from business. I think that this is an 
improvement that the people in the Reform Party would also 
want to support. It would improve election practices, improve 
government management and finally free the members elected 
from the various ridings from the pressures to which they may 
be subject on the basis of party financing.
<P>
	I think that it would be tremendous progress and I still do not 
understand why, although people dealt with it as part of that 
royal commission on electoral reform and party financing. 
Although the general public was heard on this subject and 
agreed with this reform, it got nowhere.
<P>
	If I have one suggestion to make, and I conclude with that, we 
really should look into the financing of political parties by the 
people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my honour to rise to speak on second reading of 
Bill C-18, an act to suspend the operation of the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act and refer it to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	I do not want to engage myself in a certain tone of debate 
which talks about issues that are not really pertinent to the act or 
to the substance of the issue because of the limited time and 
because it is not my style to engage in that kind of debate.
<P>
	I want to have a look at why I am supporting the bill. I am 
going to restrict it to my riding of 
Bonavista-Trinity-Conception to try to give all sides of the 
House an indication of how it is viewed by my constituents. I 
have received many phone calls, and quite frankly the 
constituents who have called me are dumbfounded. That is the 
best word to describe them. They are dumbfounded by what is 
going on.
<P>
	Let us look at the chronology from their viewpoint. There was 
a comment made in the House that I will correct. The last change 
did not take place in 1980. It took place in 1988. As I was 
entering politics the change was made, and let me say what it did 
to my riding. The name of the riding of 
Bonavista-Trinity-Conception has been around for a long 
time. It describes and rightly so the three bays on the east coast 
of Newfoundland: Bonavista Bay, Trinity Bay and Conception 
Bay. Before the present boundaries were set the southern part of 
my riding took in the northern half of Conception Bay, almost a 
straight line down through the bay. The previous boundary took 
in the northern part of Conception Bay and all of Trinity Bay but 
only the southern part of Bonavista Bay, not including the 
well-known Terra Nova Park.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	After the last census and the study of the commission that we 
are now trying to put on hold it was argued, and rightly so, that 
the riding of Bonavista-Trinity-Conception should include 
all of Bonavista Bay because there was a similarity with 
communities with respect to issuing fishing licences and the 
consideration of the community of interest, geographical 
reasons and similarly aligned issues.
<P>
	It was argued that all of Bonavista Bay should be included. It 
was also argued that for the southern part of the previous 
boundary certain communities-I think there were seven of 
them including Brigus, Collier's, Whitbourne, Georgetown and 
Markland-should not be included because they were closely 
related to St. John's and had more of an urban interest. Their 
community of alignment was with the riding of St. John's East.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2765"> 2765 </A></B>
<P>
	The third major reason was that 
Bonavista-Trinity-Conception as it was then comprised 
pre-1988 only had a population of around 75,000 or 76,000 
whereas Gander-Grand Falls or Gander-Twillingate as it was 
then called had more than Bonavista-Trinity-Conception. It 
was felt that including the upper half of the northern half of 
Bonavista Bay would balance it more reasonably with other 
ridings in Newfoundland.
<P>
	Considerable debate took place and the changes were 
eventually made. My constituents understood all the rationale 
that was used. After only one election the same rationale that 
was used to result in the present boundaries is being applied to 
revert to the old boundaries, except the rationale is used in 
reverse. It is said that the alignment of the northern part of 
Bonavista Bay is not in with the southern part of Bonavista Bay 
and the five or six communities that had an alignment more with 
the urban thinking of St. John's East really should belong to the 
district of Port de Grave because that really should belong to 
Bonavista-Trinity-Conception.
<P>
	This is very difficult to understand for constituents who are 
only now getting used to a change that was made six years ago. 
Now they are being told that within two months they have to 
appear in four different locations in the riding either to agree or 
disagree, and the ones who disagree have to give some rationale 
why they disagree. That is very hard to understand.
<P>
	What is also very hard to understand is that the population of 
Newfoundland from 1981 to 1991 had an increase of 793 people 
in 10 years. For this we are to realign what was realigned before, 
just take the rationale and use it in reverse. We will have 36 
hearings in Atlantic Canada for 32 seats. That is about one per 
seat, except in Newfoundland where we have seven seats and 
there we will be 15 hearings. I am not sure what rationale was 
used there. I would not want to speculate for the members of the 
House.
<P>
	The point I am making is that the changes that were made in 
1987-88 were quite acceptable. The total population of the 
riding has not changed. The population of centres in the riding 
has not changed. People have not realigned themselves to my 
knowledge, so that has not changed. Why all of a sudden do 
three commissioners draw lines and find some rationale for 
those lines? I do not understand it.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	What is more important is my constituents. Not only do they 
not understand it and have difficulties with it, but they are 
saying to me: ``You are going up to preach restraint, you are 
going up to lower the deficit, you are going up to balance the 
budget. How can you possibly, apart from the ridiculousness and 
the timing of this measure, support it from the viewpoint of 
expenditure?''
<P>
	I come up failing, Mr. Speaker. I cannot answer their 
questions.
<P>
	Not an old but a wise mentor of mine once told me: ``You 
know, Fred, being in politics is very simple; if you can't explain 
it, you really should not be doing it.''
<P>
	Well, I cannot explain this, Mr. Speaker, and therefore I am 
not so sure we should be doing it. Because of that, I am a very 
strong supporter of this bill to delay this ludicrous action that is 
taking place, so we can refer it to a committee, study it and come 
up with some reasonable recommendations.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate I 
will take a moment to make a comment to an earlier intervention 
by the member for Bonavista-Trinity-Conception on a point 
of order concerning relevance.
<P>
	Some of his colleagues who shall remain unnamed from his 
great province would be the masters I might say of making a 
discourse on how it might be relevant. But it always amazes me 
in the short five years that I have been here that members always 
are able to make a relevant point to the motion or the bill being 
debated, and certainly I appreciate the member's participation 
in today's debate and his relevance to the subject matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will try to find a germ of relevance in my representation as well.
<P>
	I have listened with a great deal of interest to this debate 
today. We are talking about closure, redistribution and political 
interference or non-political interference in the political 
process in Canada. That is one of the things that we can treasure.
<P>
	When we look at other countries in the world and reflect on 
the tragedy that happened in Mexico yesterday, we think of the 
very real and very great political discourse that goes on in the 
country. We see our colleagues from the Bloc who are here and 
while we are at completely different poles we are able to discuss 
these things rationally and without fear of personal harm. That is 
something we really need to treasure in our country and to hold 
very dear. I guess that is one of the reasons that I wanted to speak 
to this motion.
<P>
	When this bill was first introduced I really did not feel all that 
strongly about it. My riding of Edmonton Southwest is affected 
very little. We lose a little bit to the northwest but as members 
would know, Edmonton Northwest is represented by my 
colleague who shares the same last name. So we do not win or 
lose on that one. In the south we lose a little bit and we gain a 
little bit so that the effect on our constituency is not all that 
much.
<P>
	What we do have is a sense of fairness that when we get into a 
political debate or into an election here in Canada most of us do 
not have to go to bed at night thinking that there has been any 
gerrymandering going on with our electoral boundaries. This is 
something that I think is particularly important.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2766"> 2766 </A></B>
<P>
	In the last election I was running as a rookie. The people from 
Elections Canada who were looking after things were all 
appointed by the Conservative government that preceded this 
government. I must compliment all of the people that I was 
associated with at Elections Canada. They were impartial and 
fair to everyone. In particular, I would use this occasion to 
compliment our returning officer, Patricia Collins, who went out 
of her way to be fair to me.
<P>
	When we as a political institution start to change the rules that 
are established, whether we like them or not, we are treading on 
fairly thin ice. That is the reason that I am standing to speak 
against this motion today. If we do not like the rules then we 
have the privilege of changing them any time we want. However, 
there is no reason to suggest that the electoral boundary change 
cannot go forward as it would normally have done.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	I am not in favour of changing the number of seats in the 
House. It could have been frozen at substantially less years ago. 
However the very people who are now making the case for 
freezing the number of seats, during the Charlottetown accord 
when the number of seats in this House were going to grow 
amazingly, not one word was raised against it. Different times 
make different priorities.
<P>
	When I thought I wanted to speak to this and the new wrinkle 
of closure was added to the soup that an earlier colleague 
described, I thought why not phone the Library of Parliament 
and ask them to send over a few topic headings under the term 
``closure'' and then I would glean from that a few examples of 
members' opposite when they were in opposition railing against 
the government of the day on the issue of closure.
<P>
	There are three pages. So we just grabbed one to use as an 
example. Then I thought I had better be a little careful because I 
am sure that when members opposite were railing against 
closure when they were in opposition they had no idea that these 
words would be coming back at them in such a short time.
<P>
	However, I must use one example and this is from <I>Hansard</I>, 
May 29, 1991, the hon. member representing Ottawa-Vanier:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since I began my remarks on the government's heavy-handed motion to 
reinstate certain bills, for which it could not receive unanimous consent because 
they are indeed not very good bills, a new element has been introduced into the 
debate-closure. It is now using its majority, the tyranny of the majority, to 
impose upon the rest of us its will.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That is far from being democratic.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Therefore, I am a little nervous about introducing this because 
I know that if we are as successful as we hope to be, we will be 
sitting on the other side of the House.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Not to worry about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Not to worry about it? Fine, not to worry 
about it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Do not worry about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> No, you worry about it. That is right.
<P>
	Lo and behold I am having my corn flakes this morning 
knowing that I am going to speak to this today and from today's 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> I would recommend to hon. members and to 
those of you watching these proceedings on television a very 
worthwhile article called ``Debasing the Franchise''. This is 
part one of three articles. I recommend it to everyone so they can 
catch a bit of the flavour and a bit of the history of just what we 
are talking about here. It is in today's <I>Globe and Mail</I> and there 
will be another article tomorrow and then the next day. If I may I 
will read just a small bit from today's <I>Globe and Mail</I>. It has to 
do with representation by population and distribution.
<P>
	In any event in 1947 they had a pretty good idea that what they 
were going to do was base the number of seats by the 
representative population that Canada had and then divide that 
by the number of provinces and presto, you have the number of 
seats. As one province increases they get more seats and as 
another province decreases it gets less seats, except in the case 
of Prince Edward Island which was guaranteed four seats. That 
seemed like a pretty good idea at the time but it did not last.
<P>
	I would like to suggest a way out of this muddle. I would 
suggest that we have a limit on the number of seats. There 
certainly will not be any problem from this side of the House in 
saying that we should not be increasing the number of seats in 
the House of Commons. Let us freeze it at 295. Let us have a 
strict representation by population in the House. Every province 
will be represented strictly in its proportionate number of seats 
by its population with no floors; no floors for Quebec and no 
floors for Prince Edward Island. Then how do we go about 
representing the regions or the provinces in Canada?
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Let us have a Senate that represents the provinces. Let us have 
a triple-E Senate. That will get us out of this mess. We can have 
a House of Commons that will be strictly representation by 
population. That is magic, is it not? Then we have a Senate that 
represents the provinces.
<P>
	A member opposite said they had not heard of this before. 
There may even be a few people out there in television land who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2767"> 2767 </A></B>
<P>
have not heard of this before. It is called a triple-E Senate. 
Through representation by population in the House and a 
triple-E Senate in the other House, we achieve what we want to 
achieve.
<P>
	We achieve representation of all provinces equally in Canada 
and we achieve representation by population in this House 
without it growing forever. There, I submit most humbly, is my 
answer to the dilemma that our honourable House faces. How do 
we go about achieving it? It is simple.
<P>
	Let us get on with it now. We know how to achieve it. We need 
to do something about the Senate. We are all in basic agreement 
with that. We will get representation by population in this House 
and we can get a triple-E Senate in the other House and we can 
all go home happy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in support of Bill C-18 because I believe the present 
system is detrimental both in general terms to Canadians as a 
whole and certainly detrimental in specific terms for northern 
Ontario and for the riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka which I 
represent.
<P>
	I do not believe that the present system fulfils the mandate 
that it was given. I would like to read from the terms of 
reference. It says that ``in fixing the electoral district 
boundaries, they must take into consideration the community of 
interest or community of identity in or refer to historical 
patterns of an electoral district and a manageable geographic 
size for districts in sparsely populated rural or northern 
regions''.
<P>
	The present system does none of these things. It was simply a 
mathematical exercise and then a drawing of lines on a map. 
This does not serve the interests of Canadian people and it 
certainly does not serve the interests of people in northern 
Ontario.
<P>
	I cannot believe that the Reform Party is not supporting this 
bill. By not supporting this bill and by encouraging the present 
system, it is encouraging that we will have more members in this 
House. That is something that it has railed against time and time 
again.
<P>
	It is certainly not something that I have heard from my 
constituents, that they want to expand government and have 
more government spending. The opportunity to take a second 
look at this is probably pretty good idea.
<P>
	I certainly do not think it makes any sense to change 
approximately 80 per cent of the electoral boundaries that we 
have in this redistribution process. It seems like we are throwing 
the baby out with the bathwater. It is far too extensive. It is 
costing far too much money and causing far too much 
disruption.
<P>
	We need to develop a new system that has public input at a far 
earlier point. The present system, having redrawn all the 
boundaries and coming out with a fait accompli and then asking 
the public to comment on it, is not the appropriate way of doing 
it. We need to study it. We need a system that is going to allow 
the public to have input at a much earlier stage.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	I certainly think that history speaks to the problem. The hon. 
member who spoke before seemed to think that we had been 
doing okay with the present system and asked why we were 
trying to change it. I would like to read from John Courtney's 
book <I>Parliamentary Representation</I> wherein he talked about the 
electoral system in the most recent history:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since 1964 Parliament has amended the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment 
Act seven times; suspended one redistribution in mid-stream; ignored, then 
replaced, another at the completion of its work; and accepted three different 
formulae (a different one for each redistribution) for determining the number of 
seats to be awarded the provinces and the territories. Five starts at electoral 
redistribution in little more than 20 years suggests that the process has yet to win 
the measure of support and confidence of parliamentarians needed to ensure its 
long-term institutional independence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	With all those changes and with all the difficulties that we 
have had with electoral redistribution in the last 30 years, I do 
not think support of the present system is appropriate. Indeed we 
need to go back to the drawing board and look at a better way of 
doing things.
<P>
	In addition to the national concerns that I have addressed, I 
have some very specific concerns as redistribution relates to my 
area of the country, northern Ontario. It will result in the 
elimination of two seats in northern Ontario. We have little 
enough representation as it is now with only 12 seats, but this 
plan would reduce us to 10 seats. I believe this is unfair. We are a 
rural area in northern Ontario. We need strong representation. I 
cannot support a particular system that will see our 
representation reduced by two.
<P>
	As the hon. member from the riding of Algoma spoke earlier 
he described an electoral system that would result in his riding 
going from Manitoulin Island all the way north to James Bay. It 
is totally impractical that a member of Parliament could be 
expected to cover such a large geographic area. The present 
system that simply divides population on a map and draws lines 
is totally inappropriate. The plan to reduce northern Ontario 
down to 10 ridings takes away the collective voice we have in 
northern Ontario. The system is definitely flawed and needs to 
be changed.
<P>
	Then we get to my own particular riding of Parry 
Sound-Muskoka. It is an area that under this redistribution 
would be split absolutely in two, with the northern half of my 
riding going in one direction and the southern half of my riding 
going in a different direction.
<P>
	This certainly does not fulfil the mandate of the electoral 
commission which was to take into account historical, social 
and economic realities of the situation. The riding of Parry 
Sound-Muskoka has existed for 60 years, and in one fell swoop 
of a pen on a map there is a proposal to destroy it and to split it in 
two. I cannot accept that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2768"> 2768 </A></B>
<P>
	There are the social concerns. We in Parry Sound-Muskoka 
have developed into a unique community of communities, one 
that has a cohesiveness of interests, and again a stroke of a pen 
on a map is going to take that away.
<P>
	The third area they were supposed to take into account was 
economics. We have a shared economy in Parry 
Sound-Muskoka. We have the major industry of tourism which 
we share. We share the same major transportation links of 
Highway 11 and Highway 69. We share the same character of 
rural Ontario. Again these social considerations under the 
current system will simply be thrown out the window as a result 
of the stroke of a pen on a map.
<P>
	I do not believe the system serves the interest of Canadians. I 
know it does not serve the interest of northern Ontarians. I 
certainly know it does not serve the interest of my constituents 
from Parry Sound-Muskoka. I support the bill so that we can 
go back to take a look at the system and redesign it.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, the riding of 
Chambly I represent has an area of 384 square kilometres. In the 
last election, it had 76,204 voters; today, that number is down to 
76,203, since I spend most of my time here. It was and still is a 
mostly urban riding that straddles the Richelieu River from 
Beloeil-Saint-Hilaire to Chambly, including Saint-Bruno, a 
beautiful city we are proud of.
<P>
	In my riding, the proposed electoral boundaries readjustment 
would add 14 small, rather rural municipalities and remove a 
large one, Saint-Bruno, that would be integrated into the riding 
of Saint-Hubert. The riding would gain 14 municipalities, and 
would extend almost as far as Granby in the Eastern Townships.
<P>
	The problem is, first of all, there is no rush. We can take the 
time to debate these issues and to understand what is behind the 
changes proposed by the elections commission.
<P>
	In my case, I go from 76,200 voters to a new riding with 
110,000 voters. But my neighbour from whom I took 14 
municipalities goes from a riding of 110,000 voters to one with 
about 76,000 voters. We merely exchange voters without 
gaining anything at the administrative level. On the contrary, I 
think we stand to lose.
<P>
	What will it be like for the member representing that riding 
the day after the new electoral map comes into effect? In my 
riding, which has an area of only 384 square kilometres, all my 
predecessors had their offices in the middle of the riding to 
avoid long-distance charges. But after readjustment, the 
member for the new riding will need at least two offices and will 
be practically unable to make calls without incurring high 
long-distance charges.
<P>
	Some would reply, ``The government pays for that''. Yes, 
when the member initiates the call, but when it is the voters who 
call, they complain that they cannot reach their member. They 
can reach him but only if they pay charges that can be quite high 
depending on their complaints. If only for that reason, I think it 
is a bad idea.
<P>
	Furthermore, what is proposed does not take into account, I 
think, the communities' desire to live together because they are 
used to living together. Over the years, places like Saint-Bruno, 
Saint-Hilaire, Beloeil, Chambly-the smallest communities 
have a population of 15,000 or 16,000, while the largest have 
between 30,000 and 35,000 residents-have developed trade 
links as well as cultural and other exchanges involving 
volunteers, regional county municipalities, etc. These 
municipalities have learned to live together and have become 
very good at it. And just for the sake of it, we are now going to 
change riding boundaries to no one's benefit.
<P>
	As I said earlier, my constituency will increase to 110,000 
voters but that of my neighbour will go down to 76,000. What 
did we gain from all this? I would have understood how, if my 
neighbour had encroached on someone else and so on, we would 
have fiddled with the ridings to distribute the population more 
or less equally among the ridings, but that is not the case.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	So I have some trouble understanding why the electoral 
commission is so eager to impose on us new boundaries that do 
not reflect local realities and the desire of people to live 
together, as in the riding I represent; that said, of course, with 
respect for the people who will join our riding. Shifting riding 
boundaries around just for the fun of it was not the main purpose 
of the electoral commission.
<P>
	As for Quebec, we cannot talk about redistribution without 
talking about Quebec and its future. This morning, a poll 
published in the Eastern Townships, on which the riding of 
Chambly abuts, reports that the idea of sovereignty is supported 
by a strong majority in the Eastern Townships; the survey says 
53 per cent.
<P>
	At the beginning of my speech, I told you that the house was 
not on fire and I think that the Liberal Party of Canada has 
understood that and said to itself: ``Better not go ahead too 
quickly with those changes. Quebec will probably separate in a 
year or a year and a half, so we would have done all this 
boundary adjustment for nothing. Better soft-pedal it, if not 
stop it, and we will see later''. I think that is wise on the part of 
the government. I commend it for that and I thank it for saving 
the taxpayers in my riding and all Canadians a fairly 
considerable amount of money.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2769"> 2769 </A></B>
<P>
	This morning, we voted against a motion. I hope that you will 
understand what we on this side of the House were against was 
the rather high-handed way in which they decided to end this 
debate. Certain parliamentary principles are dear to us, whether 
we are independentists or angry federalists, and wanting to cut 
off discussion and debate on a subject like redistribution which 
is important for many people is something that my party and I 
could not support, you understand, and that is why we voted 
against it. But tonight, for the reasons I explained to you, of 
course we will support the motion of the party in power, which is 
a motion from a party that understands things, which sees the 
obvious and knows that the Canadian federation as it now exists 
probably does not have much longer to live.
<P>
	Based on the poll I have here, which is encouraging for my 
political option, we realize that the strongest bastions of 
federalism in the Eastern Townships have been shattered like 
toothpicks, so that is encouraging for my party and me.
<P>
	With that, I tell you that I will vote on second reading of this 
Bill C-18 for extending the mandate, that is for postponement, 
like my colleagues who spoke before me.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a great pleasure to take part in this debate. I found it very 
interesting. All the various parties contributed to it. I would like 
to take it though in a slightly different direction, in a media 
direction that reflects my background somewhat.
<P>
	Let me first describe my riding very briefly. My riding is 
Hamilton-Wentworth. It is a large, rural, suburban and urban 
riding that surrounds Hamilton. It follows the old historic lines 
of Wentworth county. It has a basic shape, a community centre 
and a community of interest going back well over 100 years.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	There is one corner of my riding, the far southeast corner, 
Binbrook. It is a village with some farms immediately around it. 
After the writ was dropped I did a door to door campaign in 
Binbrook, about five days into the election. I was surprised to 
discover as I went from door to door that many people did not 
know who the candidates were. They did not know my name. 
They did not know the name of the Reform Party candidate. 
They did not know the name of the Conservative candidate.
<P>
	I was quite surprised by this. I reflected upon it and asked 
questions. I discovered that the problem in this one small corner 
of my riding was that they were not served by a weekly 
newspaper. They are on the far edge of the circulation of the 
major daily newspaper which is the Hamilton <I>Spectator</I> which is 
in the centre of downtown Hamilton.
<P>
	Again they are on the fringe of radio coverage. Finally, their 
basic interest was directed not toward Hamilton but directed 
toward another community outside of my riding, Stoney Creek 
and down toward the peninsula.
<P>
	I realized then how absolutely essential it is for a politician to 
have a media which serves him because no matter what we do in 
this House or what we do in our lives for that matter, we have to 
reach the public. The public has to know what we do, whether it 
is good or bad, and I certainly hope that if it is good it does know. 
So the media is very important.
<P>
	The rest of my riding is very well served. There are three 
weekly newspapers in various blocks of the suburban and urban 
portion. Of course the majority of the riding receives the 
Hamilton <I>Spectator</I> and there are two AM radio stations and 
some FM stations as well. I am very well covered as far as the 
ability of the media to follow my actions.
<P>
	This redistribution however changes this picture entirely and 
it is a great problem. What has happened to my riding under the 
new redistribution proposal has taken out the urban component. 
As my riding is presently constituted I have about 30,000 people 
in Hamilton Mountain. They are completely eliminated. Instead 
what I have are two new blocks added, one a rural block next to 
Cambridge and another block between Cambridge and 
Brantford. To be more precise the one block is near Guelph.
<P>
	Let me just visualize it for you, Mr. Speaker. You have 
Hamilton, Guelph, Cambridge and Brantford and the new rural 
blocks are in between those two areas.
<P>
	These new blocks would be a great problem for me if this 
redistribution were to go ahead because they do not receive the 
Hamilton <I>Spectator</I>, they do not have weekly newspapers that 
serve them in the same way as my immediate community 
newspapers and they are out of range of the television and radio 
stations that are based in Hamilton.
<P>
	Instead they turn to other communities. Naturally being rural 
communities they look to their nearest urban centre. So the 
block called Puslinch looks to Guelph. The block called north 
Dumfries looks to Cambridge and the block I would call south 
Dumfries looks to Brantford.
<P>
	I am sure that you can see, Mr. Speaker, the problem that is 
presented here. If I say something in this House that is of some 
importance my chances of getting reported not only in the 
community and daily newspapers centred on Hamilton, but also 
in the Cambridge <I>Reporter</I>, the Guelph <I>Mercury</I> and the 
Brantford <I>Expositor</I> are very difficult.
<P>
	In fact, those three newspapers that serve the rural areas that 
we are talking about only form a very small portion of the 
circulation of those newspapers. There is a great difficulty for 
me to get any kind of message out into these rural areas by the 
news media.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2770"> 2770 </A></B>
<P>
	It is the same with the radio stations. These three rural areas 
that I would get in redistribution do not pick up the radio stations 
centred on Hamilton which would have the greatest interest in 
what I do. They instead are served by radio stations in Brantford, 
Cambridge and in these other areas.
<P>
	Again the difficulty and the reality of the media is if they are 
going to do a news story on someone and that someone is of 
importance to perhaps only 5 per cent of their listeners the 
chances of them actually doing a news story is very limited.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	That is the dilemma. The chances of people hearing what I do 
in these two rural blocks is very, very limited.
<P>
	There is another side to the coin which is equally difficult. I 
have a responsibility as an MP to serve the people in my riding, 
and I have to serve those people community by community. At 
present I can follow what happens in my community by again 
turning to the local media. I have three community newspapers, 
I have the major daily paper and I also have the television station 
and radio.
<P>
	The difficulty is that I have to now follow three more 
communities through the media. That means I would have to pay 
attention to these three other newspapers, I would have to pay 
attention to the radio stations and I would have to follow the 
local governments in three additional cities and municipalities.
<P>
	I just do not think it is possible for one MP to cover that large a 
territory successfully, to be up on the news and be up on what 
concerns people over that vast area. Consequently I find that the 
kind of redistribution I am looking at is very flawed.
<P>
	It is a question in my mind of philosophy. The reason we have 
to bring in a bill like Bill C-18 is not to interfere with a body 
outside of government that has been appointed to do a particular 
task. Our job as legislators is to give them the philosophy to 
operate. We have to define for them when they make this 
redistribution what they are doing and why they are doing it. It 
would appear from what I see now that in the past they have 
looked at the numbers purely and they have not given due 
attention to the question of community of interest, how our 
information comes from the politician to the people and how the 
politician gets the information from the people.
<P>
	I would strongly support the intent of this bill because I think 
we are in the business here in this 35th Parliament of looking at 
reform of institutions in the sense of how better we can serve the 
people of Canada and our constituents. I think if we re-examine 
the philosophy of redistribution we may indeed find that 
numbers are not the last word of this issue, that it is how best the 
MP can represent perhaps a geographic entity.
<P>
	Some of my colleagues have mentioned that in northern 
Ontario, for example, the numbers are sparse but the community 
of interest is based on history and geography. If you do it 
straight by numbers of course you are going to skew our historic 
responsibility to the people of Canada whom we serve 
regionally.
<P>
	In concluding, I think this is a very fine move by this 
government. I really do wish that the members of both parties, 
particularly the Reform Party, would reconsider because I think 
this is the kind of reform that all of us in this House wish to see.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in opposition to Bill C-18. My riding of Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke is very adversely affected by the proposed 
boundaries adjustment act. The riding is currently made up of 
two specific geographic areas which have much in common. 
Virtually all of my riding is located in a valley setting on or near 
one of three waterways.
<P>
	There are some notable exceptions in this for mountainous 
communities such as Rossland and Warfield. The entire riding is 
involved in forestry, hydroelectric power generation and 
tourism. The Columbia River treaty affects all communities on 
or near the river from Trail in the south of the riding to 
Revelstoke in the north.
<P>
	Many people travel between towns for work and recreational 
purposes. In the interests of economy we have learned how to 
share. For example, in 1996 Trail and Castlegar are jointly 
hosting the British Columbia Summer Games. Either 
community is too small to host this by itself, but by working 
together the 1996 games should be a spectacular success.
<P>
	In short, we are a riding consisting of commonality of both 
geography and concerns. The proposal under the current 
Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act effectively dismantles 
this riding that has so much in common.
<P>
	The West Kootenay portion of the riding is split down the 
middle with Trail and surrounding communities being placed in 
a riding that would find its centre in the Okanagan, 200 miles to 
the west, an area that has nothing in common with its new 
addition. The rest of the West Kootenays would find itself in a 
riding with its centre 200 miles to the east, again with little in 
common with its new addition.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Revelstoke would find itself in a new riding made up of parts 
of the north Okanagan where it would likely centre. This riding 
would then proceed east past Revelstoke and the Rogers Pass, all 
the way to the Alberta border and include the northern portion of 
the former Kootenay East. Kootenay East would have to give up 
this portion of its old riding to make up for receiving the chunk 
that came from Kootenay West which no one asked for. Revels-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2771"> 2771 </A></B>
<P>
toke has little in common with any of  these geographic areas 
and would be poorly served by the change.
<P>
	With these changes Kootenay West-Revelstoke would cease 
to exist and, yes, I would be an MP without a riding. Given all 
these problems for the riding and faced with the loss of my own 
seat, one might ask why I am not supporting the motion by the 
government. Indeed many have asked that very question.
<P>
	The reason is as follows. In the early stages of the drafting of 
the bill the government was looking for consent from all parties. 
Aside from the problems created for individual ridings like 
Kootenay West-Revelstoke, there were two main areas of 
concern regarding the current boundary readjustment. One of 
these is the fact that it creates six new ridings in Canada, two of 
which are in B.C. The B.C. ridings would most likely end up 
Reform ridings, but we still oppose this because we feel the last 
thing Canadians want or need is more MPs in Ottawa.
<P>
	Each MP adds about half a million dollars in direct costs plus 
untold costs for offices, printing services and supplies, not to 
mention the cost of refurbishing the House which has no 
additional capacity at this time. A condition that would have 
been necessary for us to support the bill would have been an 
assurance that no new seats would have been added to any future 
boundary adjustments. We did not get this assurance.
<P>
	Another condition we would have required is more public 
input and control. One of the problems with the current system is 
that it does not consult the public until the plan is complete, the 
maps are drawn and it is almost a done deal. The government 
was not prepared to offer any assurances on this concern either.
<P>
	Given that we believed these requests were reasonable and in 
the public's best interest, we had to consider that the 
government had a hidden agenda. The hidden agenda we 
suspected was a great increase in the number of seats and the 
removal of public input into the process.
<P>
	Following the passage of the bill to suspend redistribution and 
disband existing provincial boundary commissions, it is 
expected the government will make a motion to assess continual 
increase in the number of members of Parliament and to review 
the selection methods of the commission members, public 
involvement and the commission's powers.
<P>
	This assessment will be carried out by a committee of MPs on 
which the Liberal government would have an absolute majority. 
In actual fact the government by virtue of its majority can 
operate in a manner of dictatorship for the next five years. The 
invoking of closure which the Liberals have strongly opposed in 
the past is the most recent example of business in the usual style 
of the former government.
<P>
	While we have heard of one famous name from the past 
receiving a dollar a year to advise the Liberals, we cannot help 
but wonder if Brian Mulroney was also in need of a dollar.
<P>
	The current process has now reached a point at which public 
input is heard. As devastating as the current proposed changes 
are for my riding, I would prefer to deal with it through the 
public hearing process than take a chance on the government 
accepting or even increasing the number of seats in Parliament 
or removing the public from the process.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 6.29 p.m.,

duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every
