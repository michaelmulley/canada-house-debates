      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We note that Canada's new government has replaced environmental talk with real environmental action through: a chemicals management plan to regulate potentially harmful substances; Canada's first ever clean air act tackling greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution; a biofuels plan; $2 billion in three new ecoenergy initiatives; and exempting donations of ecologically sensitive land from capital gains tax. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While other parties offered Canadians more empty platitudes, Canada's new government is taking real action to clean up our air, land and water.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his distinguished career, Mr. Dink was outspoken against the state, advocating the opinion that Turkey committed genocide between 1915 and 1917 when it forced a mass evacuation from the Ottoman Empire and the related deaths of 1.5 million Armenians. He became victim 1.5 million and one. Mr. Dink's life's work will no doubt serve as an inspiration to other writers around the world who use the power of the pen as a weapon against brutality.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the war he signed up as an underage recruit. He served in the Battle of the Bulge, a member of the only Canadian contingent to do so. He was severely wounded in Normandy, severely wounded in Germany, and spent several years in hospital in Britain and in Montreal. He was a former police officer and police chief in Ontario and Alberta. He now resides in Nova Scotia. </div>

These calls match with the creation of a powerful cabinet subcommittee on energy security and with the minister's comments of 2006 when he said, “Canada's energy strategy is key to North America's economy.” </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artists also suffer another disadvantage in Canadian society. As most of them are self-employed, they do not have access to benefits that are available to people who are employed, such as maternity benefits, sickness benefits and income benefits as are contained in the employment insurance program. There are ways the employment insurance program could be modified to allow for self-employed artists to have access to those kinds of benefits. I think they are critical to them. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petitioners ask us as members of Parliament to rise to the occasion to recognize the value of museums, to recognize the value of heritage and culture, things the government seems to have missed out on. I am not editorializing here but this seems to be the message I am getting from these petitioners. They call upon us to work together to restore the museums assistance funding and recognize the value of our Canadian museums.</div>

The first petition has to do with public safety officers, namely, police officers and firefighters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petitioners call to the attention of the House that our police officers and firefighters place their lives at risk each and every day when they perform their duties and that the employment benefits they often receive are insufficient to compensate the families of those who are killed in the line of duty. Also, they point out that the public mourns the loss when any of these police officers or firefighters lose their life in the line of duty and they would like to have an opportunity to support the families in some tangible way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They therefore call upon Parliament to establish a fund, known as the public safety officers compensation fund, for the benefit of families of public safety officers who are killed in the line of duty.</div>

They also point out that ethical stem cell research has shown encouraging potential to provide cures and therapies for these illnesses and diseases, and also that non-embryonic stem cells, also known as adult stem cells, have shown significant research progress without the immune rejection or ethical problems associated with embryonic stem cells.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397799"></a><p>

I want to step back and talk a bit about how we arrived at where we are.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31, An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Public Service Employment Act</A> came from a committee report that was commissioned by all parties initially to look at the previous election and how it had been conducted. People had some concerns about how that election and previous elections had been conducted. This report was boiled down and turned into this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbeknownst to many people, including myself, the bill was put forward without those of us in the House and on committee understanding that we were going to take on how people voted, the most fundamental aspect of our democracy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard from numerous witnesses in committee about their concerns with this legislation. The amendments that we have put forward deal with those concerns as well as the concerns of many others who spoke to us in our communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397843"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concerns expressed by witnesses and people who we spoke to in our communities were about the requirements for photo ID. Initially, many people said that was fine. However, those without photo identification would be required to have people vouch for them, but an individual who vouched for one person could not vouch for another, and they considered this restrictive. Witnesses who supported this amendment and had those concerns spoke from the perspective of those who worked with our homeless, our most vulnerable, and our students, who some would say are part of our most transient population because of the fact that they move back and forth from their homes to their schools numerous times.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397844"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have tried to encourage both of these groups over the last number of years to exercise their franchise, to vote. Sadly, what we have in front of us are barriers to that. Why? Now they are required not only to have photo identification, but different tiers are being used. If they are unable to produce photo ID, then they are required to produce other pieces of identification with vouchers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397845"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vouchers is a topic of great concern for myself and my colleagues in our party. They will now be required to have someone who is already on the voter's list vouch on their behalf. This can only be done once. We know from people who were witnesses at committee that this is impossible in many cases simply because of the populations with which they deal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397846"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I can reference the homeless population. It has only been recent that we have been able to organize systems in our country allowing homeless people the opportunity to exercise their franchise. That was not done by government, but by the people who work in our communities. They took this on themselves. They were not paid by government exclusively to do this. They saw the need, the benefit and the responsibility as citizens to ensure that our most vulnerable citizens were not disenfranchised. These people did the work that some of us in government should perhaps have done. They took this on themselves. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397847"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are confused and angry because they believe Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> will undo all the good work they have done by way of organizing people who do not have addresses because they are homeless. They ensure the homeless have an address, usually a drop-in centre or homeless shelter, and they are able to vouch on their behalf. The bill as proposed, without our amendments, would mean that those who work with the homeless would not have the opportunity to vouch for more than one person if they themselves were on the voter's list. This would be the restriction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We put forward an amendment that would allow someone to vouch for more than one person. Also, we would have an opportunity to use a system that works in British Columbia. There would be an opportunity for them to swear that people were in fact who they said they were, and this could be tracked and accountable and would not be open to exploitation. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further amendments that we have made have to do with privacy issues. I want to underline the concerns that we have, which I brought forward in committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the bill as written, electors will now have their birth date information given to Elections Canada. This birth date information will be passed on to people who are working in the polling stations for Elections Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397851"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, about the concerns people have had recently about privacy and personal information. We have seen exploitation of the privacy of people recently with companies. We have seen stories about the information of people being used and abused.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have in front of us is a bill that would take the birth date information of citizens and that information would be circulated among all those who work on behalf of Elections Canada. I am not concerned about the propriety in the trust of the employees of Elections Canada. I am concerned about how this information can leak out. We have 308 ridings with I do not know how many different polling stations. This kind of privacy needs to be protected. That is why we put forward an amendment to remove the requirement to have birth date information shared with Elections Canada because of the privacy factor.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at ensuring we have legitimacy and trust in the election system, there are other ways of dealing with that issue, other than sharing the privacy of one's birth date. I know many people in my riding are aghast at the fact that their birth date information would be shared with Elections Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397854"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more egregious is the fact that we now will share, according to the amendment put forward by the Bloc and supported by the Liberal Party, this birth date information with all political parties. For what reason? We know what it is. It is so they can exploit it and use it for their own purposes. It has nothing to do with checking the verification of the voter in front of them. It is an opportunity, to be polite, for political parties to use personal information for their own purposes. Why else would a political party need one's birth date information?</div>
    </p><a name="Para397855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We put forward amendments on birth date information and the sharing thereof. We do not believe Elections Canada should have it to share with everyone. We most assuredly, and I think there would be a charter challenge on this, do not want political parties to have birth date information. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397856"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider this. In my riding of Ottawa Centre we have up to eight to ten different candidates and parties running. This would mean that each and every one of those parties would have access to the private information of each and every elector. How do we ensure that this information will not be shared with others for purposes other than to verify if a voter is genuine?</div>
    </p><a name="Para397857"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I implore other members of the House to support our amendments to ensure that there is privacy protection. When they find out that Parliament will pass a bill that will open up their private information to not only Elections Canada but to political parties, I think most people will be aghast. I am sure they do not know that at this point. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397858"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we have put forward these amendments. I hope for the support and hopefully a change in the minds of the Bloc and the Liberals, who at committee said that it was fine for political parties to have birth date information shared among themselves. That makes no sense. I am sure others in the House, now that they have learned about this, will want to support our amendment to remove that clause of the bill, which allows political parties to have this kind of private information of citizens. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397859"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think if we are unable to have these amendments go forward, it will be very difficult for us to support the bill. I look forward to questions from my colleagues.</div>

I will be frank in saying that I am a bit surprised these concerns are being raised by the NDP, given the considerable measures that the committee went to in its work to ensure that the franchise would be as open as possible to all Canadians, and indeed, more open than it currently is in many respects.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397861"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member mentioned a number of disadvantaged groups. He mentioned the homeless specifically. I want to point out some of the things that were done in committee to ensure that a number of groups that might be disenfranchised, specifically the homeless, are taken care of.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397862"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems for people who move residences frequently, and the homeless obviously would fit that category, is that voters lists tend to fall out of date. We asked as an administrative measure, not a legislative one, and we had an assurance from the Chief Electoral Officer for it, that the Chief Electoral Officer carry out more aggressive enumeration in areas where there is a high turnover of populations, especially in certain areas. In response to a question from me, he said he will carry out enumeration in areas where there are high levels of homelessness. That should do a substantial amount.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also made sure that pieces of ID are added to the list of ID that can be used for voting. For example, special provisions were made for aboriginal identification, for student cards and for bus passes to ensure that these groups are not excluded from the franchise.</div>

It does not address the concerns that I raised in my comments. I was at committee with him. The witnesses stated very clearly that the people they deal with would not have access to the identification he just mentioned. He knows that the change in the bill means that these people often will not be able to find people to vouch for them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397865"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a little puzzled as to his take on this. Bus passes often are not something that someone who is homeless has access to. A bus pass is a piece of identification that normally would require an address on it, so I am not satisfied with his take on how things happened in committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397866"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to also touch on the idea of enumeration. We asked, and we were very clear about it even before this bill, that we have universal enumeration for universal suffrage, nothing less, nothing more. We know about the problems we had when we went to the centralized list. People were left off the list, usually in ridings like my own and other urban ridings where there is a lot of turnover. The fact of the matter is that we have not had assurances. In fact, when we asked for universal enumeration for each election, with people going door to door, that was not accepted. With all due respect to my colleague, it is not enough. An assurance from the Chief Electoral Officer to do that was something we had before.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned that he heard no purpose given to us at committee for having dates of birth given not to electoral parties but to electoral officials. Of course, the date of birth information is very valuable. If an electoral official has a doubt about someone's identity, it can connect them to the age. It may be someone with the same name as their parent or child or a same name of two unrelated people. It seems to me that it is a unique identifier available to electoral officials when there is doubt, not to be spread about, but to add confirmation to the person's identity.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot fathom the reason for political parties needing to have birthdate information. My colleague suggests that maybe it is so they can send out birthday cards, but the purpose here is verification, and the bill calls for photo ID. The idea of sharing birthdate information for all political parties is worrisome for some of us, but as for going to the extent of sharing it with all political parties, the Bloc and the Liberals were the ones who pushed through that amendment. It was not in the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397871"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be very clear. This is about political parties having that information. I know that in the hon. member's previous employment as an ombudsman he would have been deeply concerned that this kind of information, which is private information from my perspective, would be shared. I hope he supports our amendment.</div>

    </p><a name="Para397873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bill that provides real, tangible results for Canadians. Without a well-functioning electoral machinery, of course, our democracy simply will not work. All hon. members will agree that the machinery must be regularly maintained, updated and renewed. That is what Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> seeks to do. It is in fact an ideal example of how to go about doing that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397874"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The genesis of the bill was a parliamentary committee report to which the government responded with legislative action. We have worked with the other parties in fine-tuning the bill after hearing from a number of witnesses at the committee. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397875"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I point out that while we opposed certain changes that occurred to the bill at committee, that is, our Conservative members opposed them, we are now prepared to support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> in its current form. A big reason behind this is that we think this bill has benefited from a multi-party degree of support, which is important in a bill of this nature. For that reason, Conservatives are not going to support the proposed NDP amendments that are before us today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before elaborating on some of the benefits of the bill, I want to express my thanks and gratitude to my predecessor, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78335,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78335&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Niagara Falls</A>, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A>. Through his work as the former government House leader and Minister for Democratic Reform, we are now in a position to advance this important bill, which was, I repeat, the product of cooperation and collaboration in this Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> is just one part of our very robust democratic reform agenda, an agenda based on bringing accountability and integrity to the institutions and processes of governance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397878"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We of course know about Senate Bill S-4, which remains mired in the Senate. Again today the Liberal senators refused to debate it. It has been almost a year since they have gone about refusing to debate it and have filibustered. Their own leader says he supports term limits for senators, yet that bill remains mired there. I cannot understand why Liberals want to make their leader look so weak, but I am not surprised that it is happening.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397879"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is just one part of our agenda. At least on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> we think we can see results very soon.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397880"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to some of the amendments before us, it is important to note that the bill implemented virtually all of the parliamentary committee's recommendations in its report. In particular, it took up the committee's call to do more to combat voter fraud. That is really the core of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>: to protect the integrity of our electoral system.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para397881"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two major recommendations made by the committee—and included in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>—were as follows: to confirm the identity of voters, record their date of birth on the new official lists; establish a standard process for identifying voters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397882"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This same committee reported, on December 13, 2006, on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> to which some amendments were also made. Once again, the committee emphasized the importance of these two specific aspects of the bill. Motions in amendment moved by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78922,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78922&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Ottawa Centre</A> attempt to reverse the committee's decision in this regard.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para397883"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all other members to join me in opposing these amendments so that we can avoid further delays to this very important bill. Let us address them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is the date of birth on the list of electors: The first amendment proposed by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78922,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78922&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Ottawa Centre</A> proposes to remove that provision. At committee, we opposed that as well. However, it is now there in the bill and, as I said, in the spirit of cooperation, we are prepared to support it at this stage so that the bill may move forward. Also, we do agree that it can go some distance to assisting in combating voter fraud and ensuring that people's identification is what they say it is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second is voter identification. The balance of the NDP amendments aim to gut the provisions of the bill that require the provision of identification for someone to vote and, in so doing, effectively undermine the central objective of the bill, which is to ensure the integrity of the electoral process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take, for example, Motions Nos. 2, 4 and 9. On the requirement for voter identification and the ability for polling officials to challenge voters for identification, both of those provisions were part of the key recommendations of the thirteenth report of the procedure and House affairs committee, aimed specifically at dealing with the potential for voter fraud. There were no dissenting opinions to that report, so now we are hearing from the NDP a new position compared to what took place in the original report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397887"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, as I said, addressing voter fraud is the core reason for Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. If we were to remove those provisions, we would weaken it. In terms of requiring identification, the Canada Elections Act already requires voters to provide identification if they wish to register. However, there are no guidelines on what kind of identification is acceptable. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> establishes what constitutes acceptable identification by implementing the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs on this matter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397888"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> will require voters to show one piece of government-issued photo identification with name and address, or two pieces of identification establishing identity and residence. If the voter does not have identification, Bill C-31 allows the voter to take an oath and be vouched for.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These motions for amendment being proposed today will take us back to a realm of uncertainty and uneven practice as to the types of identification that can be used. The government strongly opposes these motions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, we have ample opportunity for anyone who seeks to vote legitimately to do so. The net effect of the amendments being proposed by the New Democratic Party here--and I am surprised after the positive experience of the NDP in supporting the federal Accountability Act that the NDP would propose such amendments--would be to open up loopholes for those who wish to take advantage and those who wish to commit voter fraud. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397891"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the effect of these amendments would be. That is why I am surprised that they come from the New Democratic Party, which I thought was concerned with seeing some preservation of the integrity of the process. That is what we are trying to do with the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the potential for voter fraud hurts the integrity of our electoral system and undermines public confidence in the voting process. In fact, every time someone votes fraudulently, it undermines the legitimate say of every other voter. We all lose a little when that fraud takes place. That is why we cannot support amendments that create the opportunity for such fraud.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill provides better tools to poll officials to confirm the identity and eligibility of voters. One way is through the addition of the date of birth, which is in that amendment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way, which came out of the committee, is to require voters to show identification or be vouched for before voting, and to systemize the identification required before registering at polls so there is certainty, no ambiguity and no opportunity for fraud and cheating.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third way is to allow poll officials or candidates to challenge the eligibility of potential voters and require them to affirm their eligibility in writing: to say who they are and prove who they are. I think most Canadians actually think that is what we have to do now when we vote. I do not think many people are offended by the fact that when they say their name is X they must actually prove they are X. I think that is what Canadians expect. I think that is what Canadians hope for.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many who come to me after voting in an election and say they are amazed by the fact that anybody could have walked up and said they were Jane Doe, or by the fact that their vote could have been taken away because nobody actually asked them for ID. That troubles people. That is why we need to have those voter identification provisions.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555">(1555)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para397897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these tools would be removed from the bill under the proposed amendments from the New Democratic Party. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> and these features in particular were the result of a non-partisan, multi-party recommendation of a parliamentary committee of the House that was seeking to improve the integrity of the electoral process. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These motions for amendment would reverse that work and I hope members will join me in opposing them.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am amazed at the number of people in these communities who do not have access to the kind of identification we are talking about.

    </p><a name="Para397901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are talking about ensuring that people are able to exercise their democratic franchise, the member opposite is accusing us of supporting electoral fraud. I certainly take exception to that because I have people in my region who are trying to vote, who do not have addresses because they are not listed on band addresses, whose children have not had birth certificates, and whose government officials do not come up and fill out the most basic forms that every other Canadian takes for granted.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have some serious problems with this bill because we want to ensure that these people are not disenfranchised. I would be more than happy to invite the hon. government House leader to come with me and fill out some of these forms and he could see some of the problems we are up against. The issue, for example, of the latest census on the James Bay coast was abysmal. It was done poorly.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think most Canadians believe that the provisions for voter identification are not onerous.

    </p><a name="Para397905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do not believe the member for Timmins--James Bay has actually read the bill as it has come out of committee because there is a special provision dealing with first nations. I myself have a first nations reserve in my constituency. I am familiar with the problems and the issues, but they seem to cope with them quite well in the case of my constituents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a special provision that creates an additional opportunity for those from a first nations population that is not there for other Canadians. That provision states:</div>

</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a specific provision there taking into account in particular that they will not have to have that birth certificate.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says that people should prove that they are X. Actually, under the current provisions of Elections Canada, people do have to prove who they are. They can use a statutory declaration. They can have someone vouch for them in the community, so that it is known that they are who they are.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the bill is doing and what the government is doing is actually removing that provision and making it so incredibly onerous for people to vote by having a single voucher, one person vouching for one elector in the same poll. This will completely remove people's ability to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have looked at this bill. When he talks about fraud, and this massive bill has to deal with fraud, I want to ask the minister to respond to the charge that we make. By putting forth this bill and voting for it, he will actually be disenfranchising thousands of people in communities like mine who rely on the system as it is now in order to vote. I would like the minister to come to my community so he can see that.</div>

    </p><a name="Para397915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference is that one person who might have bad intent would not be able to vouch for 250 people. For example, if there are 200 people at a homeless residence, there are 200 people who can vouch for someone else in that residence. There is no difficulty there. There is no challenge. There is ample opportunity for that to occur. No one would be disenfranchised, but it certainly limits the ability of one bad actor to commit large scale fraud and that is a positive thing for the integrity of the system.</div>

Were the elections free and fair? When we say free, we are talking about the right of every adult person to vote, which is a charter right in Canada. The fair side is equally important to the equation of having an election. Fairness means the integrity of the process. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397924"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We as legislators have a duty to ensure that there is integrity in the voter process, so that it will be fairly applied and available to Canadians. Hon. members opposite have spoken of marginalized communities. Of course that means they must be given every possible opportunity within the integrity of the system to vote. That is fairness. It is also fairness to ensure that fraud cannot be perpetrated. I suggest that is what this bill is intended to do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had a long series of discussions and processes to get to this point, including the Chief Electoral Officer's report after the January 2006 election to the committee, our committee's report to the House, and the response of the government in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill makes a number of improvements. It improves access for the disabled. There are more convenient locations for advanced polls. There is access for candidates as well as election officials to gated communities. The processes of the electoral office also allow candidate access to malls or privately owned public spaces where often candidates are not allowed to communicate with the public. A former chief electoral officer made it very clear that there will also be an opportunity for electoral officials to go to perhaps seniors houses and shelters, places where people may not be able to get to the polls. I would suggest that we as a committee and we as legislators be immensely vigilant going forward to ensure that marginalized groups are not left out. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the House had real concerns with the electoral officials and other witnesses who came before us. We implored the Chief Electoral Officer to be more vigilant and more targeted in areas of low enumeration or voter turnout. That office has taken on that responsibility.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also asked that in areas, whether it is an intercity or a remote community, an aboriginal community or otherwise, where people in the past have shown an inability to exercise their franchise, that more vigilant and more targeted enumeration takes place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397929"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the special concern that has been raised with respect to aboriginal communities, remote communities in particular, we put to the Chief Electoral Officer that an acceptable form of government picture identification could be an aboriginal status card, if it had an address on it. If the address is not on it, then there could be a letter from the band office or something else indicating the address of the person together with the card in order to satisfy the requirements.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397930"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we must be extremely vigilant that marginalized groups are not left out of the process, we must also be vigilant and ensure that there is no opportunity for voter fraud, not by those people, but by others who may for unscrupulous reasons, and with many more resources, try to defeat the process and the fairness of the process. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397931"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the fairness of the process and the belief that Canadians have that it is a fair and honest system that is really one of the major concerns in this country. I would suggest that nothing will cause voter participation to decline faster than if the general public loses its faith in the fairness of the process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397932"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That may sound far-fetched, but we all know what happened in 2000 in Florida with the U.S. presidential election and how flawed that process was even though it was presenting a very elaborate electoral system. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do need to be vigilant going forward to ensure people are not left out but we also need to take this as a first step in a much broader electoral reform process. In the spring of 2004, the Law Commission of Canada published a paper. It is an independent commission which, I would remind the government, that it has just starved of all of its budget from its actions last fall. However, the Law Commission came up with a paper on electoral reform that is probably based on greater consultation and greater research than any other electoral reform suggestion in the Commonwealth and there was an obligation on our previous government and on the current government for the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> to answer that Law Commission report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397934"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process had begun. Electoral reform, with the agreement of the NDP, was put in the Speech from the Throne of the previous Liberal government. A committee had plans to look into electoral reform but that, for some reason, has now been stopped. I would put it to all members of the House and certainly to the government and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> that there is a responsibility to take up that public review.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard last week that the government will be hiring a polling company and a think tank to consult in a few communities across the country. I would ask the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105826,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105826&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Attorney General of Canada</A> whether they have ever read that Law Commission report and, if they have, why they think they need an alternative process at this stage and start all over again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have Parliament and the House of Commons in a special committee looking at real electoral reform and then we need a proper response from the government to the Law Commission's report. If we are to have a citizen's assembly, which we had in British Columbia and which is being advanced in Ontario, we need to ensure that the objective is to have an open and comprehensive process and not some slapdash polling process.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member and I were both in the committee when a provision was put into the proposed text of the bill. It was an attempt to deal with the construction of the voters list and the way in which people get left off the voters list. The provision recognized that homeless people actually do have a roof over their heads at certain times when they are at a homeless shelter and that people at homeless shelters are capable of vouching for other individuals. I specifically asked the Chief Electoral Officer for information that would allow us to go and put this provision into the bill. </div>

    </p><a name="Para397953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before stating our position on the motions in amendment, I would like to provide an overview of Bill C-31 and the work that has been done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this bill is to improve the integrity of the electoral process by reducing the opportunity for fraud or error. As a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, I participated in the work leading up to the introduction of this bill in the House of Commons, so I can say that a lot of work went into it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee includes representatives of each political party, all of whom cooperated effectively, thus enabling us to achieve our goal of improving the electoral process and strengthening the public's faith in it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill will reduce the opportunity for fraud or error and will improve the accuracy of the list of electors. It will also make it easier for people to exercise their right to vote and will improve communication among election officials, candidates, political parties and voters. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Conservative government approach other files with the same attitude and the same level of respect for other parties' ideas. The Conservatives' ideological agenda did not dominate our work, which probably explains why we were able to cooperate so well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to discuss in detail some of the provisions designed to reduce the opportunity for electoral fraud and error.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electors must now present government-issued photo identification showing their name and address. In Quebec, a driver's licence is an excellent example of acceptable identification. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elector who cannot produce such identification must present two pieces of identification authorized by the Chief Electoral Officer showing both name and address.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential electors who cannot produce two acceptable pieces of identification may swear under oath that they are who they say they are. They must also be vouched for by another qualified elector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also provides that in case of reasonable doubt concerning whether a person qualifies as an elector—for example, if the person's age or citizenship are in doubt—that person must sign an affidavit. Only citizens over age 18 qualify to vote; currently, no proof of age is required, not even if there is reasonable doubt that the person qualifies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think that such a simple and clearly defined procedure will improve the electoral process by preventing more fraud.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elector's date of birth will be added to the list of electors. This will help better identify the person wishing to exercise their right to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, the lists of electors include date of birth. This system works and fosters the objectives we want to achieve with this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also limits vouching so that an elector may vouch for only one person. This measure will help prevent a practice referred to as “serial vouching”, which could result in fraud.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is serial vouching? Serial vouching is when an individual who was not originally registered to vote is vouched for by someone—whose name is on the list of electors—in order to be added to the voters’ list, and then vouches for someone else who was not registered, and so on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also contains another change that the Bloc Québécois has been calling for for a very long time and that is assigning a unique identification number to every elector. This unique identifier will be included on the list of electors and will improve the quality of the lists by ensuring that duplications are eliminated.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625">(1625)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para397969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to point out that this unique identifier will be randomly generated and assigned by the Chief Electoral Officer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397970"></a><p>

The time limit within which an elector with physical limitations can request a transfer certificate to vote at a polling station with level access has been removed. There will no longer be a deadline for disabled electors to apply for a transfer. I want to emphasize that this amendment does not give licence to avoid making polling stations accessible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397971"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2154793,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2154793&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> permits an advance polling station to serve a single polling division rather than two or more polling divisions, in order to improve accessibility to advance polling stations for voters, particularly in remote regions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397972"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be difficult for voters in these regions to get to advance polling stations. Year after year, a growing number of people choose to go to an advance poll to exercise their right to vote. It is therefore necessary to enhance accessibility.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397973"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also seeks to improve communications between election officials, candidates, political parties and voters. It gives candidates a right of access to common areas of public places for election campaign purposes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397974"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to be able to meet people where they are. An election campaign is a unique opportunity to call attention to ideas and to talk about our record as members of Parliament. We must promote this, while also respecting the public.</div>

In order to do so, it is important that they have access to accurate and up-to-date lists.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various motions were presented to amend this bill. The Bloc Québécois reviewed all them and has taken a stand.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois opposes Motion No. 1, because it would imply not indicating the date of birth on voters lists, thus reducing the chances of properly identifying a potential voter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois is also opposed to Motion No. 2, because it increases the risks of electoral fraud by opposing the simple and clearly established procedure of identifying potential voters by requiring appropriate pieces of identification and having them take an oath.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I want to mention the successful cooperation that led to this bill. I hope the Conservative government will follow this example in the future. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397980"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois supports this legislation. However, we oppose the motions presented at report stage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Bloc Québécois colleagues and I are proud to have proposed some elements of the Quebec electoral system to help the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs in its work. The Quebec electoral system has proven its effectiveness. The elements found in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2154793,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2154793&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> that are patterned on the Quebec model will help improve the federal electoral system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397982"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of this bill is to improve the integrity of the electoral process. I believe that, in this sense, the bill is a step in the right direction. </div>

    </p><a name="Para397984"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the member why she would not be concerned about the reality. I think it has been very clearly documented that if this bill goes through as is, there are people who will lose the right to vote. They are not people who are involved in fraud. They are people who for one reason or another do not have ID. The vouching system that she and her party are now supporting will be impossible to engineer. I can tell her the reality is that people will be disenfranchised and not allowed to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397985"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Bloc is very concerned about voter fraud in Quebec, then why would the Bloc members not come forward with a simple idea such as the one the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78922,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78922&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Ottawa Centre</A> made? Voter cards should be put in envelopes instead of being mailed and sent to buildings where they can be picked up. The most simple thing to do would be to put them in envelopes and put the voter's name on the front. That would probably eliminate potential fraud more than anything else.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397986"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am really mystified as to why the Bloc is supporting this bill and not recognizing the real impact it is going to have on individual voters who often do not get heard. These are people who usually do not have a voice, so when they vote it is really important. </div>
    </p><a name="Para397987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very disappointed that the Bloc is ignoring people who are marginalized and is basically creating a system that will make it impossible for those people to vote. How does the member explain that?</div>

I will answer her questions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP claims that disclosing the date of birth of voters infringes on privacy rights. We in the Bloc Québécois regard the date of birth as an important tool allowing political parties to control the identity of voters who want to exercise their franchise, especially if a would-be voter shows up at a polling station without the required ID. With respect to the NDP's concerns about privacy, the Bloc Québécois suggests that, in Quebec, political parties have access to such information, and democracy in Quebec is no worse off. Consequently, the Bloc Québécois opposes Motion No. 2. The NDP thinks that this provision might restrict the ability to vote of those who do not have ID or forgot their ID at home on voting day. The Bloc Québécois thinks that it is necessary, in order to prevent fraud, that ID be required. Sufficient amendments have been made to the bill to enable sensitive groups such as aboriginal people to exercise their franchise. Note that a homeless person who does not have ID could still vote provided a qualified elector was able to vouch for them. Earlier, the parliamentary secretary described to our colleague from the NDP what was added to the Canada Elections Act for those who may not be able to get ID.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Motion No. 4, clause 22 provides that, in the event that a name is crossed off in error from the list of electors, the elector in question may vote, provided that the elector takes an oath and that the returning officer verifies that there was indeed an error made.

It is a very important bill and unfortunately it has not had a lot of attention. If the bill goes through unchanged, it will have a substantial impact on the voting rights of many low income people in Canada, and certainly in my own riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A>, which includes the downtown east side.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to begin by laying out the alleged problem we are dealing with. We are told that there is voter fraud and therefore these very significant changes need to be made to the Canada Elections Act to prevent fraud. Yet at committee when the debate first started, I actually asked the Chief Electoral Officer if he felt that there were huge instances of fraud. He basically said that there were a few isolated incidents, but no political party had brought to his attention any systemic things going on, and as far as he was concerned it was not a big issue. I was very curious about that because that was the Chief Electoral Officer who was speaking.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been very mystifying and in fact disappointing, as I said earlier, to know that three parties, the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Bloc, are in bed together here to change the Canada Elections Act to deal with an alleged problem. It is like applying a sledgehammer to a fly. The consequences of the bill will have a disastrous impact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397994"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the parties that are supporting the bill claim that they have put provisions in the bill to ensure that homeless people vote and that there can still be a vouching for somebody. However, if we actually look at what the bill contains, we see that it creates a myriad of bureaucratic procedures which I can guarantee will result in many, many people being disenfranchised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397995"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is now, if a person is homeless, on the street, if he or she does not have ID, the person can get a statutory declaration from a lawyer. There can be someone in the community who vouches for people, someone who really does know all kinds of individuals because that person may work at a place like the Carnegie Centre in my riding and can say, “Yes, I know who that person is. Yes, they are who they say they are”. The individual gets the statutory declaration and that individual can vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397996"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way it will work now is that somebody can only vouch for one person if they are in the same poll and if that person is on the voters list. It will be like two needles trying to find each other in a haystack. It will create absolute chaos.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397997"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am deeply concerned that the bill is going through with so little attention, other than from the NDP. I want to thank the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78922,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78922&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Ottawa Centre</A> who did an incredible job on the committee of pointing out every single clause that was a failure and was basically denying people's rights. Other than the NDP and some of the witnesses who came forward to point out the problems, the bill will apparently sail through.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397998"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to give one example. In the 2000 election I felt very honoured to accompany Sereena Abotsway to the poll. She voted under the statutory declaration. It was the first time she had ever voted and she voted with a sense of hope. She was becoming more aware of the political system. Because we had a system in place of lawyers who were there to assist, she felt she had the confidence, the reason and the hope to vote. This young woman unfortunately is one of the six murdered women who are now part of the missing women trial that is taking place in Vancouver. It just wrenches my gut to know that there are so many people out there who are so marginalized and disenfranchised by the system that we create on the basis that we are making it all neat and tidy and that it is all about dealing with fraud.</div>
    </p><a name="Para397999"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear theoretically from the Liberals, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78521,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78521&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver Quadra</A> who said, “Oh, yes, I believe in fairness. It is about fairness”. The way the system will work will be incredibly unfair. Even in the memory of Sereena Abotsway, to think about her and what happened to her and what happens to other people, I feel terrible that the bill will go through and that people will lose the right to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398000"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud of the fact that the NDP caucus is standing up against the bill and saying that the bill is really quite awful and will deny people the right to vote.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank some of the lawyers who came forward at the committee and appeared on video conference: Jim Quail, executive director for the B.C. Public Interest Advocacy Centre; Tina-Marie Bradford, a lawyer with the B.C. Government and Service Employees' Union; and Murray Mollard, executive director of the B.C. Civil Liberties Association.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are knowledgeable people who came forward and told the committee in detail what the system is like now, what works, what does not, and what the impact of these changes will be. They were basically ignored, other than by our member on the committee, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78922,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78922&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Ottawa Centre</A>, who valiantly put forward amendments to try to mitigate the damage in the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the lawyers who actually know what this system is about. They are not dealing with it at a theoretical level. They are dealing with it on the ground. Their advice and expertise were basically ignored and turned down. I feel that this is very unfortunate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the government House leader say that he is in favour of having a system that is as open as possible to maintain the franchise. I heard him say that the Chief Electoral Officer has said that there will be more aggressive enumeration. None of those things are actually going to assist in terms of what takes place in ensuring that a statutory declaration on its own is available and that there can be a proper vouching system to allow it to work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398005"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the claims being made by the government in pretending that the bill will ensure that people who are at risk still have the right to vote are completely false. Even to say that there will be enumeration in homeless shelters and that the government will make sure it happens, it sounds good on paper, but we know that most people who are in homeless shelters have to leave during the day. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398006"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the way these places work. In many places, one part of the rules is that the homeless have to leave early in the morning and not go back until late at night, so exactly where are the enumerators going to find people in homeless shelters?</div>
    </p><a name="Para398007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the rationale being given by the government House leader on this bill is very superficial. Again, the government should have paid attention to the people who really know how the system works in the local community and at each individual poll and polling district and what it is that the bill would do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that if we were truly addressing the inconsistencies and problems in our electoral system we would be calling for universal enumeration. Again, this is something that was ignored by the government. It is being ignored by the other political parties. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know about other members, but I remember the day when we could go down the street and actually see the voters list on the telephone poles. We could see whether or not we were on the voters list. We actually had an enumerator who went door to door and asked if people in the enumerated household were eligible to vote. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a system that worked, but now we have the high tech, centralized system. There is absolutely no question about it, because the evidence is there: as a result of that new system, many people have been left on the margins and their ability to access the system and to get on the voters list has been seriously undermined. That is a reality of what has taken place over the last decade.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the government adds insult to injury by taking away the one provision that was left to ensure that someone who was in a very vulnerable situation and did not have the right ID could at least still get to the poll. That would now be taken away with the bill if these particular amendments are not supported.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I do not think that this is a good day for the House of Commons. We are meant to be here to represent the public interest. The right to vote of all people, whether wealthy or poor, homeless or living in a fancy house, is being seriously undermined by the bill, so it will be a very bad day in the House of Commons if the bill goes through.</div>

They are valid things to be concerned about. I think it is not valid to say, as she is saying, that these things have not been taken into account in the bill, in the work the committee did on the bill, in the questions we asked the Chief Electoral Officer, in the responses he gave us, and in the way we incorporated his responses in the amendments to the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will point this out again and ask her why she thinks this does not work. The law is now amended. I invite the member to look at subclause 16(1) of the bill, which states that an elector or any other elector living at the residence of that particular person, for example, at a homeless shelter, can vouch for the person and get him or her on the voters roll. Not only that, but they can be vouched for at the poll. They cannot vouch for many people, but it does not mean that many people cannot vouch for other people on that list. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member says that people have to go to the homeless shelter during the day. That is a good point, but we have a number of ways of dealing with it. They could be enumerated when they are back at the shelter by adjusting the enumerator's hours. Enumerators frequently work in the evening for this reason anyway, so it would be easy to accomplish this goal. It could be dealt with by other means. There is a wide variety of ways this could be dealt with. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I cannot understand is why she thinks that with this provision--and this provision was put in specifically after the Chief Electoral Officer was asked how to deal with this kind of problem--this seriously fails to achieve the goals that she is outlining.</div>

The member also heard it. I think knows very clearly that the system his government has devised for this bill will create complexities in saying that only one person who is in the same poll and already on the list can vouch for only one person.

    </p><a name="Para398026"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 22, 2006, the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs tabled a report in the House that was entitled “Improving the Integrity of the Electoral Process: Recommendations for Legislative Change”. The report was based in part on the recommendations from the Chief Electoral Officer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398027"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it has already been referenced and there continue to be ongoing discussions and debate about fundamental changes to our electoral system, these should not detract from the efforts that should be made to improve the existing system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398028"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This enactment amends the Canada Elections Act to improve the integrity of the electoral process by reducing the opportunity for electoral fraud or for error. It requires that electors, before voting, provide one piece of government issued photo identification that shows their name and address, or two pieces of identification, authorized by the Chief Electoral Officer, which show their name and address. Or they can take an oath, or be vouched for by another elector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398029"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also amends the Canada Elections Act to, among other things, make operational changes to improve the accuracy of the national registry of electors. It facilitates voting and enhances communications with the electorate. It goes on to amend the Public Service Employment Act to permit the Public Service Commission to make regulations to extend the maximum term of employment of casual workers. This works both for the system and for the individual workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398030"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us in this House have gone through the electoral system at least once. Many of us have gone through it several times. On election day, we put our faith in the hands of our electorate. However, collectively as Canadians, voters and candidates, we also depend on the integrity of the electoral system to reduce the opportunity for electoral fraud and to ensure secure, fair and accessible voting on voting day. It is my hope that the initiatives contained in this legislation will enhance this process for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398031"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key concern for the Liberal committee members is ensuring that the bill allows for aboriginal status identification to be acceptable as proof for voting purposes. Government officials have clarified that the text of the bill requires either, number one, government issued photo ID with an address, or number two, government issued photo ID without an address, including band status cards, accompanied by a letter from the band council or by a phone or utility bill that shows the resident's name and actual address.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398032"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second concern for the Liberal committee members is ensuring that the enumeration process is strengthened in reserve communities. The government has suggested that, rather than send the bill to committee, the committee simply pass a motion calling on the Chief Electoral Officer to strengthen enumeration in reserve communities and in other areas of low enumeration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398033"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to strike the balance that ensures the integrity of the system without becoming overly onerous on the citizen and denying him or her the right to vote. It is a privilege to cast a ballot. I appreciate the fact that voters do not have acceptable ID. I also know that all of us in this House can dedicate ourselves entirely to the activity of election day. As a matter of fact, many of us spend every waking moment and several weeks campaigning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398034"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the vast majority of Canadian voters have busy lives that involve hectic, challenging schedules. Even though voter turnout improved in the 2006 federal election, it continues to be alarmingly low. It is important that Canadians can go to their local polling station knowing what information is expected of them in being able to exercise their democratic right. It is our expectation that a uniform procedure for voter identification at the polls will provide clear and consistent information and a system that reinforces the importance of exercising one's right to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398035"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the House also support the strengthening of the enumeration process, particularly, again, in reserve communities and in other areas of low enumeration.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, parts of the proposed legislation also address accessibility issues as some voters with disabilities will no longer required to request a transfer to a polling station with level access three days in advance. As well, the proposed legislation opens up accessibility to advanced polls. These are positive improvements for people with mobility limitations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398037"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side of the House, we support the changes to the Canada Elections Act that protect against the likelihood of voter fraud and misrepresentation. We need to ensure that aboriginal photo identification is an acceptable form of voter identification.

She had some great input and many of her suggestions actually wound up in the bill. The hon. member for the NDP spoke about a number of witnesses, and the member was at committee when they spoke.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to pose a question and make a comment or two.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398040"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the witnesses described the issue of statutory declaration and the process whereby tables would be set up in various areas and people would declare who they were. I am sure the member will recall one a question that was posed to a witness about how someone would know the individual was exactly who he or she said. The response was that sometimes they asked them to check their pockets. Sometimes parking stubs or perhaps prescription bottles were found in their pockets. This would help firm up who they were.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the witnesses prior to that suggested these folks were often robbed, which is a terrible thing, but ultimately suggested that whatever was in their pockets was not there very long. The question was posed that if this was the case, then the first thing that would get stolen would be prescriptions. The statutory declaration issue became a little less reliable, given the way these folks were identified was in itself completely unreliable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member understood this issue very well and she made some great comments at committee. Could she perhaps confirm that although statutory declarations have a role, they certainly have a lot of holes in them?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are out of the cold programs in my own riding of Kitchener Centre. There are homeless shelters. The people who work at these establishments know their clientele very well. One of the things that I found most shocking, when we were in government, was how we addressed homelessness. A great number of homeless people actually go out to work every day. They may have underemployment issues. They may have minimum employment. They are known people who are carrying on with their lives but do not have money for shelter. These kinds of people will be known at the House of Friendship. They will be known at the out of the cold programs that are run by churches like St. Andrew's in downtown Kitchener. Individuals will be able to vouch for these people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be very cognizant of keeping that proper balance, but I would agree that these are positive changes. We do not support the amendments that the NDP has brought forward. We feel they take out a very important aspect of the improvement.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In committee I had deep concerns about the fact that not only would the government have access to this private information, which it does from time to time, but political parties would have access to it as well. The Bloc put this forward as a motion and the Liberals supported it. Now the government is supporting it too, under the auspices of goodwill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398049"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand the need for parliamentarians to have that private information. We have seen recently the concerns consumers have about private information being out there. There will be 308 ridings, with goodness knows how many political parties, all having the birth date information of all electors. We already have problems with our system mixing things up. We just need to ask people who thought they were Canadian citizens.</div>

There are a number of concerns that we face on the front lines in my riding to which I would like to speak.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398054"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, I find it very interesting that in terms of electoral reform issues, this is the one issue that has been brought before the House. We are talking about the threat of fraud, yet we see very little evidence of actual fraud having occurred.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398055"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006 there was one case of fraud in the entire country. In 2004 there were zero cases. In 2000 there were three cases. That is four out of the millions of people who voted in elections in the country. Yet we have a need for all parliamentarians to stand up and deal with this threat.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398056"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise the question that perhaps it is guilty minds. We have only to look at the leadership races of parties in the House, where questions of conduct have been much more egregious than what we see in people who try to exercise their democratic franchise. Certainly no one would suggest average citizens would be out patting down cadavers to see if they had party memberships to vote for the leadership, as happened to some very august members of the House. What are we thinking to impose on the honest law-abiding citizens of our country? </div>
    </p><a name="Para398057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest the bigger issue is disenfranchisement and cynicism about the electoral process. We need to be looking at that. There are number of problems that have to be addressed. I would have expected that they would have been addressed in a bill brought forward by the new government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398058"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, on the need for electoral reform, people have been calling out for it. People are tuning out of the electoral process. They are tired of our old system and they feel that more voices have to be heard. Yet the two main parties certainly have no real interest in seeing this go forward, so this is not coming forward as a priority.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is on how the actual electoral voting system works now that we do not have a proper voting list. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 2004 election people in my riding who went to vote were told that they were on a voter's list 40 kilometres away. I know people in the southern end of my riding were told they did not belong in their own riding because their mailbox was in the municipality. Elections Canada had actually run a line through the bottom of my riding so people who lived in my riding were told they had to vote in another riding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are problems. People get fed up when they try to vote. They go home and they say they are not going to vote. That is a serious threat to democracy. I would have thought that issue would have been brought forward with some sense of urgency, but no.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are dealing with is the potential that somewhere down the road Canadians are going to commit fraud in voting. Why would anyone go out of their way to defraud just to try to vote, when we are begging and encouraging people to come out? However, that is a larger philosophical question.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus on a few areas that are very important in my region. I have very large isolated first nation communities. When we talk about getting a photo ID card, that makes sense, if we believe that every Canadian has a right to a photo ID card. However, on the James Bay coast up to 30% of our population is not eligible for health care status because the province of Ontario does not bother to go and deal with the Cree communities. It has fallen to my office and my provincial counterpart, Gilles Bisson. We go there and fill out these cards.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398064"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interesting thing about this is how do they get a photograph on the ID when the provincial government is leaving it up to a federal member of Parliament and a provincial member of the legislature to fill out the forms for citizens? Guess what. The Ontario government has a special loophole. It does not bother giving a photograph, if one lives on the James Bay coast. It will simply fill out the form and send it there with a trillium logo.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is amazing. I have thousands of wonderful looking Cree families and all their faces look like a trillium logo because the province of Ontario does not even both to ensure that these people have photo ID. This is something they are expected to have if they are going to be able to vote.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705">(1705)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para398066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the issue of having an address. I invite anybody to go into Fort Albany and ask people their addresses. People do not have street addresses that they go by. We find that in all our communities. We have many of our communities where they simply do not have even the most basic registration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if we are talking about administering an oath, I would like to see electoral officers come up and do the oath in Cree or Ojicree. Many elders, for example, do not speak English. Many elders have not birth certificates, but we are trying to get them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the issue of these community members being unfairly penalized because somebody somewhere might some day decide to defraud the system. I find it is an outrageous thought. Imagine people in Attawapiskat going to the poll and claiming to be someone different when everybody knows who they are.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the members of Parliament think I am making light of these issues, I would like to quote some of the testimony that was brought before the committee from Nishnawbe-Aski Nation, which represents the 70 communities across the northern Treaty 9 area, an area I represent.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the message I hear from the leadership in Nishnawbe-Aski Nation and the Mishkeegogamang tribal areas, and it is a message I want to bring to Parliament. Our people on the James Bay coast are not committing fraud. The biggest issue we have is encouraging them to see themselves as participants in the electoral system. That has been a hard sell. We need to ensure that more and more Canadians are entitled and encouraged to vote and are made to feel that voting is something worthwhile.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will go back to the original point that I started to make.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put this forward as the only bill so far of electoral reform in this Parliament, and it is to deal with fraud. We have had almost zero cases of fraud in the electoral system. Yet we know this bill would disenfranchise hundreds, if not thousands, across Canada. For the one person convicted of fraud in 2006, for the zero persons in 2004, for the three convicted in 2000, what we are setting out to do is to go after many people on the margins who right now we should be trying to encourage to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude with this whole question of allowing political parties access to birth dates. Some people might say this is a minor issue, it is a way of ensuring fairness. I do not impugn any political parties here or any political regions in the country, but I suggest that is in there for the crassest political opportunism. The idea of outreach in certain parties is to get people's birth date and then phone them on their birthday and say, “Hi, it's Bob, your MP, phoning you on your birthday”, and that is supposed to suffice. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398077"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I first heard about this trick from a MLA from Quebec who said, “You know, this is the one thing I do all year, I make sure I phone everybody on their birthday, and they love it. And you know what? I don`t have to do much else”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we are saying is, in the interest of going after the fraudsters, we have to ensure that every political party can ensure that they can phone constituents on their birthdays just to secure their vote. That is the reason we are talking about this today. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be honest. I know it is a sin as a politician, and I have to admit it, to give away trade secrets to the general public so they know how politicians really act. However, I feel incumbent at this moment to stand up and speak. The reason we want their birth date information is so we can hit them up on their birthday and secure a vote. I think that is fairly cynical, just as I feel a lot about this bill.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage the members to consider the bigger issue, which is that we need to find ways for people to have confidence in the democratic system and to feel as if they can become involved. I am concerned that what we are going after is a chimera because we have not seen the evidence of fraud to back up the need for this. If there were large areas, I would consider it, but at this point I cannot see further disenfranchising the communities in my riding, such as Ogoki, Kashechewan, Attawapiskat, Peawanuck, Moosonee and Moose Factory. I cannot see people from those communities, who have already been marginalized enough, feeling that they need to do anything more than to show up and say that they are citizens of this country. </div>

There are no qualifications. It does not say anything about bringing ID. It does not say anything about people having to give out their birth date information. They have that right.</div>

The Chief Electoral Officer presented himself to the committee and that was not what he said.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially he said, “We will prosecute and we are prosecuting electoral fraud vigorously”. I asked him to tell us how much had actually been done and to send the committee the information. Having been the Chief Electoral Officer for five elections, I asked him how many prosecutions there had been. His answer was that there had been less than one prosecution per election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398084"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the member is actually suggesting that less than one case of actual fraud occurs in the entire country over the course of more than one election. A more plausible scenario is that basically the way the law is written it is impossible to prosecute electoral fraud. The problem is that it is impossible to hunt down the multiple voting that occurs because there is no record left behind. This is an attempt to deal with that problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398085"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to give an idea of how bad the problem is. In the riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78598,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78598&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Trinity—Spadina</A> in the last election we were told that thousands of people turned up on election day who did not have any record of their existence on the voters rolls but were allowed to vote because the choice came down to either allowing them to vote en masse or basically freezing out large numbers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One man, James DiFiori, said that he voted three times, once for the Liberals, once for the Conservatives and once for the New Democrats. He is the only person being prosecuted by the Chief Electoral Officer after the last election because he was the only one for whom they had any hard evidence whatsoever.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an attempt to deal with the fact that there is no evidence by creating a paper trail, by creating ways to allow people to vote legally and preventing others from voting multiple times or illegally when they are not eligible. I wonder if there is a response from the member to this particular problem.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument that there has only been one or two frauds, et cetera, does not necessarily reflect how much fraud there is. If we do not have the tools to detect fraud, how will we know unless we provide more tools?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have done too much work over the years to raise the level of respectability of this profession. For the member to suggest that if we give the list to the political parties, all MPs will use it to phone people to wish them a happy birthday, is absolutely ludicrous. Our ridings have 100,000-plus people in them. The parties do have access to the list because that is part of the political process.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue here is that we need to pick our priorities.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has been added to the bill, thanks to the interventions by some of the other parties, is that not only do we take the election scrutineering information, but we turn it over to political parties.

    </p><a name="Para398101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important at the outset to give accolades to Elections Canada and the men and women who serve in that institution. What is probably not well-known by many listeners today is that the people who work at Elections Canada are world-class individuals who do world-class work. The proof in the pudding is that they have been asked time and time again to lend their expertise to countries that are trying to get out of environments that were highly undemocratic and often fraught with individuals who grossly abused their power and often dictatorships. Canada, through Elections Canada, has given those countries the ability to move from a dictatorship to a democracy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One individual who is more responsible for that happening than anyone else, someone who is one of the best and brightest, is the head of Elections Canada, Jean-Pierre Kingsley. He has led Elections Canada and, under his 16 year tenure, has moved it into an institution that is world-class.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elections Canada has served in many areas. I remember during the time when South Africa was moving from its dark days of apartheid into a rainbow nation and a democracy, it was Canada that came to the forefront to help out the South Africans to do something that was utterly inspiring and quite remarkable in moving from a draconian system into one that is a democracy without bloodshed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us remember those times so long ago when we saw lineups of people that would extend for kilometres, individuals who for the first time in their life were able to exercise that most remarkable of democratic rights, the right to vote. Canada played an extraordinary role in that, as did Elections Canada. In fact, Jean-Pierre Kingsley and his team had a lot to do with it, as they did in the Ukraine, Democratic Republic of Congo, Aceh and so many others.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the government has, ironically, squeezed Mr. Kingsley out of his position. No longer will Jean-Pierre Kingsley be Canada's Chief Electoral Officer and, in that, we all lose.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to have electoral reform, what is one thing that we could do to dramatically improve the ability of individuals to exercise that mighty right to put their check mark against somebody's name they want to represent them? It is electronic voting. In this era of new Windows operating systems, in these powerful computers that we have today and powerful operating systems, does it make sense that we cannot use the technologies that we have today to enable Canadians to vote electronically? There is no reason whatsoever, without putting the appropriate checks and balances in place, that we cannot have electronic voting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can just imagine what we could do if that were an option for Canadians to vote in a federal election. One can just imagine what that would do in terms of being able to garner and allow a greater number of people to exercise this right that so many have gone before and given their lives to enable us to do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398108"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a remarkable thing and, in particular, for a couple of populations: first, populations that are isolated, aboriginal and non-aboriginal, as members have mentioned before; and, second, youth. We know that many youth are not getting their information and news from traditional media. They are getting it through other means, often through computers and through the Internet. Why not tap into that and enable people to vote electronically which would enable people to exercise their democratic right and strengthen the democratic pillars of our country. It would be a remarkable thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps what is more important than how we elect individuals is the ability of those who we choose to come to this mighty House to exercise their ability to represent their constituents. I am talking about democratic reform. The Conservative Party's roots were in the Reform Party, and I was a member of that party. In part we came to this House to democratize it.

He knows from where I came. His view is different from that party's. His view is the opposite of reforming Parliament. He is an acolyte of the Straussian view of the world and believes that a small group of people are destined to rule. This is a dangerous thing. We see it now where decisions are not being made among the Conservative caucus but decisions are being dictated to the caucus by the Prime Minister's Office. A tiny group of people in the Prime Minister's Office is making decisions for everybody. It has to be disheartening for members who can serve their constituents, their communities, this House, and our country well with their individual expertise. They are innovative and they have solutions to offer that can be implemented in the public interest. Why is that no happening?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can we not reform the committees of the House? Why can we not allow individuals on those committees to do a better job for their constituents? There is no reason that cannot happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things the government could do with respect to the public service that would be innovative would be to abolish the mandatory age of retirement. The mandatory age of retirement was set when the lifespan of individuals was in the late fifties, not today's lifespan which is 79 years for a man and 81 years for a woman. That would be an innovative way to reform the public service act. That is not included in this bill but it ought to be.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of accountability which the government speaks about, one of the big lies is the government's Federal Accountability Act. It is one of the government's initiatives where it is pulling the wool over people's eyes. The Federal Accountability Act is causing gridlock in the public service. It will not enable the public service to do its job and liberate the innovation that resides in the outstanding men and women who serve in our public service. That is a shame. The public is not aware of this. The Federal Accountability Act works counter to the public interest.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things I hope the government does is to really look at the census that just took place on two counts. One is the non-core questions that the census asked. A number of my constituents, in their words, are being harassed by Census Canada in obliging them to take part in ancillary aspects of the census which really have little to do with the kind of core information that the census has always been about. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is the identification mechanisms that are being used and which companies are being allowed to access this information.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Chief Electoral Officer when he testified before the committee testified that on electoral fraud he did not see the need for these measures, if I can paraphrase him. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78395,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78395&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Timmins--James Bay</A> went through the actual incidents. In the last federal election, of the 10 million people who voted, only one person was actually convicted of fraud. It turned out he was not yet a Canadian citizen. Perhaps he misunderstood the rules. He was a landed immigrant, but he did not have his citizenship. Somehow he did manage to cast a ballot. The system caught him. He was given an absolute discharge. I guess the Chief Electoral Officer determined this was not malicious. It was in fact erroneous. It was more in error. We are glad that the system was working such that the person got tripped up. I believe he received 30 days of community service and then it ultimately wound up in an absolute discharge. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP is passionate about this issue for a number of good reasons. Anyone who heard the speech by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A> would have been moved. My colleague from Vancouver East has tried to address the issue of disenfranchisement and to enable more low income people to vote who otherwise may fall through the cracks. She has gone to enormous lengths. She has even set up voter registration tables with lawyers working pro bono to help people who may not have their requisite pieces of ID, or may for whatever reason not have been enumerated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398147"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could point out that one of the things that does deserve our attention is the appalling condition of the permanent voters list and the lack of enumeration that goes on in the current regime. As the member representing the riding of Winnipeg Centre where there is a high incidence of low income people and a transient population, the permanent voters list is of almost no value to us in certain neighbourhoods. When the door to door enumeration stopped, we lost track of tens of thousands of people. I say that with no fear of exaggeration or being accused of any contradiction.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The permanent voters list and the full door to door enumeration, those are areas we should be debating in the House of Commons today. I am not sure we should be debating this non-issue, this notion that there is widespread fraud. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398149"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague from Burnaby—Douglas pointed out, if we did want to write a new law about electoral fraud, we should have pulled together a committee of failed Conservative and Liberal candidates who may be authorities on the subject. Given the way some nominations we know of are run in this country, maybe there are people who have had personally frustrating experiences within their own parties but do not extrapolate that on to the population as a whole.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am the spokesperson for my party for ethics, privacy and access to information. Under the privacy category, I am appalled that we are considering putting the date of birth on the voter's list. We will now have a voter's list with a name, address, phone number and date of birth. That is a recipe for identity theft. We might as well hand somebody a kit stating that this is all they need to steal somebody's identity and get credit cards, et cetera. This is appalling.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the process at our committee of reviewing PIPA, the Personal Information Protecting Act. It is all about the obligation, the duty, to protect personal identities that we have in our possession. I know how voter's lists end up getting distributed within election campaigns. Sometimes a page gets torn out and given to a canvasser who is told to go canvass a couple of blocks. It gets circulated widely and freely. That alone would make this particular bill subject to a number of legal challenges.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the stricter requirements about identification will have the net effect of disenfranchising people to the point where those barriers will be deemed to be in violation of the charter and the right to cast one's ballot. I believe there is enough in the bill that it will be challenged and probably will not survive that challenge.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The privacy issue alone is enough reason to condemn the bill. The idea is that we are throwing up barriers for low income people, marginalized people, and people with unstable addresses and a lack of ID to vote, which I believe could constitute a charter issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third thing, the most frustrating thing, perhaps, is that in the context of this 39th Parliament it is unlikely that electoral reform will come back to us, although there is a private--</div>

    </p><a name="Para398158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, in order to curb the exodus of young graduates to large urban centres and to encourage them to move to the regions to begin their professional careers, I am proposing an amendment to the Income Tax Act to introduce a non-refundable tax credit for new graduates working in designated regions. I myself live in a resource region in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and I see first-hand everyday the impact of the exodus of young people on our region.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax credit would be for individuals who, in the 24 months following the date on which they successfully complete the courses leading to the awarding of a recognized diploma, begin to hold employment in their field of specialization in a designated region.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognized diplomas generally mean those awarded for technical training, or college, occupational or university studies. This bill allows individuals, for a maximum of 52 weeks, to benefit from a tax credit totalling a maximum of $8,000. Based on this year's taxation table, here are a few examples of how beneficial such a tax credit could be.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an individual earning $30,000, the amount of federal income tax payable will be $2,695. This amount will be credited in full with the implementation of such a tax measure for new graduates. If the individual has income of $40,000, the amount of the credit will be $4,172, whereas someone who makes $50,000 will receive a tax credit of $6,000. I would like to specify that this is a credit for new graduates working in designated regions and that these figures represent the situation of a taxpayer without a basic personal tax credit. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398162"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the members of the House of Commons that the Quebec government adopted a similar measure in 2003. In the first year after it was implemented, 2,500 individuals benefited from the new Quebec government tax measure. The year after, the number rose substantially, to 9,700 individuals. The measure had a definite impact on several administrative regions in Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, many individuals benefited from this tax credit: more than 1,200 in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, more than 1,600 in the Lower St. Lawrence, almost 800 in Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, more than 1,000 on the North Shore and more than 4,000 in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. In the second year, almost 10,000 individuals took advantage of the tax credit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people might not otherwise have come to the regions to take their first job after graduating. In many cases, they came with spouses who decided to look for work in the regions as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last spring, the Government of Quebec changed the tax credit, which is now a maximum of $3,000 per year and can reach $8,000 over three years, rather than over one year. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2152761,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2152761&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-207</A> provides only for a credit for a one-year period. This will make it easier for us to assess the impact of this sort of measure on young people and will let us make any changes that are needed in due course.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the large number of young people who are leaving our regions, the shortage of skilled labour is a real problem for the regions, which are losing workers to larger centres. Putting this sort of measure in place will stop the population drain and make it easier to develop processing industries by providing businesspeople with the skilled labour they need.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1745"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745">(1745)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para398167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialized workers are needed for many regional jobs, especially in primary resource processing and secondary and tertiary processing in forestry, metallurgy, electrical technology and other fields.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, specialized labour is often easier to find in major centres than in the regions, forcing many businesses to move to large cities or close their doors. Without the labour they need, many businesses in the regions are forced to stay small or have trouble expanding. But there is hope for our young people in the regions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who do not live in a resource region cannot truly understand the demographic problems many regions are experiencing. Out-migration is having a devastating impact on regional economies. Young people leaving the regions and new arrivals prefer to settle in major centres. We cannot abandon the men and women living outside these centres. Smaller communities are beginning to decline, with the exodus of young people and the aging of the population.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exodus of young people is not a new phenomenon, but for many years the birth rate compensated for it. That is no longer the case. That is why, for the past few years, the Government of Quebec has been trying to bring young people back to the regions and encourage them to stay there. Some municipalities have decided to follow suit by offering new residents property tax breaks for a certain number of years. For example, the City of Mont-Joli, in Gaspésie, was offering a three-year property tax holiday to everyone who decided to build a new home there. Businesses are also offering a number of incentives to new property owners. This is just one example to illustrate the urgency of the situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Quebec, some municipalities and some businesses are doing everything they can to save the cities and towns that are part of our shared heritage. The federal government must do its part to keep our young people in the regions and encourage them to settle there. That is why I have decided to introduce Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2152761,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2152761&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-207</A> on behalf of my party, the Bloc Québécois. I myself am from a resource region, so it is clear to me that both the Saguenay—Lac Saint-Jean and my riding, <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78427,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78427&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</A>, are in an unenviable position.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398172"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006, the Government of Quebec's tax credit for new graduates cost about $30 million. We can therefore assume that a similar program on a national scale would cost about four to five times as much. The Government of Canada can afford such a measure, which is sure to benefit all Canadians and Quebeckers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398173"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the situation is not as serious everywhere in Canada, economic activity has gradually been moving from resource and rural regions to larger centres, a phenomenon that, in places like Saskatchewan and Manitoba, is creating economic difficulty in regions with shrinking populations. This situation remains a concern for every one of Canada's provinces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398174"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would invite members of this House to support this bill so we can help our resource regions and rural communities keep their young people who, in many cases, want to stay.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that this bill fits into the regional development policy of the Government of Quebec.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also recognize that the negative growth in some resource regions is not just occurring in Quebec, but elsewhere as well. This measure has some advantages. Among other things, it offers a financial incentive for a young person to settle in a region. He or she can make plans, invest their money in a home or buy a car. It is an incentive to encourage a young person to settle in a resource region to work and create a home.</div>

Any initiative that encourages and promotes further growth and investment in the regions is one I feel compelled to engage in, study, and give it my foremost attention.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398182"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share many of the same concerns as my colleague. Certainly, I believe in the importance of the regions. That is where we grow our crops, harvest our fish, and mine our minerals. From the regions we make a great contribution the economy of this country and, indeed, to the overall fabric and mosaic of this great nation. Certainly, some regions are better prepared and are faring better than others, but sometimes initiatives have to be undertaken in order for all Canadians to have the opportunity to engage and share in the wealth of this great nation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398183"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, a great number of areas in the country are doing extremely well. In my area of the country, Cape Breton and eastern Nova Scotia, there has been a tremendous engagement in the Alberta tar sands. The phenomenon of the Alberta tar sands in Fort McMurray is a great resource that is being shared by all Canadians, which is evidenced by the number of people we are seeing go west to work. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398184"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that many employers in the west now are getting much better at accommodating eastern workers, workers from Quebec and other regions of this country. We see them now going out for six weeks and two weeks back home. The wealth is coming back to the communities and that is a positive thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398185"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bit of a social void where people are out of the community and away from their families for an extended period of time and that certainly causes concern. They are not able to do volunteer work with the minor hockey associations and various other associations, but at least the income and benefits are coming back into the community. I see that as a positive thing. I do not see it as the answer for the regions. I share the opinion as well that there is a responsibility on the part of the federal government to do all in its power to allow the regions to continue to grow and prosper. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituency of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78918,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78918&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cape Breton—Canso</A> has been a benefactor in recent years of some valuable investments within the community. My colleague identified several that had been undertaken within his constituency. My constituency has benefited from Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation. I recognize that there is no miracle plan, there is no magic cure in developing regions. It is a constant hard work, learn from experience type of initiative and that is how one grows the region.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398187"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been success and over the last 8 to 10 years the unemployment rate has dropped in my community from 25% to 12.5%. A significant portion of that is because some people have left the area, which is unfortunate, but still we have had growth in the job sector. We have made some good investments and had access to some tools. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398188"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of this private member's bill is really giving the regions another tool in order to recruit and retain some of the young human resource. Any time we can add another tool to the kit to grow the regions, it is imperative that we do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398189"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nova Scotia has the payroll tax credit. That was a program that was set up by a past Liberal provincial government under the stewardship of former economic development minister Manning MacDonald. That has been a tool that the province of Nova Scotia has really made use of and any companies coming in that invest in that province have really identified that as a tool that has certainly paid benefit to them and has enticed them to come and invest in the province of Nova Scotia.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800">(1800)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para398190"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past government was committed to regional economic development. We identified in budget 2005 over $800 million to be allocated to regional economic development from FedNor, ACOA, and other regional economic development agencies. Certainly, that was a testament to the belief the past government had in regional economic development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398191"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation and ACOA we have been able to invest in infrastructure. There are a couple of communities like Inverness in my constituency where the federal government invested in access to water. A business in our community wanted to expand its capability to process crab. It was very noble. It had a business plan put forward, which meant the purchase of equipment and the investment in human capital, but it also involved access to an incredible supply of fresh water in order to process the crab. The company was not able to make that investment because its business plan was to invest in the equipment for the processing. As a federal agency, we were able to partner with the municipality and allow access to the fresh water. This enabled the business to go forward and create the additional jobs. That was a good partnership.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398192"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preferred loans are another important aspect. We can sometimes access capital in the regions. I am sure anybody who lives in the region or has a business there will know that if a person wants to make an investment in a building in downtown Toronto or Mississauga, there will be no problem getting the banks to line up, but if a person is in a region of this country, it is very tough to get access to capital.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398193"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the great tools we have used is preferred loans. We can make an investment or a loan to a company, which comes in on the back end of a project. We loan the company money at a lower interest rate and there are a couple of years of holiday before the repayments have to be made. Let me state here that the repayment of these loans is of the same calibre as the repayment loans of the major banks, the major lending organizations. We have had that type because we have been able to stand with those business operators and work with them in the early days of their business.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398194"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final one is targeted investment with which we have had great success. If we want to bring these young people my colleague talked about to the regions, they have to have the opportunities in the regions to which they come. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of times a project may be so vast. We had a $24 million project in Glace Bay. The company that came in was very willing to roll up its sleeves and make an investment, but it could not carry the entire burden, and some investments had to be made in the structure. We made those key investments in the form of a forgivable loan and we created 1,200 jobs in downtown Glace Bay five years ago. Those people continue to earn wages, receive benefits and contribute to that community. It has been a great investment, and certainly the federal government got its money back twice over.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tools all go together to increase activity in the regions, to impact on the economy of the regions, and this particular initiative may prove to have some merit. We are not willing to support it outright, but I think it deserves the opportunity to go before committee. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a couple of concerns we have. Employment related to a degree is one of the aspects of the bill and we would like to see the criteria on that fleshed out considerably more. With any regulation or program that goes forward, there is an opportunity for abuse, and we certainly do not want that to happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398198"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this particular bill deserves the opportunity to go before the committee. It should be studied. If the proper criteria could be placed in the bill, then we will certainly look at supporting it, but I think I can join with my Liberal caucus colleagues in supporting it going forward to committee.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398200"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill proposes to provide a non-refundable tax credit to new graduates who engage in “qualifying employment” within two years of graduation. I will get into what that means in a minute. The credit would be the lesser of 40% of earnings in the first 52 weeks of qualifying employment or $8,000 and could be used over two years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purposes of the credit, qualifying employment would involve duties related to the skills the new graduate attained during his or her education or training, and this work would have to be carried out in a “designated region”, which refers to any of the regions listed in the Regional Development Incentives Act. The proposed definition of designated region is one of the things that I will be talking about in a minute.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398202"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that all of us in the House want to make sure that all regions of the country flourish and have the workers and the skills they need and we also want to encourage young people to look at not just the big centres, the hot centres, but at the advantages of being in another part of the country. I commend my colleague for addressing this issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although the proposal before us sounds good in theory, there are a number of inconvenient and rather cold practical facts that I think the House needs to consider when looking at this measure. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concern is that there appears to be no clear rationale or specific necessity behind the proposed tax credit. There is a kind of feeling that it would be nice to help young people settle wherever they want even if it is not in a hot centre, but there are no demonstrated facts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hon. member has not shown that there is a particular shortage of skilled workers in these designated areas. There are no facts to show that employers in the regions are unable to find the skilled workers they need. There is no evidence to show that even if employers are offering good compensation and working conditions skilled workers are unwilling to come.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is a real need for skilled workers, then why a measure that only targets new graduates? All skilled workers wanting to relocate into such a region should be considered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why propose a tax credit available to recent graduates if there is no demand for their newly acquired skills in a particular region?</div>
    </p><a name="Para398208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above all, we need to remember that we are the Government of Canada, so a government putting forward a measure to entice recent graduates to work in certain regions rather than others can hardly be called a good national policy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just some of the gaps in the proposed credit brought forward in this bill. There does not appear to be any concrete reason to provide additional incentives, just some suggestion that maybe people could settle and raise families in certain regions, but they could do that anyway.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398210"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have to question the effectiveness of the time-limited credit that would provide tax relief for the first 52 weeks of a new graduate's qualifying employment but then would stop. I fail to see how a 52 week tax credit would really be able to attract and retain skilled workers. I fail to see how we would have people settling and raising families, as the member has talked about, for just a 52 week tax credit. It is more likely that a tax credit might bring people into a particular region for a short term, but they then would move on to greener pastures. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is true that a tax credit is helpful, then the very generous tax incentives would be needed for skilled workers to choose work in these regions. If that is the case, if there are generous tax credits needed, then would they stay when those credits are no longer available? Is it good policy? Is it a good use of public funds to pay large subsidies that will clearly produce no lasting benefits? I think we would have to conclude that the answer is no.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810">(1810)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para398212"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One also has to question the appropriateness and fairness of using the tax system to provide benefits to graduates choosing to work in certain regions but also to exclude graduates who choose to work in other regions. A new graduate working in one of these designated regions would be able to earn up to about $56,000 in their first year of employment without paying any federal tax at all, but the same graduate doing the same work a mere kilometre outside the boundary of one these regions would pay an extra $8,000 in federal income tax on the same earnings, and the co-worker of this new recruit would also pay $8,000 in federal tax. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can hardly be considerable equitable from anyone's standpoint. I think members of this House would certainly expect to hear complaints from those who do not qualify for the credit. This, of course, would result in pressure to greatly expand the existing list of special designated regions and extend it to all workers who are not recent graduates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other problems is that the bill does not identify specific occupations or skills that are supposed to be in short supply in any of the designated regions. The bill uses some broad language about eligible work being that for which the duties relate to the graduate's training or education, but that would be extremely difficult to enforce.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398215"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, those with training and skills in low demand would receive the same tax credit as those with training and skills that are strongly needed. This goes against the supposed purpose of ensuring that designated regions have better access to needed skills. New graduates could come into these regions with unneeded skills or with low demand for their skills and get the very same $8,000 tax credit as those that the regions actually really need, so the bill would not help to encourage specific graduates to stay and relocate where they are needed most.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398216"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue to be considered is that the proposed credit may cause undue strain on other regions of the country that are also trying to attract Canada's recent graduates. There would be an $8,000 disparity in the tax burden between new graduates who worked in these designated regions and those who did not. This could mean that regions not fortunate enough to be included in the list of designated regions could experience greater difficulty attracting new talent, especially if they are located near designated regions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398217"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How could it possibly be the role of the Government of Canada to provide incentives to recent recruits to locate in certain regions of the country to the detriment of other regions?</div>
    </p><a name="Para398218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of a designated region leads me to another point, an important point, because the list of these special regions is found in a supplementary section to the Regional Development Incentives Act, which I already have mentioned. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This act has quite an interesting list of regions. For example, the list in this act includes whole provinces and territories: Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of those are designated regions under the act, so every single graduate working in any part of these provinces would be eligible for an $8,000 credit against federal income tax. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every part of the country that needs equal opportunity to attract workers based on current economic conditions and labour market needs would lose out because of the arrangement being suggested in this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398222"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the entire province of Saskatchewan is a designated region under the act, where, says the act, “existing opportunities for productive employment in the region are exceptionally inadequate”. But the fact is that unemployment in Saskatchewan is currently at 3.9%, well below the national unemployment average, which is just over 6%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is Manitoba. It is included in the list, but its unemployment rate is 4.2%, again well below the national average.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed credit would provide inequity among the regions. It would involve significant costs. It would also be a disincentive for areas that need particular skills in being able to attract them. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this measure is not shown to be necessary, is poorly targeted and is manifestly unfair, I am unable to support this private member's bill. I trust that my colleagues will carefully consider the points I have raised today and also vote against the bill.</div>

This bill amends the Income Tax Act for the purpose of giving tax credits to new graduates working in designated regions. It is designed to encourage new graduates from universities, colleges and other institutions to settle in economically depressed areas by offering them a non-refundable tax credit for the first year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398227"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happen to represent a region where employment is very high and the economy very strong, but it was not always so. Could this kind of measure have helped, I wondered? It was also helpful, in considering this bill, to have the opportunity, last week, to meet 30 or so young people from rural British Columbia. Among them were new graduates as well as soon to be graduates. This fuelled my thought process and led me to the following conclusions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398228"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the NDP could, with some reservation, support this bill in principle because it would level the playing field for rural communities, given that urban centres have a clear advantage over them when it comes to recruiting qualified workers. The bill would benefit low and middle income families in rural communities across Canada and help consolidate the social and economic situation of these communities by addressing depopulation and youth out-migration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398229"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, it should be pointed out that this bill is but a tiny step in the right direction. For example, it encourages graduates to find work in economically depressed areas, but does so only for one year, as our colleague said a moment ago. The Quebec program from which this bill draws, if I heard correctly, takes a more gradual approach, providing a maximum credit of $3,000 per year, up to a lifetime maximum of $8,000. It also includes a financial incentive for three years or more. Personally, I am not sure that a one-year financial incentive would be sufficient to achieve the objectives sought by the hon. member.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398230"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our second reservation about the program has to do with the fact that it could prove to be extremely ineffective if it is not rounded out by a comprehensive regional development plan. The proposed tax credit would be granted to recent graduates working in a region that is, pursuant to the terms of the Regional Development Incentives Act: </div>

        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

    </p><a name="Para398234"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it wise to send recent graduates to regions where employment opportunities are exceptionally inadequate, according to the terms in the act? For the people who already live in such areas, we should be finding ways to create more jobs before trying to draw more workers.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead or perhaps in addition to this tax credit incentive, it would be wiser to enhance the summer career placement program as opposed to cutting it in half, as the Conservatives are proposing to do. This would have the benefit of increasing employment opportunities in economically depressed regions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398236"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives saw some flaws in this program that are real but should have and could have been remedied. Rural and low employment communities as well as non-profit sector employers in urban areas should continue to benefit from this program, especially in light of the enormous student debt that new graduates are facing at the moment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last Parliament an all-party committee in a unanimous report by the human resources committee recommended substantial changes to the funding allocation formula for the summer career placement program which is presently based on the number of students in the riding. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the 2001 census numbers were factored into the formula, there were significant cuts in several ridings, especially the rural, northern, inner city or smaller ones. The committee recommended that disadvantaged and rural populations be factored into riding allocation formulas. The committee also recommended that students over 30, often single mothers, be eligible. Right now only students 15 to 30 may apply.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer career placement program is a very valuable one for numerous non-profit groups who could not otherwise offer competitive wages or afford to hire students at all to do valuable work in the community; as well, for small town rural business people to help students avoid having to go to bigger cities to find work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is saying it will better target the program to at risk youth and to ensure that profitable businesses who can afford to pay higher wages do not get subsidized. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398241"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the program could be better targeted but targeting does not mean cutting. The government could target better at current funding levels and have a far greater impact. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP would propose instead to restore full funding for the summer career placement program and implement the committee's recommendations that I have already mentioned. The NDP would also get to work in tackling the root of the problem and that is unaffordable post-secondary education especially for rural and low income families. If we want to attract graduates to economically depressed areas, ideally they should be from these regions and be coming home to work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now tuition and other education costs have grown out of reach for even middle income families in Canada. That is the problem that we must tackle. Debt burdens are overwhelming for Canadian graduates and just as they begin their careers they are foreclosing their options and their career choices.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traditional Liberal-Conservative answer has been to make student loans more accessible and therefore dramatically increase student debt in Canada. It has allowed students from rural areas to benefit and to get post-secondary education, but they simply complete their program burdened with unacceptable debt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, what we would propose is to tackle the root of the problem by making post-secondary education more affordable, by creating a national program of non-repayable grants that would prevent these huge debt levels. We would also propose to overhaul the student loan system which has become very inflexible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retargeting to those in greater need is really a piece of the solution that I hope my colleague from the Bloc, who has proposed this bill, would consider as a partial solution to the problem that is faced in certain areas.</div>

I had the feeling I was in another world or on another planet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the sort of speech I would expect from someone who had no idea what the regions are going through or what has been happening in this country for the past 50 or 60 years. I am talking not just about Quebec, but about the whole country. It was the sort of speech I would expect from someone who had not visited the regions across the country and did not understand that the populations of these regions are dwindling.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, the member mentioned Newfoundland. If there is one place that has a problem with depopulation and the loss of its young people, it is Newfoundland. Across the province, the population—especially the youth population—is declining at an alarming rate. This points to what I would call the old myths about the regions. As these myths would have it, larger centres support the so-called outlying, remote or resource regions—they have been called by so many names over the years that it is confusing. This is absolutely false. The opposite is true. These regions are called resource regions because they provide products and natural resources that allow industry and commerce in larger centres to prosper. We talk about resource regions, but we could also talk about the human resources the regions have provided for larger centres. This assistance is extremely important. Often, the regions lose their most skilled, best trained young people, who leave to train in larger centres and are working there today. They are the lifeblood of the larger centres. There is a myth about the regions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another myth. I regularly hear that there is less entrepreneurship in the regions. This is also absolutely false. That is why my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78427,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78427&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</A> introduced this bill. It is absolutely not true that there is less entrepreneurship in the regions. The opposite is true, relatively speaking. All the studies that have been conducted over the years by the Government of Canada and the Government of Quebec prove it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to invite the parliamentary secretary, if she ever has the time, to read a Senate report released in December 2006, entitled “Understanding Freefall: The Challenge of the Rural Poor”. It talks about the entire country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report shows what is happening right now. It is an excellent snapshot, published in December 2006, and I read it during the holiday break. I was very happy to have read it, because it confirmed exactly what I already knew. It confirms exactly what is happening in the regions of this country. In fact, the regions are becoming less populated. The population is aging. The population decline is both increasing and accelerating in the regions. For a country, as much for Quebec as for Canada, this is extremely dangerous, because our territory must be populated. It must be populated wisely. It must be populated while supporting rural communities and all communities of the regions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how do we support them? Of course, the bill introduced by my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78427,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78427&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</A> is step in the right direction. It has been quite successful in Quebec. Quebec is not only area to experiment with such a measure. It was also tried internationally, in some European countries. And it has produced results. In fact, to suggest that there is no evidence of a lack of qualified labourers in the regions is to ignore the facts at all cost.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider this example concerning health care. At present, there is a desperate shortage of qualified personnel in the regions, to the point that it is becoming nearly impossible to offer all services in all regions. This is happening not only in Gaspésie and the Bas-Saint-Laurent, but also in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and all rural regions of the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more. The declining population of the regions and the departure of young people mean that, as the population ages, there is constantly growing pressure to increase services.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1830"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1830"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1830">(1830)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para398257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another phenomenon has to do with the services that should be offered by all governments. Sometimes the cost of these services increase and then the services are dropped. Rural roads and transportation services are being dropped. That is what is happening where I come from.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon, during question period, I asked a question. I had a good example and I asked a question about the Mont-Joli airport. This is a very concrete example of a region that is being penalized because the transportation system has been abandoned. The transportation system has been privatized and now the government is washing its hands of it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398259"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My region has a major company that is well known by everyone. I do not want to advertise, but I am talking about the Telus head office. The head office of this company is currently threatening to leave Rimouski, which is right next to Mont-Joli, because the plane that arrives from Vancouver—carrying the big bosses—can no longer land in Mont-Joli. It is as simple as this: the airport no longer has the necessary instruments. If there is bad weather, they land in Quebec City. People are currently threatening to leave the region. This head office is extremely important. I am not talking about a head office that employs 20 or 30 people. I am talking about an very large head office. That is an example of what the federal government can do, and an example of what the federal government did not do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398260"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give another example cited by my colleague for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78837,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78837&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine</A> recently, and that is rail transportation. Establishing companies in an area where there is no longer any rail transportation and where roads are inadequate is a challenge. Yet that is what regions are asked to do. Today, regions are asked to make that effort. They are asked to be even more creative than major centres, and to get by with the little they are given. If we wish to build a country such as Quebec, people must live in the regions, our land must be populated, there must be quality of life, people must have services. For example, a young pregnant woman from Sainte-Anne-des-Monts must have access to a gynecologist. This is a good example of specialized employment in the health field. If the individual has to travel 200 km because her pregnancy is high risk, I do not think that she will stay in Sainte-Anne-des-Monts for long. We must help her, we must help these young people return to the regions. Jobs are available. It is not a waste of time for the regions. It is not a waste of time provided that measures such as those presented by my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78427,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78427&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</A> are implemented. We must realize that the federal government must assume a role like the one presently taken by the Government of Quebec. That is not the case. We must realize that the federal government must support regional development measures proposed by the Government of Quebec and by other provincial governments. It is extremely important because if the federal government does not support these measures, that means that we are paying taxes for absolutely no reason, and I am more and more convinced of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398261"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know to which party I belong. I hope that Quebec will become sovereign so that we can truly go ahead with regional development in our area, so that young people can return and so that we can build a country throughout the territory, for the well-being of all those living in Quebec.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2152761,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2152761&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-207</A> proposes an income tax credit for new graduates taking employment in certain regions. The credit would be equal to 40% of earnings from the first 52 weeks of qualifying employment to a maximum credit of $8,000. “Qualifying employment” would be employment in a “designated region” and employment duties would need to be related to the graduate's education. A “designated region”, for the purpose of the credit, is an area defined in section 3 of the Regional Development Incentives Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of very significant problems with this bill that should be of concern to the members of the House. The bill proposes to create a tax credit to address skill shortages in designated regions but no evidence is provided as to the existence of these shortages. The “designated regions” that the bill references are drawn from a list that has not been updated in more than two decades. It simply does not account for the economic changes that have taken place during that period of time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The credit proposed in the bill would also introduce very serious inequities in the tax system: inequities between recent graduates and those who graduated early, and inequities between new graduates who work in different regions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the credit would entail a very large fiscal cost for a tax measure that would ultimately not result in new jobs for new graduates anywhere in the country. This squanders public money and diverts fiscal resources away from measures that could actually help regional development that do create the type of economic environment within all regions of Canada to help them grow and prosper.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill tries to use the tax system to encourage new graduates to work in certain regions of Canada in order to address perceived skill shortages but attempts to do that in ways that, in the end, would make the tax measure ineffective. The bill, for example, would only provide tax relief with respect to a new graduate's first 52 weeks of qualified employment, but if the proposed credit were truly needed to encourage new graduates to work in designated regions, what would happen after the initial 52 weeks when the credit is no longer available? </div>
    </p><a name="Para398268"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would incentives not be provided to other skilled workers who are not new graduates if the concern is skill shortages in these regions? Clearly, this type of measure cannot yield long term benefits to regions and I am not even sure it would have an incremental impact in the short term beyond reducing taxes for a selected group of workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern with the bill is that it does not make any attempt to target skill sets that are in short supply in a “designated region” or could benefit from its development. This makes me question what the economic rationale is behind the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to a concern regarding the definition of “designated region”. The credit is only provided to new graduates who take up work in a “designated region”, a term taken from the Regional Development Incentives Act. The term refers to a region in which “existing opportunities for productive employment in the region are exceptionally inadequate”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of regions from this act has not been updated in 20 years. This certainly does not reflect the current economic situation of Canada's regions. Let me give two examples to support my point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this list, the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba are included in their entirety and yet, in October 2006, both provinces had unemployment rates two full percentage points below the national average, which is presently slightly above 6%. With facts like these, I find it hard to support the idea that these are regions with limited employment opportunities and that new graduates in these provinces should pay up to $8,000 less in federal income tax than those not working in designated regions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to my next point, which concerns the significant inequities that would be created if Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2152761,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2152761&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-207</A> were adopted. The bill could create inequities in the tax system by discriminating between regions and groups of graduates. Graduates who finish their programs around the same time but live in different regions could face entirely different income tax burdens during their first year of employment. As well, two graduates working in the same job and region but whose graduation dates are a year apart would also face an $8,000 gap in their respective tax burdens. This is patently unfair.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2152761,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2152761&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-207</A> proposes a tax credit that is also incredibly expensive. Estimates suggest that the credit could cost up to $600 million each year to the federal government. These are funds that would be taken away from other priorities, such as measures to help make the tax system fairer, foster economic growth and benefit all Canadians, regardless of where they work or live.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that some provinces have credits or, in some cases, tuition rebates for new graduates who work in their home provinces or who relocate there. Saskatchewan, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and, most recently, Manitoba, have introduced these. Most of these measures are fairly recent and there is no evidence to date that they have had an impact on graduates' choices of where to work and yet Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2152761,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2152761&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-207</A> proposes to spend $600 million on a tax measure for which the outcome is completely uncertain.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of Canada's economy is well-known by the members of the House.

I am sure all members of the House would also agree that it is important to provide a helping hand to those who need support in joining the workforce, to attract the immigrants Canada will need in the years ahead and to provide our young people with the training and education opportunities they need to compete in a knowledge-based economy.</div>

These difficulties arose from problems with the dispute with the Americans and in spite of the softwood lumber agreement which the Bloc Québécois supported. This was not a perfect agreement, far from it, but it was better than continuing the dispute, which was pointless. The companies could not afford to continue any longer. They also needed an aid package, and the Bloc Québécois had put forward a concrete proposal containing approximately ten different measures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the proposed measures was an income support program for older workers. Many had been laid off and, sadly, more have been laid off since. We also proposed an economic diversification program for forestry-dependent communities; a special tax status for the 128,000 private woodlot owners in Quebec; the acceleration of equipment amortization; a program to diversify lumber markets, and financial compensation for maintaining the road and forest network. In spite of all these proposals, the federal government did not really take any action to remedy the situation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 22, 2007, one week before Parliament resumed sitting, stakeholders representing the whole forestry industry came to Ottawa and made representations somewhat similar to those of the Bloc Québécois. They told the federal government that it does not seem to realize that the forestry industry is going through a major crisis, that there are problems with allowances in certain provinces, that there is still the issue with the United States, particularly the significant drop in prices, and that the whole pulp and paper sector is in trouble, which has a domino effect on the whole forestry industry. Therefore, the industry expects some action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day that forestry industry stakeholders were in Ottawa, the president of the FTQ, the Fédération des travailleurs du Québec, Mr. Massé, and the Bloc Québécois leader, held a joint press conference and asked for the implementation of effective programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president of the FTQ said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is none of that in the federal government's initiative. There is absolutely nothing for the renewal of technology or infrastructure. It looks as if the government has not noticed that there is a crisis in the forestry industry. Thousands of jobs have been lost. The workers affected were often very well qualified for these jobs, but they cannot easily find work elsewhere. They were left to fend for themselves. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I am rising in this House to ask the government if it is going to make a decision. Will it at least tell us that the upcoming budget will include measures for the forestry industry, which really needs help? </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Industry, Sciences and Technology has worked to produce a report on manufacturing sectors. It should soon be released. It will be a unanimous and strong report. We cannot provide details today, because it is still confidential, but I hope that the parliamentary secretary and the government will heed the messages that relate to the forestry industry in the report. However, the government has already been in possession of the assistance plan proposed by the Bloc Québécois for months now.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the hon. member gives the government yet another opportunity to show the House that the government is delivering on its commitments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the outset, we committed to resolve the long standing softwood lumber dispute. Less than nine months after taking office, the government made good on its pledge. The softwood lumber agreement is supported by two countries, all lumbering producing provinces and over 90% of the Canadian softwood producers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This historic agreement gives our producers stable, predictable access to the U.S. market, it ends years of costly litigation and it brings economic certainty to companies, communities and workers across Canada. It returns over $5 billion Canadian in duty deposits to our softwood producers, a significant infusion of capital for the industry. In fact, virtually all of the duties are now in the hands of the producers. That is action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution of the softwood lumber dispute was a clear demonstration of our government's commitment to the industry. Canadians asked the government to come up with a resolution that provided stability for the industry and protected the livelihoods of workers, communities and families, not only in Quebec but across the country. We have done this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the process to negotiate and implement this agreement, we made it abundantly clear that the government recognized the importance of the forest products industry to the Canadian economy. We are keenly aware that there are challenges facing the industry, but we are not just talking about these challenges, like the members opposite. We are addressing them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. member will recall, we announced in budget 2006 a $400 million investment to encourage the long term competitiveness of the forest industry to address the pine beetle infestation in western Canada and to assist worker adjustment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are delivering on these commitments too. On October 17, the new government announced a new cost shared program with the provinces an territories. The targeted initiative for older workers is a two year initiative that will be cost shared with the provinces and territories and assist thousands of older workers. It addresses the needs of older workers who have lost their jobs in communities where the local economy is facing ongoing unemployment or where industries such as forestry are affected by downsizing and closures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this month the government announced measures to fight the mountain pine beetle and address its impacts on forests and communities in British Columbia. We will work closely with the B.C. government to develop a comprehensive strategy to battle this infestation. It will include measures to stop the eastward spread of the beetle and to help affected communities develop new forest products, markets, industries and services to ensure their long term economic well-being.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has and will continue to support the Canadian forest industry. The actions that we have taken are continuing to make this clear. It is clear to Canadians and it should be clear to the members opposite. Actions speak louder than words.</div>

The only reason the softwood lumber agreement was passed is that the Bloc Québécois supported the Conservative Party. The other two parties in this House voted against it, and if it had not been for the Bloc Québécois' support, the agreement would not have been passed in Parliament and the crisis would now be even worse than it was.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, there is another important consideration: we need a real assistance program. We are helping older workers re-enter the workforce, and that is fine, but 20% of the people who were laid off are too old to re-enter the workforce. We cannot find new jobs for them. The Conservative government still has not provided any tools, such as an older workers assistance program, to help these people bridge the gap between being laid off and collecting old age security. Recently, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105827,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105827&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Human Resources and Social Development</A> created another committee, but it will be six months before it reports.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the parliamentary secretary assure us that the next budget will contain concrete measures like the ones the Bloc Québécois proposed in its action plan in September to enable this industry to recover its vitality and ensure its competitiveness?</div>
    </p><a name="Para398305"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going through hard times. The softwood lumber agreement drove prices down. The agreement now covers nearly the entire market. We have no choice but to pay the taxes. The situation will remain difficult. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398306"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we be sure that the government will have a clear plan to help the forest industry, and that it will make its plan known in the budget, at the very latest?</div>

Just one short year ago the Bloc Québécois put forth a motion that requested, among other measures, the creation of an adjustment program for older workers in the textile and apparel industries. Not only that, but in May 2006 the hon. member himself introduced two further motions, each of which requested a program be created for older workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398308"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have delivered on the targeted initiative for older workers, and more. We have delivered for older workers not only in the forestry and apparel and textile industries, but anywhere there is a reliance on a single industry or employer. We have delivered a program to help them upgrade their skills, gain work experience or receive career counselling. We have delivered to the provinces and territories a program that offers them flexibility in identifying communities and projects under the initiative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398309"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program could help up to 10,000 older workers develop new skills and find new jobs over the next two years so they can continue to provide their invaluable expertise and experience to the Canadian workforce as well as their communities.</div>
