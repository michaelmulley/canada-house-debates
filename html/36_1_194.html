have the honour to present, in both official languages, the 11th

<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we fully intend to debate this issue and would agree with the 
government deputy House leader that it could be deferred but we 
would like to know deferred until when. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> As it stands right 
now the paper is simply tabled.  It might arise again depending 
on what happens under motions. At that time it would be dealt 
with 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like clarification 
on that.  Is it the ruling of the Chair that this issue would 
arise today or any day subsequent to this introduction? 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder if we could rescind the matter while there are 
negotiations among the parties and we will deal with the matter 
forthwith following some consultations with representatives of 
the official opposition and other parties who might have an 
interest in the same subject matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> We may well be 
getting the cart before the horse.  The document is merely 
tabled.  There is no motion before the House.  If the member for 
Miramichi at some future date under motions rises then it would 
be dealt with at that time, or with notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, dealing with this under 
motions today, or any other day, without consultation with the 
other parties— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> We are not going one 
inch further down this road right now.  We will go to the 
introduction of government bills.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.)</B>  moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-485, an act to prohibit the export of 
water from Canada by pipeline, railway tank car, tank truck,

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this bill would prohibit the export of 
water from Canada by pipeline, railway tank car, tank truck, 
tanker or interbasin transfers. Water will be the defining issue 
of the coming century and the centuries beyond.  It is the most 
cherished by Canadians of the values that define our natural 
heritage. The overwhelming desire of Canadians is to protect 
their water from export.  The bill simply attempts to do this.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I introduce this bill on behalf of an 
overwhelming number of my constituents who truly believe a change 
like this is appropriate.  Edmonton Centre-East would properly 
describe this riding in full whereas at the present time the 
centre of the city of Edmonton to 109th Street is not described 
by the title of Edmonton East alone.  The bill has overwhelming 
support and I am presenting it for that reason.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.)</B>  moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-487, an act respecting a national day 
against impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a bill in the 
House that will call to the attention of Canadians the need to 
continue to fight against drunk driving.  This private member's 
bill will dedicate August 14 each year in Canada as the national 
day against impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year in our country so many good people are killed or 
injured by those who deliberately drink and drive.  This bill 
will remind us all of our obligation to resolve the problem. This 
bill was inspired by Sharlene Verhulst whose twin sister Cindy 
was killed by a drunk driver.  I dedicate the bill to Mark 
Roffel, Cindy Verhulst, my niece Sheena, a very special person in 
my life, my niece Krista, and all victims of drunk drivers.  This 
bill should be know as Cindy's bill.

including some from my own constituency of Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House

world in countries such as Indonesia.  They also point out that 
Canada continues to be recognized as the champion of 
internationally accepted human rights.

I have another 7,500 names, which makes it now over 21,000 names. 
The individuals signing this petition are informing the House 
that between April 14, 1997 and February 1998, a period of 10 
months, four sexual assaults took place in the Abbotsford area. 
All four were committed by residents of the Sumas Community 
Correctional Centre.

fewer devastating sexual and other assaults if legislative 
measures would be taken.

Centre officials have the right to refuse violent, repeat and 
dangerous offenders who could pose a danger to society, and that 
habitual violent offenders and sexual perpetrators should not be 
allowed to reside at Sumas Community Correctional Centre any 
longer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans 
Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak 
to third reading of Bill C-61 today.  This omnibus legislation is 
designed to provide enhanced benefits for Canada's veterans and 
their survivors.  It is a tangible expression of our gratitude to 
these men and women for their service and for their contribution 
to their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not often that members of the House agree on the need for 
swift passage of legislation.  Let me at this point express my 
heartfelt gratitude to all members of the standing committee who 
saw the need and acted on the need by letting the bill pass 
through their deliberations with speed and dispatch.  The fact 
they have done so is an indication of the high regard we all hold 
for our veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The men and women who have served in our armed forces and in our 
merchant marines throughout the first half of this century have a 
number of things in common.  They were young.  They had high 
hopes for settling down, for starting families and for a bright 
future, and they loved their country.  When war came they would 
surrender their youth and put their hopes, their families and 
their futures on hold for the love of their country.  When called 
upon these young men and women, these ordinary men and women, 
they would come to do quite extraordinary things and in the 
process become quite extraordinary themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it was all over those who did not die on the field of 
battle came home to build a nation, and what a nation they built. 
We the generation that followed have known only peace and 
prosperity for the most of the second half of this century.  As 
we are about to enter the new millennium we are the benefactors 
of the sacrifices of those brave men and women who served in two 
world wars and in Korea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the country made a pact with them which said “We 
will remember your sacrifices”, a pact which said “We will take 
care of you as you took care of us”.  That is why over the years 
we have developed such a comprehensive set of programs that 
provide disability benefits for those whose injuries and 
illnesses from service continue to plague them; monetary 
allowances for those whose life circumstances have left them at 
the low end of the income scale; comprehensive medical and dental 
benefits as supplements to provincial plans; and a veterans 
independence program that allows veterans to stay in their own 
homes as long as possible and, when that is no longer possible, 
provides access to long term beds so that their care needs 
continue to be provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During second reading of the bill I spoke about the progress 
which has been made in building and improving upon a package of 
programs and services for veterans which ensures they are able to 
live as comfortably as possible and with the dignity they so 
rightly deserve.  Our challenge now is to make sure that these 
programs and benefits continue to meet their needs which are 
changing with the passage of time.  The bill will do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like most omnibus legislation, Bill C-61 is not about making 
great changes to policy.  It will generate no great newspaper 
headlines.  Rather, it concerns itself with the details that will 
affect, for the better, the day to day lives of many of our 
veterans.  In short, the legislation is another step forward in 
providing top notch quality care to these men and women and their 
dependants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Bill C-61 do for veterans?  Very briefly, it brings 
the merchant navy under the same legislation as armed forces 
veterans and it puts an end to any uncertainty regarding their 
status as veterans.  It also opens up the disability pension 
process so that more widows of veterans might be eligible for an 
increase in their pension payments.  More than 35,000 widows fall 
in this category.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are recognizing the special needs of former prisoners of war 
and affording them the opportunity to receive an attendance 
allowance to help with their day to day personal care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-61 seeks to defer the deadline for termination of war 
veterans' allowance payments to allied veterans residing outside 
Canada.  In so doing we will remove the possibility of any undue 
hardship which might be caused by requiring these individuals to 
return to Canada in order to continue to receive their payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also looking for changes to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs Act to allow for more orderly procedures regarding grave 
markers and financial assistance for funerals and burials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are proposed changes as well to the Veterans Review and 
Appeal Board Act to help smooth the process for the board's 
hearings and to make the scheduling of these hearings convenient 
for the board and, more importantly, for the appellant.  Finally, 
through the bill we are providing continuing pension payments for 
those survivors of the terrible explosion in the Halifax harbour 
in 1917. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is also noteworthy about these amendments is that they 
respond to priorities identified by the main veteran 
organizations.  Bill C-61 demonstrates that we are listening and 
that we are prepared to act.  Most importantly, it will provide 
direct improvements for the lives of these most cherished of our 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we can send another signal to veterans groups by 
demonstrating that we are prepared to act soon.  I urge all 
members of the House to lend their support to this bill.  We owe 
it to Canada's veterans by showing them that we care and that we 
have not forgotten them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today I wish to speak of Canada's unknown navy, the navy 
shamefully not found in many of our schools' history textbooks, 
the navy Canada's young know not of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's merchant navy of World War II developed into a force of 
12,000 men and women who collectively sailed 25,000 merchant ship 
voyages.  Canada's unsung soldiers moved vital war supplies 
through enemy lines not by mule, not by truck, but by ship at a 
horrendous cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young men and women signed up for this service, just as they did 
for others.  Restrictions on enlistment were lesser for the 
merchant navy, allowing the under-age and under-weight to still 
serve their country with dignity and pride.  Dedication to 
service came at a high cost to these brave Canadians and 
Newfoundlanders.  The first service causality of the war was with 
the merchant navy.  On September 3, 1939, Hannah Baird of Quebec 
was killed aboard the unarmed vessel <I>SS Athenia</I> when a 
German submarine sank it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To emphasize, as has never been done before in this Chamber, the 
real price of peace, the real sacrifice to merchant mariners, I 
would like to make mention of the lost ships.  Canada's merchant 
navy was very small in the early days of the war.  At that time 
it only consisted of 38 ocean-going vessels.  By war's end, five 
years later, that fleet grew to 410 ships.  Merchant crews were 
often unarmed and were forced to sail under rough sea conditions 
to supply the war effort.  The crews did receive some training, 
but often that was done on the calm and safe inland waters such 
as the marine engineering instructional school located in 
Prescott on Lake Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By later 1940 the merchant fleet had grown from 38 vessels, but 
losses had already claimed eight vessels.  In 1940 seven ships 
were lost:  the <I>Erik Boyle</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Magog</I> 
was torpedoed and shelled; the <I>Waterloo</I> was bombed by 
German aircraft; the <I>Thorold</I> was bombed by German aircraft; 
the <I>Kenordoc</I> was attacked by submarine gunfire; the <I>St. 
Malo</I> was torpedoed; and the <I>Trevisa</I> was torpedoed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that each ship also took the lives of many 
brave young Canadians to the ocean floor. 
Death was not often quick and painless.  Badly burned, a person 
would swim until shocked to their death in the cold, oil-topped 
North Atlantic.  Other ships in the convoy would do their best to 
help, but also had to consider their own safety.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many veterans say, the worse the weather the better they slept. 
A calm, clear night with a full moon was cause for insomnia.  A 
calm evening might end with the engine's monotony shattered by an 
attack that suddenly turned their world from peace into hell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was all too familiar in 1941 as 13 more ships were lost: 
the <I>Maplecourt</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Canadian Cruiser</I> 
was sunk by a raider; the <I>A.D. Huff</I> was sunk by a raider; 
the <I>J.B. White</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Canadolite</I> was 
captured by a raider; the <I>Portadoc</I> was torpedoed; the 
<I>Europa</I> was bombed by German aircraft; the <I>Collingdoc</I> 
was mined; the <I>Lady Somers</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Vancouver 
Island</I> was torpedoed; with the <I>Proteus</I> the loss was 
unknown; the <I>Nereus</I> was another unknown loss; and the 
<I>Shinai</I> was seized by the Japanese. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians were not the only ones busy building for all-out war. 
In 1942 the German U-boat fleet grew from 91 to 212.  This made 
the situation for the merchant ships deteriorate further.  The 
addition of Canadian built, highly manoeuvrable Corvettes to 
Canadian convoys helped, but losses were still tragically high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1942 alone 31 ships were lost:  the <I>Lady Hawkins</I> was 
torpedoed; the <I>Montrolite</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Empress of 
Asia</I> was bombed by Japanese aircraft; the <I>Vicolite</I> was 
torpedoed and shelled; the <I>George L. Torian</I> was torpedoed; 
the <I>Lennox</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Sarniadoc</I> was 
torpedoed; the <I>Robert W. Pomeroy</I> was mined; the 
<I>Vineland</I> was torpedoed and shelled; the <I>James E. 
Newsom</I> was shelled; the <I>Lady Drake</I> was torpedoed; the 
<I>Mildred Pauline</I> was shelled; the <I>Mont Louis</I> was 
torpedoed; the <I>Calgarolite</I> was torpedoed; the 
<I>Torondoc</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Troisdoc</I> was torpedoed; 
the <I>Frank B. Baird</I> was shelled; the <I>Liverpool Packet</I> 
was torpedoed; the <I>Mona Marie</I> was shelled; the <I>Lucille 
M.</I> was shelled; the <I>Prescodoc</I> was torpedoed; the 
<I>Princess Marguerite</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Donald Stewart</I> 
was torpedoed; the <I>Lord Strathcona</I> was torpedoed; the 
<I>John A. Holloway</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Oakton</I> was 
torpedoed; the <I>Norfolk</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Carolus</I> was 
torpedoed; the <I>Bic Island</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Rose 
Castle</I> was torpedoed; and the <I>Charles J. Kampmann</I> was 
also torpedoed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were tremendous losses taken by the merchant navy with 
their ships sunk out from under them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1942 was the year the ongoing battle of the Atlantic continued 
in earnest.  German U-boats were infesting Canada's waters. 
Several ships were lost in the St. Lawrence River.  Concern was 
at an all time high when even harbour anchorages did not put 
men's minds to rest.  The wrath of the German U-boats was felt 
from the warm Caribbean seas all the way up to the chilly waters 
of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the war went on the Canadian contribution became so much 
more important.  Supplies in continental Europe were quickly 
being depleted and supply lines into Britain were under constant 
attack.  At one point it is said that a crisis developed when 
there existed less than 30 days of stocks and Canada was 
responsible for bringing the situation back to a manageable 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada supplied to the war material as no other nation, save the 
United States, with 17,000 aircraft, 900,000 land vehicles and a 
million men and women in uniform.  This truly was a war of 
material supply.  Canada contributed raw materials like wood and 
foodstuffs, but also multitudes of manufactured materials like 
airplanes, vehicles, tanks, weapons and clothes.  All of this 
material was transported by our merchant navy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no such thing as a typical merchant navy ship.  Ships 
of every description were utilized as the need for supplies 
across the ocean multiplied.  Many of the vessels used had 
previous lives in industry before the war erupted.  Some ships 
had sailed all the oceans, while others had never left Canadian 
waters before.  Some were lakers recruited for war on the high 
seas.  The same could be said for their crews. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many seamen had high seas experience, but others had never left 
Atlantic Canada or even the Great Lakes.  There were men who had 
sailed the west coast and had never dealt with the threat of 
icebergs before.  Despite all of these obstacles, each one of 
these men was proudly Canadian and knew their lives were not safe 
on the seas, but they felt a duty to serve king and country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as there was no typical ship, there was no typical seaman. 
Many of the people in the merchant navy had been working on their 
respective ships prior to 1939, so they were not the young 
teenage men we often picture.  Many had families, children and 
grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as the merchant navy was home to older, seasoned sailors, 
it was also home to our youngest seamen.  With the adrenalin of 
the war effort, men and boys of all ages wanted to serve Canada 
overseas.  With manpower in desperate need, many questions were 
not asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as the young could skirt the rules to enter the merchant 
navy, so could those with health problems and disabilities.  Many 
barely missed the cutoff for the armed forces, but driven by 
patriotic pride they joined the war via the merchant navy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that not all members of the merchant navy were 
men.  There were also many women who participated.  Of the 1,500 
who died, eight of them were women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many young lives were lost in 1943 when three ships were lost, 
bringing the total to 54 vessels:  The  <I>Angelus</I> was 
shelled; the <I>Jasper Park</I> was torpedoed; and the <I>Fort 
Athabasca</I> was blown up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the war progressed many of the sailors had sustained injuries 
and many had lost a friend or two, if not their entire crew. 
Many wanted to return home to comfort grieving parents and some 
had not seen their wives for several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tension of the battle of the Atlantic was several years old, 
but by 1943 the tide was turning to victory.  However, losses in 
1944 were still triple that of the previous year.  Mines were 
taking a greater toll and the threat of enemy aircraft seemed 
worse, even as the RCAF and RAF began to gain air superiority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1944 nine more ships came to rest at the ocean bottom:  the 
<I>Fort Bellingham</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Fort St. Nicholas</I> 
was torpedoed; the <I>Watuka</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Fort 
Missanabie</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Albert C. Field</I> was 
torpedoed; the <I>Fort Norfolk</I> was mined; the <I>Nipiwan 
Park</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Cornwallis</I> was torpedoed; and 
the <I>Fort Maisonneuve</I> was mined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final year of the war was 1945, but the merchant navy 
continued its work long after the war's end, delivering 
humanitarian aid to the citizens of Germany.  They still ferried 
supplies required for the rebuilding and restocking of Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Merchant navy seamen were encouraged to continue on the ships by 
our government of the day.  While a few were able to remain 
aboard the ships, most gradually lost their jobs when the ships 
were sold to other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Merchant navy veterans were not entitled to the benefits of 
other veterans.  They did not have the same access to education. 
They were disadvantaged as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In early 1945 the merchant navy lost another six ships:  the 
<I>Point Pleasant Park</I> was torpedoed; the <I>Soreldoc</I> was 
torpedoed; the <I>Taber Park</I> was mined; the <I>Silver Star 
Park</I> was lost in a collision; the <I>Green Hill Park</I> was 
blown up; and the <I>Avondale Park</I> was torpedoed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also remember that the ships <I>Watkins F. Nisbett</I> 
and <I>R.J. Cullen</I> were also lost for unknown reasons on 
unknown dates.  To this day their families are still wondering 
what happened and when. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total of the merchant ships lost was 72.  If a ship was 
lost, on average, only 50% of the crew survived.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will reread some relevant comments I made in the House this 
past year in Statements by Members: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's merchant navy of World War II is proud of its 
contribution to a free world and should remain the recipient of 
the enduring respect of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's veterans of this global conflict are deserving of our 
undying gratitude for their service to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians must recognize fully that our existence and privileges 
enjoyed today are due not only to the efforts of our veterans, 
but also to the efforts of their missing comrades throughout the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few finer examples of Canadian wartime success and magnificent 
effort can be found than in the annals of the battle of the 
Atlantic where merchant seamen sailed the enemy infested sea in 
keeping Allies supplied in World War II. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many dedicated individuals have worked to have the merchant 
navy's concerns addressed.  Their work will be remembered as part 
of the lengthy battle for equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take a moment to pay a personal tribute to a man who has the 
utmost respect of all veterans and members on both sides of the 
House.  Mr. Gordon Olmstead was forced to step back from the 
frontlines of this battle due to his health but he remains a 
respected voice among his peers.  He was a prisoner of war and 
was instrumental in having this legislation drafted.  No better 
tribute could be made than to call this bill the Gordon Olmstead 
act. I am pleased we can have this legislation passed without 
unreasonable delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year I was able to get the agreement of all merchant navy 
groups on these four points of outstanding concern: to be 
recognized as war veterans, to receive prisoner of war benefits, 
to receive compensation for years of denial of equality, and to 
receive recognition on ceremonial days.  This legislation will 
address three of these four points and for this I am very 
thankful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth point will be addressed in committee due to a motion 
which I successfully had all parties support in committee. For 
the first time we will examine the issue of merchant navy 
compensation claims.  The committee is committed to deliver a 
report with corrective recommendations to the House before the 
summer recess.  Finally we will be able to bring closure to this 
unfortunate chapter in Canadian history.  For the first time a 
formal committee will study the compensation aspect of the years 
of denial of equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to bringing closure to this long outstanding 
issue this year.  Recompense is the final concern which begs for 
settlement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak at third reading of Bill C-61. This bill amends the War 
Veterans Allowance Act and certain other acts in consequence 
thereof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with respect and honour that I will pursue at third 
reading the same objective I pursued at second reading, which is 
to improve the services provided to veterans and their 
dependents, to ensure the recognition of a unique status for all 
those who participated in these wars, and to pursue the 
retroactivity claim for merchant navy veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the bill is very incomplete, the Bloc Quebecois 
supports it because it provides benefits to veterans and 
because, for the first time, those who served in the merchant 
navy are given the same status as other veterans. This 
legislation is governed by the same acts that recognize the 
critical role of merchant navy seamen in the victory of the 
nations that fought for freedom. This legislation also puts some 
order in the various acts that apply to veterans and it ensures 
a degree of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill meets the concerns of a number of associations. During 
the debate at second reading, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Veterans Affairs announced that the House would 
respond positively to a key priority of the National Council of 
Veterans Associations, by allowing former prisoners of war to 
receive the special allowances. 
He indicated that, in passing these changes, the House would 
also respond positively to the number one veteran's priority of 
the Royal Canadian Legion, which is to increase pensions for 
survivors.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The merchant marine veterans presented two demands: recognition 
under the same laws and the benefits they did not receive for 
the past 50 years retroactively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government denying today what it wanted yesterday? 
The Minister of Veterans Affairs said the following before a 
committee on April 29, 1998, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have personal knowledge of this. It was the fall of 1991. 
Three members of the opposition, including myself, took it upon 
ourselves to address what I personally had felt had been an 
injustice for many, many years, and the other members agreed 
with me. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In opposition, this member tried to repair the injustices.  Now, 
in power, as the minister, he remembers nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did this member, now Minister of Veterans Affairs, not 
include provision for retroactivity in his bill?  Is he really 
serious as he cries over the fate of these veterans? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole, this bill is intended to correct the anomalies of 
the past and to include financial compensation, which would 
repair the deeds of negligence of a previous government. 
That government passed a bill giving numerous benefits to armed 
forces veterans returning to Canada after World War II, but did 
not extend these benefits to merchant navy seamen, who 
volunteered to serve their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, legislation was tabled to give merchant navy seamen the 
same benefits to which army veterans are entitled, but not the 
same status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took 45 years for the role played by merchant navy seamen to 
be recognized and the same benefits, but not the same status, to 
be extended to them.  Now they are being given the same status 
as members of the armed forces, but not the retroactive benefits 
of which they have been deprived all these years.  Their demands 
are slowly being met.  However, the average age of these 
veterans is 75. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus the bill is incomplete, since it does not accept 
retroactivity of the rights now recognized for merchant seamen 
back to the time they joined the battle.  They have been 
deprived of 50 years of benefits.  They have suffered all their 
lives because of this refusal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike other veterans, they never had the advantage of financial 
assistance for trade training or university.  They never had 
priority for public service hiring, they never had access to 
land, housing or business funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one of the committee hearings, a witness told us that most 
merchant seamen would discuss their post-war experiences amongst 
themselves, but hesitated to do so publicly, because they felt 
ashamed, although they were wrong to feel this way. 
They felt it was their fault that they could not support their 
families the way their fellow Canadians who had been in uniform 
could, with the help of government subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet they too were in the line of fire.  In 1941, the monster 
Adolph Hitler issued the following order: “Attack the merchant 
marine, particularly on the return route, with all possible 
means.  Sinking merchant marine vessels is more important than 
attacking enemy warships”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The merchant seamen were exposed to dreadful working conditions 
and heavy loss of life.  They sustained more losses than any 
other Canadian combat forces. 
During World War II, 13% of merchant seamen lost their lives, or 
one in seven.  Personally, I would have preferred to be on board 
an armed ship and attack the enemy rather than on a defenceless 
cargo ship to be used as a human shield. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These brave Canadians, who plied the corridors of hell, played a 
vital role in our war effort, one as vital as that played by the 
regular forces, and one that is recognized throughout the world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear from the strong support the public gave the 
former merchant marines who organized a hunger strike on 
Parliament Hill, that they do not support the longstanding 
government negligence in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has fallen short of its responsibilities and of 
the justice required by the sacrifices these men have made, 
because from the outset, it could have included retroactivity in 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hypocritical, even. 
It gives the impression of wanting to gain time and let history 
hide the facts, and when the hour has sounded for the last of 
these brave defenders of freedom, the Minister of Veterans 
Affairs, as has happened in Europe at certain commemorations, 
will weep warm tears over the fate of these defenders of 
democracy.  However, he is untouched by their great suffering, 
especially their mental suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At second reading of this bill, all the opposition parties 
called for either retroactivity or a lump sum payment to replace 
the benefits they did not receive after serving their country. 
Only the Liberal government remains intractable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Great Britain gave full veteran status to the merchant marine 
seamen in 1940. 
In the United States, merchant navy veterans gained the same 
status as regular forces veterans in 1988, while Australia 
recognized full equality in 1995. Here in Canada, they had to 
wait until 1992 to get the same benefits, but not retroactively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, the government decided to improve its image by inviting 
a few merchant navy veterans to participate in a pilgrimage to 
Liverpool, to commemorate the battle of the Atlantic. In 1994, 
the government made another symbolic gesture with the placement 
of a merchant navy book of remembrance in the memorial chamber. 
It lists the names of Canadian merchant mariners who lost their 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs 
said, at second reading of this bill, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure members that merchant navy veterans are 
veterans in every sense of the word and this bill underscores 
that fact. By using the same acts to respond to the needs of 
both merchant navy and armed forces veterans we send a powerful 
signal that we value the service and sacrifice performed by the 
merchant navy during the wars. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this intention and this assurance are real, why did the 
government not recognize the mistake made in this bill, 
apologize and make the whole thing retroactive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will agree with me that Canadian merchant navy veterans 
can no longer wait: they have already been waiting for over 50 
years. In addition to social benefits and disability pensions, 
they need a compensation package. Does the government have the 
necessary money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An examination of the amounts not spent by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs over a 15-year period shows that it is not for 
lack of money that merchant navy seamen are not being 
compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Accounts of Canada lists the amounts not spent by 
the Department of Veterans Affairs for the years 1982 to 1997. 
They are as follows:  in 1982-83, $22,903,618; in 1983-84, 
$56,128,372; in 1984-85, $70,082,937; in 1986-87, $33,631,696; in 
1987-88, $56,647,600; in 1988-89, $56,050,578; in 1989-90, 
$40,103,973; in 1990-91, $35,262,562; in 1991-92, $20,073,856; in 
1992-93; $50,489,052; in 1993-94, $154,747,329; in 1994-95, 
$113,023,778; in 1995-96, $83,742,347; and in 1996-97, 
$49,530,866. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A total of $887,960,424 was not spent.  Merchant navy seamen are 
asking for approximately $40 million.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill could have restored this unspent money.  For reasons 
unknown, the government put these funds into general revenue, as 
it does with the EI surpluses, cuts in provincial transfer 
payments, and unpaid commitments to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, the following amounts are owed to Quebec: $435 
million for Hydro-Québec towers after the ice storm; $58.7 
million for the Palais des congrès de Montréal; $33.6 million 
for the Oka crisis; $70 million for day care centres; $86.7 
million for young offenders; $351.4 million for social 
assistance.  And I could go on and on.  The total unpaid bill 
for Quebec is $3,807,400. 
The refusal of this government to pay retroactivity to the 
merchant seamen is just one of many similar acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of solving problems, the government is concerned only 
with looking good, with enhancing its visibility.  Such is the 
case, for example, with the millennium scholarships, although 
education is a provincial responsibility.  Today the federal 
government is going to invest billions of dollars on 
window-dressing to create havoc and create duplication just to 
improve its image. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, in 1993, merchant marine veterans agreed to join 
with armed forces veterans in a visit to Liverpool to 
commemorate the Battle of the Atlantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, they were again part of the delegation to commemorate 
that battle, and were also along on the pilgrimage to mark the 
50th anniversary of various World War II battles and campaigns 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also there.  The Army veterans' recognition and respect 
for the merchant seamen was obvious.  The merchant seamen showed 
no bitterness.  Why are they still being refused what they are 
entitled to, 50 years later? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is very good about these pilgrimages.  They make 
it look good.  But all this show does not, when it comes down to 
the nitty-gritty, do much for the merchant marine veterans.  As 
we saw last summer, right here in front of the Parliament 
Buildings, it just leads to hunger strikes and to despair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not this minister's mandate to provide veterans, civilians 
and their families with the benefits and services to which they 
are entitled, in order to ensure their well-being and 
self-sufficiency within the community and to ensure that all 
Canadians remember their accomplishments and their sacrifices? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it ensuring their well-being and self-sufficiency, was it 
fulfilling the governments' mandate in this respect to refuse 
the same benefits and services to which merchant seamen were 
entitled retroactively, right up until 1992?  And what about 
that other responsibility, of ensuring that all Canadians 
remember that war? The people of Europe and Asia, who lived 
through it, already do remember. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens in these former theatres of war in Europe or in 
Asia when a whole contingent of youth and invited guests turns 
up?   Most of the time, a handful of local people attend. 
I think these veterans should be allowed to return once in their 
life to a theatre of war accompanied by a relative. But at the 
moment, it is pretty much always the same people who go on these 
trips: the deputy minister and his team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not establish a real national day of remembrance in Canada? 
It is Canadians we should be informing and involving.  We should 
open Parliament the entire day to school children and veterans 
with their relatives, their MP and their minister and take the 
evening to remember those who were lost.  In my opinion, 
providing documentaries to the media is a means of keeping alive 
the memory of their dedication. 
Having a real day of respect, of thanks and of commemoration. 
This first day could be devoted to the members of the merchant 
marine to compensate for the error of the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee, I introduced an amendment that was ruled out of 
order.  However, included in the bill, it would have resolved 
the problem once and for all.  It read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All payments of allowance or other benefits under the Pension 
Act or the War Veterans Allowance Act in respect of a merchant 
navy veteran of World War I or World War II or a Canadian 
merchant navy veteran of the Korean War are payable for a period 
beginning on the day on which that veteran would have otherwise 
first become entitled to the payment if the provisions of this 
Act had been in force on the date of commencement of World War 
I, World War II or the Korean War, as the case may be. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I once again call on the government so that the members of the 
merchant marine may obtain justice and the reparation of past 
errors through retroactive redress or a lump sum payment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of my New Democratic colleagues in support of 
Bill C-61. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As veterans affairs spokesperson for the federal NDP, I am 
pleased that part of the stain on the record of how Canada treats 
its veterans has been removed.  This bill should become law so 
that in word and from now on in deed merchant mariners will be 
treated as full equals to other Canadian veterans instead of 
being relegated to the margins of Canada's official military 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These brave Canadians played a central role in Canada's war 
efforts.  Many lost their lives and their health for our country. 
Families suffered.  Communities suffered.  As a result our 
country was poorer for the loss of so many merchant mariners, yet 
so much richer for the role they played in bringing victory to 
all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While many of those whom we remember and honour today are those 
who served in the regular military, we must not forget the many 
others who served their country in a unique yet very important 
way, either as special construction battalions or merchant 
marines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to once again take the opportunity to commend the 
merchant marine veterans, their organizations, families, 
activists and supporters for bringing this bill into being. 
Without their tireless and for the most part thankless work, we 
would not be discussing this bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to the Canadian merchant mariners upon their 
return to Canada?  In Britain they returned as full and equal 
veterans with equal access to post-war programs, services and 
benefits.  In Canada they returned to virtually no support.  They 
were denied upgrading courses at technical, vocational and high 
schools offered to regular forces veterans.  They were denied 
health support and employment opportunities available to army, 
navy and air force personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to support Bill C-61 which declares as law the equal 
status of merchant navy veterans with regular forces veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not proud of this Liberal government's abject failure in 
providing just compensation for these Canadians. I mentioned at 
the outset of my comments that part of the stain on Canada's 
record of honouring and dealing with merchant mariners is to be 
scrubbed clean with this bill.  The issue of compensation, one of 
paramount importance, remains a dark blotch on our record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government saw fit to provide an ex gratia payment of 
$23,940 each to Hong Kong veterans who were Japanese prisoners of 
war. This payment was promised last December.  It strikes me as 
at least an effort to achieve a just settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned earlier in my comments, it is a disgrace that this 
government has betrayed Canada's merchant mariners by refusing to 
compensate them for the discrimination that the merchant mariners 
faced upon their return home from serving Canada's war efforts. 
It has been estimated that merchant mariners are dying at the 
rate of about 12 per month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 24, 1998 in response to a question I put to the 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, the minister said concerning 
compensation negotiations for merchant mariners “I am there to 
listen”.  I already mentioned earlier that debating Bill C-61 
before this House signals a time to act. Justice delayed is 
justice denied, particularly when the death rate among these 
veterans who served Canada so nobly is so high.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs 
is slated to explore this compensation issue after the passage of 
Bill C-61.  Assuming that the committee comes forth with a 
recommendation, I worry a bit that the government will then take 
its time to respond and make an announcement.  How many more 
honourable Canadian merchant mariners must die before the Liberal 
government does the right thing and provides just compensation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even today as I am speaking I am reminded of Mr. Gordon Olmstead 
who has fought long and hard on this issue and is currently in 
the hospital dying of cancer.  It is just a matter of time 
probably, unless the good Lord sees otherwise.  From where the 
New Democratic members sit, one more death before proper 
compensation is provided is one too many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to this point, it is high time that the government 
supported improvements in the health care package available to 
all veterans, particularly those at a venerable and often 
vulnerable age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope that the spirit of justice in Bill C-61 has an 
effect on the government's treatment of other Canadian veterans. 
What about Canada's aboriginal veterans?  First nations men and 
women served their country well alongside non-native forces 
personnel despite the fact that when World War II ended, they 
were not allowed to vote or even own their own land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many first nations veterans were never told they were entitled 
to educational opportunities or that they were able to purchase 
land at a cheap price.  Some even returned to Canada to learn 
that their reserve lands had been seized by the federal 
government to compensate non first nations veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think in particular of the Canadian veterans who were 
wrongly sent as prisoners of war to the Buchenwald concentration 
camp by Hitler and the Nazis.  This government disgraced those 
brave Canadians when they were sent cheques for $1,098 to 
compensate them for the horrors they faced in the concentration 
camp, horrors which are in some cases relived in the minds of 
these veterans over and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Liberal government has failed miserably where so many other 
governments have succeeded.  I hope the spirit of Bill C-61 has 
some effect on the government so that it moves to ensure the 
Buchenwald survivors find the justice they so richly deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am indeed pleased that this bill provides for the continuation 
of disability pensions for victims of the 1917 Halifax explosion. 
As the member of parliament for Halifax West, I am all too well 
aware of the horror of that tragedy and the pain, death and 
destruction it wreaked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased this bill clarifies which merchant navy 
veterans of the Korean War will be eligible for benefits. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to lend my support to the third reading and passage of Bill 
C-61. This bill is something that many of our merchant navy 
veterans have been looking forward to for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great feelings for those men and women who served in 
World War II, being the sister of two brothers who were overseas 
through the whole conflict of World War II. We were very 
fortunate that both my brothers came home safe and sound.  I will 
never forget the day.  I was only a little girl, about seven 
years old.  I remember my uncle who was shot in the first world 
war, and we thank God that he lived through that, telling me, 
“Put on your very best dress, dear.  We are going to the train 
station for the boys are coming home”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The veterans are very dear to my heart.  The first real 
legislation to deal with the Canadian merchant navy was brought 
in in 1992 by the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, by 
the Hon. Gerald Merrithew who was the Minister of Veterans 
Affairs. At that time, omnibus Bill C-84 was brought in with an 
additional $100 million of funding to be allocated directly to 
the merchant navy and their claims.  The bill brought in by my 
former colleagues was not perfect but it was a huge step in the 
right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of this legislation is that it took this 
administration six years to address the concerns of the veterans 
with the original legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-61 will make changes to address some of the biases 
merchant navy veterans have faced when applying for benefits.  By 
placing them under the coveted War Veterans Allowance Act, it 
puts an end to the cross-referencing each of the merchant navy 
veterans was subjected to when applying for benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This I am sure will please many of the veterans as it now means 
that they will qualify for benefits they should have been 
receiving since World War II. Great Britain recognized the 
merchant navy men as the fourth arm of its services at the 
beginning of World War II and they received all the same benefits 
as other members of the armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also provide an additional $8 million to address the 
needs of those merchant navy veterans who were prisoners of war 
and be used to assist those who were widowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My heart goes out to all those across this nation who lost a 
loved one in the line of duty and to those who died later due to 
the complications of war related service, the soldiers who gave 
their lives, the air force men, the navy and our merchant navy 
men, so that all Canadians from Victoria to St. John's, 
Newfoundland could enjoy the freedom we have today. A large part 
of the war effort was filled by the bravery and tenacity of the 
Canadian merchant navy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To all the merchant navy veterans who are listening today, many 
from across the country waiting to see what will happen with Bill 
C-61, I want to say thank you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it enough for us to just say thank you, knowing what we know 
to be true and how the merchant navy was treated after World War 
II?  How they must have felt, each and every one of them, as they 
watched their counterparts receive many benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The counterparts should have received benefits, but they were 
benefits the merchant navy men never received.  One of eight of 
every merchant navy men died at sea.  This is the largest 
percentage of any of the armed forces groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine serving your country well, with pride and dignity, and 
returning after the war you see your counterpart who was on the 
same boat with you given everything and you are given nothing. 
How would you feel?  You would feel hurt.  You would feel let 
down.  I was not there.  I can only imagine what these men must 
feel today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those men come into my office with tears in their eyes. 
Their wives, as well, get in touch with me.  It has been 54 years 
that they have been fighting for equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question remains whether we, as a country, owe these men 
something.  I believe the answer we would hear from most 
Canadians is yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would people feel this way?  People today are well informed. 
After the hunger strike held here by some of the merchant navy 
veterans last fall, Canadians from coast to coast took the time 
to become more informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year when those men were on a hunger strike people from 
Germany, Japan and China came to visit Ottawa. They came up on 
the Hill. They could not believe our merchant navy men were on a 
hunger strike. They signed a petition asking our government to 
please give them some compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know these veterans were not really paid a high premium for 
their service. A privy council document from 1941 showed that 
these men were not to be paid any higher than a sailor in the 
navy.  This certainly dispels the myth that they were paid a 
higher wage and therefore should not receive any compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of the post-war era for merchant navy men was that 
they were the big losers after the war.  A video has been made by 
Mr. Cliff Chadderton, president of the National Council of 
Veterans Associations in Canada, entitled <I>Sail or Jail</I>. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a copy in my office and when I watched the video it truly 
brought tears to my eyes.  I do not know how Cliff was able to do 
this video but it shows when they were torpedoed.  It shows when 
they were in the water and it shows them dying.  It is there.  I 
will share the video with any of my colleagues in the House if 
they want to see it. It quickly becomes apparent in watching 
<I>Sail or Jail</I> what the merchant navy lost.  One of eight 
merchant navy men was lost at sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regular forces veterans were given clothing allowances, and 
rightfully so.  They were given rehabilitation grants, 
transportation costs to return home, re-establishment credit, 
employment reinstatement and out of work allowances for up to one 
year.  They were also given education assistance, trades 
training, disability treatment, land grant opportunities and 
waiting returns allowances.  I am pleased and proud that we gave 
these to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was offered to merchant navy men?  They were given hope as 
the government of the day talked about developing and maintaining 
the merchant navy.  This is difficult to say but if we look at 
the history of the merchant navy, it appears that the government 
of the day did not want to pay benefits to these men so they were 
not given the opportunity to be part of the demobilization effort 
of the government.  They were kept busy cleaning up the seaways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the troops were demobilized the boats they worked on were 
sold. The men were offered jobs on ships that were held in 
foreign registry and were paid wages in foreign currency.  I know 
that may be attractive today but it certainly was not attractive 
in those days. After World War II the foreign currency being paid 
was not enough for people to survive on in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had great concerns this week when I saw in the estimates 
tabled that $1 million was to be taken from the veterans 
independence program.  I thank the parliamentary secretary for 
responding and telling us no, $1 million will not be taken from 
the veterans independence program because they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think about it, 54 years.  Think of how old these men are today. 
They cannot go out and shovel.  They cannot do the cleaning that 
has to be done.  They cannot do the cleaning within the home. 
They need that part time service.  We do not want them to be 
totally independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be a Canadian.  I do not think anyone would 
question that.  When I think of how these men were treated after 
the war I get very angry inside and a bit ashamed. However, there 
is hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs 
is about to begin to study the issue of compensation.  The 
findings of this study will then be turned over to the government 
for a response.  I want to make it perfectly clear.  There are 
all kinds of rumours out there that the merchant navy is looking 
for a great big lump sum payment.  According to Cliff Chadderton, 
some would get $5,000.  Is that not a big lump sum payment? I 
think the maximum was perhaps $30,000, although for very few of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told that every month we lose probably six or more of our 
merchant navy men across this country.  There may be around 2,000 
still living today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very strongly when I look at the fact that we have had 
lapsed funds in our veterans affairs that have not been used. The 
money is there.  We can do this.  We can give these men back 
their dignity.  We can show them that we love and respect what 
they did, that they took my brothers over there safely and they 
took over their needs, ammunition, food and clothing, so that 
they could fight for you and me and could come back safely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many Canadians, I hope the response given is in favour of 
the Canadian merchant navy request for compensation. It would not 
justify the 54 years of neglect, as I have said.  At least they 
would feel we have finally said we thank them for the work they 
have done.

could not apply for benefits to help them along the way and it 
would not turn back the clock, but it would help ease the pain 
through the simple act of recognition of service to their 
country, not just through simple words of kindness but through a 
payment of some sort to say thank you for what you have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know many of my colleagues on the government side agree with 
me.  I thank today the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Veterans Affairs for his assistance and his help. 
When we went to him when the men were on Parliament Hill on a 
hunger strike he said he would meet with them and he did.  They 
appreciated it.  He came to my riding.  He sat down with them. 
That is what we need, that kind of dialogue to get the 
understanding we need. I thank him very much today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank the Minister of Veterans Affairs and the other

to put this study in place and making Bill C-61 hopefully 
unanimous today when we vote.

them, to stand up for what is right and proceed forward with

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL HOUSING ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK64">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (for Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services)</B> moved that Bill C-66, an act to 
amend the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation Act and to make consequential amendment to 
another act, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a great honour for me to launch the debate on Bill C-66, an 
act to amend the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I congratulate the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services who is responsible for CMHC for providing us with such a 
progressive and balanced piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed Bill C-66 will simplify the National Housing Act by 
removing unnecessary restrictions, enabling CMHC to respond 
quickly to the needs of Canadians and to opportunities in an ever 
changing market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it was created over 50 years ago, CMHC has made an 
unparalleled contribution to help house Canadians.  Over the 
years it has been involved in every aspect of housing from 
building units to direct financing, urban planning, mortgage 
insurance and now trade development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The achievements of CMHC have benefited the country. Many of our 
own families and communities have been helped. Through 
partnerships with all levels of government, community 
organizations and the private sector, CMHC works to allow 
Canadians to obtain the shelter they need. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT19"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT19"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1130
<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also works on a number of fronts to assist low 
income Canadians and the homeless.  One important tool is the 
CMHC's renovation programs which have provided assistance to low 
income Canadians for over 20 years.  The funds provide help to 
repair unhealthy and unsafe homes.  They help to upgrade 
accommodations for the homeless, or for those at risk of becoming 
homeless, and to modify units for persons with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other CMHC initiatives such as Homegrown Solutions and the 
Canadian Centre for Public-Private Partnerships in Housing are 
fostering community based initiatives that address the problem of 
affordable housing, some of which are specifically directed at 
serving the needs of low income people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members will agree that we want to ensure the benefits 
provided to past generations of Canadians will continue to be 
available to future generations.  Passing the legislation will 
help ensure that Canadians continue to have access to housing, 
have a choice of housing and benefit from new housing research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of the bill are threefold.  First, Canadians will 
benefit from these changes because CMHC will be able to respond 
to shifts in consumer demand and market conditions.  They will 
also benefit from the availability of low cost funds and access 
to mortgage financing, no matter where they live in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, CMHC will be able to better promote Canadian housing 
products and services abroad.  This will result in job 
opportunities for Canadians here and abroad.  Third, CMHC will be 
able to provide better service to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will illustrate how Bill C-66 reflects several of our 
government's priorities and what they mean to Canadians.  I will 
begin with CMHC's mortgage loan insurance function, a key part of 
our efforts to provide Canadians with access to housing in all 
regions of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years CMHC has been approached to support many new and 
innovative products. Unfortunately under the current National 
Housing Act the CMHC has not been able to bring the benefits of 
some of these new types of home financing products to our 
marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these amendments CMHC will have the flexibility to consider 
products such as insurance for a reverse equity mortgage enabling 
older homeowners to use the equity in their homes to obtain funds 
currently while allowing them to continue to live in their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMHC would also be able to develop non-mortgage financing 
for remote areas where the land registry system does not 
facilitate mortgages.  It would also include similar financing 
arrangements on Indian reserves where restrictions exist on 
providing land as security for mortgages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporation would also be able to ensure a greater variety 
of financing options for the housing rental industry.  Another 
benefit is that the CMHC will be able to respond quickly to 
shifts in consumer demand and market conditions with new and 
innovative home financing products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these legislative changes Canadians for generations to come 
will have access to the benefits of public mortgage insurance. By 
giving CMHC the means to better manage its business, these 
amendments will ensure that CMHC's mortgage insurance activities 
remain competitive while being managed in a financially 
responsible manner.  With this new legislation the CMHC will be 
able to respond quickly to changes in domestic and international 
markets as well as to organizations looking to use Canadian 
housing expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will greatly enhance the government's ability to 
better promote the products and services of our Canadian housing 
industry abroad.  To illustrate this point, I will use the 
minister's own participation in last fall's trade mission to 
Chile.  Thirty housing industry representatives joined him on 
that mission.  The delegation was made up of provincial and 
territorial governments, builders, manufactured housing 
suppliers, products and services providers, and urban planners. 
The members for the ridings of Kelowna and Québec also 
participated in the trade mission.  The minister was pleased to 
lead this group of entrepreneurs and officials, successfully 
opening doors to Canadian exporters in this important Latin 
American market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through CMHC's market development programs and services it is 
anticipated that within one year following the mission this group 
of exporters will have generated over $35 million in new 
business, which translates into direct economic benefits to all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two more trade missions are planned for Korea and Germany in May 
and October 1999.  Similar public-private sector collaborations 
have recently been undertaken with Poland and Germany.  This is 
what I mean when I say the legislation will help the CMHC create 
job opportunities for Canadians here and abroad.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers in the housing industry, indeed taxpayers of Canada, 
all stand to benefit from these amendments which will result in a 
modernized and more efficient approach to housing. The 
corporation's greatest strength has been its ability to identify 
and respond to emerging needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such initiatives are developed either by CMHC on its own or in 
partnership with other governments or the private sector.  CMHC 
either moves once the private sector players have developed the 
ability to take on the challenge or becomes part of the ongoing 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments that are presented today will build on CMHC's 
ability to adapt to changing circumstances and help the 
corporation to carry out the government's vision for the future 
of housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I mentioned that these amendments reflect our 
government's priorities.  This is demonstrated in several ways. 
For example, one of our government's top priorities is its 
commitment to stimulating job creation and economic growth.  We 
are proud of the fact that more than 1.6 million new jobs have 
been created since the government was elected in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we want to do more.  We know that the housing sector is 
a key component of the economy, with considerable job creation 
potential.  For every $100 million spent on construction, 1,500 
person years of employment are created both directly and 
indirectly.  Behind every construction worker many other workers 
are producing the materials needed to build a home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the objectives of the housing industry and the 
government's goals of expanding international trade and 
stimulating economic growth are one and the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC is proud of its record in participating in team Canada 
trade missions to many of the emerging world markets, unlocking 
opportunities for the Canadian housing industry and creating jobs 
at home.  Canada's international reputation for excellence in 
housing technology helps to open doors to the Canadian housing 
industry in many foreign markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporation has helped foster that reputation through 
international representation and research.  Now, through the 
Canadian Housing Export Centre, CMHC continues to play a key role 
in supporting the efforts of Canadian housing firms to market 
their products and their expertise abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC has also been a leader in helping to establish and research 
new building practices.  The result has been improved housing 
quality, affordability and choice for Canadians.  In so doing the 
corporation supports research and development, another one of our 
government's top priorities.  As we can see, CMHC is helping our 
government turn its commitments into action in a wide variety of 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments proposed in the bill will enable the corporation 
to continue these achievements by providing it with the tools it 
needs to move forward with its expanded role.  At the same time 
the corporation will be able to ensure the long term viability of 
its mortgage loan insurance function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of Canadian families bought their first home thanks to 
the insurance program.  In fact, one in three Canadian homebuyers 
have been helped by CMHC in this way.  Through the bill we want 
to ensure that future generations of Canadians can continue to 
benefit from this service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of Canada's oldest crown corporations, CMHC has always 
been a pioneer.  As such, it has introduced government to a new 
way of delivering services.  At the same time CMHC's core mission 
is not all that different from what it was 10 or even 50 years 
ago.  Through the legislation the corporation will be able to 
continue to do what it has always done and will be able to do it 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill to amend CMHC is part of the government's broader 
efforts to modernize government operations and ensure the 
efficient use of taxpayers dollars while improving services to 
clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC will continue its most important basic function which is to 
help provide homes for Canadians.  I encourage all members of the 
House to support the legislation and enable the Canada Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation to carry on with its work well into the 
new millennium. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
privilege to enter into the debate on Bill C-66.  The bill amends 
the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation Act.  There a consequential amendment to another act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I couch my remarks with regard to the bill in terms of some 
questions I would like to ask.  Does the legislation bring the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation closer to the purpose and 
intent as stated in the National Housing Act? 
Are the proposed changes in the specific legislation consistent 
with efficiency in terms of administration?  Are they consistent 
with effectiveness, in other words reaching the goal or the 
purpose more effectively?  What are the financial costs?  What 
are the economic costs?  What about the quality of life?

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the questions I wish to address.  Within that context 
I would like to refer to some discussions we have had with the 
officials of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.  They have 
indicated rather clearly that the policy of the government is the 
object of what Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation does.  Its 
purpose is to implement the government's policy on housing.  The 
details of that policy are in fact contained in the corporate 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to the corporate plan for 1998 to 2002, in which 
the mandate for CMHC is stated as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) is Canada's 
national housing agency.  Founded in 1946, CMHC's general 
authorities are derived from the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation Act.  CMHC is a crown corporation within the meaning 
of part 1 of schedule 3 of the Financial Administration Act (FAA) 
and is subject to the various conditions and requirements set out 
in this legislation.  CMHC's specific authorities in housing are 
embodied in the National Housing Act (NHA).  The NHA provides 
CMHC with a range of authorities and tools to address the housing 
and related needs of Canadians.  These tools can be grouped under 
four main headings:  housing finance, assisted housing, research 
and information transfer, and international activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In early 1995, CMHC's mandate in the area of housing research 
and information transfer was reaffirmed by the Treasury Board of 
Canada.  Later that year, the government determined that CMHC 
should be given the authority to sell products and services in 
support of housing exports.  In the 1996 federal budget, the 
government announced its intention to operate the mortgage 
insurance fund (IMF) and the mortgage backed securities guarantee 
fund (MBSGF) on a more commercial basis.  At that same time, the 
government also announced that it was prepared to offer the 
provinces and territories the opportunity to take over the 
management of the existing federal social housing resources. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not an interesting way of saying we are getting out of 
the business?  In other words, we do not want it any more and 
will download it to the provinces.  The government did not 
consult with the provinces.  It simply said that it would not do 
it any more and in fact cut their funding.  I will have more to 
say on that later.  The plan continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments to the NHA and CMHC Act are required to implement 
aspects of CMHC's new mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes to CMHC's mandate have significant implications for 
the way the corporation will conduct its business in the future, 
necessitating changes to current products, structures and 
processes.  The mission, vision and core value statements on the 
following page were developed by CMHC to reflect the new mandate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will stop there for the moment and indicate that the 
legislation before us today, March 11, 1999, follows the 
introduction of the corporate plan which clearly indicates what 
the direction will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is CMHC right now?  I would like to go into some details 
as well.  They too come from the corporate plan.  With regard to 
mortgage loan insurance it stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the mortgage loan insurance program, CMHC provides 
insurance against borrower default on residential mortgages in 
consideration of a premium.  Through default insurance, borrowers 
with down payments as low as 5% have access to mortgage financing 
at terms and conditions comparable to those with much greater 
equity.  Financial transactions and mortgage loan insurance are 
recorded in the Mortgage Insurance Fund (IMF). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very useful for many young people or people with lower 
incomes that have not been able to accumulate a down payment of 
sufficient size.  They are helped tremendously. It is a boon to 
families and to couples that wish to by either a condominium, a 
townhouse or a single dwelling house.  It is a wonderful program. 
That is what it is doing.  It continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 1997, mortgage insurance volumes were on track with more than 
442,000 units....  Insurance-in-force was expected to reach $152 
billion by the end of the year.  Under the NHA, the aggregate 
outstanding amount of all loans for which insurance policies are 
issued had previously been limited to $150 billion.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could not go beyond the $150 billion. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Corporation received a $50 billion increase to the ceiling in 
the fall of 1997. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words it was increased to $200 billion.  It is very 
interesting that the bill does not change that.  This is an 
interesting development.  The corporation is running the show. It 
is fascinating and I will say more about it as we move along. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of 1996, the MIF was in a surplus position of $18.1 
million.  A loss before taxes of $23.8 million was forecast at 
mid-year 1997, compared to a $76.1 million before tax income 
projected in the original 1997 plan.  This decline in 1997 is 
attributed to an increase in claim expenses. By the end of 1997, 
the Fund was expected to have a small surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In mid-1997, Treasury Board approved a policy whereby CMHC will 
make annual payments to the government for its backing of the 
Mortgage Insurance Fund. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is interesting.  In 1996 it had a profit.  In 1997 it 
looked like it was barely going to have a profit, but in 1997 
Treasury Board said that it now had to pay it because it had 
access to the consolidated revenue fund. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, CMHC will begin to fund the additional policy reserves 
required by private mortgage insurance by the Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) imposed on the 
private sector.  This applies to new commercial mortgage 
insurance business initiated after 1996. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is beginning to develop with CMHC is very interesting.  It 
is no longer simply a crown corporation.  Legally it is, but it 
is entering into direct competition with the financial 
institutions.  I will explain that a little later.  It goes so 
far as to put itself under the same kind of guidelines and 
provisions that OSFI imposes upon other financial institutions, 
particularly federally registered trust companies, banks and so 
on.  That is one area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC is also involved in mortgage backed securities. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the Mortgage-backed Securities (MBS) program, CMHC 
provides a guarantee of timely payment on securities based on 
qualifying pools of NHA-insured mortgages.  Financial 
transactions for the MBS program are recorded in the 
Mortgage-backed Securities Guarantee Fund (MBSGF). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Projected MBS insurance for 1997 has been revised to $3.9 
billion, up from the original plan of $2.1 billion and reflecting 
renewed interest from lenders.  In 1997, the MBSGF was projected 
to generate $13.0 million in revenues, compared to the original 
plan of $10.7 million....  Higher cash flows and resulting 
investments of $52.7 million were also expected.  The year-end 
surplus was expected to increase to $36.6 million. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mortgage backed securities business expands beyond NHA 
mortgages or guaranteed mortgages.  There is an MBS guaranteed 
fund but there are also other mortgage backed securities.  As we 
go along, we will find that CMHC now wants to get into mortgage 
backed securities that are not NHA guaranteed mortgages.  It is 
getting into direct competition with the private enterprise 
sector; a crown corporation is getting into competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go into other areas.  Canada Mortgage and Housing gets 
into assisted housing. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unilaterally or in partnership with the provinces and 
territories, CMHC subsidizes, on behalf of the federal 
government, more than 656,000 units of social housing. The 
portfolio is operated through long-term administrative and 
funding arrangements between CMHC and the provinces and 
territories, and between CMHC and locally-based housing 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government announced a new On-Reserve housing policy 
in 1996. 
Throughout 1997, CMHC has been phasing in the policy.  This 
involves the conversion of the existing NHA Section 95 non-profit 
Housing Program into a full-subsidy program, and First Nations' 
capacity development to help them take on responsibility for the 
housing in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reduce overlap and streamline existing administrative 
arrangements in social housing, CMHC began negotiations in 1996 
to transfer to the provinces and territories the management of 
existing federal resources, with the exception of housing 
programs for Aboriginal people living on-reserves. The Government 
of Canada will continue to honour its long-term funding 
commitments to social housing (currently $1.9 billion per year).

signed with Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, Nova

housing. This is very interesting.  This theme will develop as we 
go along here.  What is happening here is significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC today is also involved internationally.  The hon. 
parliamentary secretary referred to that in some detail. I want 
to commend the people who went on the Chile trip.  I was one of 
the participants in that trade venture.  It was a good one.  It 
was well organized.  The industries involved paid their way. 
There was no government subsidy at all. I commend the way in 
which it was conducted.  Some good things are happening in that 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question however is whether this is a function that CMHC 
should be undertaking in the first place.  That is a different

function of a crown corporation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other initiatives. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From time to time, CMHC is called upon to administer short-term 
housing initiatives linked to federal policy priorities.  The 
1997 Federal Budget included funding of $51.9 million for 1997 
short-term initiatives linked to job creation, including $50 
million for the continuation of the Residential Rehabilitation 
Assistance Program (RRAP), the Emergency Repair Program (ER), 
Home Adaptations for Seniors Independence (HASI), and the Shelter 
Enhancement Initiative (SEI) for victims of family violence.   An 
additional $1.9 million was included in ongoing annual funding 
for the SEI. In total, assistance for an estimated 12,868 units 
was delivered under these initiatives in 1997.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporate account is another area. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC is a large mortgage and loan administrator as a result of 
activities in support of various housing programs.  Including its 
land holdings, CMHC's asset portfolio is currently $15 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Corporation's profits are the result of the margin on its

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We begin to see the intricate web that is being woven as to the 
involvement and then the extrication and involvement again in all 
kinds of affairs. That is what it is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a history with CMHC as well.  I want to address that 
for a couple of minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the federal government built some housing for World War 
I veterans, the groundwork for a federal housing agency was not 
laid until 1935, with the creation of the Dominion Housing Act. 
By 1938 the act had helped finance almost 5,000 housing units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During World War II the Wartime Housing Corporation built 46,000 
units, mostly for war workers, and helped prepare and modernize 
thousands of existing units. When the war ended, more than a 
million Canadians in the armed forces were ready to return to 
peacetime life which created a housing demand the private sector 
could not meet. The federal government responded in 1946 by 
creating Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, CMHC. That was 
the beginning.  That is why it was created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC built thousands of housing units for veterans, but from the 
beginning the corporation's mandate was to improve housing for 
all Canadians.  In 1954 the corporation began insuring mortgage 
loans made by private investors. The Bank Act was amended to 
allow Canada's chartered banks to lend money for mortgages, and 
the amount of mortgage funds available to consumers quickly 
increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small surprise.  There is no risk left for the lending 
institution if it is guaranteed by a crown corporation.  Why 
would the financial institution not increase the amount of money 
available?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1950s CMHC focused on improving the quality as well as 
the quantity of Canadian housing.  The 1960s brought an emphasis 
on redeveloping inner cities, while new CMHC programs in the 
1970s worked to maintain and improve existing communities. Since 
the 1980s the corporation has given priority to environmental 
concerns, sustainable communities and the housing needs of native 
peoples, the elderly and disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other dimensions but before going into them I want to 
focus attention on the purpose and intent of the National Housing 
Act.  It is very short.  The housing act states very simply that 
it is “an act to promote the construction of new houses, the 
repair and modernization of existing houses, and the improvement 
of housing and living conditions”.  That is it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that adequate shelter for all households has long 
been a social goal of federal, provincial and municipal 
governments in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although housing is within provincial jurisdiction as a matter 
of property and civil rights, or matters of a merely local or 
private nature, since the 1937 passage of the National Housing 
Act, the federal government has played a major role in its 
provision, mainly through the federal spending power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1946 the federal government established the Canadian Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation.  Since then, CMHC has carried out the 
federal government's commitment to provide Canadians with equal 
access and opportunity to suitable, adequate and affordable 
shelter in safe, healthy environments.  This commitment means 
providing assistance to the most disadvantaged of Canadians, a 
fundamental value that underlies Canada's social safety net.  It 
also means encouraging self-sufficiency in the private housing 
market through support to financial markets and to the housing 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social housing ranges from single detached family homes to 
townhouses, walkups and apartments.  It includes rental units 
owned and managed by the government, non-profit units owned and 
operated by community and charitable organizations, co-op housing 
units, units provided for aboriginal peoples on and off reserve, 
and privately owned units subsidized by governments and rented to 
low income people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the social housing portfolio which had CMHC assistance in 
1990, over 34% was public housing, 24% was non-profit housing and 
close to 21% was low rental housing.  The balance entailed co-op 
housing, 8%; rental supplements, 7%; and aboriginal housing, 6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reading from paper No. 8 by R. E. Jenness, published on 
March 23, 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a historic federal and provincial partnership 
here.  Until the mid 1960s, government housing projects entailed 
relatively minor expenditures.  There was a small public housing 
program under which capital costs and operating costs were shared 
on a 75/25 federal-provincial basis, and a small limited dividend 
program creating privately owned housing units to rent at 
slightly less than market rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the 1970s progressed, CMHC expanded and diversified its 
programs.  The upshot was a de-emphasis on high density public 
housing projects and increased reliance upon the following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One, a non-profit and co-operative housing program, fully 
federally funded, that provided an ongoing subsidy to sponsoring 
organizations, including urban native sponsors, and added new 
units to the stock of social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise these points because this is the area the federal 
government is getting out of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two, a federal-provincial rent supplement program, cost shared 
equally with the provinces that subsidized units in private 
buildings for rent geared to income clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three, a residential rehabilitation assistance program, fully 
federally funded, that made loans, partly forgivable, to 
homeowners, landlords or non-profit groups to undertake repairs 
and alterations.  The minister announced that the program was to 
come to an end.  He recently announced there would be an infusion 
of money into that program again so it will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four, a rural and native housing program, mostly cost shared, 
75% federal and 25% provincial, to provide new housing and 
renovation assistance for low income native and non-native people 
in rural areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, during the 1970s and early 1980s the federal government 
along with the provinces, municipalities and community groups 
steadily increased their collective commitment to social housing. 
According to the Canadian housing coalition, construction of new 
social housing units rose from 110,213 in 1971-75 to 185,000 in 
1981-85.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986 after a task force report and consultations with the 
provinces, new directions were taken on social housing.  Changes 
were made with respect to program targeting, the nature of 
subsidy assistance, caps on special purpose housing, program 
planning and financial contributions from the concept of where 
need was accepted, and a housing needs allocation model was used 
to distribute federal resources among provinces under three 
federal main budget housing projects,  non-profit, rent 
supplement, rural and native housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lead responsibility for delivering the programs was in most 
cases given to the provinces.  That is really the issue here. 
They were given the lead.  Also, they are extremely capable of 
doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to look at one of the most recent developments that I was 
very cognizant of shortly after I took over the lead critic role 
in this area.  It has to do with co-op housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said for sure that it wanted to get out of social 
housing.  It wanted to download it to the provinces. There are 
many different kinds of co-op housing but two basic ones, those 
that are federally operated and those that are provincial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government said the provincial ones are not its 
concern but the federal ones are.  It wanted to download this. 
Then the association of federal co-op housing got a load of this 
and thought if this is to be downloaded, it is afraid it will 
lose its co-operative status. 
Lo and behold, enough pressure was created that the minister 
changed his mind.  He said that federal co-op housing would stay 
where it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The philosophy co-op housing I support 100%.  It provides pride 
of ownership. There are two kinds of co-op housing.  One I really 
like is equity co-op housing.  The individual buys a unit and 
begins to build up an equity they can use.  They have the pride 
of ownership, the involvement and this is a good thing.  It would 
be great if all social housing had some kind of pride of 
co-operative ownership. We all want this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting that as the government moved out of this 
the provinces recognized that if this would happen, they had 
better do something.  They have been aware of this for quite some 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure in Ontario where the numbers go, whether 16,000 
co-op units are federal and 18,000 are provincial, but it does 
not matter very much.  It is about a 50:50 split. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Ontario has downloaded much of this to the 
municipalities.  It is very interesting that I came across a 
study that I am sure members are aware of or have seen.  It is 
the report of the mayor's homelessness action task force entitled 
“Taking Responsibility for Homelessness:  An Action Plan for 
Toronto”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read what these people are dealing with and 
compare it with what we talked about in terms of the CMHC.  This 
report deals with simplifying and co-ordinating the service 
system.  What would be simpler than to have one level of 
government involved instead of three? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exactly what these people are talking about are what services 
are available at present, why the current approach does not work, 
changing the role of urgency hostels and shelters and making 
drop-ins and outreach more effective.  We are getting rather 
specific but it gets more specific.  They talk about specific 
strategies for high risk subgroups, families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a dramatic increase.  Some of these shelters are 
being populated to a large degree now by families.  I do not 
think I have time to get into some of the statistics but they are 
very revealing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They mention youth, abused women, aboriginal people, immigrants 
and refugees and go as far as to talk about prevention strategies 
and how we can prevent the problem, shelter allowances, rent 
banks, housing help, legal assistance, anti-discriminations 
measures, additional strategies for social assistance recipients, 
individual support, discharge policies and practices and 
community economic development, the whole area.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about homeless people but we are dealing with 
more than simply not having a house: an overview of existing 
services, removing barriers to health care, mental illness and 
homelessness, addictions and concurrent disorders, and the whole 
area of supportive housing.  The report goes into affordable 
housing and the case for public investment, lessons from our 
past, producing new low income housing, preserving existing 
affordable housing and finally implementation.  There are some 
110 recommendations that follow this report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an excellent piece of work but I do not think it is the 
end. When I talked to the councillor in charge of social housing 
for Toronto he said they were just beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to come to grips with this.  One government can do this. 
As we go into this corporate plan it is interesting to note what 
CMHC says.  In the 1998-2002 plan CMHC says it: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—plans to conduct a forum on “best practices” for addressing 
homelessness.  This forum will bring together experts on the 
homeless, representatives of service providers and various levels 
of government to share information on homelessness and to 
recognize and promote best practices in the area.  This will 
provide the basis for potential partners to work together to 
develop future strategies to alleviate homelessness. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many different ways do we have to look at the same problem? 
One would almost think the city of Toronto was doing this in 
isolation.  This task force received assistance from all kinds of 
experts.   Did it get it only from Toronto?  No. Let me read into 
the record where they went to obtain some assistance. They 
received assistance from Canadian cities like Calgary, Montreal, 
Ottawa, Vancouver and Winnipeg.  They also went to American 
cities like Boston, New York, San Francisco and Washington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This task force is not made up of amateurs. These are not people 
who do not care about policy.  These are not people who are 
unaware of what is to be done.  Now CMHC says it will conduct a 
forum.  We have the information we need.  We say it is only 
Ontario. It has a 50:50 split on co-op housing.  It knows all 
about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to what is happening in British Columbia. 
This task force reported in January 1999.  A 1992 amendment 
to the municipal act required municipalities to include housing 
policies in their official community plan.  Additional amendments 
have provided municipalities with a greater range of powers to 
address community housing needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, municipalities have reviewed or are in the process 
of reviewing their OCP.  Nearly all have adopted or are in the 
process of adopting housing policies within their plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Definitions of affordable housing have been or are in the 
process of being written in several communities.  In a number of 
cases housing strategy documents outlining definitions, policies, 
procedures and specific methods to address housing issues have 
also been produced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A variety of housing related techniques such as density bonusing 
and housing agreements is currently being utilized by 
municipalities to increase the diversity of the housing stock or 
to produce affordable housing units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To increase residential density, many municipalities are 
permitting housing above shops, manufactured home parks, 
secondary suites and small lots for single family housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A definition of special needs housing has been developed or is 
nearing completion in many municipalities.  Although the 
definitions vary, they speak to the importance of creating both 
market and non-market housing for individuals with special needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipalities are taking up the challenge and finding 
innovative ways to meet the need for special needs housing. 
Committees or task forces are dealing with special needs 
populations or addressing disability issues at the community 
level in a large number of municipalities.  Reports or surveys 
identifying the special needs population have been produced or 
are underway in several areas of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipalities are developing guidelines for adaptable housing 
and several are promoting this type of housing to provide access 
to suitable housing for individuals with special needs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are able and competent to deal with this issue and 
constitutionally they have been given that responsibility.  That 
is their job and now we have an intrusion into much of that 
through the National Housing Act and the central mortgage and 
housing act. There was a time when this was significant, in 1935. 
We have gone through this and we know what it is but it has 
changed into something quite different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The involvement of multiple levels of government creates basic 
inefficiency.  It creates mutual recriminations.  If one level of 
government is not doing it, then the other level says it is your 
job, you go do it.  As a result the very people who were intended 
to be helped by this act are the ones who lose.  Most important 
in all this is the confusion, the chaos, the conflict, the 
confrontation and the contradiction that develops because of 
these different levels of government getting involved in each 
other's way.  We do not need that.  It could be simplified so 
easily. Then comes the worst of all, the lack of consistency in 
housing policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest there is no consistent social housing policy as far as 
the federal government is concerned.  There are immediate 
expedient types of solutions presented.  The time has come for us 
to bring rationality to bear on this situation. The provinces 
have recognized this responsibility, have contributed to meeting 
that responsibility and have demonstrated they can do the job. 
As a federal government we need to create an environment that 
makes it possible for them to carry out the job they have ably 
demonstrated they can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know the CMHC has achieved many worthwhile things and is 
continuing to do that.  This is not inconsistent with what the 
minister of housing has said.  I quote directly from the 
statement he made on August 26, 1998 in Ottawa when he found 
agreement with Yukon: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having only one level of government involved in the 
administration of social housing will maximize the impact of 
taxpayers' dollars. The territorial government will have the 
flexibility to meet the needs of its residents while adhering to 
national principles and an accountability framework. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do that. This act does not come to grips with those kinds 
of things.  It simply moves along and makes what is into law. 
Some of the things that are not yet approved are already 
happening and we just have not had the legislative provisions to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the CMHC has lost its way in another area.  Not only 
has it not dealt specifically with some of the people who are in 
need, but listen to this strategy which comes from the corporate 
plan of 1998-2002.  The strategy in one sentence is level the 
playing field for private-public competition. Interesting. The 
CMHC will now get into competition with the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strategy involves behaviours consistent with the corporate 
value of entrepreneurship, as well as the creative and effective 
use of housing finance tools to achieve fair competition for the 
CMHC and the private sector, and otherwise support competition in 
housing markets.  Collectively these measures will place CMHC on 
a more competitive footing with private competition by reducing 
costs through operational efficiencies, effective asset 
management and product improvements.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the key tactics: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, CMHC will fund additional policy reserves and commence 
payment to government, based on the capital and additional policy 
reserves that the office of the superintendent of financial

non-NHA mortgages and non-mortgage loans subject to legislative 
changes.  An annual payment to the government is currently being 
developed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what this law does.  It allows CMHC to get into 
another area of non-NHA mortgages, to put these into mortgage 
backed securities.  There is a market that exists now.  CMHC does 
not have to get into that mortgage backed security market.  It is 
already there.  It is simply getting into direct competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a crown corporation with total assets of the 
consolidated revenue fund of the country of Canada competing with 
private enterprise.  I think that is wrong in principle.  I do 
not think it is fair at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For seniors, CMHC plans to introduce a Reverse Equity Mortgage 
(REM) insurance product through at least one Approved Lender by 
1999.  The objective is to ensure REMs are available through two 
or more Approved Lenders by the end of the planning period.  The 
Corporation also plans to consider MBS for REMs in 1999 or 
thereafter if there is evidence that Approved Lenders are unable 
to use their own resources to issue REMs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does a reverse equity mortgage mean?  This is for seniors 
who own a house or who have very high equity in a house.  They 
take a reverse equity mortgage, draw down more money and the 
interest rate goes up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here it is with a reverse equity mortgage insurance program, or 
at least that is what it is thinking of putting together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night I had the opportunity to meet with a representative 
of the Bank of Nova Scotia.  I asked this gentleman how he would 
insure a reverse equity mortgage.  He looked at me with a blank 
look on his face and asked me what I was talking about.  I told 
him that I had just read that the corporate plans for CMHC state 
that it is going to introduce a new product called reverse equity 
mortgage insurance.  He said that he did not know how it would 
work and he did not understand how it could actually work.  He 
went on to tell me that it was actually a very small market to 
begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe that market will grow.  I am not here to debate whether 
one should or should not get into a reverse equity mortgage. 
That is another issue.  However, one of the major financial 
institutions in Canada does not understand how this product could 
work.  There is something fundamentally wrong in what is going on 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to come to grips with a much bigger issue, which is the 
whole housing issue and how best it should be handled.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with my colleague and friend, the hon. member 
for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. Over the next 20 minutes, I will 
address Bill C-66, which is currently before us. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of World War II, the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation, commonly called the CMHC, was given the mandate— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I apologize for interrupting 
the hon. member. 
If he wants to share his time, he must first 
get the unanimous consent of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> I will resume, Madam Speaker. As the 
previous speaker pointed out, the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation was established in 1946. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, its role was to implement a program designed to 
create housing units and thus meet a basic need, particularly 
for the troops coming home. These young people wanted to start 
families and to settle down. They would often come back to 
settle down in a region that was not necessarily their place of 
origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the signing of the peace treaty in 1945, cities such 
as Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa welcomed large numbers of new 
residents. 
With the large increase in the number of immigrants, the CMHC's 
mandate was broadened in 1954 to open up Canada to immigration 
and to make it possible for people coming from countries the 
world over to at least have a decent roof over their head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMHC therefore began to guarantee the loans certain 
financial institutions made to these new residents of towns and 
cities so that they could build their own home, even if they 
lacked the necessary capital for a down payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMHC continued in this role over the years, with the odd 
legislative amendment to its status, a name change, and so 
forth. 
The primary role of the CHMC has been to put in place mechanisms 
making home ownership possible for many people and allowing them 
to live decently in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the years went by, the CHMC also acquired know how, and 
because of its involvement in loan insurance and housing 
development, invested in research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building materials unknown at the end of the last war became 
popular and were used almost constantly, because one of the 
things the CHMC did was approve new materials, supervise the 
quality of construction. It also had a program under which, when 
it was loaning money or guaranteeing loans, it sent out 
inspectors to check that housing was up to code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The party I represent in the House admits this.  We are not 
necessarily congratulating the government, but all Canadians 
who, back then and even today, have made the CMHC and its 
mandate possible. 
It did not spring up out of thin air. 
CMHC was not created with money that came out of thin air.  It 
was created with public funds, with the money of all Canadians, 
through their various taxes and other means. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, despite CMHC's good intentions, it is not entitled to 
hog all the control over a specific area. 
I would point out to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services, who is responsible for 
administering CMHC, that when housing is considered according to 
the areas of jurisdiction set out in the 1867 
Constitution—unfortunately none of us here today were present at 
its signing—it is a provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, there was an implicit acknowledgment of this by 
CMHC, since most of its programs were joint efforts with 
provincial authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in Quebec is rather special, because we have the 
Société d'habitation du Québec, which is kind of the Quebec 
equivalent of CMHC. 
Judging by my experiences with several transactions, it seems to 
me that—at least in the eyes of the general public, or even the 
smaller group of those involved in real estate transactions—there 
is, or at least was, a certain degree of harmony between the 
texts and policies of the two, Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation and the Société d'habitation du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a throne speech, in 1994 I think, before the time of 
the Minister responsible for Intergovernmental Affairs.  Much 
has changed since this troublemaker has been on the scene.  When 
he enters the lions' cage, they do not attack him, but devour 
each other instead.  This troublemaker comes out unscathed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But before the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs arrived, in 
a speech from the throne in 1994, the federal government—which 
at the time, before the arrival of the troublemaker, showed some 
understanding, indicated a certain intent to work with the 
provinces on matters of varying degrees of difficulty—indicated 
that social housing would be returned to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the sudden urgency that brought about the creation of 
the CHMC, the situation calmed down somewhat, and the government 
considered that, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
having fulfilled its mandate, it might be time to give back to 
the provinces the jurisdiction that was theirs to begin with, a 
jurisdiction they could exercise in the normal course of events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, with the arrival of the troublemaker, these 
things are no longer the case, and this is reflected in Bill 
C-66, which is currently under consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill reflects in many of its terms what the Canada Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation did or does, but it goes further.  We 
may well raise questions.  We know that the Government of 
Canada, a member of the OECD, negotiates WTO, world trade 
organization, agreements.  It almost got taken as well in its 
negotiations on the multilateral agreement on investment, MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government, like the federal government, does not like to 
become entrapped.  In international negotiations, they do not 
like to have to say to their negotiating partners “Sorry, this 
area is not completely under federal jurisdiction, we will have 
to ask the provinces, we need their approval.  We cannot say yes 
immediately, we must consult at home”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gets to be embarrassing. We are not at fault. As I said, we 
were not there when the Constitution of 1867 was signed, and we 
were not there either when the Constitution of 1982 was signed. 
Quebec was never there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is embarrassing for a government to have to say “Listen, we 
cannot make a decision and sign right away. We must go back home 
and see what the provinces think about this”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is happening in several areas. The federal government 
decides to go over the head of its provincial partners and to 
enter into high level international agreements that affect 
jurisdictions which come under the provinces by virtue of our 
Constitution of 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spirit of Bill C-66 is a first reflection of this. I am 
convinced that the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve will 
elaborate on this, because I know he is in full agreement with 
me, and so is the hon. member for Châteauguay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was hoping the bill would provide that “If the CMHC wants to 
finance construction and residential development projects, it 
should reach an agreement with the provinces, including Quebec”. 
I realize the other provinces do not have a housing corporation 
such as the Société d'habitation du Québec. But let us not blame 
Quebec for exercising its legislative and constitutional 
jurisdiction, for assuming its responsibilities. This is why it 
created its own housing corporation. It could not let others 
look after its problems, because the cost was too high. No. With 
all the courage that such a measure implies, the Quebec 
government established the Office municipal d'habitation and 
manages what comes under its constitutional jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And then, in 1999, the troublemaker, with his colleague the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada, ups and 
produces a bill that appears to ignore the policies announced in 
the 1994 and 1996 throne speeches.  A new policy is taking shape 
and, as always, this government is inconsistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example is the trade missions, where the Prime Minister 
invites a gaggle of businessmen from all sectors, informatics, 
housing construction, modular housing, or whatever, to accompany 
him to Asia.  They all head overseas, contacts are made and the 
foundations for future trade relations are laid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people in my riding who excel in modular construction 
and are establishing contacts in China to try to sell their 
products, houses that are made in the lovely riding of Chambly, 
which I have the honour to represent here in the House. 
Business cards are exchanged and there are handshakes all round. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Chinese indicate an interest in coming over here to 
examine the modular housing they have been hearing about, and 
wonder if there are factory models they can actually see and 
touch, they are encouraged to make the trip, but are refused a 
visitor's permit that would enable them to enter Canada and see 
which of our products they might like to buy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has happened in my riding. 
The excuse given was that there is some concern that the 
Chinese—presidents of Chinese corporations who have the buying 
power—will not want to return to China and that this will become 
a problem for Canada, and so all the good intentions shown by 
both groups during the trade mission to China come to nothing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might say that the right hand in this government does not 
know what the left hand is doing.  This is not the first such 
case I have seen; it happens frequently.  It is far less 
alarming if it is a Quebec company that is unable to export its 
know how or its products to another country.  If an Ontario 
company had been involved, I think the reaction on the other 
side of the House would have been much faster in coming.  This 
being a Quebec company, however, the reaction is much slower, 
the urgency less.  We have learned to live with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain that, given its expertise and its finished product, 
the business in question will eventually manage to export. 
Perhaps it will manage to export its first modular home in two 
years, because this government is such a piecemeal operation. 
It is my impression that the ministers do not speak to each 
other much, with the exception of the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, who talks to everybody, and issues 
orders right and left.  I am sure he is listening to my words 
with great interest, this man whom I have just described as a 
troublemaker, but of course I did not mean that in a bad way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to point out that I might have been inclined to 
accept the bill, as it stands, to see some good in it.  When 
those of us in the Bloc Quebecois say that we are a constructive 
opposition, it has to show; we have to ensure that we give 
people concrete evidence of that.  We have never been untrue to 
that vocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do indeed want things to go well, but with this bill again I 
have unfortunately to tell you that the government is once again 
denying an area of Quebec jurisdiction accorded under the 
Constitution.  They are meddling in an area that is not theirs. 
They circumvent the provincial government with provisions such 
as the one now enabling the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation to undertake negotiations or discussions with 
municipalities, organizations, business groups or any other 
body.  They are circumventing provincial authority, which 
despite all, has jurisdiction in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Bloc Quebecois member, I cannot allow that.  I do not know 
whether my colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve is more forgiving 
than I am, but I find it unacceptable.  Once again the 
government is treading on provincial jurisdiction. 
Why?  To gain visibility it cannot gain through good management, 
by doing a good job, realizing savings, not on the backs of the 
poorest with money literally stolen from the unemployed, but by 
cutting operating costs by so many millions—or billions—of 
dollars through good management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government spending has not significantly decreased in the past 
five years.  At best, it has dropped by 9%.  On the other hand, 
the income of the unemployed has dropped by about 100%.  This is 
where the savings are made and this is what they hold up to the 
public as a success.  We are not fooled.  I find no interest at 
all in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding, I want to briefly say that the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation guarantees loans when borrowers 
do not have the 25% for their mortgage equity, which is the rule 
with the banking system. People are told they can buy a house by 
putting down 5% of the purchase price. The CMHC lends the rest 
of the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take, for example, a house being sold for $100,000. A young 
couple interested in buying that house could get it with a 5% 
downpayment. The CMHC would then lend $95,000, to be repaid over 
a 25-year period perhaps, and an insurance fee would be added to 
that amount. If I am not mistaken, the fee on a $95,000 loan is 
3.5%. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1240

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The downpayment on a house is often less than the fee required 
to guarantee the buyer's loan. This does not make much sense. 
First, we help the buyer and then we hit him hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, the CMHC does not appraise the property for which it 
guarantees the loan. The buyer figures “If the CMHC is prepared 
to lend me $95,000, this means the property is worth that much”. 
Not so. The CMHC now proceeds by appraising large groups or 
sectors; as a result, it often ends up taking back properties 
for which people paid $100,000, but that are hard to sell back 
for $40,000 or $45,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the government that loses. It is ordinary people, with 
the insurance fee they area charged. They are the losers, 
because it is this 3.5% fee that is used to pay for all that. 
However, if things were properly managed and buildings were 
appraised, people might be charged 2% instead of 3.5% on a 
$100,000 loan. It would feel more like the CMHC is helping 
someone buy a house, which was the ultimate goal of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end on that note. I am convinced the hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve will go into much more details and discuss 
much more detailed cases than I did. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with no small pride that I share my time with the member for 
Chambly.  We both have points to bring to this issue, and I will 
try to make mine well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dedicate my speech to our colleague, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, who is here in the House.  I will be 
referring to a federal-provincial dispute and presenting a few 
points of analysis, particularly as we both hail from the same 
political science department, he as a professor and I as a 
student.  I am sure he has wonderful memories of the time I 
spent in the department.  I do not have any bad memories of the 
days when he was a professor of organizational theory and the 
public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, we would have liked to support this bill. 
Why?  Because we are all positive people.  I think that is 
known.  Examples of an opposition more responsible and 
constructive than the Bloc Quebecois in recent years could not 
be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is a problem.  The Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs knows very well that the throne speech is sacred, 
because it is a sort of blueprint of what the government intends 
to do during its term of office.  As such, the throne speech 
contained a commitment, just as sacred, to decentralize a 
certain number of powers to the provinces.  The Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs cannot fail to recall that housing is 
one of the sectors the government was going to give back to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can it be that we end up with a bill like this one, when 
what is needed is recognition of the full jurisdiction of the 
provincial governments over housing?  I would like someone to 
explain this to me in the course of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two problematical clauses.  I do not want to get into 
technicalities, but there is clause 58(1)—I am sure that the 
minister is familiar with it—which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>58.(1)  The Corporation may make loans and contributions for the 
purpose of assisting in the payment of, or providing allowances 
for, expenses that, in the opinion of the Corporation, are 
related to housing accommodation, and may forgive amounts owing 
on those loans. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raised questions in my mind, which I put to the staff. 
My thanks to those who made themselves available to me, 
particularly Mr. Asselin, who was extremely kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the feeling that it was possible the federal government 
might be tempted to use this clause to create a national housing 
allowance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1245

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I asked him directly, and his reply was “Yes, that is a 
possibility”.  This is of concern to the Bloc Quebecois, and we 
would not view such a possibility favourably, since it would of 
course lead to encroachment on a provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our second area of concern is that this bill opens the door to 
the very real possibility that, with respect to housing, the 
federal government could deal directly with intermediary bodies 
such as municipalities, co-operatives and others involved in this 
field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not understand how such a clause can be in a bill.  If the 
government wants the Bloc Quebecois to support the bill, I would 
ask the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, in the same 
spirit of positive and open co-operation that has always guided 
us, to be this voice in cabinet.  We ask him to draw on clause 
88(2) of the bill and to broaden its scope.  This clause, Madam 
Speaker, I dedicate to you. It reads, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) Loans or contributions may be made and amounts owing on 
those loans may be forgiven under this section only with the 
approval of the government of the province where the 
corresponding rental housing project is, or will be, located. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, to synthesize, as we learned in political 
science, we are delighted that this government wants to invest 
in the housing sector.  It is well known that there is a 
tenuous, almost incestuous, link between the fight against 
poverty and housing.  I will come back to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government has money for housing, it must go through 
those whose mission this is primarily: the provinces.  The 
Government of Quebec is the only government in Canada to have a 
housing corporation, with the expertise, know-how, tradition, 
planning and management required to meet the housing needs of 
its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to take note, and we will introduce 
amendments as we consider this bill, at committee stage or at 
third reading.  It will all be considered to ensure that no 
direct intervention is possible in the housing sector without 
the provinces being involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is nodding.  I 
would ask him to share this idea with his cabinet colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue of concern to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs is the whole matter of the $1.9 billion.  The federal 
government is negotiating with the provinces so they will be the 
only ones to intervene in matters of social housing.  That is 
good news.  We have long awaited that.  However, the amounts 
involved are totally ridiculous.  I want to be very clear, 
because there is no room for generalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada wide federal spending on social housing is approximately 
$1.5 billion.  In fiscal year 1995-96, $362 million of that 
amount went to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A quick calculation shows that Quebec receives 18.7% of federal 
spending on housing.  I imagine the parliamentary secretary is 
listening to the interpretation, so I repeat that Quebec is 
getting 18.7%.  This means that 81.3% of federal spending on 
housing takes place outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what is Quebec's demographic weight within the Canadian 
federation?  It is 25.3%. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many households are living in poverty in Quebec?  Still with 
respect to 1995-96, there are 341,000 such households.  I appeal 
to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to note that 29% of 
Canada's poor households are in Quebec.  Yet 18.17% of federal 
spending on housing is all we get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All governments have decried this trend.  I could tell members 
about someone who has the respect of the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, an intellectual in Quebec society, 
for that is what he is, by the name of Claude Ryan.  Some people 
will immediately think of the beige paper, others of the 1980 
referendum, others still of Robert Bourassa. 
However, the reason I am mentioning Claude Ryan today is because 
he was once minister of housing.  And in that role, he made the 
same arguments as I have.  All this to say that there is a 
strong consensus that Quebec has not received its fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, is there unanimous consent for me to table 
figures that could be passed out to members, particularly to the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The hon. member is seeking 
leave of the House to table a document.  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, I think members will be the 
richer for it.  Please pass it out on that side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that the federal government wants to 
transfer $1.9 billion to the provinces under this proposal. Have 
you any idea how much is being offered to Quebec? I could not 
believe it when I first heard it. Quebec is being offered a mere 
$289 million, which is less than what the federal government 
spent on Quebec in 1995-1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the breakdown here. Last year, the federal government 
spent $362 million on housing in Quebec, but now, under this 
proposal, it wants to transfer $289 million to Quebec. The 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services, who is also 
the hon. member for Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel, will have to work 
hard and meet with his counterpart, Mrs. Harel, one of the most 
endearing members of the National Assembly, with whom I have the 
pleasure of sharing some of my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will have to discuss the issue with the 
Quebec government and try to settle this once and for all. 
Quebec is ready to take on all of the responsibilities for 
social housing. It makes perfect sense. Which of the governments 
is best suited to adequately and efficiently meet the housing 
needs of the people and solve the housing problem? Quebec, of 
course, since it is the government nearest to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Quebec does not want to incur losses. What the federal 
government wants to do is to transfer a lump sum that will keep 
on shrinking. You have to understand that, with a housing stock 
for which mortgages were signed 20, 25 or 30 years ago, at the 
time when the money starts decreasing, more and more repair, 
renovation and restoration work will have to be done. 
That is why the Quebec government is asking for $440 million 
just for the transfer, plus 3 tax points. If that were on the 
table, the Quebec government would not hesitate to sign an 
agreement and to meet its responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope our voice can be heard and I hope we can count on the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who we know is not afraid 
to speak loudly on some issues, to defend Quebec's interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to another issue. Members will recall that we 
were elected in 1993 but, since the Prime Minister had to attend 
a NATO conference, parliament convened only in January 1994.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, in the first budget of the current Minister of Finance, 
the Canada Housing and Mortgage Corporation was asked for a 
contribution over a number of years, ending in 1998-1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members add all the amounts the federal government took from 
the CHMC, they will see that the total comes to $487 million. It 
is a lot of money. Now it would appear that, over the next few 
years, there will be money available in the budget for housing. 
The CHMC will therefore be able to use for other purposes the 
$487 million and all the money it was supposed to send to the 
Treasury Board or to the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope this money will be used for the development and 
construction of social housing, through the provinces, of 
course. I think this cannot be avoided. Housing initiatives must 
be linked to land management, income security and the fight 
against poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I repeat and I hope they are listening, my question is 
for my colleagues across the way: Which government is better 
able to meet the needs of our fellow citizens in the most 
efficient and direct way? The Quebec government, of course. It 
is closer to the people. The main areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, such as health, education and income security, are 
central to our fellow citizens' lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we want money to be invested in social housing. If 
the hon. member for Chambly was to trade places with me, I am 
sure he would be just as passionate as I am in his defence of 
social housing. I know this is an issue of great concern to him. 
I am sure he will fondly recall going door to door in the riding 
of Sherbrooke, which resulted in a resounding victory for us. 
I believe we should still today celebrate our victory in the 
riding of Sherbrooke a few months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this to say that the hon. member for Chambly personally went 
door to door in the riding of Sherbrooke. I had the opportunity 
to talk to him about this, since he knocked on every door in a 
low cost housing project and has fond memories of this. I dare 
not say it was a revelation to him because he was already quite 
aware of the problem, but he came face to face with it and was 
able to see with his own eyes—the member for Chambly is a hands-on 
kind of guy—how important low income housing, co-op housing, is in 
terms of social action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is low income housing about? It is about people who form a 
community and know that no matter what happens to them, they 
never have to be alone. 
These people can count on a community room, but also on a 
support network and a solidarity that are always there, in good 
times as in bad times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this bill is a grave source of concern, since two of its 
clauses would allow the federal government to get directly 
involved in areas of provincial jurisdiction. This bill seeks to 
give a more commercial role to the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation. It sends a conflicting message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, the government said, in its throne speech, that 
it wants to decentralize things and give back to the provinces 
the responsibility for social housing, but on the other hand, it 
gives greater powers to the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would love to support this bill, because we realize something 
must be done in the area of social housing. But there has to be 
the assurance that this will be possible, to the extent that 
provincial governments, including the national government of 
Quebec, agree to that. It is our hope that this will be included 
in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How? I ask government members to look at clause 88(2). I will 
read it again, because I think this provision should be a model, 
a source of inspiration. If this condition were met, we could 
support the bill.

</UL>
<“may be made... only”. These words mean something. I will read 
the rest of the clause:

corresponding rental housing project is, or will be, located. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not rocket science. We are not asking for the 
impossible. 
We are asking that provincial jurisdictions be respected. If 
this is put in writing in the bill, we will be very pleased to 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding, I want to ask the government to resume 
negotiations. The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs must do 
his utmost to have Minister Harel and the Minister responsible 
for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation sit down 
together and come to an agreement regarding traditional demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that all the governments in Quebec, 
regardless of their political stripes, have asked for more money 
from the federal government for social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have taken part in this debate. I hope we will 
be able to support the bill. However, we will not do so without 
the assurance I have asked for today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague 
from Sackville—Eastern Shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to summarize this bill in one word it would be 
destructive.  It is destroying the hopes and dreams of Canadians 
who can only imagine living in decent housing and who see this 
bill as the final step away from any chance of their dreams being 
fulfilled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are people from across Canada who can talk of the 
difference social housing has made in people's live.  However, as 
the member of parliament representing the community of Reserve 
Mines I feel I have a unique perspective on what we will lose if 
this bill is allowed to go through.  It was in Reserve Mines that 
the first housing co-operative in Canada was built.  At one time 
people in Reserve Mines were forced to rent houses from the 
mining company that were overpriced and often substandard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Owning their own homes was a dream many thought was 
unachievable.  However, with the encouragement of their parish 
priest, Father Jimmy Tomkins, the co-operative that the people of 
Reserve Mines formed succeeded in planning, financing and 
building houses for its members.  For people who had never 
thought they would have a decent home for themselves and their 
families, it was a dream come true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dream of living in well maintained affordable homes that 
inspired the people of Reserve Mines in 1938 continues to be the 
driving force behind efforts to build and maintain social 
housing.  Unfortunately in the last few years the federal 
government has been doing its best to kill that dream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface Bill C-66 appears harmless.  The government has 
attempted to portray this bill as little more than a housekeeping 
measure to simplify the current legislation, remove unnecessary 
restrictions and improve the flexibility of the CMHC.  To use an 
old saying, the devil is in the details.  There are a number of 
details to which this government is not keen on drawing 
attention.  It is these details that administer the coup de grace 
in the Liberal government's retreat from social housing. They 
pave the way for the privatization of social housing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already seen the first step in the destruction of social 
housing in Canada with federal downloading.  Every province 
except Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia has had the complete 
social housing portfolio dumped on them.  It is disappointing but 
not surprising that my own province of Nova Scotia was the first 
to agree to the downloading.  Housing activists warned that the 
compensation offered by the federal government for taking over 
its housing responsibilities would not be enough in the long term 
but, as with DEVCO, a small pile of cash persuaded the Nova 
Scotia Liberal government to bend over backwards to capitulate to 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, New Democrats in British Columbia have held out 
against the download.  They have looked at the long term costs of 
downloading and they know the federal government has an important 
role to play in housing.  I know housing activists appreciate the 
efforts of British Columbia to get the federal government to live 
up to the commitments made in the many operating agreements it 
signed with individual non-profit housing providers across the 
province.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the provinces that have accepted the downloading we have seen 
that the end result is abandonment of social housing.  For 
instance, the Filmon government in Manitoba has made clear its 
intention to gradually withdraw all funding from social housing. 
In my own community we see the effects of abandonment of housing 
by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Open Door shelter is one of two homeless shelters in Sydney. 
The building it is in is 60 years old and is in need of repair. 
In a region where the real unemployment rate is 40%, there is not 
a lot of money to go around.  Since the federal government is not 
providing support for the community, the staff and board of the 
shelter must go elsewhere to look for money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few months I have had constituents coming to my 
office desperate for help.  There are people in my riding who are 
living in homes with plastic sheeting for a roof.  They are 
looking for help from the federal government and all too often 
there is none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the federal government is preparing to take the final step 
toward abandoning any responsibility or obligation for responding 
to housing problems in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current statutes contain very clear definitions of what is meant 
by terms like public housing project or eligible contribution 
recipient.  This bill eliminates these definitions from the act 
and puts them at the discretion of CMHC.  This opens the door for 
private, for profit corporations to be recognized as social 
housing providers.  This bill also eliminates the statutory 
requirements for social housing to be safe, sanitary and 
affordable.  These are currently minimum requirements for social 
housing units.  Now this Liberal government apparently feels that 
getting rid of these requirements will, to use its language, 
remove unnecessary restrictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be nice to believe its intentions are honourable.  It 
would be nice to believe that the maintenance of social housing 
projects across Canada is so good that including any minimum 
standards in the legislation is redundant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the evidence points to another, nastier 
conclusion.  The reason the Liberal government is getting rid of 
these requirements is so it will not be required to live up to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has tried to justify getting rid of these 
definitions on the grounds it needs flexibility.  According to 
it, dumping minimum standards for housing is just a little 
housekeeping measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to know is exactly why requiring homes to be safe, 
sanitary and affordable is so restrictive.  Is the government 
trying to tell us it needs the flexibility to allow people to 
live in fire traps, to allow conditions where diseases develop 
and spread, to raise rents through the roof? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either one believes all Canadians should have a right to decent, 
safe, affordable accommodation or one does not.  By removing 
these requirements the government is saying it does not think the 
homes of Canadians should have to meet even the most minimal 
standards of safety, sanitation or affordability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to touch on the proposed changes to mortgage 
insurance.  Under the current CMHC act, if the CMHC takes any 
losses when it underwrites someone's mortgage, the federal 
government absorbs those losses.  This enables CMHC to underwrite 
mortgages for people who cannot get mortgage insurance from banks 
such as people with low incomes, people with poor credit ratings 
and people in remote areas who do not have access to a bank or 
credit union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government is proposing is that CMHC will have to 
absorb any losses from underwriting mortgages itself out of the 
mortgage insurance fund.  Having to absorb any losses itself may 
force the CMHC to deny mortgage insurance to high risk 
applicants.  This will exclude applicants with low incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current mortgage insurance system the CMHC acts as a 
bulwark against a recession because it can underwrite mortgages 
in poor market conditions without risk.  This encourages housing 
development at a point in the market cycle where the market may 
discourage it.  This will change with the commercialising of 
CMHC's mortgage insurance.  CMHC will now be forced to weigh risk 
according to market cycles.  Thus it will no longer be able to 
play this valuable counter-recessionary role in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we come to the real reason for these changes.  It is well 
known that GE Corporation of the United States, which has large 
interests in the insurance industry, wants to expand into Canada. 
It is well known that it has been lobbying the Liberal government 
for the commercialization for CMHC's mortgage insurance to make 
this possible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill, the agenda of GE seems to have been put ahead of 
the needs of Canadians.  According to the government, there was a 
risk that if it did not make the changes in this bill, GE could 
have forced the changes using NAFTA.  In which case why, if NAFTA 
is such a fundamentally flawed agreement, was this government 
willing to sign it in 1993 and why has it not tried to change it 
since? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to touch on what this bill says about the real 
agenda of this government.  In the last few months we have heard 
regular expression of concern from this government about the 
problem of homelessness.  The recent announcement that social 
housing would not be transferred to the province of Ontario was 
portrayed as an attempt to protect social housing in that 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill proves that all the lip service the Liberal government 
has paid to the problem of homelessness was nothing but hot air. 
Homelessness has skyrocketed since the Liberal government came to 
power.  More and more Canadians are freezing to death on the 
streets.  This bill could have addressed these problems.  Instead 
it will make things dramatically worse.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with great pleasure to speak on what I 
consider to be one of the most important debates in the House of 
Commons when it comes to the social housing needs of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to give accolades to my colleague from Churchill, the 
critic for this area.  She has done an excellent job on behalf of 
the New Democratic Party in pointing out the major flaws within 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may wish to have a copy of a book written by our member 
for Vancouver East entitled <I>Homelessness, An Unnatural 
Disaster: A Time to Act</I>, a guide to the study she did across 
the country with members from social housing, NAPO and groups of 
that nature to discuss the social housing needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recognize that the Conservative Party of Canada is now 
doing a similar tour of its own.  I wish the party good luck with 
coming up with long term solutions for the problems that exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a young lad in 1974, I attended the UN sponsored habitat 
conference in Vancouver on housing and the need for housing not 
only in Canada and the Americas but around the world.  It is 
interesting to sit here today in the House of Commons and now 
have this debate on a domestic level 25 years later.  It is quite 
fundamental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to start with something very interesting which is how 
Liberals, especially those in cabinet, can flip-flop and change 
their opinions literally at the drop of a hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 the then official opposition and chair of the Liberal 
Party task force on housing, the current finance minister, 
condemned the government of the day for doing nothing while the 
housing crisis continued to grow out of control:  “The 
government sits there and does nothing.  It refuses to apply the 
urgent measures that are required to reverse this deteriorating 
situation.  The lack of affordable housing contributes to and 
accelerates the cycle of poverty, which is reprehensible in a 
society as rich as ours”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my party could not agree more.  The question is why did 
the finance minister change is mind.  Why did the Liberal Party 
change its mind on many other issues?  On such a fundamental 
issue as this one, why did the so-called caring finance minister 
change his mind and literally destroy the advancement of 75,000 
new social housing units in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from the beautiful province of Nova Scotia where the 
federal government has abandoned all responsibility for social 
housing and literally tricked the current Liberal government in 
Nova Scotia to take over responsibility for it.  It is absolutely 
reprehensible that a federal Liberal government would abandon its 
social housing policies in the beautiful province of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like Liberal or opposition members to come with me to 
Catalina, Newfoundland.  When we did a fisheries tour with the 
Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans we saw a row of houses 
completely abandoned because those people had no more jobs and 
there was no more work.  They had to go elsewhere in Canada to 
find a place to live and work.  Meanwhile, a perfectly good home 
was left abandoned.  This is the history of our country.  Farmers 
in the prairies and in the Atlantic provinces and fishermen in 
the east and west have had to abandon their homes to look for 
work elsewhere in the country because the centralized governments 
of our day completely abandoned the extremities of this nation.

to aboriginal people and first nations reserves.  I will not go 
into the details of it as it has been explained quite well 
already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the Liberal Party of Canada have to do is read a 
fantastic magazine out of Newfoundland called <I>The 
Downhomer</I>.  <I>The Downhomer</I> will send them at a cost of 
$36 Canadian, no tax, a copy of a Ted Stuckless print.  It is a 
picture of two Newfoundlanders in a dory with a make and break 
engine.  They are towing a home on logs across the bay as was 
done during the resettlement program.  That picture says a 
thousand words on the devastation of the resettlement program 
which moved people from their ancestral homes for so-called 
economic development.  People from Newfoundland and Nova Scotia 
are abandoning their homes now and moving elsewhere to other 
parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Homelessness is no surprise.  Cities like Toronto, Winnipeg, 
Vancouver, Montreal and Halifax are in a crisis state.  It only 
makes sense.  They cannot keep taking, taking, taking and 
destroying the social programs and then turn around and say it is 
a surprise that there is homelessness in Toronto.  They cannot 
say “What a shock” or “When did this happen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the life of me I cannot understand why the Liberal 
government abandoned all of the principles of their sixties 
agreement.  Back in the sixties the current deputy minister was 
left of centre and has now completely abandoned all those 
principles.  The government has abandoned the great principles of 
former Prime Minister Lester Pearson.  It has abandoned the 
principles of Warren Allmand.  It has abandoned most of those 
principles for the so-called fiscally conservative right which 
benefits the few and puts the majority at disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recommend that the Liberal Party of Canada, especially the 
deputy House leader, if he wishes, go to Newfoundland, or <I>The 
Downhomer</I> would be proud to send a lovely print of the two 
Newfoundlanders in the dory with the make and break engine. I 
have a copy of that beautiful print hanging on the wall of my 
office.  Every day it proves to me that we have a serious crisis 
when it comes to homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fundamental basic right of the nation and of all world

area as I used to be the president of a housing co-op that was 
seeking allocations of units so we could build social housing 
within the inner city of Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member of parliament who I defeated in that riding 
joined my housing co-op to show that he was interested in social 
housing.  That is the only reason he would pay $10 to join our 
co-op.  At the only meeting I saw him attend he said that Canada 
was the only country in the world which did not have a national 
housing strategy. 
He made that comment because prior to 1993—this is what I was 
leading into and I would like the member to comment on—it was 
Mulroney who started to tear down any kind of a national housing 
strategy.

intended to reinstate some kind of national housing program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the inner city of Winnipeg none of the normal market controls 
or influences work.  The value of the property is too low to 
interest landlords in investing in low income housing.  In the 
absence of social housing, or some kind of subsidized housing, no 
new units will be built.  We are facing a ghettoized situation 
where we have a donut shaped city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result has been epidemic arson.  Landlords are turning in 
desperation to torching their houses.  It looks like burn baby, 
burn in the late sixties in Watts.  There were 80 or 90 arsons in 
a 12 block area in three months.  That is five or six a night 
sometimes, places being burnt out of desperation.  I would argue 
this is because of the complete absence of any commitment to a 
national housing strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the member's personal experience in the communities in which 
he has lived, has he seen a similar deterioration of housing 
stock without new housing being built through social housing 
programs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. colleague is 
absolutely right.  It is something we have been saying time and 
time again:  Liberal, Tory, same old story.  The Liberals have 
reformed Tory policies.  That is exactly what they have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague is absolutely right.  The Liberal government 
has abandoned its heart when it comes to policies on medicare, EI 
and especially social housing.  It is a national disgrace.  In 
the next election the Liberals will be paying for it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to address the House today on Bill C-66 
which proposes amendments to the National Housing Act and the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have divided my speech into two portions.  I would first like 
to speak about the bill as proposed.  There are a few things in 
the bill that are good and I would like to talk about some of 
those areas.  However, our party also has some serious concerns 
with some of the provisions in the bill.  I would like to walk 
members through some of the proposed changes and explain exactly 
our concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically I would like to deal with the proposal to 
commercialize mortgage insurance and the effects this would have 
on the risk aversion of corporations and the $200 million payment 
to the federal government from CMHC for the crown backing of its 
insurance and loan guarantee operations.  I would also like to 
discuss the changes to the structure of CMHC's board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second part of my speech I want to talk about the social 
housing sections of the bill or, more specifically, what has been 
left out of the bill and how the government has missed a prime 
opportunity to address some of the problems involving affordable 
housing and homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC is mandated to deliver federal housing programs in four 
general areas.  First, under housing finances, CMHC promotes the 
availability, accessibility and choice of housing funding.  For 
many home buyers this takes the form of mortgage insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, CMHC strives to encourage competitiveness in and the 
health of the housing market by conducting research, by improving 
housing, by supporting the housing market and by the 
dissemination of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, CMHC has an ongoing responsibility for federal assisted 
housing initiatives, including support for aboriginal communities 
in their efforts to become self-sufficient in developing and 
maintaining their housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government provides the corporation with $1.9 
billion of funding each year.  The lion's share of these funds 
goes to meet the long term financial obligations arising from 
subsidies for 656,000 social housing units such as non-profit 
housing, public housing and housing co-operatives. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early in its first mandate the government announced that it 
would withdraw from funding further social housing units.  Since 
then the government has signed agreements with seven provinces 
and territories to offload social housing on to them.  Finally, 
CMHC supports the export of Canadian housing products and 
expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66 contains the most extensive changes to the National 
Housing Act and the CMHC Act since 1985.  Among other things, the 
government is proposing changes to CMHC's mortgage insurance 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, the government wants to commercialize the 
corporation's mortgage insurance functions.  Any losses as a 
result of mortgage insurance underwriting must come out of CMHC 
rather than general government revenues.  This removes any 
competitive edge the government agency has in the marketplace and 
puts CMHC's mortgage insurance on a level playing field with 
private insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC would be able to introduce new mortgage products such as 
reverse equity mortgages.  These mortgages enable older residents 
to use the equity in their homes to obtain funds to supplement 
their income while allowing them to continue to live there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes will also allow CMHC to accelerate the growth of the 
secondary market by providing a wider range of secondary mortgage 
market products through mortgage backed securities guaranteed 
funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pooling of individual mortgages provides lenders with a 
lower cost source of funding and ensures an adequate supply of 
mortgage funds.  These commercialization measures are a response 
to potential challenges under the North American Free Trade 
Agreement.  While these changes would give Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation the flexibility to offer new products, they 
also eliminate the advantages of government underwriting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, forcing CMHC to cover any losses will decrease its 
willingness to finance high risk borrowers such as low income 
people.  If it also makes it more difficult for borrowers in 
rural Canada to qualify for mortgage loan insurance, speaking as 
someone who grew up and lives in rural New Brunswick it would not 
go too well in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second problem we have with the proposed change to CMHC's 
mortgage insurance activities involves the payment to the federal 
government in compensation for the crown's backing of its 
insurance products retroactive to January 1, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the objective of the new section 18 in that the 
government wants to create a level playing field with the private 
sector sellers of mortgage insurance.  It has to pay compensation 
for the backing of its insurance operations.  To be fair, CMHC 
should have the same obligations.  I agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem arises when it is realized that over the next few 
years the government will pull $200 million out of the 
corporation.  According to CMHC's summary of the corporate plan 
for 1998 to 2002, by the year 2002 the government will have 
starved Canada's social housing programs by $197.9 million to pay 
this fee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government possibly justify taking $200 million out 
of CMHC that is charged with helping house Canadians while 
thousands of Canadians are forced to sleep in shelters each 
night? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to find a way to reinvest this money into 
social housing programs so that no Canadian who is in need of 
housing suffers because of this measure.  It seems the government 
has not completely thought this issue through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem that concerns my party and should concern all 
Canadians involves one proposed change to the CMHC Act with 
respect to the composition of CMHC's board of directors. 
Presently the board consists of the chairman of the corporation, 
the president, a vice-president, two public servants and five 
political appointees, for a total of 10.  All in all this is not 
a bad balance.  We would have a board of five highly qualified 
housing professionals and five people appointed by the Liberal 
cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want to speak against the Liberals, but the 
government has developed a reputation, deservedly so, of 
appointing Liberals to government boards, qualified or otherwise. 
The minister is proposing in the bill that we should reduce the 
number of qualified professionals on the board by three and 
replace them with Liberal appointees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the legislation the requirement to have a vice-president 
and two public servants sit on the board would be removed.  Only 
the chairman and the president would remain and the Liberal 
patronage appointees would have a healthy majority of eight of 
the ten director positions.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from the distasteful nature of this change that could put 
three more Liberals on the CMHC board, it would also threaten the 
independence that CMHC enjoys as a crown corporation.  Just 
think, right now CMHC management has to answer to a board that at 
least has some balance between five highly qualified 
professionals and five Liberals.  However, under the new board 
CMHC management will be under the direction of a board comprised 
of a majority of Liberal appointees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as important as what is proposed by the government in this 
bill is what was conveniently left out of it.  I will take a few 
minutes to talk about social housing policy in general and how it 
relates to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past month the government missed two prime opportunities 
to deal with the problem of the lack of affordable housing in 
Canada and its impact on homelessness in particular.  The first 
opportunity occurred on February 11 of this year when the bill 
was introduced and the second was when the budget was brought 
down on February 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that the person who introduced the budget, the 
finance minister, the member for LaSalle—Émard, was once the 
champion of social housing.  In 1990 he and his colleague, the MP 
for London North Centre, published the report of the national 
Liberal caucus task force on housing.  In that document the 
current finance minister set out a manifesto on how a Liberal 
government would provide affordable housing for all Canadians and 
eradicate homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alas, like so many other broken Liberal promises, like the GST 
and free trade, the finance minister's promises on social housing 
were relegated to the dustbin just as fast as the Liberals took 
power in 1993.  That may suit the finance minister just fine, but 
he and his government have done nothing to provide affordable 
housing for Canadians and to eliminate homelessness.  It is 
exactly the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is looking for some good ideas on what should 
be included in Bill C-66 to deal with these problems, I will 
quote liberally from both its party's task force document as well 
as a report that was released in January of this year by the 
Toronto task force on homelessness, chaired by Dr. Anne Golden, 
entitled “Taking Responsibility for Homelessness.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his report, the finance minister promised that a Liberal 
government would recognize in the Constitution the right to 
adequate shelter.  It never happened.  He said that housing is a 
fundamental human right and that a Liberal prime minister would 
discuss housing rights at a first ministers' conference.  We are 
still waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He told Canadians that he would provide more money for housing 
in provincial transfers, but instead he cut provincial cash 
transfers by 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He promised a new federal-provincial social program to assist 
the working poor with housing costs, but none ever materialized. 
He told anyone who would listen that his government would 
increase funding for housing co-operatives and look for new ways 
to use housing co-ops to provide affordable housing.  Instead it 
froze and then decreased funding for co-ops.  Now it is trying to 
offload housing co-ops to the provinces and cut off funding 
entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my favourite.  The finance minister promised that he 
would eliminate all substandard aboriginal housing by the year 
2000.  I guess he has missed that target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Assembly of First Nations, almost 50,000 or 60% 
of the 83,000 housing units on reserves are inadequate.  More 
than 10,000 of those units have deficient or non-existent water 
and sewer services and 16,000 units are overcrowded.  So much for 
the word of the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this bill, there are some concrete steps the 
government could take to deal effectively with the problems of 
inadequate housing.  As I have already mentioned, many of these 
proposals were outlined by Dr. Anne Golden in her report released 
in January.  In her report she refers to four causes of 
homelessness:  increased poverty, lack of affordable housing, 
deinstitutionalization and a lack of discharge planning, and 
social factors such as domestic violence and physical or sexual 
abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the scope of Bill C-66 deals only with housing issues I 
will limit my discussion to how the government could increase the 
supply of low cost rental units and rooming houses, and the need 
for increased support for social housing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has been a key player in social housing 
development for over 50 years, since the founding of the Central 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation after the second world war.  The 
decision by the Liberal government to offload social housing on 
to the provinces has contributed to the growing shortage of 
affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the Golden report notes that among major western 
industrialized countries only Canada has no policy on 
homelessness.  It recommends that the federal government provide 
capital assistance for the construction of new affordable housing 
and the rehabilitation of existing affordable housing.  Because 
the federal government is largely responsible for aboriginal 
people, immigrants and refugees, it also suggests that Canada 
should fund projects to prevent and reduce homelessness among 
these groups at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also recommends that the federal government should 
change the mortgage and valuation rules so that in addition to 
commercial transactions through the CMHC mortgage insurance fund 
the government could introduce policies that encourage not for 
profit rental construction.  Right now CMHC permits lower debt 
coverage ratios for certain special purpose projects and it could 
do the same for non-profit rental projects, including innovative 
housing forms that may have uncertain market values such as 
single room occupancy units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Golden report suggests that CMHC get into direct mortgage 
lending.  Direct lending is the cheapest source of financing and 
could generate revenues for the corporation.  Additional mortgage 
funding could be piggybacked on to the mortgage backed securities 
that now fund social housing mortgage renewals.  It also 
recommends that the federal government provide land at less than 
market value from its holdings of surplus land and buildings 
through Public Works, CMHC and the Canada Land Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also calls for an investment of up to $300 million in 
capital support for new low income housing and for CMHC to 
reinvest the savings realized each year for the devolution of 
social housing to the provinces.  Unfortunately, as I noted 
previously, the Liberals have instead decided to take $200 
million out of social housing, which is disgraceful by any 
measure.  Perhaps we can persuade the government to change its 
mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another recommendation of the report calls on the government to 
channel federal capital to new affordable housing by way of an 
infrastructure program for housing or set up local foundations 
for affordable housing and/or a tax incentive for contributions 
to eligible foundations or projects.  The residential 
rehabilitation assistance program should also be expanded to 
include rental apartment buildings, rooming houses and second 
suites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it is very difficult for the operators of rooming 
houses to obtain mortgage financing or insurance.   When they are 
successful it almost always at a premium rate, reflecting the 
higher perceived risk by lenders.  Since CMHC has expertise in 
mediating lending rates, the report suggests that CMHC assist 
rooming house owners in accessing mortgage financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all simple steps the government could take in part 
through Bill C-66 to alleviate homelessness and to increase the 
supply of affordable housing for all Canadians.  The Liberals, 
through the finance minister, promised they would deal with this 
problem.  They have recently had two opportunities, through this 
bill and in the budget, but they have not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could be no more potent reminder of the need to find 
solutions to the housing problems in Canada than we saw a week 
after this bill was tabled and a few days after the budget.  A 
few blocks from Parliament Hill, Lynn Maureen Bluecloud, a 33 
year old homeless, five-month pregnant aboriginal women was found 
dead in a park at the corner of Nicholas Street and Laurier.  She 
died from hypothermia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need action on homelessness now.  The government must live up 
to its promises and use the means available to it to increase the 
supply of affordable housing for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much room for improvement in the bill.  I look forward 
to dealing with this bill in committee so that we can propose 
ways of doing just that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member a couple of quick questions, 
but I will make a brief statement beforehand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Liberals were responding to what the Tories were 
doing to social housing policy and what they were going to do to 
social housing in this country.  Is this a change in the 
Conservative position with regard to social housing?  Does he not 
believe that all the Liberals have really done is reformed Tory 
policies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to pick on the hon. member that much because he is 
a decent fellow from New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is absolutely right that this bill needs a lot of work.  I 
wish him and his party, along with our party and other parties, 
the best of luck in committee in putting amendments in place.  He 
is absolutely right when he says that all Canadians deserve 
affordable housing no matter where they live in this country.  I 
wish him and his party the best of luck when they go on their 
cross-country tour to discuss homelessness and poverty issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not agree that with CMHC becoming more 
privatized that would in effect set up a privatized for-profit 
social housing policy in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
from the NDP for his question.  I have a great deal of respect 
for that gentleman, but it is too bad for his line of questions. 
When the member speaks he makes us feel as though the NDP is the 
only party that has ever said anything right in this House.  Over 
the years the Conservative Party has said some good stuff, which 
was right, as well as the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we were in power between 1984 and 1993 we had our own 
record on housing.  We had a lot of money attached to it.  When I 
open this to the second page I see that under the National 
Housing Act from September 1984 to November 1988 some $4.8 
billion went toward social housing in this country.  Today there 
is $1.9 billion going toward social housing.  Therefore I wonder 
why he criticizes the previous Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said that my party has changed its mind.  The money was 
there and we did great stuff to make sure that every Canadian had 
affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go even further than that.  In 1986 we put money upfront 
to help persons with disabilities.  In 1986 we increased 
assistance to renovate housing for persons with disabilities from 
$1,500 to $5,000.  That was done under the previous Conservative 
government.  The NDP was never in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go even further.  Today the budget of Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation is $1.9 billion for 656,000 homes.  In 
1992-93 we had a $2 billion cap on social housing for 652,000 
homes.  Today we have 4,000 more homes, but less money.  That is 
where the gap is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our 1993 budget we said that we would continue to fund all 
existing social housing stocks, which included co-ops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1991, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation rural 
and native housing programs were to receive $33 million in 
additional funding over what they were already receiving.  This 
followed discussions with interest groups in meetings across 
Canada.  From 1986 to that time the program had helped over 
96,500 rural households across Canada.  It said that it would 
spend $108.4 million in 1993-94 for on reserve social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to the national news last night.  Peter 
Mansbridge was saying that Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation or Public Works would contribute an extra $20 million 
to help natives on reserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today a contractor who purchases land and builds a house will 
have to put in a sewer system and dig a well.  A well would have 
to be dug especially in rural areas where the reserves are 
because they do not have city water.  This adds to the 
construction costs of the house.  Building a house today with all 
those incentives, $80,000 a house, there will not be much luxury. 
By the same token, using the price of $80,000 for a house, $20 
million will only build 250 houses to help the natives of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same report last night said that over 100,000 new houses 
were needed on reserves to help families.  Pictures of the inside 
of some of those houses were shown last night.  I was very 
disgusted to see that in as rich a country as Canada is. 
Aboriginals are Canadians too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live four kilometres away from the second biggest reserve in 
New Brunswick.  I own a little business and 85% of my business is 
with those people.  They are good people. I am also associated 
with the Knights of Columbus on that same reserve. I am not 
saying they do not have any problems, but problems can be fixed. 
People should see the number of people who live in a small house 
or a small room.  They should see the condition of some of those 
houses.  I cannot describe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to work together.  I am not trying to bash anyone.  I 
say to members on the government side and to all parties on the 
opposition side, let us all work together so that we can have a 
good housing bill so that we can put money up front.  It is money 
that is not going to be wasted.  The money will go to Canadians 
who need a good and decent home to raise the kids of today.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is going to be harder for them to give me the money. I am 
going to be at a higher risk because I live in a rural area, 
maybe with seasonal work six months of the year.  That is a big 
concern. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on this matter as 
homelessness is of considerable concern to the people in my 
riding and to the people of Toronto generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coincidentally, the mayor of Toronto was here yesterday for a 
meeting with the Prime Minister.  It is ironic. Toronto fancies 
itself as the centre of the universe and indeed it is an economic 
engine and does house many of Canada's largest corporations. 
There is a level of prosperity in Toronto which is seldom matched 
in the rest of the country.  Toronto, as I say, is a bit 
conceited in seeing itself as a world class city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would therefore think that the topics on the agenda between 
the Prime Minister of Canada and the mayor of Canada's largest 
city would involve something like the Olympic bid or a fixed rail 
link between Pearson airport and downtown Toronto.  I regret to 
inform the House that the number one topic between the Prime 
Minister and the mayor of Canada's largest city yesterday was 
homelessness. That is distressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Homelessness is an enormous problem in Toronto and I dare say it 
is an enormous problem in various other centres across the 
country.  At least 5,000 people are homeless each and every night 
in Toronto.  In my riding alone there are 1,100 homeless people 
each and every night.  They are from everywhere.  They are from 
every province and virtually every city in this nation and from 
around the globe. They are not overly fussy where they come from, 
but they all end up in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a tour of my riding.  My riding is at the east end 
of Toronto.  It butts up against Lake Ontario and the Rouge 
River.  It used to be the entrance to Toronto before the 401 was 
built.  As a consequence, there are a number of motel units, 23 
motel units in all, of which 11 are retained by metro housing to 
house homeless people.  This was supposed to be a temporary 
solution. As a consequence, when someone is homeless from 
anywhere else in the country and is in Toronto or lands at 
Pearson airport, the likelihood is that he or she will end up in 
my riding that night.  There are 1,100 people each and every 
night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It simply overwhelms our school system.  The local school, West 
Hill Public School, has a 200% to 300% turnover for children on 
an annual basis. I do not know how the principals and the staff 
cope.  I do not know how the children cope.  How can they expect 
to run a soccer team or conduct a science fair when all of their 
schoolmates are leaving for other places.  Similarly with food 
banks, there is an endless lineup at food banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely proud of my community because we have coped 
magnificently.  The local churches have stood up to the plate. 
They provide meals on a weekly basis, whether it is a breakfast 
or a dinner.  However, we are starting to have compassion 
fatigue.  We cannot continue to cope with 1,100 people in my 
riding each and every night. In some respects, I would dare say 
that the people of Scarborough East are being unfairly asked to 
house the rest of the people from Canada and around the world who 
are homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All forms of housing are linked. 
In some respects Scarborough East can be seen as a microcosm of 
the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding we can buy a $2 million house.  We can literally go 
from a $2 million house, to a $1 million house, to a half a 
million dollar house down to townhouses, to apartment buildings, 
to social assistance housing.  Twenty-five per cent of the people 
in my riding are on social assistance of some kind.  Then we get 
down to the motel units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a family was a functioning family when it entered one of 
these motel units, I dare say by the time it exited the motel 
unit, the family would have become dysfunctional. These motel 
units are no way to house homeless people. I dare say that anyone 
in this House who spent any amount of time with a spouse and 
children in these motel units would not have a functioning family 
when they left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All forms of housing are linked. This bill addresses those forms 
of housing. It is a mark of a civilized society as to how it 
shelters its people.  That is fundamental.  It is a mark of a 
civilized society as to how it houses its people particularly in 
a northern climate. There is no choice.  We cannot have people on 
the street in a northern climate. This bill somewhat addresses 
that issue.  The purpose of the bill states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this act, in relation to financing for housing, is 
to promote housing affordability and choice, to facilitate access 
to, and competition and efficiency in the provision of, housing 
finance, to protect the availability of adequate funding for 
housing at low cost, and generally to contribute to the 
well-being of the housing sector in the national economy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The test of the success of this bill will be how it meets its 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I address the House's attention to clause 8 which provides 
insurance for reverse mortgages.  This is a form of protection of 
housing for elderly people. This is a response in some measure to 
the feeling that people who are in a certain situation, a certain 
age bracket, are unable to stay in their home and stay there 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that time is going on, Mr. Speaker.  If I may, I will 
continue my speech after question period.

this week is National Farm Safety Week.  Having a riding such as 
Waterloo—Wellington in which there are many farms and still 
living on my own family farm, I realize the importance of this 
nationwide event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farm can be a very dangerous place, as members know, if 
precaution is not taken.  It is very important for all Canadians, 
especially those living in or visiting rural areas to learn about 
the dangers surrounding farm equipment and farm animals. Children 
and adults alike must acknowledge these dangers and act 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week offers an excellent opportunity for Canadians to learn 
about and identify the possible dangers of farms.  Events taking 
place across the country can provide education and awareness of 
farm safety procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of my riding as well as all Canadians to get 
involved in this event, to learn more about what they can do to 
keep their farms safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to commend the Canada Safety Council for 
putting on the National Farm Safety Week.  Its efforts in this 
and other fields must be appreciated and acknowledged.

Canadians improve a system in which supply has fallen tragically 
behind demand.  Today's promise can be tomorrow's precious gift.

Speaker, today the Canadian Council for International 
Co-operation has called on the government to improve our foreign 
aid policies. Our international reputation as a caring country 
has been under attack for the past decade.  Liberal government 
cuts have caused Canada's aid to fall to a shameful low of .27% 
of our GNP, a far cry from the UN target of .7%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More money for the foreign aid program is not enough. Canada's 
aid program is not doing the job it should, to be solely focused 
on the elimination of global poverty. New Democrats have long 
called for a move from donorship to local ownership in aid 
relations, to involve Canadians in development issues and to 
spend enough money to meet our global obligations.  We endorse 
the call today of the CCIC to cancel debts to the poorest 
countries and to rebuild our Canadian aid resources to .35% of 
GNP by 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I salute the efforts of the CCIC and all Canadians who 
understand that fighting poverty, whether at home or abroad, is 
the hallmark of a truly civilized society.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, after six years of delay the Prime Minister has finally 
agreed to changes in the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reforms to hold parents of young offenders more accountable and 
to give victims a greater voice have been included.  For that 
Canadians can thank Reform MPs from Surrey North and Crowfoot. 
Beyond that Canadians will be disappointed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, why did the justice minister reject the 
recommendation of her justice committee that the age of 
application of the Young Offenders Act be lowered to age 10? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we need to understand what the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights recommended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its concern was that children under the age of 12 who commit 
crimes not fall through the cracks in our system generally.  We 
agree with that, but we do not believe that the formal criminal 
justice system is the best place in which to deal with and help 
those young children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have sat in the House listening to this party express its 
concern about children and families.  We have got— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Leader of the Opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the justice committee and many members of parliament 
have found that older criminals were recruiting 10 to 12 year 
olds into criminal activity because they knew they could not be 
touched under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of lowering the age to 10 was to get those young people 
into the system so that the rehabilitative aspects of the Young 
Offenders Act could be applied at a younger age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the minister reject that advice not only from Reform MPs 
but from her justice committee? 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition misunderstands the recommendation of the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me reiterate that we on this side of the House believe a 10 
year old or an 11 year old who breaks the law does need support, 
does need help.  Where we need to look for that support and help 
is not in jail.  It is in the child welfare system and the mental 
health system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the best rehabilitative system for young people is 
strong families.  That is where rehabilitation and preventive 
actions can occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. minister really believes the statistics that link 
criminal activity on the part of young people to economic 
deprivation in families, why does she and why does her government 
support discriminatory taxation against families that aggravate 
the problem? 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again let me say this is a 
party that talks, that blathers on about fair commitment to 
children and families.  This is a party which voted against the 
national child benefit.  This is a party that voted against 
increased funding for CAPC.  This is a party that would jail 10 
year olds. 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
not interested in jailing 10 year olds, but there has been no 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been demanding a change to cover 10 to 15 year 
olds.  The justice committee recommended that 10 and 11 year olds 
be held criminally responsible for their crimes, not sent to 
jail.  In order to rehabilitate these children we have to get 
them within the system before it is too late for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the minister refuse to listen to the demands of 
Canadians to get these kids into the system so they can get the 
help they need?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me reiterate that we are 
not suggesting these young people should not be within a system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the view of the government—and I thank my colleagues on 
this side of the House for supporting me on it—that it is best 
to use the child welfare system or the mental health system to 
help those children under 12. 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
age of application has been at issue for decades.  In 1962 the 
justice department recommended that 10 and 11 year olds be 
included.  The government refused citing economic and political 
considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government letting politics getting in the way of public 
safety?  There is an extremely low number of 10 and 11 year old 
offenders.  Do they not deserve to be saved by our criminal 
justice process and to get the help they need? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What political considerations caused the minister to fail to 
comply with the wishes of Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member 
misunderstands the desires of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Canadians want is to make sure that 10 and 11 year olds, if 
they break the law, are not left to their own devices but get the 
help, support and treatment they need.  That is why we believe 
the child welfare system or the mental health system is the best 
place to provide that assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also made it plain my officials are working with 
provincial and territorial officials to make sure that together

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
owners of Davie Industries and various stakeholders want to 
ensure the survival of the shipyards in Lévis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, the Government of Quebec established a policy to 
provide tax credits to assist shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Minister of Industry prepared to offer tax advantages to 
the shipbuilding industry compatible with those offered by 
Quebec, in order to facilitate the sale of the Lévis shipyard 
and to thus ensure the survival of the hundreds of jobs there? 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member must be aware of the fact that, with the existing 
tax system, there is an accelerated deduction of depreciation 
costs of 33% for ships built in Canada.  It is very quick, it is 
direct depreciation.  That means that after four years the buyer 
of a ship built in Canada can deduct the entire cost of the 
ship.  That is a very generous tax shelter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Industry would do well to discuss with his colleague 
the Secretary of State for Agriculture, who last month said in 
<I>Le Soleil</I>, and I quote “There are some very generous people 
there—on investors.  I have had contact with them.  They have 
set as a condition the federal government's relaxing tax 
advantages for shipbuilding”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the light of this statement by his colleague, could the 
Minister of Industry tell us why he refuses to provide tax 
advantages compatible with those provided by Quebec? 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would also mention the fact that with the existing tax shelter, 
there is also a 25% customs duty on ships imported into Canada 
outside the NAFTA agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also internal contracts for the federal government and 
funding for commercially viable transactions by the Export 
Development Corporation.  Not only in this sector, but in others 
as well, there is the system of tax credits for research and 
development that are also very favourable.

of State for Agriculture and Agri-Food said that the next budget 
might contain new measures for shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we saw nothing along these lines in the last federal budget, 
are we to understand that the Secretary of State for Agriculture 
and Agri-Food failed miserably in his attempt to convince his

R&D in Canada and for the process of innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the most important sectors for building the 
industries of the 21st century here in Canada and in Quebec. 
These were the same sectors that received funding in the budget

the men of the Davie shipyard that there is nothing he can do 
for them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is not true that the federal government has done nothing for the 
Lévis shipyard.  It invested large amounts of money in the 
shipyard for several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also just explained that there are tax shelters for the 
shipbuilding industry here in Canada.  The assistance that has 
already been given and that will given in the future is not

recruited into youth gangs in Winnipeg and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knows what I am talking about.  Yet the new package 
fails to come down hard on those who would lead those kids down 
that road.  The bill is silent in the face of that growing

<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

There are existing provisions both in the Criminal Code and in

question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the numbers do not add up.  The government announced $175 million 
in new moneys for the defence budget and restored a cut of $150 
million, bringing the defence budget to $9.7 billion for this 
year.  However, the estimates state that the defence budget is 
$10.3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister tell us why he did not announce the new 
spending of $600 million and tell us where the money came from? 
Was it transfers from the provinces, the finance minister's shell 
game, or did he again dip into the military pension fund? 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

provisions in the defence estimates relevant to the disaster 
financial assistance arrangement, which is not directly related 
to military but does form part of the expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we are grateful that for the first time in a dozen 
years the Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces 
have received an increase in their estimates.  That gives us the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The new youth criminal justice bill allows for provinces to opt

of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Indeed, Mr. Speaker, I will not concede 
that.  In fact what we have presented today in the House is a 
balanced and principled approach to a growing concern on the part 
of Canadians in terms of their lack of confidence in the youth 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind members that in fact our balanced approach is 
based upon an overarching commitment to protection of society. 
We do not take a uni-dimensional approach to that challenge, 
unlike some.  We believe that we achieve that protection through, 
first, crime prevention; second, meaningful consequences when 
crimes are committed; and third, rehabilitation and 
reintegration.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Justice seems to think that only she and her 
government know what is good for people and she in fact says that 
other people just do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the justice minister that the member for Surrey 
North is a victim of youth crime.  He paid a terrible price and 
he ran for parliament on those grounds.

North, or this caucus or anyone across the country who does not 
agree with her, just does not understand? 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not saying that Canadians 
do not understand.  In fact, we have listened to Canadians.  We 
have been told by Canadians that they want a new youth justice 
system which reflects their values, values of accountability and 
responsibility, with a further emphasis on prevention.  The other 
thing they told us was, for them, that does not mean putting more 
kids in jail for longer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK156"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a degree in criminology and I do not think that putting ten 
and eleven year olds in jail is the answer.  I agree with the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people need to be brought into the system.  Ten and eleven 
year olds need to be brought into the system so they can be 
rehabilitated when we know that they are there.  The child 
welfare system is not going to salvage these kids, and the 
minister knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the minister says that the member for Surrey North just 
does not understand, that we do not understand about ten and 
eleven year olds.  How in the world does the minister think she 
has all the answers and that this is going to solve the problems 
of youth crime?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

of the House that we have all the answers, unlike our friends 
over there who have a simplistic, black and white, 
uni-dimensional answer for every complex social problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member for Edmonton North bothered to read the youth 
justice strategy she would see that we have a multi-dimensional 
approach that speaks to the real concerns of Canadians.  We 
prevent crime in the first place.  When crimes are committed, we 
provide meaningful consequences and when—

It is true that women who work less than 15 hours are now in a 
better position with our hour-based employment insurance system. 
This is definitely the case for those who work less than 15 
hours some weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, for those women who work more than 15 hours and up to

what his in-law Paul Desmarais had to say.  “Why pay taxes in 
Canada when taxes are so exorbitant?”  He went on say “When the

his own family.

Mr. Desmarais said was that he was going to stay in Canada and 
that he was going to pay his taxes in Canada because he 
recognizes that it is those taxes, the taxes of all Canadians, 
which pay for our health care and education.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A proposal has been made to provide ongoing lifetime care to

two public projects built adjacent to the Prime Minister's

$72,000, was to build an RCMP compound. The second one, worth 
$65,000, was to build a road.  I sent the contract award records 
to the minister.

it. Security for the Prime Minister is the responsibility of the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  The RCMP indicated that an 
additional access road was required.  The contractor was already

</I></B></P><P align=left>For over two years now, Lucien Beaupré, who raises elk in Aston

herd because one animal that had just been bought had 
tuberculosis.  But Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada had twice 
certified the animal's health in writing.

years. That is why we are working so hard with provincial and 
territorial governments.

doing.  We provide $143 million every year now and in fact we 
will be providing more money in the coming years.

<A NAME="LINK230">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-66, an 
act to amend the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation Act and to make consequential amendment to 
another act, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the debate was interrupted for 
question period the hon. member for Scarborough East had 12 
minutes left. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will not take the entire 12 minutes complete my comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was speaking about the situation in my riding and the 1,100 
homeless people who are there each and every night and the 
growing situation in Toronto which I know is being experienced by 
other cities.  Homelessness continues to be a significant and 
major problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all linked.  All shelter is linked.  It does not much 
matter whether one can buy a $2 million home in my riding or a 
$500,000 home or if one is in a motel unit.  It is all linked. 
That is what this bill attempts to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be obscure to some people that things like bundling 
insurance is somehow linked to homelessness. 
When a package of $100 million in mortgages can be bundled and 
sold off to investors, that makes a pool of $100 million 
available to lenders so they can in turn lend to other housing 
situations.  We increase the pool.  That is what this bill does.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be obscure to some that reverse mortgages are somehow a 
very limited form of shelter.  If you are elderly, if you have 
equity in your home and if you do not want to move, being able to 
stay in your home over a period of time through a reverse 
mortgage is a very useful thing to be able to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill speaks to direct assistance to housing projects.  This 
bill speaks to lending to charitable corporations so housing can 
be provided to those people who are most in need of it.  In my 
riding we have federal co-op houses.  There is not a person in 
the Chamber who would not like to live in that kind of housing. 
It is good housing and it is provided through the auspices of the 
Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good bill that deserves the support of all members. Is 
it enough?  It is never enough.  Will it address the problem of 
homelessness in its totality?  Of course it will not.  It does 
move toward eliminating homelessness in my riding of Scarborough 
East, in the city of Toronto, in the province of Ontario and in 
the nation.  This bill, along with the measures announced in the 
budget to provide $3.5 billion in health care funding, $2 billion 
in additional cash funding to the CHST and in Ontario's case an 
additional $900 million in catch-up money, speaks to the 
commitment on the part of this government to address the crisis 
in our largest city and in all cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has responded and it is responding 
enthusiastically to those issues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have this opportunity to speak to the second 
reading stage of Bill C-66, an act to amend the National Housing 
Act and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act. Although 
our party is opposed to the amendments to these two acts, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity because the issue of housing and 
social housing is a very important fundamental issue in Canada 
that affects millions of Canadians and regrettably it rarely gets 
debated in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the government member said a few moments ago, 
the amendments will not in any way improve or increase the supply 
of affordable, not for profit social housing in Canada.  This 
bill will pave the way for the further privatization of social 
housing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that point of view this is a very sad day for Canada 
because historically Canada has played a very positive and 
innovative role in the provision of social housing right across 
the country.  We have tremendous expertise and skill at a 
community level in the not for profit housing sector in 
developing resources and in the construction and development of 
social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, all of that has pretty well come to a standstill 
because of policies implemented by the Liberal government since 
1993 to basically trash social housing in Canada. Regrettably the 
debate today is simply nothing more than one more nail in the 
coffin of social housing and affordable housing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in question period I asked the Prime Minister why in a 
meeting with the mayor of Toronto yesterday about what is a 
disaster in that city and across the country on homelessness, the 
Prime Minister had nothing more to offer the mayor of Toronto 
than a cold beer. 
There was no offer of funding for social housing.  There was no 
offer of a national action plan for social housing.  There was no 
offer of new social housing units or help for people who are 
living on the street, and yes, dying on the street as well.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we heard today from the government was that it is thinking 
about it, it is studying it and in fact it has already done a 
lot.  The reality is that we have a crisis in this country, not 
only in the city of Toronto, but in just about every major urban 
community and in smaller communities as well because the federal 
government abandoned the provision and the construction of social 
housing in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make no mistake about that.  There is a direct 
relationship between increasing homelessness, what we now see, 
even here in the city of Ottawa, what I see in my own riding of 
Vancouver East, what I saw in the city of Halifax and in other 
communities across Canada, and the policy decisions that were 
made by the finance minister in 1993 to axe social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that I think it is an absolute disgrace.  I think 
that Canadians understand intuitively that housing is a basic 
human need.  It is a human right that is laid out in the 
universal declaration of human rights, and yet here in Canada we 
have no provision to ensure that this basic human need is being 
met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that the Toronto disaster relief committee has 
repeatedly called on the Prime Minister to visit this disaster 
area to see for himself what is taking place on the streets of 
Toronto.  When I visited the city of Toronto, I visited the 
emergency shelters and saw the appalling conditions that people 
are living in.  When I talked to people on the street it was 
really very shocking to learn what people are facing in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who form what is called the Toronto disaster relief 
committee have put together a very urgent call that has actually 
been endorsed by the 10 big city mayors across Canada, including 
the mayor of my own city, the city of Vancouver, and the city 
council.  What the Toronto disaster relief committee is calling 
for is simply this, that there needs to be a 1% commitment to the 
provision of social housing in Canada by all levels of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would hope and one would have expected that there would be a 
response from the federal government, that there would be some 
kind of indication that there is an acknowledgement and a 
recognition of the disaster that is before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would hope that there would be an acknowledgement of the 
work that was done on the Golden report in the city of Toronto, 
which was actually funded by the federal government, and that 
indeed there would even be some kind of response to that report. 
There was even a Liberal member on the task force.  However, 
there has been deafening silence on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not seen one cent come forward for the provision of 
social housing.  We had one small announcement saying that there 
would be additional funds for residential rehabilitation. 
However, I have to say that the Minister of Public Works, in 
making that announcement, really was just making a drop in the 
bucket in terms of the very critical situation that is facing us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government keeps on telling us that it is no longer 
in this business.  In fact the bill that is before us today to 
amend the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation Act is really going further down this path of 
the federal government offloading and abandoning its 
responsibility to Canadians in this area.  In fact what we have 
seen is the federal government trying to download and devolve its 
housing responsibility to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to say that in the province that I come from, British 
Columbia, we have been resisting this devolution and we have been 
saying consistently that the federal government has to have a 
national responsibility for the provision of housing.  Yes, there 
needs to be a partnership with the provinces.  Yes, we need to 
have the involvement of the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities.  In fact the federation is begging the federal 
government to come back to the table and to get involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province alone, because of the loss of federal dollars, 
because of the abandonment of social housing by this Liberal 
government, we have lost something like 10,000 units that would 
otherwise have been built if the program, as it existed in 1993, 
was still in place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we add the numbers and multiply them across Canada, on a 
very conservative estimate we have lost 75,000 social housing 
units in Canada that would have been built if those programs were 
still in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is a very bad day.  Instead of facing that reality, 
instead of taking on the responsibility and saying that we will 
meet this human need, we will make sure there is adequate, safe, 
secure, affordable housing for Canadians, what is the federal 
government doing?  It brings in this bill.  It claims that this 
will improve housing for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read the press release from the Minister of Public Works who 
said that these amendments will better respond to the housing 
needs of Canadians.  Where is the evidence?  There is not a shred 
of evidence to show that will take place if this piece of 
legislation and these amendments pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is about privatizing the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation, privatizing certain provisions of its 
policies and practices and further commercializing the way CMHC 
operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the situation where CMHC insurance and mortgages were 
guaranteed by the federal government.  As a result of very large 
corporations in the U.S. challenging us under the NAFTA and other 
international trade provisions, the Liberal government is now 
capitulating and saying that those types of assurances will no 
longer be provided.  Therefore, people who unfortunately are 
considered to be high risk by the marketplace and our financial 
institutions will now be in greater difficulty, even through 
CMHC, because they will not have the same access they had before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important debate.  We are talking about a very basic 
issue that does not often arise for debate in this House.  I am 
glad we are debating it.  However, I also want to say that we in 
the New Democratic Party are appalled and outraged that the 
Liberal government has gone so far from its own platform and 
commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can hear the words in my head of a Liberal member of 
parliament, now the finance minister, who in 1990, as the chair 
of a Liberal task force on housing, said that it was 
reprehensible in a society as rich as Canada that we would have 
an erosion of social housing and a growing gap between the rich 
and the poor.  That is what the finance minister, then an 
opposition member of parliament, said in 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to government members that this bill is not what we need. 
This piece of legislation is not what Canadians need.  We need to 
be responding to the very dire circumstances of the people who 
are living and dying on the streets today in Toronto, in my 
community of Vancouver east and in the downtown east side where 
6,000 people are still living in deplorable conditions.  These 
people are living in substandard housing, in rooms that are ten 
feet by ten feet, with no washroom facilities.  They have no 
cooking facilities and they have to share a broken washroom down 
the hall with 25 other people.  That is what people are facing in 
this country.  It is something that none of us should be 
tolerating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want a response from this government that will improve and 
make clear that there is a commitment for social housing in this 
country, that will use the expertise that has been developed at 
the grassroots level and in the not for profit housing sector and 
that will encourage the development of co-operative housing in 
Canada that has been so incredibly successful.  Since 1993 no new 
co-operative housing units have been built.  That is absolutely 
shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are opposed to these amendments today because they are taking 
us in the direction of the further privatization of social 
housing in Canada.  The amendments basically undermine the 
programs we have had in the past and further abandon the federal 
government's response and responsibility to providing housing for 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members of this House, particularly Liberal members, to 
rethink the provisions of the amendments that are before us 
today.  If we are genuine about our care and support for homeless 
people, for poor people, for people who live in substandard 
housing and for people who are paying more than 50% of their 
income for rent, then we should be defeating these amendments. 
We should be trying to get back to a national housing strategy. 
We should support the call from the Toronto disaster relief 
committee for a 1% commitment for social housing in this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member referred to the Golden report, the task force on 
homelessness in Toronto.  I want to share with her a couple of 
facts from that report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the total homeless, 28% were youth, 70% of whom had been 
physically or sexually abused; 15% were aboriginal persons; 10% 
were abused women; and 30% were mentally ill persons.  That 
totals 83% of total homelessness in Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one looks at those items with regard to youth, clearly the 
government has invested substantially in youth initiatives, youth 
employment strategies, education programs and all kinds of 
different programs.  Therefore, I believe the member's assertion 
that the government has done nothing with regard to homelessness 
is incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to aboriginals, it is the same.  The member will 
know the substantial investment that the Canadian government 
makes to our aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of abused women is primarily under provincial 
jurisdiction, as is the issue of the mentally ill.  However, the 
member well knows that there has been a substantial increase in 
the moneys available for health care to address these issues. 
This is where the government's participation is, in front-line 
health care for the mentally ill and for those in need, et 
cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the member also knows about the RRAP, the 
additional funding for rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should also know that the government puts forward 
about $2,500 per unit for CMHC housing and about $3,500 per unit 
for rent geared to income housing.  Those are government 
contributions to deal with social housing.  This shows an ongoing 
commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She also talks about the poor.  She should know that 40% of the 
people who are poor, according to Statistics Canada's low income 
cutoff, own their own house, and of those half of them have no 
mortgage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should know these facts because it is very important 
to understand what is homelessness and its causes, as well as 
what is poor and who is poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been a director for five years of the Peel Regional 
Housing Authority, which managed social housing, we found that 
half of the units that were available to us were family units, 
and of those more than three-quarters were mother-led. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the member agrees that the breakdown of the Canadian 
family is one of the most significant contributors, not only to 
homelessness and the need for social housing in Canada, but also 
to poverty in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there were a lot of 
questions posed in the member's comments.  If what the member 
says is correct, that there are youth programs, programs for 
aboriginal people and employment programs, I would not agree 
because I think those programs are very inadequate.  However, let 
us assume that they are there and that they are adequate.  That 
does not escape the reality that even with those programs we need 
to have a basic necessity in place, which is housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to young people in emergency shelters in Halifax.  They 
were involved in youth programs and counselling.  However, when 
they go through those programs, if they do not have an adequate, 
safe, secure and affordable place to live, then all of those 
programs become meaningless.  I have seen that time and time 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not necessarily disagree with what the member is saying. 
Those other programs are also critical.  However, if we are 
dealing someone who is facing drug addiction or someone who is 
dealing with issues around mental illness, yes they need social 
support and the programs, but if they do not have a decent place 
to live it is very difficult to go to school.  It is impossible 
to go to work. 
It is really hard to raise kids in an environment without 
housing.  I hope the member understands that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of his involvement with the Peel Regional Housing 
Authority and the fact that there are a lot of single parent 
families in housing, we could have another debate about what 
causes family breakup.  The fact is that families are living in 
poverty and high unemployment places a lot of stress on families. 
We must ensure that there is adequate housing and that people do 
not spend more than 30% of their income on housing.  That is very 
important. Unfortunately, this bill does not address that in any 
shape or form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is taking us down the road of privatization.  It is 
taking us down the road of abandoning people's needs.  I think 
the member would agree. I ask the member to defend how this bill 
is improving the housing needs of Canadians.  Having looked at 
it, I cannot see one sentence that will do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am saddened when members of parliament 
particularly from that party see no good in what the government 
has done.  They are prone to exaggeration of nothingness. I 
remember having attended a few events in Winnipeg where I 
delivered federal government funding for social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, would the member agree that the meeting on 
homelessness between Mayor Lastman and the Prime Minister was 
important? Would she agree that the pledge of the Prime Minister 
to attend the summit on homelessness in Toronto on March 25 is 
significant?  Would she agree that it is significant that 
health-related homelessness could be addressed by the $11.5 
billion transferred through the CHST? I hope that she would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the situation in Winnipeg, I visited Winnipeg.  I saw 
communities that were completely devastated because housing was 
abandoned and there were no funds to rehabilitate the houses in 
the north end of Winnipeg.  A consequence of the public policy 
decision that was made by the member's government is affecting 
the member's constituents and the people of Winnipeg like other 
cities across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I agree that the meeting with the mayor of Toronto was very 
important.  But why was the meeting required in the first place? 
Why did the mayor of Toronto have to come here hand in glove and 
beg for funds to meet the disaster that is happening in Toronto 
and elsewhere? Why has the Prime Minister not gone to the city of 
Toronto to view the disaster?  That is the question I would like 
to ask the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in Toronto is really bad. People are dying on the 
streets.  And it is not just in Toronto, it is across Canada. 
The Golden report clearly pointed that out.  To this date, we 
have not had a response from any Liberal member or from the Prime 
Minister as to what is going to be done to enact the Golden 
report, or more than that, to deal with the situation across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there will be an emergency conference in Toronto at the end 
of the month.  I am glad that it will take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This entire disaster could have been prevented had the federal 
government continued its provision of funding social housing 
since 1993; 75,000 units have been lost.  That is why we are 
seeing more people on the streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the money that was announced in the budget, it is 
Liberal members who are saying that it is going to health care. 
I would argue that housing is a health care issue.  They should 
be looking at housing as a health care issue.  Good housing is a 
basic determinant of health.  I encourage the member to do that. 
By the government's own admission, that $11.5 billion is going to 
health care which is also in a crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, where is the money for housing?  Where is the commitment 
to meet this very important social need?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to Bill C-66, amendments dealing with the 
National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank my hon. colleague from Kelowna who this 
morning so aptly described the history, the background and many 
of the concerns surrounding this bill and CMHC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nature of housing covers a broad range of topics.  It would 
be impossible for any of us to fully cover them in such a short 
period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that every Canadian needs to have adequate 
housing.  Many people suffer today from a lack of adequate 
housing.  Tragically, many are faced with the prospect of no 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully, there are many private and non-profit organizations. 
One I have had limited involvement with is the Habitat for 
Humanity organization which takes resources in local communities 
through private donations and mobilizes community resources to 
provide housing for people who probably could not get it 
otherwise. Although these kinds of organizations do not solve all 
the problems, they solve many problems.  With the right 
legislation, they probably could solve the majority of housing 
problems in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Housing means many different things to many different people. 
For those who can afford adequate housing, it may mean home 
improvements, care and pride and working to make their living 
space better for them. For those who cannot afford adequate 
housing, the thought of owning a house is just a dream.  It puts 
a whole new meaning to the term dream house, does it not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that people are not able to have adequate housing?  Is 
it that we lack the physical resources of building materials?  It 
does take a lot of cement, brick or wood, gyproc and nails, et 
cetera to build a house.  However, we know this is not the major 
source of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding has a large resource base of timber.  There are parts 
of my riding where we can stand on a mountaintop, look in every 
direction and see nothing but tree covered mountains. I know that 
sounds beautiful and perhaps those who are from the east have no 
idea what that is like.  I do miss that kind of view when I am on 
Parliament Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know we have the available timber to build houses. There are 
many loggers and mill workers in my riding who wished everyone 
was building a lot more houses.  They would love to get back to 
work.  Many of them are having difficulties paying for their own 
houses as they have been idle for far too long. We also know we 
have sufficient quantities of all the other materials to build as 
many houses as we need in this country. Neither do we lack 
expertise or labour force to build them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What holds people back from finding suitable housing?  It most 
often comes down to one factor:  affordability, money, making 
ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the simplest ways to alleviate this problem is for the 
government to leave more money in the hands of the taxpayers to 
begin with.  Let us end things like bracket creep.  Let us index 
the tax rates.  Let us end the discrimination between single and 
dual income families in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are all things that this government has had a chance to do 
but has chosen to ignore.  Somehow the Liberals think it is 
easier to ignore the plight of those who have taxes hung around 
their necks like a millstone than to make fundamental changes in 
the way government operates to ensure that taxpayers truly 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want more than just tinkering by this government, yet 
this government just does not seem to get it.  It sends a task 
force out west to find out why voters do not vote for the 
Liberals.  I want to make a prediction.  I predict that when the 
task force returns, they still will not understand.  Canadians 
are intelligent people.  What they simply want is good 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is not looking for interference and intervention by 
government in their day to day lives.  There are models and 
examples which show that when government gets out of the way of 
business, business can grow and expand at a rate far faster than 
the government could have thought possible. 
When government gets in the way, the public loses. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example of government interference, I just have to think 
back to my home province.  The Insurance Corporation of British 
Columbia has had a government controlled monopoly on vehicle 
insurance for many years.  What is the result of that? When I 
moved from Alberta to B.C., what it meant to me was a doubling of 
my insurance rate.  So much for government interference in the 
workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a counterbalance, the past several years in Alberta have seen 
dramatic changes in the ways that the provincial government has 
extricated itself from many day to day transactions.  The net 
result is that private enterprise now operates many of the 
services previously under government jurisdiction. My knowledge 
of this is that the revised system is working, and it is working 
well.  What a concept.  How novel.  Government that lets the 
people move ahead with the business operations day by day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can break the category of money shortfalls into a couple of 
different sections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who although working and bringing in an income 
are simply not able to finance the type of housing they need. 
These are the people, perhaps single, perhaps a couple, who work 
hard but at the end of the month, the extra dollars just are not 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another category of people are those who face financial 
shortfalls.  It may be a single parent who is trying to raise 
children, work a full time job and still cope with life. It may 
be a family that has faced unemployment for a prolonged period of 
time and cannot get the needed break. It may be the homeless 
person we see on the streets of most of our urban centres.  These 
are the people who need some form of assistance that often seems 
unavailable to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I do not adhere to all of the theories and beliefs of 
Abraham Maslow and his hierarchy of needs, he made a very strong 
argument for people and their psychological needs.  He theorized 
that people could not move on to other things in their lives 
until their physical needs were met. Personally I believe there 
needs to be a strong spiritual component in order to make life 
here on earth fulfilling and many people forget that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I understand what Mr. Maslow was trying to say in this 
regard.  He is saying it is difficult for mankind to grow, mature 
and contribute back to society if every day is such a struggle 
that people feel they have to fight their way through daily life. 
I understand how that can work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example I can think of is when we have a loved one who is 
sick.  I do not know about others but I find I am thinking about 
that person continuously, so much so that some of the other 
things in life just do not seem to matter as much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is with those who struggle to get adequate housing, always 
trying to put enough aside to get the down payment and they just 
cannot seem to make it.  The need to find a safe place to sleep 
and rest will occupy much of their waking moments.  Only when 
that need is met will they be able to move on to fulfilling other 
parts of their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ought to be careful here.  There is a difference between 
needs and desires in human life.  I believe that those who are 
living on the street need housing.  There are others who would 
desire better housing but continue to live in their present 
accommodation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can be done for those who are not able to find housing that 
meets their physical needs yet remain affordable for them and 
their families?  One would hope that a bill such as Bill C-66 
might be of some help to them.  Let us take a look at some of the 
attributes of the bill and determine if it meets the needs of 
this stakeholder group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the purpose of Bill C-66 is to redefine the roles 
and responsibilities of the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation, particularly in relation to mortgage loan insurance 
and export and international support. There are a number of 
things within the bill that should be looked at in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the questions I have with any legislation is whether or 
not it will be good for the free marketplace.  In other words, 
how will the small business owner in my riding of 
Nanaimo—Cowichan benefit by the bill?  Or will the bill simply 
add one more layer of bureaucracy, of administrative nightmare 
which we will all be faced with as we attempt to find, grow and 
build our niche in the business world?

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The least amount of government in the face of business is always 
the best.  My read of the bill shows that CMHC will enter into 
competition with the private sector.  Is the role of government 
to compete with the private sector? I sincerely hope not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of clauses that cause me concern in the bill. 
The first is clause 16 which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Corporation may provide protection against the effects of 
changes in interest rates for housing loans. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the face of it, the protection of homeowners against sharp 
rises in interest rates is admirable.  There appears to be a 
certain amount of ambiguity, however, in this clause with regard 
to the protection of banks from losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that the current wording leaves the clause open 
to potential abuse by financial institutions.  There is no 
indication in the guidelines under which proposed clause 16 would 
be used.  The hows and the whys are always important and they are 
not outlined in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second concern is clause 6 which deals with the ability of 
CMHC to determine whether or not an approved lender is 
financially sound.  Guidelines need to be in place to prevent 
CMHC from conducting business with a financial institution that 
is not financially stable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own life I would not make an investment in a business that 
I do not think will make it.  I would not put my money in a bank 
that I think will fail.  The details of how and when CMHC would 
be made aware that the lender is no longer financial sound are 
lacking in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These concerns are examples of details that are currently 
lacking.  We cannot allow the passage of the bill without these 
kinds of details being sorted out.  Canadians do not want the 
government to simply sign any more blank cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of the federal government dealing in housing is a 
matter that causes me concern.  This is an area of exclusive 
jurisdiction for provincial authorities.  The provinces are in a 
better position to determine the type and volume of housing 
necessary for their locales.  To add bureaucracy only increases 
costs with government interference.  It does nothing to ensure 
housing for those who really require it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government should not be in the business of competing in the 
private sector.  I have said it before, I say it now, and I would 
say it again.  The housing market is enormous.  There are 
non-public mechanisms in place which could best serve the 
interest of a broad range of the public.  I agree and support the 
principle that Canadians should have access to affordable 
financing to acquire housing.  I support competition in the 
private sector for the provision of mortgage insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet housing is a severe problem for a portion of Canadian 
society.  For many, the problem would be better solved through 
less government interference.  The biggest form of government 
interference is the tax grab into so many Canadian wallets. Every 
Canadian would be better served by having government reduce the 
tax burden.  Surely even members of the government would agree 
with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us eliminate bracket creep that has taken billions of 
dollars out of the hands of Canadians.  Let us eliminate the 
disparity of unfair taxation between single and dual income 
families.  The numbers bear this out.  Leaving money in the hands 
of Canadians is a far better solution to major portions of the 
housing problem in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleagues and I have raised a number of very pertinent 
questions.  I would leave the House with one final suggestion. Do 
the changes introduced through Bill C-66 resolve the questions 
and issues raised throughout this debate?   Unfortunately my 
answer is that I do not think so.  We can do better than what 
Bill C-66 is attempting to do.  Hopefully amendments at committee 
stage will make it easier to support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am not sure whether the member heard my earlier comments in 
reference to the Toronto situation when I gave some statistics. 
Very briefly the make-up of the homeless in Toronto as a result 
of the Anne Golden report was 28% youth who have been alienated 
from their families, 15% aboriginals, 10% abused women and 30% 
who are mentally ill. 
None of them were as a result of economic deprivation.  Some 83% 
of them are a result of what would normally be termed health and 
social problems.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked an rhetorical question in his speech about what 
the bill would do for the people of Nanaimo—Cowichan.  I want to 
share with the member another statistic from the Golden report, 
that 47% of the homeless in Toronto do not come from Toronto. 
They come from all across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of the line from the movie <I>Field of Dreams</I>: 
“If you build it they will come”.  In fact Toronto built it. It 
built up a social housing bank.  It provided all kinds of support 
services for the homeless which attracted people from across 
Canada.  The same has been experienced in other centres like 
Winnipeg, Calgary, Montreal, et cetera.  Major centres are 
attracting people who need help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's question is very relevant, the rhetorical question 
about how the bill helps Nanaimo—Cowichan.  It would appear 
there are no necessary services or no supports for those who have 
these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member really believe that the provinces would be 
better able to do it?  If the provinces were trying to save some 
dollars they would not provide the supports at all.  They would 
let them all go to Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that communities have to start investing in their 
people and in their families.  When people have these kinds of 
health and social problems, it is up to all of us to identify 
them and to provide those needs so they do not become homeless as 
a consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for that observation and question.  He is certainly right in 
terms of getting to the root cause of poverty and displacement in 
society which makes inadequate housing a symptom of the problem 
rather than the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a strong believer in community action, in local communities 
taking hold of local problems.  Government has a role to play in 
this but it is not the major player.  I do not see, in answer to 
the member's question, that the bill has any effect upon the 
particular concern he has raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be doing things in our communities, fostering the 
kind of community spirit that will help people get off welfare 
and find jobs and take a fresh look at their lives so they do not 
end up on the streets and move from community to community 
following free housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the hon. member's comments and take them under 
great advisement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I also 
thank my hon. colleague across the way for his question to my 
colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go one step further.  We need to recognize the 
differences between social housing and public housing and 
homelessness.  The characteristics of the homelessness are rather 
different from other kinds of housing that need to be provided 
for people suffering from mental health, drug addiction or 
convergent addictions.  Maybe there comes a point where we need 
to separate homelessness which has all kinds of causes that are 
quite different from low income, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague like to say something about what has happened 
in society that puts all of them into one category: the poor 
fellow or gal who has a convergent addiction problem with drugs, 
alcohol or whatever the case might be, and the person on 
employment insurance or with an inadequate income?  Those are not 
the same kinds of problems.  If we simply took one size fits all, 
one solution fits all, would that really help the situation?  I 
wonder if the hon. member would like to comment on that point.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
from Kelowna for that observation and question.  I suspect that 
one reason this has happened in society is the preponderance in 
government at every level to look upon itself as big brother 
knows best.  This is the philosophy that exists among governments 
today.  When that kind of philosophy gets going through 
government and starts to permeate society, certain segments of 
society will naturally become dependent upon government for every 
aspect of their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government takes an approach to people which lumps them together 
in this regard.  It is unfortunate because it does not foster the 
entrepreneurial spirit we need to get us truly working again in 
every aspect of our lives.  We can do this if we start to work at 
it ourselves.  There are agencies and people who will help, but 
in the final analysis we are the ones who have to do the job, 
take care of our lives and are responsible for that.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL HOUSING ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK242">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-66, an 
act to an act to amend the National Housing Act and the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act and to make a consequential 
amendment to another act, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very happy to be involved in the debate on Bill C-66 which deals 
with the very critical issue of housing, something that we 
believe has been left behind in national debates and has not had 
the attention it truly deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is probably the only developed nation in the world that 
does not have a national housing strategy.  This is shameful.  We 
are feeling the impact of it now in our cities, in our rural 
communities and in our northern communities.  We are seeing the 
predictable consequences of not having any strong national 
standards or strong national plan in terms of providing clean, 
affordable housing for Canadians who cannot take part in the 
mainstream of the real estate market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just heard the member for Nanaimo—Cowichan advocating 
strongly that this matter should be left to the free market, that 
if we let industry take care of it without government 
interference the market will take care of itself and provide an 
adequate number of units to meet the needs of people all over the 
country.  If we take a serious look around, I would argue that is 
clearly not the case.  We have failed the people waiting for 
clean, affordable housing by leaving it up to the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not blaming the private sector.  I am merely pointing out 
that in some marketplaces, like my own riding of Winnipeg Centre, 
it is simply not economically viable to get involved in low 
income housing as a private landlord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Landlords have been making representation to provincial 
governments and the federal government saying that this is so, 
that they simply cannot make a buck on it because of aging 
housing stock and the amount of rents they can charge.  It just 
does not add up.  Frankly they have been letting it go. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is a ghettoization in the inner city of Winnipeg. I 
am not proud of this but the riding I represent has terrible 
aging, crumbling housing stock with landlords who no longer want 
it.  One of our biggest problems is that these landlords cannot 
turn a buck on it.  They cannot afford to pay for the necessary 
renovations so the houses are catching fire.  There have been 85 
fires in the last 3 months in a 12 square block area, 85 arsons 
in the last 3 months.  This is an urgent situation.  It is 
not a safe situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason we know it is arson and not some coincidence is when 
the firemen come to put the fire out, they find big holes cut in 
the first and second floors to allow the convection of the smoke 
and the flames in order to more seriously level the house rather 
than just damage it.  It is a real hazard for the firemen who 
walk in and cannot see their hands in front of their faces for 
the smoke and who are then faced with four square foot holes cut 
in the floors. It is my feeling landlords are giving kids $50 and 
an address on a piece of paper and saying torch this house 
because it is a burden and a liability to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the desperation the private sector has found itself in 
in terms of trying to provide affordable housing in that market. 
As a result we have thousands of families that would happily move 
into some kind of social housing project within the city of 
Winnipeg.  We have literally thousands on the registry looking 
for housing.  It is not being built.  It is not going up anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another issue on which I think we are missing the boat. 
As a carpenter by trade I have built a lot of houses.  I have 
built a lot of houses in the riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan, the 
riding of the last speaker.  We all know what an engine for 
economic growth it is to have a healthy construction industry. 
There is a pent up demand for thousands and thousands of units. I 
do not have to go through the details of how many jobs that would 
entail, not just the actual trades people but all the building 
materials that go into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1980s under Mulroney the Tory government pulled the 
rug out from underneath what we used to think of as the co-op 
housing program and other social housing initiatives.  Had we not 
allowed that to happen and had the Liberals not allowed it to 
carry on, we would have built 75,000 more units in the country. 
That is the prediction.  That is the pent up deficit.  We got 
shortchanged by the 75,000 units of clean affordable housing that 
would have been built in our inner cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk more about the need in my riding of Winnipeg Centre. 
A group of neighbours formed a housing co-op to try to take care 
of my own street.  This was not because we needed housing since 
we all owned our own homes.  We wanted to buy up some of the slum 
properties on my street and either tear them down or renovate 
them and put them back into the hands of families that needed 
them.  We called ourselves the Ruby Housing Co-Op since we were 
on Ruby Street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did the research on one of the units we were trying to tear 
down and found out who the people really were and what kind of 
business it really was.  The guy who owned this property owned 
250 other units all through numbered companies and all through 
rings of other slum landlords to the point where one landlord 
might subcontract 10 units from the parent slum landlord.  The 
landlord might owe the parent landlord $1,000 per month per unit 
and be able to keep the rest.  The onus is on the landlord to 
stuff that slum unit full of so many welfare people that the 
landlord will get more than $1,000 and the profit is the 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a house on our street zoned R2T. You are allowed to have 
a duplex or transition, but a duplex at best.  There were 17 
units stuffed into a house rated R2T.  To get to one person's 
bedroom you would have to walk through another person's bedroom. 
City welfare is paying for all these rooms. At $237 a month for 
each room times 17 rooms, he would be giving the slum landlord 
$1,000 and keeping the rest.  His main interest is just stuffing 
that place full of the most disreputable people you would ever 
want to meet, people who were our neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what motivated us to start doing some research and 
finding out who these people were.  I will not use the 
individual's name here but he is one of the wealthiest, well 
known businessman in the city and I have every reason to believe 
that when he is at a cocktail party and someone asks him what he 
does for a living he says he is in real estate.  He does not say 
he is a slum landlord which is what he should say because we know 
how he makes his living.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not pointing at anybody in particular on the other bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some bright lights.  People are reacting to and 
dealing with the pent up shortage of housing in the inner city of 
Winnipeg.  The Lion's Club, to its credit, is buying up gang 
houses and crack houses in the inner city and putting training 
programs on for inner city welfare kids who then renovate these 
homes and put them back on the market at low interest loans.  It 
has been a good project.  We are dealing with one or two units at 
a time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is also my criticism of Habitat for Humanity.  Frankly, as 
much as I appreciate the volunteerism and all the goodwill, it is 
dealing with five or ten units at a time in a city that needs 
thousands of units.  If we put the same amount of energy and 
volunteerism into lobbying for a social housing program through 
the federal government maybe we would be putting 500 units a year 
into the city, or 2,000 units a year, somewhere at least 
reasonably close to the actual need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is not just limited to the inner city of Winnipeg, 
although, as I say this, donut shaped city phenomenon is 
certainly happening to us as it is happening to other major 
cities.  They are building good quality homes in the suburbs and 
going through all the cost of delivering services to those high 
end homes while letting the inner city rot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inner city is burning, frankly.  It looks like the late 
1960s in American cities.  It is like burn baby, burn.  These 
people are torching their homes out of desperation.  It is Watts, 
Detroit or something.  That is what it looks like.  Every night 
these people are voicing their discontent by torching houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to hear the Reform Party member say that 
government has no role to play here.  In this example one would 
have to be ideologically driven with blinders on to even intimate 
that government has no role to play in at least setting the stage 
to provide for clean affordable housing for people who live in 
this country.  It is a basic right.  We have just heard the 
member for Vancouver East speak very passionately about the 
United Nations declarations while recognizing the plight of 
homeless people as a national disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud that our housing critic, the member for 
Vancouver East, toured the country recently and went to just 
about every major city and wrote a very good report on her 
findings on homelessness and substandard housing.  That was the 
theme and it was not just people with no homes whatsoever, it was 
clearly about people living in inadequate housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the front page of the report I will read a brief quote.  I 
think she made reference to it in her remarks.  It was written by 
the finance minister when he was in opposition.  It was the way 
he felt when he was lambasting the Tory government for its woeful 
inadequacy in addressing this problem: “The government sits 
there and does nothing.  It refuses to apply the urgent measures 
that are required to reverse this situation.  The lack of 
affordable housing contributes to and accelerates the cycle of 
poverty, which is reprehensible in a society as rich as ours”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an excellent quote.  I could not have said it better 
myself because a lack of adequate housing is both a cause and a 
consequence of poverty.  It is one of those things that comes at 
us from both ends.  We do not have to go through all the social 
aspects of adequate housing but we can imagine a young family 
trying to get on its feet or trying to keep kids on a straight 
and narrow direction if they grow up in absolute desperation in 
terms of their housing situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised this in the past.  There is a group in Winnipeg 
called Rossbrooke House.  It is a safe house for inner city 
street kids. They can drop in and have some place to hang out 
where they are not at risk or getting into trouble.  It is run by 
two catholic nuns, Sister Leslie and Sister Bernadette.  They do 
a wonderful job.  The member for Vancouver East and I visited the 
safe house as part of the study.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things pointed out to us was that the people who live 
in that area in often terribly substandard housing will not sleep 
in the outer rooms of their house.  They will sleep only in the 
inner rooms of their house like the den or the living room 
because of the gunfire every night.  They will not sleep next to 
an outside wall.  These two sisters pointed this out to us as 
being the reality people in that neighbourhood live with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I raise this is the biggest challenge they have in 
trying to deal with the problem youth who come through their 
doors is making them feel safe somewhere.  One cannot work with a 
kid if that kid does not feel safe and trusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These kids all exhibit physical characteristics that are common 
among people who never feel safe wherever they are. If they are 
at home with a substance abuse parent they never know if they 
will get hugged or swatted on the head. They are insecure about 
that.  When they are on the street they are not safe so they are 
always spinning around looking to see if someone is going to jump 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These kids have nervous ticks.  It is hyper acuteness and they 
are fearful of their environment.  I say this is largely due to 
the fact that even when they are at home, if it is not a secure 
setting, they can never relax.  It could be a 10 year old kid on 
pins and needles all the time.  These women work with these 
street kids who have these nervous characteristics that we see so 
often.  Their argument again is that housing is the second 
biggest problem in terms of rehabilitation of these kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved in this issue for quite some time, first as 
a carpenter building houses.  I know the value of the industry. 
I know a great deal about the technical side of housing, whether 
it is multifamily or single family units.  As the president of a 
housing co-op I have been actively engaged in trying to get the 
resources together to build clean, affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we should point out is nobody is asking for any handouts in 
this regard.  When social housing used to be built the numbers 
still had to crunch.  A business plan had to be put together to 
prove that the revenue coming in would meet the debt service to 
the loan.  The only favour the government would do was provide 0% 
down or 100% financing and it would be amortized over a longer 
period of time, maybe 35 years rather than 25 years. That is not 
some kind of handout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say here is $2 million, build 40 units of social 
housing.  The applicant group, usually an ethnic group or a group 
of like minded people who come together and put together a 
proposal to build social housing, has to sit down and crunch the 
numbers. It has to figure out the bridge financing, the hard 
costs of the construction, the soft costs and the debt servicing 
on the loan, add all those things together in a total package and 
find a rent people can afford and be able to meet the debt 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all gets paid back.  This was the beauty of CMHC's many 
housing programs that have been gutted and cut and offloaded to 
the provinces.  There was no kind of handout.  It was an 
empowering kind of thing where citizens were taking their housing 
needs into their own hands and learning about running a business 
plan and executing the actual building of this project and then 
managing it for many years afterwards with some kind of tenant 
association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very positive thing.  It is a very community building 
thing.  It is not any type of government handout.  When I listen 
to the member for Nanaimo—Cowichan trying to make it sound that 
any kind of social housing is some kind of government handout, he 
clearly does not know a great deal about the programs that have 
been cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned that Bill C-66 will put the final nail in 
the coffin of any hope to have a national housing strategy.  We 
are very concerned that this pushes it just that much further to 
privatization of social housing.  Who knows what kind of free 
marketers will swoop in and take this over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen what happens when things turn bad, when profit 
motive is the only reason for doing something.  As soon as it is 
a little less than profitable, they turn their backs on it. These 
units are torched or they erode to the point where nobody should 
be living in these units.  It is a time honoured expression where 
I come from that capital has no conscience.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it.  It is the government's job to inject some 
conscience into the whole picture of providing social housing. 
Other countries such as Chile are leaps and bounds ahead of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not usually blow Chile's horn.  It is not my favourite 
place because of its checkered history, although it seems to have 
cleared that up.  It is building 200,000 units of social housing. 
It is nice that a Canadian company is signing contracts to build 
the first ones now.  It will move a whole plant down to Chile and 
use Canadian building materials such as drywall and shingles, the 
whole shooting match, as well as Canadian expertise and 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for that market for Canadian housing technology is 
that Chile has the vision to upgrade building stock. It realizes 
that over the years it has let it slide.  Free marketers were not 
providing the necessary units.  There will be a couple of 
thousand now and many more thousands next year, for a total of 
200,000 units of social housing for Chile.  In Canada it is zero. 
Since 1993 there has been nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an earlier intervention I mentioned the member of parliament 
I defeated in the riding of Winnipeg Centre.  He joined my 
housing co-op just to demonstrate that he was sensitive to the 
issue.  He was elected in 1988 and fought the Tories in their 
gutting and dismantling of the social housing system.  In 1993 
when it became a campaign promise he was a little taken aback, to 
be fair, that his government would not reintroduce any social 
housing.  That became abundantly clear as 1993-94 went by and 
nothing was being done.  From 1995-96 to this date all we have 
seen is a downward slide in this regard.  He was probably as 
disappointed as we were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My biggest insight into the condition of social housing in my 
riding was while knocking on doors for other candidates during 
the 1988, 1990 and 1993 federal elections and then in 1997 for my 
own campaign.  I could walk down the same streets and knock on 
the same doors and see the dramatic slide in the condition of the 
building stock.  There was no hope for property in that area. One 
could buy a pretty good little house for $10,000 to $15,000. It 
had no real value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a community is in decline like that it is very hard to pull 
it back up.  That is why no private sector housing initiative 
will be viable without social housing being introduced and 
managed by the federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to my hon. colleague's presentation, in which he quoted the very 
famous phrase “Capital has no conscience, capital has no 
morals”.  Members opposite should take this phrase down, so that 
everyone may reflect on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If capital has neither conscience nor morals, then people must 
think about people and respect one another.  The homeless are 
people too.  Perhaps they have more problems in their lives, 
sometimes since birth. 
We treat them a bit like a herd, very often we put them together 
in places that cost as little as possible, but we do not respect 
the human being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in 
1995, 117 heads of state and the 185 governments represented 
renewed their commitment not only to reduce poverty around the 
world, but also to eradicate it from the face of the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They undertook to pursue the elimination of poverty in the world 
through determined national action and international 
co-operation, “as an ethical, social, political and economic 
imperative”. 
Participating countries pledged to take national action to 
eliminate poverty within their boundaries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in Canada, what are we doing for those who suffer the most? 
I am under the impression that members opposite do not 
understand and do not listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Matapédia—Matane, which is a rural riding, there 
are many people waiting for housing units. This is the situation 
in 1999, not in 1979. In 1999, there are still people waiting 
for housing units. I find this completely inhuman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member could tell us how we could get our 
friends opposite to understand that capital is not everything, 
that human beings are also important, particularly those who are 
in dire straits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget states that those who earn $250,000 will save between 
$8,000 and $9,000 in taxes. Why is there nothing in the budget 
for the homeless? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could we, once and for all, make everyone in this House 
realize that there is a major problem as the year 2000 nears? 
Why not give ourselves one year to solve this problem to some 
extent? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for those 
very thoughtful remarks.  I can be quite brief in answer to the 
member's comments.  The whole issue seems to be about the 
redistribution of wealth.  That is as simple as I can state it. 
When we live in the richest and most powerful civilization in the 
history of the world, it is very difficult to excuse the huge 
division and the huge inconsistencies in the distribution of 
wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simplest and the best way I can put it is when I was 
visiting Washington, D.C., Reverend Jesse Jackson once spoke to a 
group of carpenters.  He had a way of trying to articulate this 
difference.  He said, I think it went this way: “If you have 
five children and only three pork chops, the solution is not to 
kill two of the children”.   Right-wingers and people like the 
members opposite would probably tell us that the solution is to 
cut those three pork chops into five equal pieces.  Then all the 
kids go to bed hungry because nobody has enough to eat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way that a socialist would review the problem would be to 
challenge the whole lie that there are only three pork chops and 
challenge the absolute baloney that there is not enough wealth to 
go around so that we can all enjoy a reasonable standard of 
living.  It is not about the amount of wealth in the country; it 
is about the distribution of wealth.  I thought Reverend Jackson 
had a very good way of pointing that out.  He has a real gift for 
communication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to housing it is not so much the distribution of 
wealth.  We have other ways of dealing with that in terms of fair 
wages and the opportunity of workers to get a reasonable reward. 
Social housing should not be stripped down strictly to monetary 
terms.  As I pointed out, most of the social housing programs, 
which were gutted by the Tories and then further gutted by the 
Liberals, did not require a huge cash outlay.  Nor did they 
necessarily require grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They needed some enabling measures so the people involved could 
finance their own projects, friendly financing. Zero per cent 
down was the big thing.  If one had a $2 million project to build 
a 40 unit social housing project, one had to come up with 25% 
down or a half million dollars. Those people do not have half a 
million dollars to put down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would underwrite them, giving 100% financing and 
a longer period of amortization, another thing we strongly 
recommend.  Seeing that the lifespan of a brand new project with 
modern technology is 50 to 70 years, it is not a risky business 
move to let these people have a 35 year mortgage rather than a 25 
year conventional mortgage. 
Those two things alone made the numbers crunch in both 
situations.  Having that ability is what made a deal viable. That 
is how most of the ethnic based seniors' homes such as the 
Filipino seniors home in my riding, groups of otherwise powerless 
individuals, people with no money and no resources, manage to 
build good quality housing, a really fine place that they can be 
proud of and in which to raise their kids.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not take a huge redistribution of wealth to embrace the 
idea of a national housing program.  We are not talking about 
anything radical or innovative.  We are just talking about 
catching up to where the rest of the world is already in terms of 
embracing the idea of clean, affordable housing as one of the 
rights of citizenship.  No one is talking about giving it free 
but about making it accessible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to Bill C-66, an act to amend the National 
Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act. 
The official opposition will oppose the bill unless we have 
clarification on certain elements and see certain amendments to 
the bill, some of which I want to speak about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier my colleague, the hon. member for Kelowna, the official 
opposition critic for public works and government services, spoke 
very eloquently about the bill and stated the position of the 
official opposition.  I hope my remarks add to his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize that there has been a steady erosion 
of federal funding support for new social housing, culminating in 
its virtual termination from 1994 onward. Effectively by 
disavowing the spirit and substance, if not the letter of its 
social housing agreements with provincial governments, the 
federal government was deliberately offloading its social and 
financial responsibilities on to the provinces and territories at 
a time when they could least afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the process, despite its commitment cited in the CMHC mandate 
to maintain the flow of affordable housing as part of the 
nation's social safety net obligations, the federal government 
has virtually gutted its new social housing programs, thus adding 
to the plight and suffering of homeless persons and inadequately 
sheltered households in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the purpose of the bill.  The purpose of the bill 
is to redefine the roles and responsibilities of Canada Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation, CMHC, in relation to mortgage loan 
insurance and to export and international support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us deal with housing financing.  The bill will enable CMHC 
to adjust its insurance and guarantee operations under the 
National Housing Act to help ensure the continuing availability 
of low cost financing to home buyers in all region of Canada, 
promote market competitiveness and efficiency, and contribute to 
the well-being of the housing sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments will give CMHC the necessary tools to compete 
effectively and fairly in the loan insurance marketplace.  They 
will simplify our National Housing Act by removing unnecessary 
restrictions and enable CMHC to respond quickly to shifts in 
consumer demand and market conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important because, as we know, since 1993 the Liberals 
have stopped funding new social housing projects.  They have 
caused Canada to be the only western nation that does not have a 
national housing policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia and Quebec are the only provinces pursuing a 
social housing policy.  We have a housing problem in the country. 
We have as many as 200,000 homeless people in Canada. Thousands 
and thousands of people do not have a place to live.  This is a 
tragedy in our nation that has so much prosperity everywhere.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many thousands of people are living in substandard housing. 
These Canadians are very uncomfortable.  They lack running taps 
with hot water.  They lack enough room for their children.  These 
are the people whose homes lack the appliances and furniture that 
would greatly improve their day to day lives and serve the needs 
of their young children.  Many Canadian mothers have no place for 
their families to live.  They miss the conveniences of, for 
example, a microwave oven.  Their children are hungry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is having us debate a bill that addresses 
mortgage loan insurance and facilities to export housing 
technology and to provide support for our housing industry as it 
takes on an international capacity.  Today we are debating 
housing, but it is amazing that we are not talking about the 
homelessness crisis in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how the Liberals can ignore homeless people and pass 
legislation dealing with mortgages and providing housing for 
people in foreign countries.  This would be a funny joke if it 
were not true.  There are about 200,000 Canadians who are 
considered homeless.  They are not worried about mortgage 
insurance, they are worried about homes and shelters in which 
they can live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to support the bill, but only with clarification and 
amendments.  However, it is very difficult to deal with the 
concerns of this bill given our country's housing crisis and 
homelessness crisis which we can even see a few blocks away from 
Parliament Hill.   We see it every day on our way to work and on 
our way home.  We feel that we are fortunate to have homes or, at 
least, hotel rooms or apartments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders if the Liberals can relate to the housing crisis. 
They are out of touch with the rest of Canadians.  They do not 
know about drug problems, refugee problems, immigration problems 
or the problems Canadians have paying taxes.  Even if they know, 
they do not deal with these problems properly because they do not 
know how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn to the second part of Bill C-66, which concerns 
export promotion.  These elements of the bill will expand export 
opportunities for Canada's housing industry by giving the CMHC 
broad authority to help Canadians sell their housing expertise to 
foreign countries, to participate in housing development and 
financial infrastructure projects and to better promote Canadian 
housing products and services abroad.  This is said to result in 
job opportunities for Canadians at home.  I doubt that, but let 
us take it at face value.  This is a good thing because Canadians 
are so heavily taxed that they cannot find jobs and we cannot 
create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal government policies have been killing jobs since 1993. 
Payroll taxes kill jobs.  Even if you have a job, the taxes you 
pay are unbelievable.  Paycheques are cut in less than half in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have copies of recent press releases from the Canada Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation which I can table if members want.  We 
can see the dire straits of our housing industry through the 
press releases.  It is no wonder the Liberals want to construct 
housing offshore.  Clearly they are not doing it inside our 
borders.  For example, as of February 11, 1999 residential 
construction was expected to stay at the same level as 1998. 
This is disappointing, particularly to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMHC is being given no direction from the minister to help 
his officials increase residential construction for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before becoming a member of parliament I was a real estate 
agent.  I can relate to how this is affecting homelessness.  I 
can relate to how first time homebuyers are facing problems. 
Construction of new housing units is actually dropping under this 
government, while the homelessness crisis is growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The housing crisis is getting worse, but the Liberals only want 
to help the CMHC build houses outside Canada.  Maybe the Liberals 
think they can do a good job helping the homeless in other 
countries.  They certainly have done a poor job in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a press release from the Infrastructure Works department, 
dated March 5, 1999.  I can table it if members want.  Backbench 
members of the government do not normally read Government of 
Canada press releases because they are told everything they are 
supposed to say by the Liberal Party whip, so those press 
releases become irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The press release I am talking about is entitled 
“Infrastructure Program funds Seniors' Housing Project in 
Brandon, Manitoba”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are infrastructure funds needed to build homes for seniors? 
Why can the private sector not provide those services?  The 
private sector can build homes.  Why does the government have to 
get into that business?  What lessons we learn when we read these 
kinds of press releases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are using our tax dollars to build seniors' homes, 
yet they are now trying to send our housing industry offshore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is enough work for the housing industry right here in our 
country where 200,000 people are homeless.  They do not know 
where to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize what Canadians want to see with 
respect to Bill C-66. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to see that the bill is effective and efficient and 
that there are real cost controls on what is being proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding efficiency, the bill is silent on administration. I do 
not see anything in the bill that talks about how it is to be 
administered.  The bill is silent on the relations the government 
intends to have with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding effectiveness, does the bill really help the banks and 
other financial institutions?  I cannot say that with confidence 
because I do not see anything in the bill which would do that. 
We need to know the details of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already know that Bill C-66 is not helping Canada's 
homelessness and housing crisis.  Therefore, we would like to be 
sure that it is really effective in terms of doing what it is 
supposed to be doing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the comments of the 
member for Surrey Central.  There is no question that all members 
of this House should be deeply concerned about the housing crisis 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently we heard from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities 
about the national disaster of homelessness, not just in Toronto, 
but in my own community in the lower mainland of British 
Columbia, in the greater Vancouver area and in many other parts 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know as well that this Liberal government has completely 
abdicated any leadership in the area of national housing 
strategy.  This is one of the only industrial countries in the 
world that has no national housing strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It used to be that Liberals believed in co-op housing.  There is 
not a penny in funding for new co-op housing in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It used to be that Liberals believed there was a federal role 
for housing for seniors, for students and others.  There is 
nothing at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know as well that the great market simply is not delivering 
affordable rental housing.  The federal Liberal government is 
silent on that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Reform member.  He said that he agrees 
that the Liberals are not doing what they should be in the area 
of housing.  He said that the Liberals should be doing more to 
support social housing and to tackle the plight of the homeless 
in our country.  Yet I read with great care the budget document 
that was prepared by the Reform Party before the government 
budget was tabled.  I looked everywhere.  I looked on the cover. 
I looked inside.  I looked on every page.  I looked on the back 
cover. There was not a single word, not one word, in the Reform 
Party's proposals to the Government of Canada about housing or 
about homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What planet is the hon. member on when he stands and rightly 
attacks the Liberal government for its failure to show leadership 
on housing when his own party is totally silent on the 
fundamentally important issue of federal support for housing? 
Why the double standard?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has been in 
the House for a much longer time than I, so I do appreciate the 
concern raised by him.  He knows very well that we have not 
formed the government yet, but when we do sit on the other side 
he will see a much more effective and efficient budget.  We want 
to have that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to look at our policies. I am happy that 
he has at least shown interest in our policies.  I hope that he 
will look at the policies of the united alternative movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not fully read our document.  If he had done that he 
would have seen what we are talking about.  We are talking about 
poverty in this country.  We are talking about high taxes in this 
country.  We are talking about creating jobs in this country. 
The unemployment rate in this country has been quite high 
compared to our neighbours.  The unemployment rate, particularly 
among youth, is very disappointing.  What is the motivation for 
youth to get jobs?  It is a vicious cycle in which we are living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When children are young, they worry and struggle.  When they go 
to school to get a better education they must be safe on the 
streets.  When children grow up they worry about getting a job. 
When they do get a job they worry about paying taxes.  When they 
get older they have to worry about their own families.  After 
that they have to worry about their pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to tackle this vicious cycle at a broader level.  I can 
assure the hon. member that when we form the government he will 
see effective and efficient results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try again 
with the hon. member because it is important for Canadians to 
understand clearly that the Reform Party made a written proposal 
to the Government of Canada with respect to what it said were its 
priorities and what it wanted the federal government to do.  In 
that list of Reform Party priorities there was not a word about 
housing or homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member stands and cries great crocodile tears 
about the fact that Liberals did not do anything about 
housing—and he is right in that criticism—how does he explain 
that his own party, the Reform Party, did not have any proposals 
whatsoever on housing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give him one last opportunity to fess up and acknowledge 
the error of Reform Party ways.  Will the hon. member tell this 
House now just how much money the Reform Party is suggesting the 
federal government put into a national housing plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, while the hon. member is 
wiping his crocodile tears, let me point out that Reform Party 
policies are policies with vision.  We are for lowering the taxes 
in this country which are the root cause of all our problems. 
The social safety net that we are getting from this government is 
damaging our health care system, elevating poverty, creating 
unemployment, homelessness and so on in this country.

<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure by now the crocodile tears will be dry and I will give 
the answer to the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Homelessness, poverty, unemployment, these are the byproducts of 
high taxes.  These are the side effects of high taxes.  We do not 
offer any band-aid solution.  We want to offer a permanent 
solution.  That is why we are asking for the taxes to be lowered. 
Taxes are killing jobs, creating poverty, unemployment, 
homelessness and all those things.  We are offering a permanent 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly believe people are not able to own a home unless jobs 
are created and unless the ability is created to earn the money 
to buy and live in a home.  I think the hon. member will see that 
the solution to the problem is creating the ability to own a 
home, creating jobs and lowering taxes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have children who are married and have families.  In all cases 
both parents are working, trying to struggle to make a living. 
They find it very difficult to buy their own homes.  They are all 
buying their own homes but it is very difficult because of the 
amount of money they are paying out in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be a better solution to the problem to cut taxes 
and leave more money in people's pockets so they can have the 
money at their discretion to do what they want with it, whether 
they want to rent or build or whatever? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is bang 
on.  That is the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us are homeless at one time when we leave our parents' 
home.  For us to get a home we have to have jobs.  Jobs can only 
be created when taxes are low.  We can create more jobs.  When 
taxes are high small businesses, the engine of the economy, feel 
the engine is smoking.  The engine is being derailed with high 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is right on.  The solution to the problem is 
lowering taxes.  Government members do not get it.  I plead with 
government members to lower taxes.  That is what we do in our 
policy.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I must 
tell you that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Yukon. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to speak to this bill, an act to amend the 
National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation Act. This bill does a number of things.  It is very 
important that we understand exactly what this bill does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill in amending the National Housing Act and the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act, gives more options to CMHC 
in carrying out its mandate, such as increased ability to enter 
joint ventures and the ability to offer more financing options to 
borrowers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill gives CMHC broad powers to set eligibility and other 
conditions for social housing grants. This broad discretionary 
power replaces the very detailed definitions and restrictions 
that have been laid out in the old act which causes us some 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill increases the ceiling of capital CMHC can control and 
gives the privy council the power to modify this ceiling through 
orders in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this bill commercializes, and take note of the word 
commercializes, CMHC's mortgage insurance function.  Any losses 
CMHC incurs from underwriting mortgages will come out of CMHC 
rather than the general government revenues.  CMHC would use a 
mortgage insurance fund to cover these losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Giving CMHC the ability to enter into joint ventures is the 
first step toward privatization of social housing.  This causes 
us great concern.  We see today this great trend toward 
privatization and we know that the bottom line in privatized 
ventures is usually profit. Usually privatization is aimed at 
profit, quite often to the sacrifice of the very important human 
values of compassion, affordability, accessibility and so forth. 
We have some concern about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We note that definitions such as those for “public housing 
project” and “eligible contribution recipient” are being taken 
from the act.  This opens the door for private for-profit 
corporations to be recognized as social housing providers. The 
statutory requirements that social housing be safe, sanitary and 
affordable are also being eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see along with the trend toward privatization the removal of 
standards which should apply to housing for Canadian citizens. 
This caused me great concern as well.  In the city of Halifax, 
and I am sure in many other cities across the country, there are 
many what we refer to as slum landlords.  People have properties 
that are really not fit for human habitation, yet they are 
renting out these properties to people who are in unfortunate 
circumstances, who are drawing social assistance.  Quite often 
people are living in wretched conditions.  They are unable to 
advance themselves beyond that state of housing. The move to 
privatization facilitates this.  We are very much concerned about 
that.  We would certainly be opposed to this bill because it 
enables that to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the commercialization of mortgage insurance. This 
is something that might have eventually been forced on CMHC by a 
NAFTA challenge from a foreign insurance provider. We know that 
the GE corporation, which has large interests in the insurance 
industry, has been lobbying the Liberal government for these 
changes to remove what it calls CMHC's “unfair competitive 
advantage”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that CMHC had a big advantage in providing financing 
to high risk borrowers such as low income people.  This was very 
necessary to enable people in less fortunate circumstances to 
have housing.  Removing this advantage will hamstring CMHC's 
ability to fulfil its mandate to provide mortgage insurance to 
people who need it, such as high risk customers that the banks 
will not touch, and people living in remote areas without the 
full range of financial services available to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes really concern us because we know that today there 
is a great problem with homelessness.  We also know that housing 
itself is a very basic human right.  It is right up there at the 
very top along with the right to food, clothing and medical care. 
Every woman, every child and every man in Canada has a right to 
live in decent, affordable, secure and safe housing.  This is a 
very important human right. 
The declaration of human rights in article 25(1) bears this out: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the 
health and well-being of himself and of his family, including 
food, clothing, housing and medical care—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we can look around today and see that homelessness, a very 
unnatural disaster, is present with us.  All I have to do is 
leave this place and walk down Rideau Street.  On my way home I 
pass by many homeless people, many people who through very 
unfortunate circumstances have no shelter, no place to rest at 
night, except on the cold streets in which they find themselves 
living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is true right across our country.  It is becoming more and 
more serious every day.  We see people dying on the streets. 
People without homes and without proper shelter are dying.  This 
is a very disturbing thing in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 100,000 Canadians are homeless.  Some find temporary 
beds in shelters. Thousands of others sleep on park benches or 
huddle in doorways for warmth.  Still thousands more live in 
ramshackle substandard housing in the urban core or on remote 
reserves.  Homelessness is a national emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The homeless are men, women and children. The streets and the 
cold do not discriminate against these people.  The government 
does.  The government has cut all funding for social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall in 1993 when I became the deputy minister for housing 
in the province of Nova Scotia, it was right around the time when 
the federal government had withdrawn its financial support for 
the social housing program.  Over the years it continued to get 
worse.  Eventually the federal government withdrew from social 
housing to the point of devolving all the responsibility to the 
provinces. In 1996 the government started downloading to various 
provinces. It has concluded downloading agreements with seven out 
of ten provinces, with B.C., Alberta and Ontario being the only 
holdouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a disturbing situation when our federal government does 
not accept any responsibility in the area of housing.  We hear 
from time to time the minister speaking about the various things 
that the government is “doing” in providing more money for 
grants, RRAP and programs of that nature, but this does not get 
to the core of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month members of our party took to the streets to find out 
what was actually happening.  We found that many people are 
homeless. The trip resulted in a very important report by one of 
our members who deals with these issues.  We gathered opinions of 
people on the streets who are making a difference, activists, 
local politicians, volunteers, people seeking refuge from the 
streets, people living in shelters, rooming houses or substandard 
housing on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our intent was to raise awareness, strengthen coalitions, 
present recommendations and to force the Minister of Finance to 
make housing a priority in the last federal budget, but this was 
not done.  There was no real commitment to the homeless. There 
was no real commitment to those people who are living on the 
streets without adequate shelter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until 1993 the federal housing program helped contribute to the 
stabilization of low income neighbourhoods through the 
development of social housing.  Regrettably, the Liberal 
government's retreat has meant that the vulnerable communities 
are increasingly defenceless with more and more people becoming 
homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize that homelessness is not something that 
happens in isolation.  Homelessness is very much connected with 
the unemployment situation and with the lack of benefits through 
EI.  Today a bill concerning young offenders was tabled.  Young 
offenders are sure to appear in our society if there are people 
who do not have adequate housing and adequate protection. Health 
problems are connected as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has actually happened over the years is the Liberal 
government has sacrificed our social safety net for the sake of 
balancing the budget.  This has been done on the backs of the 
most vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We urge today that we not be fooled by this legislation and that 
we do not support something that will antagonize the problem. 
Rather, let us look for real solutions to the problem of 
homelessness and housing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there has been a lot said about homelessness and the 
lack of money for housing.  But is it not true that over the last 
decade various provincial governments, including the provincial 
governments in Ontario and British Columbia, have systematically 
deinstituionalized all kinds of people who normally would be in 
an institution?  They have been put into subsidized housing in 
the community, which in turn has led to a lot of these people 
turning up in the streets, often by choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not agree that part of this problem is actually 
a reflection of a change in the attitude of provinces toward 
institutionalizing people?  Schizophrenics are a classic example 
of people who are now in the streets who 20 years ago were in 
institutions.  Would the member comment on that please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is not that simple. There were many cuts to federal 
transfer payments which affected the areas of housing, social 
services and so forth. The provinces were put in a position where 
they were not able to handle a lot of these problems.  The cuts 
to social housing go back much further.  Even before the 
deinstitutionalization process began, there were very serious 
cuts to the social housing program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can recall many years ago when I was in my late twenties there was 
a co-operative housing program under the federal government.  It 
seemed to find a fair degree of support in a lot of small rural 
communities.  People would band together and build housing under 
this program.  That program no longer exists. That program could 
meet a lot of the needs today if the federal government were 
serious about capping the housing problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit of a folly to blame the provinces and their programs 
of trying to bring about the deinstitutionalization of people. 
We know that concept would not work unless proper supports were 
there for the people who are deinstituionalized.  Again, that 
support needs funding, much of which has been cut by the federal 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad the hon. member mentioned the critical problem 
of psychiatric patients who are now on the streets and are 
homeless. It is a serious problem in our country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the mindset of certain provinces was to 
deinstitutionalize psychiatric patients was good for some of 
them. However, for a large number of them it was a profound 
tragedy which cost them not only hardship but also sometimes 
death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is very experienced in this matter. How does he 
feel about individuals who make a good salary taking advantage of 
and participating in subsidized housing?  Those people are taking 
positions away from the people who truly need them.  What would 
the member do about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not as familiar as my 
hon. colleague may be with people who make good salaries and live 
in subsidized housing. In most instances where subsidized housing 
is involved, there is a means test and an income test in terms of 
whether people qualify. If programs are being abused, then I 
would be the first to say that there has to be a better way of 
checking up on those programs to make sure they serve the needs 
of the people who need the services most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we come back to whether or not the departments and the 
people administering the programs are adequately resourced to 
make sure these programs are carried out properly.  That comes 
back to the huge amounts of cuts that have taken place. In many 
departments and agencies people are carrying caseloads well 
beyond the norm.  They cannot devote the time and effort required 
to make sure the programs run smoothly. It comes back to the 
federal government's withdrawal of payments that were formerly 
transferred for these kinds of programs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this bill 
unfortunately is about what we are losing as a country and as 
individuals.  We would not suddenly just by lowering taxes have 
more houses available to those people who may or may not have 
jobs, because just having a job now does not guarantee one will 
get a mortgage to get into a home.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of women with decent jobs who are single parents and are 
not eligible for a loan.  Neither were they eligible for any help 
from CMHC so that they could buy a home, even though they had the 
money to make the monthly payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The saddest point about this issue is what we are losing.  The 
bill would eliminate statutory requirements for social housing to 
be safe, sanitary and affordable.  Those are minimum requirements 
that we would expect for any housing, let alone social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from a letter dated September 22, 1993, from the current 
Minister of Finance to the National Housing Coalition in which he 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the federal government has a positive, proactive role 
in a national housing policy and the responsibility of 
accessibility and affordability to over one million Canadian 
households living in need of adequate shelter. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could almost cry knowing that this has not happened and that 
in fact the reverse has happened.  The government is not even 
willing to shelter those who are most vulnerable in society such 
as those who have psychiatric problems and have ended up on the 
street.  We are also talking about the elderly and the very 
young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a young friend who left Yukon to return to Ontario and 
lived on the street for two to three months.  She struggled 
really hard, lived in shelters and managed to get herself into 
high school.  In fact she will graduate this year.  She spends 
her spare time volunteering to help other kids get off the 
street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day when I walk to work I make sure that I have money for 
the people who are on the street at 8 o'clock in the morning 
because they have no place to live.  One man has lived under a 
bridge for the last 17 months.  Why on earth would we tolerate 
that?  We do not need people living without anything but a 
sleeping bag, a hat and a pair of sunglasses.  We can afford to 
do better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill shows an unwillingness to build houses, to take money 
from people who pay their taxes and turn it into four walls and a 
roof so that nobody will freeze to death in the night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another part of our population that suffers disproportionately 
when it comes to housing are our first nations people.  Recently 
I saw a video put together by an Ontario group of first nations. 
In three towns the first nations people were at dumpsites using 
scraps to build shelters.  They were living in burnt-out old 
vehicles.  They had 10 to 20 people in their little shacks so 
that they could stay warm at night.  This is all they had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those little places are regularly either burned down by the 
townships or bulldozed because they do not want them there. They 
do not want those little shanty towns outside their rather nice 
cities.  That is all these people have to call home.  Whatever 
piece of two by four, plastic or plywood they can put together is 
their home.  Then as a country we say it is all right to burn 
them down.  In those three communities alone there were nine 
deaths.  They were called natural causes but dying of TB and 
exposure are not natural causes.  Not having a place to live is 
not natural. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another tragedy for these people is that they are the ultimate 
victims of the residential school system.  Ninety-eight per cent 
of them have come out of that system.  They do not fit in their 
own community.  They do not fit in a white community.  They live 
in our garbage dumps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of one of the towns had enough compassion to have the 
RCMP arrest them and put them in a cell so that at least they 
would have a warm place overnight.  Some 2,300 arrests were 
logged in one year just to give these people a warm place to 
sleep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said over and over that first nations people are 
living in third world conditions.  They do not have equality. 
Our minister of aboriginal affairs has issued a Gathering 
Strength document dealing with building new partnerships.  The 
problem is that they need to be equal to be partners.  In no way 
can we say the first nations people of the world are financially 
equal to the rest of us.  All we have to do is look at the houses 
they are forced to live in to know that they do not have 
equality.  How can they be considered partners that can go out 
and get financing to build homes?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMHC bill has indicated an intention to seek joint ventures 
with first nations as a way of facilitating housing developments 
on reserves.  However, it would be a radical change to make first 
nations borrow from financial institutions to pay for their own 
housing.  This would be a back door abandonment of the 
government's responsibilities for housing on first nations.  Over 
half of the first nations population live off reserve and in the 
ghettos of our cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has signed a lot of covenants and conventions recognizing 
that aboriginal people have the right to an adequate standard of 
living for themselves and their families including adequate food, 
clothing and housing.  This is not being met by any stretch of 
the imagination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I travelled around Yukon I met a couple.  They were elders 
and were forced to live in a burnt-out cabin.  That is all they 
had.  The older gentleman had arthritis in his hand so he could 
not build a new cabin.  That is the kind of housing we are 
expecting them to live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to living in the north, the CMHC underwriting of 
mortgage insurance has been absolutely essential for anyone to 
get a house there.  We would lose the capacity of the CMHC to 
absorb losses.  If it underwrites these mortgages itself, it 
might decide that it cannot afford to insure houses in the north, 
that it is far too expensive and it will not do it.  The state of 
Alaska has had to deal with the issue because it only has 
commercial mortgage insurance.  No one would go into Alaska to 
insure homes so it had to depend on government intervention to 
insure mortgages to allow people to get homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very different situation to try to get a mortgage for a 
home in the north.  It is not something that happens even if one 
has the money to buy a home and pay the mortgage on a monthly 
basis.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her eloquent testimony of 
the problems faced by aboriginal people both on and off reserve. 
The member mentioned giving things to people.  No one would argue 
giving people the essentials so they have the ability, where they 
are physically able to do so, to take care of themselves and to 
provide essentials for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit that in many cases we have created 
institutionalized welfare states in many aboriginal communities. 
Rather than giving people the basic essentials and then providing 
them with the tools to take care of themselves, we have given 
people the basic essentials and cut the soul out of them by not 
giving them the tools to provide for themselves, by not giving 
them the obligation to participate in opportunities to take care 
of themselves.  Would the hon. member care to comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in Yukon we have an 
umbrella final agreement with most of the first nations having 
signed on and finished their land claims to have the obligation 
to look after themselves, to make their laws, to produce the 
goods they need to support themselves whether off the land or 
through commercial ventures where they would join in the greater 
part of Canada.  Land claim agreements are exactly about what the 
member of the Reform Party is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By supporting first nations agreements, claims and treaties for 
their own self-determination and self-government, we would be 
giving them the freedom to improve their living conditions and 
their way of life in a manner that suits their cultural

Hamilton must be the capital of social housing in Canada.  Huge 
tracts of social housing were built in the 1980s and early 1990s 
on Hamilton Mountain.  This basically emptied the 19th century 
housing in the downtown core and transferred the population from 
downtown Hamilton to uptown Hamilton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially in the lower city there is block upon block of empty 
apartment buildings, empty storefronts basically because the 
people have been moved to brand new social housing on the 
mountain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the member opposite that perhaps what is wrong 
here, where the government should be going and where I think this 
actual legislation has a beginning is that it is not really a 
question of spending more money.  It is spending money wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason in my mind that the existing housing stock in 
Hamilton could not have received some government assistance, 
either directly or indirectly, so that people could be housed in 
the city's core rather than transferring them to the suburbs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely what we are really talking about here is a reallocation 
of resources and not necessarily more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if it were just a 
reallocation of resources there would not be such a big problem. 
It is the taking away of resources and making it far more 
difficult for people to have homes.  It is really homes for 
profit and not homes for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with the privatization of homes and people who 
otherwise would never have a chance to own a home or to even be 
part of a home.  It is about turning social policy into profit 
rather than just reallocating resources, better town planning, 
better input.  Where should this housing go?  How will it benefit 
us as a community?  If that was all it is about, it would be a 
really good step.  It is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about taking away the prospect of a home.  We see the 
results day after day with more and more people on our streets 
and under our bridges, the young and the old.  Even those who are 
working are not able to afford a home. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be brief and to the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Point number one is subsidized housing.  There are two groups of 
people, those who need it and those who do not.  For those who do 
not, I have had them in my office.  They are Gucci socialists. 
These individuals are making good money and what they are doing 
is taking away homes from those people who desperately need them. 
This is an absolute outrage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Point number two is the issue of the people who are homeless and 
on the street.  There are a number of groups.  Group one consists 
of those individuals who are psyche patients, as was mentioned 
before.  This bespeaks of the deinstitutionalization that has 
taken place and that has been an abysmal horror for the people 
who suffer psychiatric problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must provide areas where these individuals can be taken care 
of.  Not only does this make sense from a humanitarian point of 
view but it is also good medicine and cheaper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Point number three is the individual on the street suffering 
from drug problems.  It bespeaks of the abysmal failure we have 
had in terms of how to deal with drug problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we can look at as a solution is the Geneva experiment, the 
post-needle park experiment, which is probably the best program 
in the world right now on how to get hard core drug addicts off 
the streets, employed and integrated members of society.  I ask 
that this issue be dealt with in a multifactoral manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the long term approach of preventing these people from 
becoming homeless, what we need to do is address the problem at 
time zero.  We can have a national head start program using 
existing resources based on the motion I had passed in the House 
last year.  It would go a long way in preventing a lot of the 
social problems that are occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the Minister of Human Resources Development to work 
with his counterparts, the Ministers of Justice and Health and 
their provincial counterparts, to develop an integrated approach 
where they can start of with the medical community at time zero, 
train volunteers in the middle based on the Hawaii head start 
program and use educational services for children starting at age 
four to eight.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially it strengthens the parent-child bond to ensure that 
children have their basic needs met in those formative years.  If 
children in their first years of life have their time disrupted 
through child abuse, drug abuse, being subjected to alcohol while 
in utero, et cetera, it has a dramatic and damaging effect on the 
psyche of these children and therefore does not enable them to 
become integrated members of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been proven time and time again.  We have wonderful 
programs from the head start program in Moncton that the Minister 
of Industry was a leader in to programs in Michigan and Hawaii. 
If we incorporate those and use the motion that I had passed we 
will have a seamless program that will prevent a lot of these 
problems from occurring in the future.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>PROGRAM FOR OLDER WORKERS ADJUSTMENT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
February 5, I put a question to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development regarding the Program for Older Workers Adjustment 
or POWA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer the minister gave me was not satisfactory. I had 
reminded him that on the program <I>Zone Libre</I>, where he had 
appeared, he had finally admitted that the active measures he is 
now offering older workers who have been laid off, such as those 
of the BC mine, are not the answer to the special problems of 
this category of worker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked him: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that the minister is going to quickly throw 
together a new and improved version of POWA, a program that he 
himself cut? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister answered in general terms, too general, saying he 
was very pleased with the creation of 87,000 new jobs across 
Canada, half of them for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe my question was very clear. It dealt specifically with 
the drastic situation of older workers. Their problem is that it 
is not easy for them to have access to the new jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work place is changing quickly. It is undergoing a mutation 
and requires new knowledge and skills. It is not surprising that 
young people eventually find a place in the labour market. We 
are very happy about it, but it does not solve the problems of 
older workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister keeps on saying that the best way to fight poverty 
and alienation is to create jobs, but he must understand that it 
is not the only way. It does not extinguish the government's 
responsibility to help people in dire straits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On its own, the labour market cannot remedy inequalities and 
injustices.  The minister himself admits this in his book.  The 
state must correct the inequities in the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must see reality as it is: older workers have real problems 
getting back into the workforce.  Employers hesitate to hire 
them because of their age.  To get any retraining is a lengthy 
process.  The doors to the workforce are not exactly wide open 
to them.  The minister is closing his eyes to the reality of 
older workers, and taking refuge behind overall market 
statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The immediate need of older workers is financial assistance to 
help them survive, to meet their obligations, and to negotiate 
the long and difficult process of career training.  These 
workers have paid into the employment insurance system for years 
without ever using it, and now they are more than deserving of 
our consideration and support.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I watched <I>Zone libre</I>, I was hoping the minister was finally 
aware of the plight of older workers. Was I wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of shedding false tears over those who have been 
excluded, when will the minister take action and introduce an 
improved version of POWA to do something about the poverty and 
exclusion of older workers who have lost their jobs?

<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to respond on behalf of the minister.  In response to some of the 
things the member had to say I would like to provide some 
information that may help her understand what the government is 
attempting to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to helping unemployed workers, 
including older workers.  We believe, however, that the best way 
to help unemployed workers is to help them return to the world of 
work.  The program for older workers which ended last year 
offered only passive income support and it did little to help 
older workers adapt to a changing economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government has now done is shift its support to active 
employment assistance to help workers reintegrate into the 
workforce.  Therefore our efforts are being directed to helping 
those older workers who need our help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have developed partnerships with the provinces through a 
number of labour market development agreements. These agreements 
are helping to deliver active employment measures tailored to the 
needs of unemployed workers.  The government is showing its 
support for these workers by offering the provinces $2 billion a 
year in EI funds to help support these active employment 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may also be interested to know that the majority of 
older workers continue to do relatively well in the labour market 
when compared to other age groups.  In fact, the unemployment 
rate for workers over 55 has decreased from 9% in 1993 to 6.3% in 
1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any unemployment is still too much, but certainly within the 
target group the member is interested in there has been 
considerable progress.  The government has also shown its 
commitment to this important sector of the labour force through 
our commitment to the working group established by the forum of 
labour market ministers. The working group will seek to address 
the concerns raised by older workers and we are constantly in 
discussion with all the provinces to find ways to address the 
needs of this group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for her question and for her concern.  I hope 
she will continue to work with us to see that the needs of older 
workers are addressed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
