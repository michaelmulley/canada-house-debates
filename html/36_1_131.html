<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from September 29 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-53, an act to increase the availability of financing 
for the establishment, expansion, modernization and improvement 
of small businesses, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to participate in the debate on this excellent piece 
of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know of course that the Minister of Industry has a keen 
interest in small business in Canada, as do all hon. members.  As 
late as yesterday the official opposition was talking about small 
business people in Canada, EI premiums and a number of other 
issues, extolling the virtues of small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition in the House also raised 
the world economic challenges going on now and asked if the 
government had anything to announce in its business statement in 
regard to that.  I of course thanked him for the question and 
immediately told him about all the excellent legislation on which 
we are proposing to move to assist small businesses, and business 
generally, and to create wealth and jobs in Canada.  That is 
central to the program of the government. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, given the interest of opposition members, and of all 
members, in the Canadian economy—if the speeches and interest 
shown in the House yesterday are any indication—we can only 
wonder why the official opposition has decided, in its wisdom— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Let us not exaggerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> —in its supposed wisdom, to resort to a 
procedural mechanism so as to prevent the bill from going 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition has asked that consideration of the bill to help 
small businesses be postponed for six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard:</B>  What a contradiction! 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
points out how contradictory this is.  She is, as usual, right 
on the mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that this bill to help small businesses go 
ahead. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the opposition not cause delays on this 
bill by moving dilatory motions, hoist motions or other 
procedural tricks to stop this bill from going ahead.  I do not 
think procedural tricks should be going on.  Therefore I move: 
<A NAME="LINK5">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the question be now put. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> We now proceed to the 
period for questions and comments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague across the way for his speech, but 
I am disappointed that he wants to put the question on this very 
important issue at this point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be that as it may, I have a question for the hon. member.  His 
government is taking a significant amount of EI premiums and 
putting them into general revenues.  These moneys are in excess 
of what is needed in the fund to pay out to people on employment 
insurance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1010
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current information shows that taking this money out of the 
pockets of the private sector has a significant dampening effect 
on the ability of the private sector to generate employment.  The 
hon. member knows very well that the report of the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business which came out 48 hours ago 
shows very clearly that the number one issue that impedes the 
ability of business to create jobs are the high taxes in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member whether he is prepared to ask the finance 
minister today to lower EI premiums by 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Speaker, first of all I do not 
want to give a procedural lesson to the member across the way, 
but “That the question be now put” does not mean that the 
debate ceases now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to explain this to the hon. member.  He has been 
a member for a long time and I am surprised he does not know the 
significance of the motion that is now before the House. “That 
the question be now put” is a motion to ensure that no member 
can in fact hoist the bill and prevent it from coming to a vote. 
That is what the motion means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B> Can I ask what the question is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Speaker, I did not know that I 
would have to give a procedural course to another member across 
the way.  Perhaps I can just recommend Beauchesne to both of them 
and that will solve the problem.  We could have a seminar.  It 
was actually given to all members when we were elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question proposed by the hon. member is very serious.  He 
said that the government is taking EI premiums and putting them 
into the consolidated revenue fund.  I would like him to 
substantiate that allegation.  No such action has been taken.  No 
one has taken EI premiums for anything.  That is blatantly 
inaccurate.  I think what he means is that there is a debate 
right now as to whether the best course of action should be, not 
is, to lower EI premiums or to lower other forms of raising 
money, say, for instance, general taxation, whichever is the best 
process to put money back into the pockets of taxpayers.  That is 
the debate.  It is not whether someone has taken or is taking EI 
premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the second part of the question, the hon. member said that 
these funds are being put in the consolidated revenue fund. In 
1986 the Auditor General of Canada recommended in a report 
abolishing the special UI reserve where the premiums were held. 
That was abolished a year later in 1987.  It has been almost 12 
years since there was a separate EI fund.  I know news travels 
slowly around here sometimes, but such a fund has not existed for 
12 years.  The debate is not on that; the debate is on what is 
the best process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has listened to representations from the 
member opposite and others.  The question is, what is the best 
process to put some of that money back into the pockets of 
Canadians, not whether it is going to happen.  That is an 
entirely different issue.  How much of a cushion should there be 
in the event that there is a slowdown in the economy at some 
point in the future, which I certainly hope does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the debate that is before us.  It is not whether someone 
is taking EI premiums.  It is nonsensical to put it in those 
terms and does a disservice to everyone around here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would recommend that all Canadians read the Reform Party's 
policies.  I know that is difficult at the best of times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Let me rephrase that.  Canadians should 
read a very small portion of the Reform Party's policies because 
I know that reading a lot would cause indigestion, heartburn and 
other things.  We might have to call a well-known physician in 
the House to take care of us if we read too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we read very briefly that part which refers to EI premiums, I 
know very well that the policy of the Reform Party has been, as 
late as the last election, to take EI funds and use them for tax 
reduction.  That was the policy of the Reform Party, stated in 
its own documents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate that you recognized me in order that I may comment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
You have allowed the same party two opportunities in a row to 
put a question to the Leader of the Government in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, my apologies but I was 
speaking and suddenly I lost the floor. Could you please explain 
how that happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  One of the members 
had a point of order.  You have the floor now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I point out to 
anyone watching this debate that the member from the opposite 
side has just pulled what we would call a sneaky procedural trick 
while he has accused us of doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to do and what the Liberals are failing to do is to 
improve legislation.  It is totally false for him to imply that 
we are somehow against the ability of business to do its job.  He 
is saying that we want to prolong and somehow kill this 
legislation.  We want to improve it. We have found from this 
Liberal government that there is no openness to reasonable 
amendments.  We want to make some amendments, we want to have an 
allocation of time given to improving this bill before it is put 
into law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 35th parliament this government used some form of time 
allocation or closure 35 times.  The Liberals do not want debate. 
They do not want debate in the House and they do not want debate 
among the Canadian people.  Once the Liberals have made up their 
bullheaded minds they do not want to change their minds.  That is 
giving us legislation that is far less than what it could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already had seven time allocation motions in this 
parliament including one earlier this week on the DNA act.  We 
supported the principle of that bill but there were some very 
important amendments to be made.  What reaction did we get from 
this government?  We got “No, we are going to do it our way” 
and there was a time allocation motion.  The government brought 
all its members in here.  They stood and voted for it on command. 
As a result the bill was jammed through in its present 
uncorrected form.  It is flawed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the Liberals opposed to having legislation improved? 
Surely they are not so arrogant as to think that the very first 
shot at it is the best anybody in Canada can ever do.  Why are 
they not willing to listen to other points of view, those 
expressed by the Canadian people through the opposition and those 
expressed by Canadians directly?  Why are they insisting on 
closing down debate? This is really unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member opposite to explain to the Canadian 
people, not just to me and our party, not just to the opposition, 
why his party has to resort to these heavy handed tactics in 
order to jam its legislation through, in its perfect form 
according to them, when we know it could be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Speaker, I recommend to the hon. 
member citation 521 of Beauchesne's.  That is the first part of 
my answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says that he wants the bill amended but the motion he 
put earlier this week was that the bill be delayed for six months 
and not amended.  He proposed a motion that would stop it from 
going to committee where his own amendments could be proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposite to the truth has never been stated more accurately 
than by what the hon. member has done just now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to speak to Bill C-53, but something just 
happened here that, I think, requires clarification.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently in response to a Reform motion to be disposed of next 
Tuesday I guess, the government House leader is proposing a kind 
of gag order. Because he does not agree with the Reform Party's 
motion to defer consideration of the bill for six months, he is 
proposing that we proceed immediately. That is what he said this 
morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This needs clarifying. The government House leader referred to 
our Standing Orders, but went on to talk about employment 
insurance and what not, leaving the people who are at home 
listening to us completely confused 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted, Bill C-53 is not perfect. However, given the principles 
behind the bill, including the need for small businesses in 
Quebec and Canada to have access to financing, leaving these 
businesses in a lurch for six month cannot be justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, through Bill C-21, approximately $1 billion in 
additional funding was to be provided. Now, this was a while 
ago, and we all know how long it takes for legislation and 
programs to be implemented at the federal level, especially with 
this government, which is quick to propose time allocation 
motions but is very slow when it comes to reviewing programs. I 
find this somewhat funny. The government House leader wants to 
proceed quickly when this bill is not well structured enough to 
meet the needs of small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, there is an urgent need to maintain funding. 
But we must be careful not to repeat the mistake made these past 
three years, when a bill was introduced each year to provide a 
one-year extension as well as additional funding. This year-to-year 
approach makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must at least recognize that Bill C-53 provides for the 
continuous operation of the small business loans program. We 
support this objective. It is very important, imperative, that 
we stop playing this game year after year, leaving our small 
businesses across Canada on the edge all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this kind of management approach, the people concerned 
live in fear of the program being abolished or of funds running 
out so they rush out to the bank so they can be sure to benefit 
from the program. 
Often, projects, and this has been shown, are not always ready 
and are more vulnerable.  They risk being rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time comes to compensate the banks for losses, the 
government has a number of demands.  This is what occurred in 
the past, because the basis was a year at a time.  The auditor 
looked into that and noted that there was indeed a control 
problem and a certain lack of cost effectiveness.  I think that, 
for the last year, the compensation figure was around $200 
million.  A significant figure nevertheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, 95% of businesses in Canada are small.  They create 
nearly 50% of jobs.  It is the small businesses of 50 employees 
or fewer that use much of the manpower and are the most 
imaginative and creative, we have to admit.  They are the most 
involved in economic development. 
That is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we support the bill in principle and why, Tuesday, 
the Bloc Quebecois will support it.  We understand to some 
extent the arguments of the Reform Party and we understand why 
the Reform Party wants a six-month delay in order to better 
understand the situation.  If we agreed to their proposal, we 
run the risk of depriving small business of funding for a fairly 
long time.  We cannot agree to that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best approach would be for the Reform Party and the other 
opposition parties along with the government members to buckle 
down and get to work on the Standing Committee on Industry.  The 
parliamentary secretary is here and has said that he would be 
receptive to changes and improvements.  For once.  We are not 
used to having the government open to change proposed by the 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally, they tend to think the truth is exclusively on their 
side.  We think it is better distributed than that.  Often, it 
may be found as well on the opposition side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can call this a game, but we can also call it democracy. 
That is the way our system works. 
There is a bill, and a parliamentary committee is going to 
examine it.  People with proposals for changes will be able to 
have their opinions listened to.  Some changes will make sense 
and others will not.  It will be up to the parliamentarians to 
evaluate that in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The usual process is for a report to made to the House after 
that.  Here again, the opposition parties can present 
amendments.  Since this is a very important subject, this time 
it might be necessary for the government to show it is listening 
to the views of the public, which will also be expressed through 
the opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I have heard so far in the debate on this bill, and 
on Bill C-21 as well, not to mention the debate last year, 
because the government brings this up pretty well every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am on the Standing Committee on Industry, and again yesterday 
morning we were presented with a foot-thick pile of documents and 
statistical studies.  There are proposals for such things as 
seminars, symposia, endless press reviews, and groups asking to 
be heard.  The association of independent business people, 
consumers, big business, all have opinions on this.  Then there 
is all the current debate around the bank mergers.  This is far 
from a minor issue.  It is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, there are seven major banks, plus the 
caisses populaires in Quebec.  As we know, the caisses 
populaires are extremely important in Quebec.  I have some 
knowledge of this because their head office is in my riding. 
Lévis is where the Desjardins movement began in 1900.  Its 
centennial will be coming up in two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comments are very pertinent, since half of the loans granted 
under the old Small Business Loans Act are administered by the 
caisses populaires in Quebec, while the other half is 
administered by one of the seven major banks. This is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are indeed talking about small business and small business 
financing, but we are also talking about how banks operate. This 
is currently one of the most talked about issues at the federal 
level. All the parties must conduct a very thorough review of 
this issue. All have basic positions and principles, but the 
situation of financial institutions is changing so rapidly at 
the world level that the debate should include an assessment of 
the financing needs of small business. I know that the Standing 
Committee on Finance is looking at this issue. There is the 
McKay report on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must take the time needed, but we must not take too much 
time, otherwise we would deprive our small businesses from 
getting the financing they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not perfect. It is in response to the auditor 
general's recommendations who, and rightly so, proposed 
accounting measures and controls. The auditor general did a good 
job. He is proposing that the government add mechanisms, that 
the minister have more means to control the program's 
effectiveness. We agree with him. However, we must not only 
react to this specific situation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To rely exclusively on controls, and to implement too many of 
them could prevent us from benefiting from the development 
triggered by small business in Canada, which we truly need. The 
future is far from being secure and guaranteed, and major 
businesses—such as GM in Montreal—are slow to announce what 
they have in store in terms of investments, planning and 
direction. Meanwhile, people are left on the sidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a major industry in my riding called Davie Industries. 
It has secured $300 million in contracts, but its workers face 
an uncertain future, because there is currently no guarantee of 
financing. We must take a serious look at this situation, 
because it involves hundreds of millions of dollars. 
What is involved for 95% of the businesses in Canada is $200 
million that has allegedly been lost.  However, they have failed 
to look on the profit side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As businesses were setting up under the program and therefore 
creating jobs, tax money was being paid both federally and 
provincially.  This meant additional revenues.  Perhaps the 
program cost $200 million, but no financial studies have been 
done to show how much it generated for the federal and 
provincial departments of revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no studies to indicate that, but I have no doubt that 
it brought in far more than it cost.  When we talk about 50% of 
Canada's manpower, we are talking a lot of people. 
That translates into taxes too.  If we do not help small 
business to set up and remain in operation—because a lot of 
them go bankrupt—and we do not provide for renewed funding, 
what happens?  Jobs are lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a period of receiving employment insurance benefits, these 
people find themselves without jobs.  But here, I am sounding a 
sour note, because we realize that some 45% of people who have 
paid into employment insurance cannot collect benefits under the 
new legislation when they become unemployed.  That is a scandal 
and the subject for another debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That involves money too.  This sort of situation costs all 
taxpayers.  What happens when two people are in the same 
situation and are not entitled to employment insurance benefits? 
They have to turn to social assistance. 
This means additional expenditures for both levels of 
government, since the federal government also kicks in for 
welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think one would have to be short-sighted to take the Reform 
Party's approach and try to have the bill put off for six months 
because it is not perfect, because it does not quite suit them, 
and turn a blind eye to the serious impact on the health of 
businesses, not to say the health of those they employ. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot leave people hanging for six months, not knowing 
whether or not the program will be extended.  If we were to go 
along with this measure, it would mean that, tomorrow morning, 
because there is still a little money left in the program—an 
additional $1 billion to extend it for one more year—all 
businesses would quickly throw projects together and rush to the 
financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I see it, there is one major problem with the bill.  It 
guarantees the banks compensation for any losses, on condition 
that they move fast, because once the $1.5 billion is exhausted, 
they are out of luck.  Everyone is scrambling, and we all know 
that, when there is too much haste, problems arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois would have liked to see a better bill, one 
that incorporated the suggestions it made last year, and wishes 
that needs had been more accurately assessed.

broader consultations.  We hope that, as part of the work to be 
done by the Standing Committee on Industry, it will be possible 
to carry out this consultation of the groups concerned, namely 
small businesses, financial institutions, the seven major banks, 
and the Canadian Bankers Association, as well as caisses 
populaires and credit unions in the rest of Canada, which 
operate along the same lines as financial co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should have a say in the matter, for the future and for the 
long term, so that we will not have to debate this issue in the 
House every year only to argue in favour of motherhood. 
I think that is where matters stand, but this government is 
going to have to listen seriously to what the public has to say 
and consider objectively the various proposals being made, 
including those from the opposition parties.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the words of my 
colleague from Lévis.  He and I have had many discussions on 
small and large businesses.  Sometimes we agree and sometimes we 
disagree, but at least we have a good debate and try to put our 
best efforts forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member brings his amendments to the industry committee 
I hope they are to improve the bill and not marginalize it.  I 
welcome that.  I welcome his debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has been on the industry committee for a long time 
now.  I have forgotten how many years, because we have both been 
there for a number of years.  When we put forward Bill C-21, the 
extension for one year of the SBLA, in the springtime the 
commitment was made by the minister and the department to make 
sure that the new bill would be tabled as early as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the industry committee was to hear from as many 
witnesses as possible.  The stakeholders of the bill would be 
present to make their efforts known to the committee.  The 
objective was to have a good industry committee discussion on the 
bill and on amendments that could be brought forward from the 
stakeholders to make sure that when the bill came back to the 
House it would be a bill that we would all be pleased with, not 
one that we would delay and then have a crunch later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member who has been a member of the industry committee 
for a long time expand on that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, I will answer by saying that 
what goes around comes around. As the hon. member knows, I have 
been sitting on the committee since the election held in June of 
last year. As regards Bill C-21, which was to be postponed for 
one year, the member surely remembers that the Bloc Quebecois 
had supported that legislation. At the time, we had reservations 
about the legislation and we proposed some changes. I will 
certainly help him remember the amendments and suggestions we 
proposed back then. There is a good chance we will suggest the 
same changes again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this spirit that I said earlier that we would support 
the bill on Tuesday, when the House will vote on it, because we 
are dealing here with the principle of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can one be opposed to the principle—and I ask Reform Party 
members to reconsider their position on this—of helping small 
businesses get financing? I am not talking about subsidies. 
I represent the riding of Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, where the 
Lévis shipyard is located. Because of the huge figures involved, 
people are always under the impression that it is a major 
business. They think it is outrageous to provide assistance to 
such a company. But there are essentially no subsidies in the 
funds provided by the government. All the money is provided 
through loans, loan guarantees or contracts. It is somewhat 
similar in this case.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What in fact is being asked of the government is for it to act 
as guarantor, up to a ceiling of $1.5 billion, to all of the 
small businesses in Canada for loans negotiated with banking 
institutions.  Everyone recognizes the expertise of the banks, 
as well as the caisses populaires and credit unions, for they 
are located in the various regions concerned, which have 
different problems and characteristics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advantage of this is that it offers small business a basic 
program.  There are other programs more specific to certain 
sectors, perhaps too many in my opinion.  Too much of something 
can sometimes be as much of a problem as too little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was recently in an office in Vancouver in connection with my 
responsibility for regional development. 
I saw people working away at computers to locate government 
programs, both provincial and federal.  I asked one person how 
long she had been at it, and she told me it had been a week. 
She told me it had been two days before she finally figured out 
how the system worked.  She commented that she had been shunted 
from one program to another, and how very confusing it was.  It 
is all very fine to have computers available to give people some 
degree of independence, but there still have to be advisors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec now has a new structure in place which impacts on the 
social economy, the local employment development councils. 
These have enhanced the economic councils, which some regions 
called by another name.  These still need counsellors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be kept in mind that a loan program is still needed. 
Within the framework of this legislation, this loan program is 
aimed at small business. 
It is therefore extremely important.  I do not believe such an 
essential issue is the right place for petty partisan politics.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to discuss Bill C-53. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to this point in time nobody has mentioned in the House what 
makes small businesses go or what makes small businesses operate. 
Coming from the western constituency of Souris—Moose Mountain 
we have but two major corporations.  Both are government owned. 
They are coal generated power plants.  Outside one other business 
every business in my constituency is under definition a small 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the winter of 1966-67 my question to the small businesses in 
my community was to ask what they needed most.  At that time the 
answer was to get the high cost of government doing government 
business for them off their backs.  It was almost universal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the story has changed and it is a sad case on the western 
prairies.  It is very sad in my community for small businesses. 
It is probably worse to be in a small business in the grain 
industry now than it has been since World War II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I made phone calls the comments I heard were that the bill 
did not interest them in the least.  They wanted customers who 
had some money to spend.  We have not addressed that question in 
the debate.  It is a domino effect.  If customers have no money 
in their pockets, the businesses go down regardless of the loans 
to them.  We have not addressed the plight of primary industries 
for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made two phone calls to small hardware stores in my community 
that would certainly qualify for a loan.  Basically they depend 
entirely on two sources:  the oil patch and the agricultural 
community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both hardware stores, same response.  One more year of this and 
we close the door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In most in my towns and villages there are three businesses 
closing for every one that is staying open. We have not addressed 
the problem of providing and looking after our primary 
industries.  Grain production in Saskatchewan is still the number 
one industry.  I will give members what I dug up in the last two 
days.  Here are four local industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One, setting up steel storage beams.  They are out of business. 
They had a loan. Two, an independent soil testing device to 
provide information to the farmers.  Closed.  Out of business. 
Three, fertilization. It no longer pays to fertilize with the 
price of grain. Four is very interesting.  A local contractor not 
too far from where I live employing four people is out of 
business. His job was to put new roofs, barns and so on. But 
there is no money. Businesses are going down because we have 
neglected the primary industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the House and all Canadians will listen to this so they 
understand.  Picture in your minds nine steel bins on the 
prairies full of grain.  The first three bins will go to pay the 
freight.  The next two bins will go to pay the taxes.  The next 
two bins will pay the fuel costs.  The last two bins pay the 
seed, spray and maybe some fertilizer. NISA, the RRSP for 
farmers, was a good program.  I commend the government and the 
provinces for that.  It now is gone.  They used it all in the 
last two years. They have exhausted their total line of credit at 
the banks and the credit unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the situation.  I read something I got yesterday morning 
from my local elevator.  Canadians should realize why small local 
businesses are out of the picture.  As of yesterday, with freight 
deducted, the farmer takes home $2.12 with number one red spring 
wheat.  That is the worst price that the farmers have received. 
Nothing since World War II could come anywhere near that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agricultural economists tell us that if we do not get $4.00 
a bushel we are not breaking even. 3CW durum is $2.02.  No wonder 
men stores and the ladies shops and all the small businesses are 
closing.  Oats are 77 cents a bushel. Number one feed barley is 
74 cents a bushel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stopped a lady who had gone in to buy some shoes, some jeans, 
shirts and so on for a family of three to get them started back 
to school.  The total bill was around $324.  Let me tell members 
the plight of western Canadian small business.  That small bit 
that she bought for her children would take 437 bushels of 
barley.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of joking about this situation, hon. members should be 
ashamed of themselves.  This is not a joke.  I live among these 
people.  I know what is happening out there.  All across Canada, 
if the primary industries are not nurtured or protected, we will 
have a domino effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would take 8,100 bushels of barley or 7,800 bushels of wheat 
to pay a $6,000 tax bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens to the small business is simply that the majority 
of taxes in Saskatchewan go to education.  These taxes are not 
going to come in.  Therefore what happens?  There are fewer roads 
built, fewer teachers hired and it goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The local governments cannot keep up because of commodity 
pricing and they are not the least bit interested in this bill 
until this government takes an honest look at what part it can do 
in looking at a very serious situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of the largest farm implement dealerships locked their doors 
in the last two months.  They were for sale.  No buyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a survey I did, at 26 farm auction sales only 2 of those 
farms were going to be turned over to members of the same family. 
The majority of these people want nothing to do with the 
dreadful situation that exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill looks good.  The bill sounds good but it is of 
absolutely no value whatsoever to the people I represent until 
the government does something about the primary industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in my constituency could not care less about the 
wrangling in this House today.  That does not put money in their 
pockets.  It does not give them any guarantee for the future. 
They hate to face the coming winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not deny that the government wants to support small 
business but I want members to be aware that if they are really 
going to support small business, they have to look after the 
primary industries of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that respect, the people in western Canada, the people I have 
met in my constituency totally will say you have disregarded the 
primary interest of our province.  Members have to put more money 
into the hands of the customer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are approximately 68 private insurance brokers in my 
constituency.  One motion of this government that will allow the 
banks and the credit unions to have it all in-store shopping 
could knock out 76 private businesses in two weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have heard the same message I have but I have made it 
abundantly clear to them that I am here to protect their business 
on the main street of every town.  I hope the government heeds 
that lesson very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing is the overtaxation not only to the consumer but 
as it deals with the private small business.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The domino effect of grants from this government and from the 
provincial government has made it virtually impossible for the 
small operator to meet those taxation demands.  Their taxes have 
gone up 8 times, 800% in less than 20 years, and little wonder. 
If any of the members opposite want to dispute this claim they 
can do their own research. Is it not true that they have had as 
many phone calls as I have had with regard to the EI? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the people who called me this morning basically said “Do 
you want to hurt government businesses?  We paid $1.40 for every 
one of our employees spending $1.  It belongs to us and we won't 
be able to hire more people unless that premium is dropped”. 
This was from a person hiring some 16 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If government really wants to help small businesses, go ahead 
but it had better deal with the primary things first.  It has 
taxed businesses to death.  It has taxed the Canadian public to 
death.  It has excessively taxed people on their CPP premiums, 
which is another tax grab.  The government has a disgraceful

this is going to be for small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to move a motion before this bill went any further 
because I wanted to make it abundantly clear to all Canadians 
that small businesses with a staff of two and three people are 
going to close their doors in my province in the next two years 
because of this government's lack of concern as to what it could 
do to support that primary industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second largest bill is the tax on the fuel that a farmer 
uses to run his farm.  I was in a farm yard not too long ago when 
the tanks were filled and the bill was $1,800.  A good portion of 
that is taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this bill should be delayed.  I look at these prices 
such as $2.12 a bushel for wheat.  I do not think there is a 
farm, even if it is a 20 section farm, that can survive on that. 
However, because this government seems to have no interest in 
that small amount, I want to read to this House—

provinces to provide adequate health care to our rural

hampers the abilities of these towns and villages to fill vacant

only three. The last time this area had only three doctors was 
back in World War II.

families to give up their rural way of life because it is no 
longer safe.  The situation is serious and must be addressed 
immediately.

do with VIP security, as if Quebec were not capable of ensuring 
this.  Knowing as we do that for the federal government the word

question is for the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the world bank said yesterday that the G7 
countries should “take measures to stimulate their economy, 
increase demand and rebuild confidence”.  Yesterday, the Bloc 
Quebecois put the very same thing to the minister to be told its

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Finance think the position of the president 
of the world bank totally ridiculous as well? 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
happened yesterday is that the Bloc Quebecois wanted to blame 
the Government of Canada for the ills of the world, and that is 
totally ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the statement by the president of the world bank, 
with whom I had long discussions, I agree with it.  All 
industrialized countries must join together to bring the Asian 
and Russian economies out of the slump they are in.  I made a 
speech in this regard this week. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
past two months the Bloc Quebecois has been trying to wake up 
the minister. All the better to have him awake now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more analysts and experts are sounding the alarm.  The 
president of the world bank says this is the time to act, and 
the minister concludes he is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister stop talking about the Canadian economy 
and do something before we find ourselves in a full recession? 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has already acted.  This is why we were so quick to 
eliminate the deficit.  This is why productivity in Canada is

I too have a question for the Minister of Finance.

for the past four months, and not just in Latin America or Asia, 
but right here at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many more months of negative growth will it take for the 
minister to admit that there is a problem and that urgent action 
is required to stimulate the economy, as the president of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once 
again, I agree fully with the president of the World Bank that 
industrialized nations will have to co-ordinate their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what Bloc Quebecois members are suggesting.  They 
are suggesting that we spend, and that we reduce government 
revenue.  In other words, that we go back to a deficit 
situation.  That is the worst thing we could do in today's 
volatile global market.

so well that we are only 700,000 jobs short of the number of 
jobs before the last recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister understand that, at a time such as this, the

so puts our economy at risk?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no doubt that we live in turbulent times.  That is why 
it was so important for the government to put its fiscal house 
in order the way it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But let us look at the results in Canada. In 1997, 500,000 new 
jobs were created.  During the first eight months of this year, 
200,000 jobs were created.  The unemployment rate has dropped 
from 11.5% to 8.3%.  Today, the IMF tells us that Canada will 
lead the G-7 countries in job creation.

dangers of the spreading global financial crisis.  He is likely 
also aware that the chairman of Europe's largest bank has

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want the minister to go through the usual mantra of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

that the tumbling stock market puts mutual funds and a lot of the 
savings of Canadians at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Minister of Finance tell the House what is the 
collective exposure of the big six banks to risks associated with 
mutual funds and hedge funds?

is well within their ability to handle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of banks are involved in mutual funds.  In terms of the 
major hedge funds the hon. member probably saw the report where 
the Toronto-Dominion Bank refused long term capital, which is the

place.  I am assured that is common throughout our banking

my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With his response yesterday on icebreaking, either he does not 
understand the matter or he could not care less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he realize that the new icebreaking fee will hit port

<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the question yesterday and the one today 
come from the imposition of fees for ice breaking and marine aids 
which total approximately 17% of the actual costs of the services 
provided.  We are attempting to make sure that those who use the 
services pay at least 17% of the costs.  Then the general 
taxpayer is, of course, relieved of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the ports of Quebec is that to get to them 
vessels have to go through waters much closer to Newfoundland. 
Therefore, if there is ice breaking, the inevitable result is 
they could just ice break in the St. Lawrence, but it would not 
do much good because the ships would never get to port.

a good start.

Speaker, as the global economy teeters on the edge and commodity 
prices plummet, farmers are feeling pretty cynical and very

incomes are falling by as much as 40% this year and farm leaders 
are pleading with the minister of agriculture to help.  Farmers 
want to know if he is listening.

<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

are assisting the agriculture and agri-food industry to find

international scene as well.  We are managing with them in

<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, NISA right now covers one month's expenses for the 
average farmer while the U.S. Congress is debating an extra $7 
billion to help its farmers.  U.S. and European farmers receive 
massive support from their governments but here in Canada the 
Liberal government has killed the Crow rate, has gutted the rail 
system and slashes farm support by over two-thirds. Farmers want 
backbone, not backdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister of agriculture stand up for farmers and bring 
forward a farm aid package quickly?  Will he assure that it is 
more than just a band-aid on a hemorrhage? 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

there.   As a matter of fact, in the net income stabilization 
accounts alone there is $2.5 billion. In a conference call on 
this and a number of issues, the farm leaders in the member's 
part of the country just two days ago advised me not to go into 
ad hoc payments, we need the strength of our industry and to use 
the safety net system that is there already.

we improve the management of the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act.  It is for these reasons that I have decided to 
appeal the Sunpine decision.  If left unappealed, the decision

determine the scope of environmental assessments which is a very

question is for the Minister of the Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, we learned that, following Bill C-14, the government 
now intends to use a national strategy to meddle in the area of 
drinking water, a matter of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister honour the Constitution and  acknowledge

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment,

the export of bulk fresh water.  We do permit for the export of 
bottled drinking water.  That occurs with great frequency right 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the issue of the export of bulk fresh water is of 
concern to the federal government.  It is a national issue. 
Individual provinces do have some authority but it is in the area 
of a national issue as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petition calls upon parliament to enact legislation to 
implement in conjunction with the provinces a national head start

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have three petitions.  The first has to do with our police 
officers and firefighters.  It is signed by a number of 
Canadians, including some from my own riding of Mississauga 
South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that police 
officers and firefighters are required to place their lives at 
risk on a daily basis as they discharge their duties. Often the 
employment benefits they have do not provide sufficient 
compensation to their families when one of them loses their life 
in the line of duty.  Further, the public also mourns the loss of 
our police officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty 
and they wish to support their surviving families in a tangible 
way in their time of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore ask parliament to consider 
establishing a public safety officers compensation fund for the

petition, Mr. Speaker, has to do with health warning labels on

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that the 
consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health problems. 
Specifically, fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol related birth 
defects are 100% preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption 
during pregnancy.  Further, consumption of alcoholic beverages 
impairs one's ability to operate machinery or automobile 
equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore call upon parliament to require health 
warning labels to be placed on the containers of alcoholic 
products to warn expectant mothers and others of the risks 
associated with alcohol consumption.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners, in this year marking the 50th anniversary of 
the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, would like to draw 
to the attention of the House that Canada is internationally 
recognized as a leader in promoting human rights around the world 
and that human rights abuses tragically continue in many 
countries around the world, including Indonesia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore call upon parliament on behalf of the 
Government of Canada to appeal for action by leaders of countries 
where human rights are not being protected and to seek to bring 
to justice those responsible for the violation of internationally 
recognized universal human rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to stand in this House today to provide 
some comments with respect to Bill C-53, the Canada Small 
Business Financing Act. This act will increase the availability 
of financing for the establishment, expansion, modernization and 
improvement of small businesses in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point we are also debating the motion of the Liberal 
Party to cut the debate short.  This is a very serious matter 
that the government has implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see two political parties in the House of Commons playing 
games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party wants to kill the bill. Reform Party members 
time after time, speaker after speaker, whether they are from 
British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan or Manitoba, stand in 
this House and say that small businesses do not deserve fair 
financing opportunities for their progress. Reform Party members 
time after time from every province they represent, the four 
provinces in western Canada, say that this bill is bad and that 
they want to kill it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will affect about 200,000 businesses over the next 
number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is playing what many people describe as silly 
games. The Liberal government in response to silly games jumps 
right in feet first and plays sillier games by ending the debate, 
closing or limiting the debate on this bill which is very 
important to small business owners and employees of small 
businesses in this country. The NDP is really quite unhappy that 
both of those political parties are playing games with the 
futures of these businesses and the families that are supported 
by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, we have seen the Liberal Party time after time limit or 
close debate on matters that are of economic importance to our 
country.  We have seen it invoke closure so many times in this 
House I have lost count.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen it invoke closure on the wheat board act, which was 
supposed to be an act that encouraged debate and provided 
opportunities for members of parliament to strengthen the wheat 
board.  Instead, the Reform played its silly games.  The Liberal 
government jumped right in and played more silly games, ending in 
a wheat board act that is not as strong as it should have been if 
it had full debate in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the Liberal government opposite limit debate on 
very important budget bills because the Reform Party played silly 
games.  The Liberal Party gets sucked in.  It embraces these 
silly games and plays sillier games.  We have seen it cut debate 
on the World Trade Organization legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The World Trade Organization has handcuffed Canadians but not 
Americans to the detriment of agriculture in this country, to the 
detriment of many small, medium and large enterprises in this 
country.  We are seeing firsthand in Canada this week the effects 
of limiting of debate on the very bad World Trade Organization 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we see one more silly game by the Liberals, and the Reform 
Party is embracing silly approaches to the business of the 
nation.  I believe that both parties are negligent in their 
responsibility to the taxpayers of the country.  They are 
negligent to the small business community because they do not 
want full debate or full discussion on the bill. The Reform Party 
not only does not want debate.  It does not want the bill. It 
does not want to have any small businesses left in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to business people viewing the Reform Party's real 
agenda, its big business, anti-small business agenda, the Reform 
Party will pay very dearly for that come the next election.  The 
Liberals will not benefit from that because they are the ones who 
are inciting the Reform Party to play these stupid games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am from Saskatchewan.  In part I share the comments of the 
member of parliament for Souris—Moose Mountain, a Reform member 
from Saskatchewan.  He is concerned about the agricultural 
problem in western Canada and in our country.  I am very 
concerned about this serious matter.  I have had calls from and 
discussions with farmers and their families over the last number 
of weeks.  Farmers in Saskatchewan and in other parts of the 
country are in desperate straits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen commodity prices fall.  We have seen the incomes of 
farm families falling.  Many predict that they will fall by about 
40% this winter alone.  What this means is that one-third of the 
farmers who are basically operating on a very tight margin could 
potentially loose their farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have here?  We have a Liberal government and a Reform 
Party that are killing debate on a small business bill.  They do 
not allow for wide-ranging debates and inputs from the House of 
Commons on the agricultural farm aid packages which are 
necessary.  One of the key issues for us in the House is not just 
small business and financing for small business but making sure 
that our farm families have at least equal support from our 
national government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are the only country in the OECD that does not have a 
national agricultural policy or a program to assist our farmers. 
When the Liberal government eliminated the Crow benefit we were 
told that it was according to requirements of GATT and the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France, and 
raised the issue with farmers and farm members of parliament from 
36 European countries that subsidize their agricultural needs and 
farm families.  I said that the Liberal government in Canada was 
eliminating the Crow benefits, a farm agricultural transportation 
subsidy, because of the WTO. I asked whether they were to 
eliminate subsidies in their countries which, by the way, total 
about 60 cents on the dollar for European farmers from their 
governments.  We total about 2 cents on the dollar in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said that GATT and WTO gave them five years to address 
their subsidies to farmers.  The Liberal government eliminated 
these subsidies at the first possible opportunity.  We are seeing 
not just farmers going bankrupt in record numbers.  We are also 
seeing the transportation system being ripped apart by the 
government as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, these European parliamentarians and the agriculture 
committee of the Council of Europe said that under no 
circumstances would they abandon their farmers to benefit the 
United States of America in its need to have reduced subsidies 
for other farmers except its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been three years since I have spoken to these politicians 
in Europe.  They said their subsidies were intact but their 
farmers were still suffering but not as much as farmers in Canada 
because they have a basic support package from their national 
government and our government does not provide one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Bill C-53 is a work in progress. It should be 
forwarded to the standing committee on industry for a detailed 
review to make sure that small businesses have an opportunity to 
access funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard representations from the small business community 
and some of their representatives such as the Canadian Federation 
of Independent Business and others saying that one of the 
important requirements of small business is access to capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned that small business continue to have 
access to capital.  The bill will provide small businesses with 
an opportunity to obtain some guaranteed loans which will be 
totally financed by the businesses in question.  This is not a 
subsidy program but a loan guarantee program which I feel is very 
necessary, particularly for the small business community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will raise a couple of concerns about the bill.  It is 
basically an update of the Small Business Loans Act, the SBLA, 
which has been very successful over the years because businesses 
can apply directly to an authorized lending institution for a 
loan and their requirements can be met with respect to the SBLA 
and now the new Canada small business financing act, the CSBFA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic parameters of SBLA are not changed in the bill, 
according to my information.  There will still be asset based 
debt financing to businesses with less than $5 million in annual 
sales.  The loans will remain capped at up to $250,000 per 
business.  There will be a maximum amount eligible for financing, 
which is 90% of the cost of assets.  There will also be a one 
time registration fee of 2% which is paid to the government to 
apply for this loan once it is accepted.  The loan period will 
remain pretty much static. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative by government is important to small business 
because 30,000 firms apply each year under the program. It is not 
$250,000 per approved application.  It actually averages to 
around $68,000 per loan.  For some people that may not sound that 
large, but we have to understand that there are some very 
interesting structures in the Canadian small business area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Thompson Lightstone & Company Limited just 
completed a study in 1998 with respect to small business.  It 
found that two-thirds of small and medium enterprises report 
annual sales of less than $500,000 a year.  Thompson Lightstone 
also reported that 49% of all businesses report sales of less 
than $250,000 a year.  This is up from 43% the previous year. 
From 1997 to 1998 we saw an increase from 43% to 49% of all 
businesses with less than $250,000 a year in sales. This study 
also showed that small and medium enterprises employed on average 
only seven full time people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is trying to kick the heck out of small 
companies that are trying to create jobs and trying to sell 
services and products in this country and abroad.  Yet it expects 
in return support from the small business community.  The small 
business community will be quite interested in its comments with 
respect to the bill and to small business.  They will be 
distributed across the country by all members of parliament who 
support some kind of financing mechanism for small business.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I want to make is that the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business did a study of its membership.  There are 
between 70,000 and 90,000 members, depending on the year. 
However, 27% of CFIB members believe that the availability of 
financing is a problem.  If the bill is killed by the Reform 
Party 27% of all existing businesses will be concerned because 
there will be almost zero availability for much of their 
financing problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This figure does not quite jibe with the Lightstone statistics. 
Lightstone says a top of mind issue of small and medium 
enterprises is about 10% but that is because when the CFIB poll 
its members it gave them a choice of about 10 issues:  which of 
these 10 issues are important to you and are first at mind? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Lightstone polling is more of a cold random sample.  It 
calls up small business people who are very busy trying to do 
their jobs and keep their businesses going.  They are caught on 
the phone and have to answer these questions.  The first thing 
that comes to the minds of most business people is that they need 
more customers and more revenues.  This is very important, but in 
terms of key issues facing the viability of small business 27% is 
a number which has been consistent throughout the years in all 
the research I have seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Lightstone report also provided interesting information with 
respect to businesses.  Lightstone said that 18% of the hundreds 
of thousands of small business enterprises used an SBLA type of 
loan guarantee and another 6% used some other form of loan 
guarantee, be it a provincial government or a federal government 
loan program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 26% of small and medium enterprises are rural based.  The 
member for Souris—Moose Mountain indicated earlier that 
agriculture was a problem and that it would not really help the 
business community in his riding.  He made a good point, but I do 
not think he understands that 26% of these small and medium 
enterprises are rural based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important statistic I find with respect to the 
breakdown of businesses and where they operate from in the 
Lightstone report is the figure that 28% of all small businesses 
are home based.  That is a tremendous figure.  It is a huge 
figure which is backed up by Statistics Canada in its national 
registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is attacking home based enterprises and other 
small and medium enterprises by cutting off any opportunity they 
may have for obtaining loan guarantees, which I remind members 
are basically self-funding and self-financing from the business 
community that uses them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may argue that the auditor general had some concerns.  Yes, 
indeed the auditor general had some concerns with respect to the 
Canada Small Business Loans Act.  I happen to have some comments 
from the auditor general in this regard.  He was very concerned 
about the accountability of some of these loans.  He was very 
concerned about how some businesses were abusing it with the 
co-operation of certain financial institutions.  He had some 
other concerns in terms of auditing and keeping track of the 
numbers and the government's potential liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These concerns are legitimate and I think all members of the 
House would support them.  The bill should be referred to 
committee so that these concerns could be raised one more time 
and the government could provide assurances in the bill at 
committee that the auditor general's concerns will be addressed 
and that the the very minor abuse by financial institutions and 
by some businesses alike will be addressed and cleaned up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see in the SBLA program that 177,000 new loans from 1993 to 
1997 were approved with loan guarantees.  The total was about 
$11.2 billion, a significant amount of money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party have other concerns to raise with 
the House.  The concerns are more related to the pilot projects 
the bill is going to undertake.  Two pilot projects are proposed. 
One is to extend the program's guarantee to cover capital 
leasing and the other is to improve the voluntary sector as 
eligible borrowers.  We are concerned about the design of these 
projects.  We would like to raise with the Treasury Board 
minister and the Minister of Finance our concern that it becomes 
a regulatory process in terms of approving these loans.  They are 
not as transparent as they should be.  The auditor general has 
indicated that there should be some transparency in approving 
these loans certainly with respect to the regulation thereof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is cost recovery under this program.  We believe that if 
there is a cost recovery component in these regulations the act 
will be very beneficial to small business.  The CFIB has some 
concerns about capital leasing.  It is concerned that the 
$250,000 limit is quite high.  It is concerned as is the auditor 
general about larger firms beating the system.  It is concerned 
that the data collection and the monitoring are poor and should 
be improved. We want to see this bill referred to committee so we 
can raise these matters on behalf of small business and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel along with the CFIB that there may be some politicizing 
of this bill in particular as we are providing the volunteer 
sector with access to the SBLAs.  The volunteer sector is a very 
important sector in this country.  It benefits by receiving 
charitable donations and other donations which are tax supported 
through the tax system.  We are concerned this is just one more 
way of saying to the volunteer agencies that we are not going to 
provide any more funding to you but we will let you borrow money 
through guarantees in the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to see this bill referred to committee for further 
study.  We want to make sure home based businesses, first nation 
people and women are not excluded from the program.  We want to 
make sure the banks in this country are able to discriminate 
between small and large businesses.  We are also very concerned 
about the mergers of the banks and how those will affect access 
to capital for small businesses.  The merging of the banks is 
economically a very dangerous situation for our country.  We 
would like to see the mergers stopped because with respect to 
this bill and small business the banks have admitted they have 
failed in their delivery of small business financing and access 
to capital for small business.  We want to make sure the small 
business community is given a fair shake in terms of reviewing 
capital.  I look forward to discussing this bill further in 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from the NDP for his speech. 
However, I will correct him on a number of points.  The hon. 
member suggests that we are somehow against the notion of this 
bill.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Reform Party 
has been on the cutting edge of providing constructive, effective 
and pragmatic solutions in order to revamp our economy and make 
it a nimble, aggressive tool for the people of Canada in the 21st 
century. It is unfortunate that neither his party nor the 
government has done as much as they could do on that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member alluded to what the auditor general mentioned.  These 
were not just small concerns.  They were large concerns, concerns 
of accountability.  The auditor general said very clearly that 
90% of the loans in the act would already have been made by 
private sector banks and that there was no need of money from the 
government.  In other words, the taxpayer did not need to 
subsidize loans to the private sector.  In this era of declining 
resources and a lack of money on behalf of all governments to 
provide for programs we already have, we are opposed to the 
taxpayer subsidizing the private sector on loans it would already 
be getting.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect the taxpayer is subsidizing the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my hon. friend and colleague whether he will 
join with the Reform Party in holding the government to task to 
make sure this act is going to ensure the monies available are 
going to small businesses that would not normally get a loan from 
the bank and that accountability is put into the system so monies 
will be invested in such a way that they come back to the 
taxpayer and we have an ongoing replenishment of the cycle.  This 
is what the Reform Party is very much in favour of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns we have in the New Democratic Party is the 
same concern he has and the same concern the auditor general has, 
to make sure the abuses that have been taken with the SBLA 
program are eliminated, the abuses larger businesses have been 
instrumental in participating in, the banks in a co-operative 
sense helping them abuse the system.  These should be addressed 
and terminated.  That is why we want to see the bill sent to 
committee, to make sure these points are raised, that there is 
clarification and that there is no opportunity in the future for 
abuse to take place such as this. I agree with the member on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP believes that a government has to be accountable, that a 
government has to be responsible and that a government has to 
deal fairly with the people it governs.  We have proven this for 
37 of 52 years in governing the province of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saskatchewan we have been re-elected time after time on these 
three principles because we do not just preach but we take action 
and implement the programs that Liberal-Tory-Reform coalitions do 
not support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan had 11 consecutive surplus budgets under the NDP 
government of Allan Blakeney, no debts at all in the province of 
Saskatchewan, free dental care for children 18 years of age and 
under, the lowest tax rate in the country, the lowest 
unemployment rate in the country, an almost free drug 
prescription program in the seventies and early eighties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the Reform style governments of Mr. Grant Devine 
take all those programs, eliminate them, drive our province into 
$16 billion in debt for one million people.  Some Reformers in 
the House of Commons were supporters of Mr. Devine.  They are now 
saying they are going to be accountable and responsible. I do not 
think one person in Saskatchewan believes that to be the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for the Reform Party may not agree with this.  I ask 
the Reform Party members from Alberta and British Columbia to 
talk to people from Saskatchewan who have experienced the Reform 
style government of Grant Devine which promised and implemented 
the same promises they are blaming for their economic solutions 
and who butchered our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This small business Bill C-53 deserves full debate.  It does not 
deserve silly games that the Reform Party like to play with it. 
Business is business in this country.  Business is serious. 
Business supports families. Business creates jobs. It is my view 
that when this bill gets to committee we will be able to discuss 
this fully and have the Reform Party put forward its 
recommendations that Grant Devine put forward which proved to be 
total and utter failures.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very interested in the comments of my hon. 
colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell members a little story.  I was talking to a 
businessman who runs a small sawmill in British Columbia not far 
from where I live.  He said that when the NDP took over the 
government in British Columbia he had $200,000 in the bank.  He 
said that of course is long gone.  He said that after this NDP 
government last year he had a really good year. He lost only 
$10,000. 
This is what the NDP has done to British Columbia.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Small Business Loans Act is an important piece of 
legislation.  It is to support small business people, 
entrepreneurs who are trying to create business, opportunities 
and employment in Canada.  But it takes the initiative of the 
government, it takes the support of the provincial government and 
it takes the courage of the entrepreneurs to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the difficulty with this bill as the auditor general has 
pointed out is that there are too many conflicting ideas about 
how many jobs it is creating and the government overestimates 
this.  He also has said that this bill is supporting the lending 
institutions probably more than the small business people and I 
believe this should be rectified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member, in light of what is 
happening in British Columbia, how his socialistic premises are 
going to improve the opportunities of small business people when 
governments like the New Democratic Party government in British 
Columbia have done everything that they can to bring small 
business and big business to its knees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have seen firsthand in 
Saskatchewan a Reform style of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  How about British Columbia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  If the member will give me one moment 
to answer the question.  He has given an example of one business 
that has lost $10,000 and that is very sad. I was very 
thoughtful and listened to his question and he does not want to 
do that because he knows that he has a real problem. There is an 
old saying in Saskatchewan with respect to what Reformers are 
yipping and yapping from their seats on. When you throw a rock in 
the dark and you hit a dog and a dog yelps, you've hit a dog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we have here.  We have hit a dog because we have 
seen the policies of the Reform Party in Saskatchewan in 1982 to 
1991.  They promised fewer taxes, fewer services, less 
government. We have higher taxes, low services and huge debt. 
People in Saskatchewan were so ticked off with the Reform Party 
that it does not exist any more provincially.  It abolished 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only 18 Reform members of the legislature under the Devine 
Liberal-Reform coalition ended up being charged and found guilty 
with respect to how they governed the country.  I believe that is 
the proof of the pudding.  When we get Reform style governments 
governing and 18 of them are charged and found guilty as a result 
of their activities in delivering governments in the province 
they can deliver, that is the proof of the pudding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I believe 
this member is very close to imputing improper motives to fellow 
members of the House.  That is against the rules of this House. I 
would ask him to withdraw that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I did not hear the hon. member 
imputing motives.  But perhaps he could clarify the situation for 
the Chair.  Perhaps the hon. member for Elk Island could tell us 
what was imputing motives.  I thought the hon. member was 
discussing problems with the government in Saskatchewan, not with 
the government here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am a businessman by 
profession.  I was in business for six or seven years.  There was 
a saying in Saskatchewan under the old Reform style government of 
Grant Devine.  How do you start a small business in Saskatchewan 
under the Reform style government of Grant Devine?  Every 
business person in the province was saying at that time you start 
a big business and you wait a year under the Reform style 
policies.   That was the result of the Reform style government 
of Grant Devine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are really concerned about being associated with 
Mr. Devine, but they were and they are.  I do not begrudge them 
the fact that they want to duck that relationship that has been 
proven through membership cards in Saskatchewan that many of the 
supporters of the Reform Party in Saskatchewan held.  They do not 
want to be associated with that. That is fair game. They can duck 
that as they see fit.  But the record shows very clearly that the 
Reform style government of Grant Devine in Saskatchewan in the 
1980s was clearly a bad government.  I would hope that the Reform 
Party members have learned a lesson from that and apologize to 
this country for the disgraceful performance of their government 
in the 1980s.

will try not to be quite as partisan as the last two speakers who 
rose to speak to Bill C-53, the the Canada small business 
financing act.  Perhaps later on I will explain to the hon. 
member from the NDP that there are provincial governments across 
this country which do have the proper policies in place to 
encourage small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make no mistake about it.  Small business is the backbone of the 
Canadian economy.  It is the small businessmen, the small 
businesswomen and small businesses themselves which hire people 
and give them the opportunity of having employment in our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is those small businesses which have to be assisted in some 
fashion in order to identify and achieve the necessary working 
capital and the operating capital that is required to develop and 
start a small enterprise or a medium enterprise, referred to as 
SMEs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, it was the 1961 Progressive Conservative 
government of John Diefenbaker which introduced the first 
legislation concerning small business, the Small Business Loans 
Act.  For over 37 years it has helped small businesses achieve 
those finances that are absolutely required to put them in place 
and help the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, I should say off the bat that the critic for our 
party, the hon. member for Markham, obviously agrees in principle 
with the legislation that has been put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are, as there are in every piece of legislation, 
problem areas.  At committee stage it is hoped that the 
amendments which will be put forward by the opposition parties 
will be listened to logically by the government because, quite 
frankly, no government has a lock on ideas on how to make 
legislation better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Logical amendments that should be put in place will come forward 
in committee to make this piece of legislation better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I want to talk about small business in general.  Perhaps 
the hon. member from the NDP, who attacked other provincial 
governments and policies which they have put in place, may well 
want to listen to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Manitoba small business is appreciated for 
what it really can do.  Let me give some ideas and examples of 
what has happened in my province just recently in developing what 
I consider to be a business friendly environment, something which 
has not happened, as was mentioned earlier, in the province of 
British Columbia.  In fact, businesses are being chased away and 
are leaving in droves the province of British Columbia to go to 
other business friendly environments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about the environment in Manitoba which now has, if 
not the best, one of the best economic opportunities of the last 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the business friendly environment involves taxation. 
Taxes in the province of Manitoba have been reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Workers' compensation assessment rates have fallen by 22% since 
1988, the time of an NDP government, and will fall a further 5% 
in 1999.  A regressive payroll tax has been reduced in the 
province of Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The payroll tax exemption has increased from $100,000 to $1 
million.  That means that small businesses which have a payroll 
less than $1 million will be exempt from a regressive payroll tax 
in Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The payroll tax rate will decline from 2.25% to 2.15% in 1999 
which means that those businesses whose payroll is over $1 
million will pay less in payroll taxes in 1999 than they do 
currently.  That is another reduction of a regressive payroll 
tax.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The capital tax exemption has risen from $1 million to $5 
million which means there is a reduction in capital taxes to 
small business enterprises.  That makes it much easier for those 
enterprises to do business in the province of Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The retail sales tax has, since 1991, been applied alongside the 
federal GST.  It was previously applied on top of the federal 
manufacturers sales tax.  We do not have to go into the benefits 
of the GST, which removed a very regressive manufacturers sales 
tax and which made our ability as Canadians to compete with 
international markets much easier and much better.  This tax was 
implemented by the Progressive Conservative government and then 
embraced by the existing government, which said “We will scrap 
the GST”.  The GST was not scrapped and is now an unnecessary 
evil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electricity used in mining and manufacturing activities in 
Manitoba is now sales tax exempt.  I wish the NDP government of 
British Columbia would listen because these business friendly 
improvements were made in the province of Manitoba to increase, 
not decrease, the economy of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about small and medium enterprises it is necessary 
to recognize that they are the economic backbone of our country. 
The people who we see walking in the streets are the people who 
are employed by these corporations.  These people pay substantial 
taxes to the federal government.  I mention this because the 
government not only has an opportunity under Bill C-53 to make it 
easier for small and medium enterprises, it could also make it 
much easier for those same enterprises if it would embrace the 
concept of less taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a prime opportunity before us, which is the reduction 
of EI premiums.  Over the last two weeks in the House we have 
talked about what should happen to the $19 billion surplus in the 
EI account.  We have heard from the government that the surplus 
is going to be used in whatever way it sees fit, for education or 
health care or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a responsibility to look after education and 
health care.  It has done a very poor job by reducing by $6 
billion the transfer payments that should be put into those 
services which Canadians wish to have.  That does not mean that 
the moneys that came from the EI fund, an insurance fund, should 
be used for those purposes.  The law states that when there is a 
surplus the surplus should be returned to those people who 
invested in the fund.

has been calculated for the EI employment premium contribution is

reduction of $1.20 could be put in place now for employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we talking about in Bill C-53?  Small businesses which 
employ people.  Reducing EI premiums would be a way to allow 
dollars to go back into those businesses.  It would allow those

enhancing our economy.  Not only does this apply to the employer.

per $100.  The break-even rate for employee EI premiums is $1.83.

</I></B></P><P align=left>EI premiums for employees could be reduced to $1.83.  But no, 
the government likes to have a $6 billion to $7 billion annual 
surplus, raised from the taxes of not only the employees but the 
employers.  Now the government has the opportunity to use it as a 
slush fund for wonderful political projects which, quite frankly, 
do not do one iota of good for the small businesses which are 
paying all those costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is it unfair, I believe that under the act it is 
illegal.  I am sure the Minister of Finance and the government 
will change that in order to use that money as a slush fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a necessity to assist small and medium size enterprises. 
Right now we have this piece of legislation before us.  It is 
good legislation because it was put in place by a good government 
in 1961.  However, legislation has to be adapted as the years go 
by.  Things have changed over the last 37 years and we have to 
adapt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the government has not adapted quite enough with 
Bill C-53.  Having it go to committee is the right thing to do. 
But the very right thing to do is to have the government listen 
when it goes there, to have the government listen to very good 
amendments from the Progressive Conservative Party so that we can 
make this legislation better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give one example of an area where the government does not 
have the vision to look forward to how business should be done in 
the future.  I am talking about the knowledge-based industries. 
If members of the government or members of other opposition 
parties actually talked to their constituents, their businesses 
and the people, they would recognize that achieving working 
capital and operating capital for a nuts and bolts business is 
easier than achieving that same capitalization for a 
knowledge-based industry because with a knowledge-based industry 
the asset is intellectual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be difficult for government to understand that.  I can 
appreciate that, but I am sure that in committee we will be able 
to lay it out in simplistic terms so that it will understand that 
with the intellectual asset requirement in small businesses we 
have to change the way we do business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry has actually stood in this House and 
said that he embraces the knowledge-based industries.  But there 
is nothing in Bill C-53 that will achieve that.  What we have to 
do is make sure that the government recognizes that and adds to 
this piece of legislation the ability for intellectual properties 
and knowledge-based industries to be treated equally, as are 
other types of small businesses trying to achieve the necessary 
working capital for their industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the outset, we agree in principle with Bill C-53. 
However, we would like to see some of those necessary changes. 
There are some minor changes and there are some major changes, as 
I mentioned, concerning intellectual properties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only one small part of what it takes to achieve success 
for our small businesses.  I would like to suggest very strongly 
that it is necessary not only for the Minister of Industry to 
make the changes, but for the Minister of Finance to make the 
necessary changes to make sure that we are successful in keeping 
this very vital part of our society in business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Reform Party talked about the agricultural 
sector.  I, too, am very familiar with that as I have been very 
familiar with small business for most of my working life.  There 
is no doubt and no question in my mind that the agricultural 
industry in this country right now is being adversely affected by 
a number of factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One obviously is the major global economic downturn, particularly 
in Asian markets.  Agricultural industries are also being 
affected by an ineffectual government.  We must ensure that trade 
deals which have already been negotiated are complied with. It is 
not happening, as we see now in the northern states of the United 
States.  In fact governors, unilaterally, are suggesting that we 
are not complying with our own rules of trade, which is not the 
case.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of the day is ineffectual in making sure that 
those states comply.  It is affecting my producers and our 
country's agriculture industry. That is only another part of how 
this government has unfortunately neglected small business in the 
agriculture industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about a number of other things with respect to 
agriculture but at this time I will suggest only one thing. We 
would like to see the government have an open mind when this 
legislation comes back to the House and when it is dealt with at 
the committee level. Our critic, the member for Markham, will be 
at the committee table. I hope the government will listen with an 
open mind.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
do want to thank my colleague from Brandon—Souris for support in 
moving this bill to committee as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one comment I wanted to make is to correct something my 
colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca made in response to the 
previous speaker.  He was talking about the number of loans that 
might or might not have been made without the Small Business 
Loans Act.  I believe the figure he referred to was 90% that 
would have been approved even without the act being in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of parliament received some documentation from the 
Minister of Industry on Bill C-53 entitled “Meeting the Changing 
Needs”.  In that document there is an item about incrementality, 
in other words, measuring the extent to which loans made under 
the program would not have been made at all or would have been 
made under less favourable terms in the absence of the SBLA 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to quote from the document. “While incrementality 
is difficult to determine, studies have shown that under a broad 
interpretation, as many as 86% of loans guaranteed under the 
program since 1995 are incremental”.  This means that either 
these loans would not have been made at all to the small 
businesses concerned, and that is 54% of firms, or they would 
have been made under less favourable terms, and that applies to 
32% of firms applying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wanted to have that on the record.  Even recognizing it 
is difficult to draw firm conclusions about the subject of 
incrementality, the latest studies that the Department of 
Industry had undertaken on its behalf have shown that it is a 
very significant program in terms of making access to capital 
available to small businesses. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from the government for his 
comments.  I would be very interested and curious in seeing the 
document he presented to the House because it flies in the face 
of information that I have received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak on Bill C-53, the small business loans 
bill.  At the outset I would like to say that we in this party 
have been very much in favour of trying to find innovative ways 
in which small businesses can become more aggressive in trying to 
meet the challenges in their need to acquire capital in order to 
grow and become competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we agree with the notion of this bill and its intent, we 
have a difficult time with parts of it.  The auditor general 
supports our contention that there needs to be more 
accountability in the system to ensure that the moneys go to 
businesses and that there is a mechanism of determining that the 
money actually goes to the businesses that need it.  We must also 
ensure that those moneys are repaid, that they come back to the 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found that the moneys are being disbursed to companies that 
would by and large already receive bank loans.  In effect this 
bill has been subsidizing the banks.  The banks do not need 
subsidization. They are making some pretty fat profits and have 
been doing so for some time in spite of the recent downturn the 
entire economy is facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the larger issue, our legislative agenda for the next few 
months is about as useful as pabulum. Look at the situation in 
our country today.  The really big issues are a plunging loonie, 
an economy that is in the doldrums and an international crisis 
the proportions of which we have not seen since the Great 
Depression. 
Our health care system is collapsing.  The CPP is in dire 
straits.  And we see issues for the House to spend time debating 
that have very little meaning to those grand problems that affect 
Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to get back to dealing with the large issues.  We need 
to use this House in a way that we can find the best solutions 
from within Canada and around the world and apply them to the 
problems at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health care system is eroding. Canadians are in pain and are 
on enormously long waiting lists.  The future of the CPP is in 
crisis.  Our economy is falling apart.  And we are looking at 
small, minuscule issues dealing with these problems if we deal 
with them at all. Let us get down to brass tacks.  Let us get 
down to the real issues at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important issue that Bill C-53 deals with is the economy.  We 
have seen the lowering dollar.  There has been a consecutive 
decline in the the GDP over the last four months.  We have an 
unemployment rate which is 4% higher than that of the United 
States.  Our productivity has declined.  Our productivity was 
significantly lower than that of the U.S. when our dollar was 90 
cents.  It is still low at 65 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public may or may not be aware of this, but our dollar is 
declining for many reasons.  Some people point fingers at the 
Asian flu.  Some people point fingers at the Russian meltdown. 
The bottom line is when we point a finger at something, three 
fingers point back at us.  It is true that some of these things 
are out of our control but many are within our control.  There 
are many constructive suggestions that we can employ.  The Reform 
Party challenges the government to employ some of these 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we get our productivity up?  The Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business put out a document three days ago.  It 
articulately and eloquently shows that youth want to work but 
they are unable to work for many reasons.  One of the biggest 
reasons they are unable to work are our high taxes. The 
government needs to reduce taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some specific solutions that my colleagues have spoken 
about.  We spoke about reducing EI premiums.  Let us also reduce 
the CPP premiums.  This is a provincial responsibility, but let 
us also look at reducing workmen's compensation premiums which 
also contribute to choking off the private sector.  Let us also 
remove the existing surtaxes that crush the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are surtaxes such as the capital gains tax.  It impedes 
the private sector's ability to take moneys it has invested, sell 
things such as real estate and reinvest that money into the 
business.  The capital gains tax restricts the movement of 
capital within our system thereby reducing our productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should work with the provinces to decrease those 
taxes.  I challenge the finance minister to bring together his 
provincial counterparts within the next two weeks to discuss 
these issues, make a plan and institute it as soon as possible. 
By doing this we can make ourselves more competitive, not by 
reducing the loonie but by dealing with the structural reasons of 
why our country is non-productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the history of the United States, the 1920s, the 
1960s under President Kennedy, and the 1980s, every time there 
was a reduction in taxes there was a huge increase in the 
effectiveness of the economy.  Why?  There are increased savings 
and increased investment.  There is also a greater desire to work 
because we know that the more we work, we will not have more 
money taken away from us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also see a reduction in the black market, a significant 
problem in our country.  By reducing these tax loads we will be 
able to reduce the black market.  In 1992 under Prime Minister 
Mulroney we found that more moneys came into the public coffers 
for the reasons I previously mentioned.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can deal with facts.  Looking back in history we can see the 
constructive solutions that have already worked we and can apply 
them in 1998 to make them work for the people of our country 
today. I caution that this will not compromise the people who are 
most impoverished. It will make them more employable and will 
allow them to have more funds.  It will rescue our social 
programs by making more funds available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reducing taxes will allow us to deal with another important 
structural problem, the brain drain which my colleague spoke 
about earlier.  In 1997 we lost 46,500 of our best and brightest 
people to the United States alone. Compare that with 1990 when we 
lost 20,500.  That is a substantial difference. There has been a 
substantial change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our best and brightest, the crème de la crème of our country are 
going south, not necessarily because they want to live there but 
because they see far greater opportunities there. Comparing the 
tax structures, after tax a family of two in the U.S. makes 44% 
more than a family of two wage earners in Canada.  How can we 
compete with that?  We cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year the business community combined with the 
educational community to provide a number of constructive 
solutions to deal with another factor that could improve our 
economy, the educational system.  It involved innovative 
partnerships between the private sector and the educational 
system that would do much to address one of the core pillars of a 
strong, nimble and effective economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a nutshell, the business round table had many recommendations. 
It recommended that all students learn at significantly higher 
levels and that the curriculum content reflects the higher 
expectations we would have of students.  It recommended that 
instructional strategies and school choices vary to ensure 
success for all and that the system be based on performance by 
using a broad range of assessment tools.  It recommended that 
schools have a major role in decision making, which would 
alleviate the rigid control over schools in what they can do. 
Schools should receive rewards for success, assistance to improve 
and penalties for failure to be effective teachers of today's 
youth.  A major emphasis should be placed on staff development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The round table also recommended that employee unions at 
individual schools be required to grant waivers on certain 
contract provisions governing the hiring and firing of teachers 
and principals and on the participation of staff in academic and 
financial planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot overemphasize the importance of those recommendations. 
If we are going to have an effective, nimble and aggressive 
economy, we have to change our educational system.  We have to 
give schools some control over what they do in terms of teaching. 
They must have control over their budgets.  They also must have 
the ability to be assessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Teachers federations have traditionally been completely opposed 
to an assessment of a teacher's performance.  I feel this is 
wrong. Good teachers will benefit from the system because they 
will not only be keeping their jobs but they will also be 
rewarded for doing a good job. It would add the needed element of 
incentive into the teaching profession.  It would remove from the 
system teachers who are not doing a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any system, including this one, those who are not doing a 
good job get turfed. That may sound ruthless but when we are 
dealing with the future of our youth, we must give them the best 
opportunities we can. We owe it to the youth of today to ensure 
they have an opportunity for the best education possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must strive not only to help those who are among the most 
underprivileged and disadvantaged.  We must also encourage those 
who are the best in our system and give them the challenges they 
require to become individuals who can contribute greatly to our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister could do a couple of other innovative 
things.  There is presently a limit on the amount Canadians can 
devote to foreign investment.  It is now at 20%.  The government 
should increase that to 30%. 
That would go a long way to enabling people to provide for their 
future.  As we in the House all know, the CPP will not be there 
for those in my age group and younger as it has been for previous 
generations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister could actually expand RRSPs, have a 
designated RRSP amount. Those moneys could then be used to invest 
in the private sector, in small to medium size businesses on 
Canadian soil.  If the finance minister were able to expand 
RRSPs, it would not be a lodestone around the taxpayer neck.  It 
would also enable Canadians to invest in Canadian companies on 
Canadian soil and create Canadian jobs.  It would be an important 
tool for increasing investment and innovation in the private 
sector by using the dollars that already exist.  It would not 
rely on taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important facet the prime minister and the finance 
minister should look at to enable us to put money into the 
private sector and to enable the private sector to do research 
and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss in suggesting that we not ensure the research 
and development system including the National Research Council 
have the moneys to do the very good research it does.  It should 
be encouraged to partner with the private sector so that it will 
have the moneys to build another pillar of the private sector, 
the research and development section.  Therein we would have a 
much more productive and effective economy for the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am delighted to address the hon. member's comments.  He dealt 
with education.  I realize he championed the national headstart 
program, the early childhood intervention program.  Fortunately 
the aboriginal headstart program is well on its way and is 
serving a greater purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share with him a vision of education.  One of the 
first obligations of the country to first nations occurred when 
the aboriginal people negotiated the future of their people. 
Education and health were major priorities.  Education rights and 
health benefit rights are entrenched in the treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a social democratic country like Canada why do we not have 
tuition free education?  Why do state controls stop after our 
children have gone through school from kindergarten to grade 12? 
Why can we not hold and nurture them until they become adults at 
the age of 21 to 25?  Then they could stand up and take on their 
master's degrees or the Ph.D degrees to attain their careers. 
Tuition for university, technical schools, business schools and 
all trade apprenticeship programs should be supported.  Youth 
need to be prepared a bit longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the hon. member's vision is, because his heartbeat 
seems to be on the socially conscious side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
from the NDP.  I know of his deep interest in aboriginal issues, 
particularly in improving the health, welfare and education 
systems of aboriginal people so that they have the tools to stand 
on their own feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's question was about why we did not have government 
funding for post-secondary education up to and including bachelor 
degrees.  The bottom line is money.  Unfortunately we have a 
limited amount of money and we have to do the best we can with 
the resources we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Reform Party championed the concept of an 
income contingent loan replacement scheme in the last parliament. 
This is a very clever scheme that would provide for a greater 
amount of loans for students. 
Those moneys could actually go into a system that is far more 
accountable and more money would stay in the system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, when a student leaves school loaned moneys would be 
paid back on the basis of the earnings potential of the student, 
rather than current system where the student has to pay the whole 
shot back in a very short period of time, usually at a time when 
it is very difficult to acquire a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House and my hon. colleague in the NDP were able to work 
with us to champion that, we would do a great service to students 
by implementing an income contingent loan replacement scheme 
which would provide for more money for students while not 
extracting more money from taxpayers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a few minutes 
ago the member for Regina—Lumsden stood in the House as a member 
of the NDP and tried to paint himself and his party as being 
defenders of small business in Canada.  I have not heard anything 
more laughable in the last couple of months.  There are comedians 
at work all over the place and this member seems to want to get a 
job doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia there is an NDP government.  It is easy to 
start a small business in that province:  start with a big 
business and it will not be long before it is a small business. 
Another way is to start a small business in British Columbia and 
move it to Alberta.  That NDP government of B.C. has a shockingly 
interventionist attitude and punitive tax levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporate capital tax in British Columbia is a tax paid on 
the value of assets every year whether a business is making any 
money or not, whether one is making a profit or not.  Give me a 
break; the NDP telling us that it is going to be the defenders of 
small business.  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals would try to have us believe that they are the 
defenders of small business in Canada.  I was a small 
businessman.  As a matter of fact it was my time and my 
experience as a small businessman that drove me into the House of 
Commons, that got me involved in politics.  I got mad enough at 
those clowns over there that I had to come here to do something 
to set the situation right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my experience as a small business person:  I was living 
on the west coast of British Columbia, minding my own business, 
trying to earn a living, employing people and trying to get 
along.  What happened?  The federal government continually 
interfered in my business.  Statistics Canada sent me forms to 
fill out.  This was back in the early 1980s.  The first time I 
filled out the forms.  I thought I could do it once.  Then Stats 
Canada started sending them on a regular basis saying that they 
had to be filled out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time involved in filling out the forms was substantial.  I 
reached the point where I said I was not going to do it any more. 
Then the people from Stats Canada said it was against the law and 
if I did not fill them out they could prosecute me and throw me 
in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next I learned that the receiver general wanted to collect his 
payroll taxes.  He wanted them in his bank account on the 15th 
and the last day of every month.  If the money was not in his 
bank account on those dates there was an immediate 10% penalty 
and the interest clock started ticking right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are businesses in rural Canada, which a lot of these 
members do not realize exist, that do not have access to 
electronic banking so they have to pay their taxes in advance. 
That is the level of understanding and comprehension that the 
government has for small business.

year, the government expects the business to start paying taxes 
on its next year's profit before it is even made.  It expects a 
cheque to be sent every month in case a profit might be made. 
That is the level of attitude of the federal government. I cannot 
believe that the government actually tries to paint itself as 
being concerned about small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about lending money to small business because that 
is what the bill is about.  I will speak about a situation that 
happened in my home town.  Our great, wonderful and illustrious 
federal government back in the early 1980s decided to embark on a 
loans program for small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A concrete company in my home town of Kitimat poured ready-mix, 
made concrete slabs and so on.  On rainy days when there was 
nothing else to do, it used its little block plant to make 
concrete bricks.  It was rainy day work and a good fill-in for 
employees rather than the owner of the company sending them home 
during inclement weather.  A fellow in Terrace—they were both 
good business people—decided to go into the block plant 
business.  He got a loan from the federal government and the new 
block plant put the block plant in Kitimat out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about that.  The guy who was already in business 
and paying his taxes for years and years saw his tax dollars 
going to provide a loan to a potential competitor to set up 
business and drive him out of business.   Also the employees that 
were able to work during times of inclement weather were sent 
home.  Those were net effects of the government's policy with 
respect to lending money to small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mean to criticize either one of these businesses.  It 
is just an obvious contradiction.  The private sector ought to be 
providing capital for small business, not the government.  If the 
government would do the right thing, set its own house in order 
and get the fundamentals right, we would not need to be concerned 
about whether small business had access to capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some matters we would like to see the government 
consider.  It has not as yet.  One of these days there will be a 
government on that side of the House that will do these things. 
It should reduce bureaucracy, reduce red tape, reduce payroll 
taxes, reduce personal income taxes and quit meddling in the 
private sector.  Let the private sector get on with what it does 
best.  The government should get out of its way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe the government believes it has some way of 
helping small business in Canada without addressing these 
fundamentals.  The government has shown its willingness to 
continue a rip-off of the EI fund which is hurting small business 
and rank and file Canadian taxpayers, workers, and which will 
take $7 billion in excess out of the economy this year.  How can 
it suggest, with any sense of credibility at all, that it has 
somehow managed to come up with an idea that will help small 
business in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nothing more than mother Ottawa trying to devise another 
interventionist government directed policy.  It is a government 
that, to solve the problems of small business, sets up a program, 
sets up a ministry, sets up a bureaucracy and, by the way, lends 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not try just leaving small business 
alone?  Why does it not try reducing punitive tax levels?  Why 
does it not trying reducing red tape?  Why does it not try 
leaving people alone?  If the government would listen and would 
be willing to consider those ideas, small business in Canada 
would be a lot better off than it is right now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK204">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That an order of the House do issue for copies of all documents 
relating to the Royal Canadian Mint building a coin plating plant 
in Manitoba. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely delighted that finally we 
have a venue for an open and parliamentary debate on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who have been following this story know that it has been 
almost a year now since this story hit the fan, so to speak.  It 
is a situation where approximately 100 jobs in my riding are 
being jeopardized by a decision of the government to build a coin 
plating plant in Winnipeg, the back door of the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might also give another quick little political plug here 
because I think it is very appropriate.  I have a strong 
suspicion that if the plant I am talking about, the private 
enterprise plant Westaim Corporation, were in a Liberal held 
riding we would not be discussing this right now. I do not think 
the issue would have gone this far. That is just a suspicion I 
have, based on my observations of the way this place works and 
what I have seen happen around here in the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get down to the actual issues.  The motion is for the 
production of papers.  The motion specifically says that we want 
to have the papers released that will finally show the truth of 
the decision making process on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in my speech, which will be taking place in the next few 
minutes, a number of questions which I would like to have 
answered.  I am just conjecturing here but I believe there is 
probably already a canned speech ready for the parliamentary 
secretary. My hopes of getting these questions answered is 
somewhere between zero and nothing.  I want to pose them anyway 
and then I am going to urge members of this House in the 
interests of truthfulness, disclosure, openness of government to 
support the motion since if there is nothing to hide then the 
government should be eager to have everything out in the open so 
that the truth can be known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they vote against it, we can only conclude that the 
motivation must be that they want to deal in innuendo and in half 
truths or non-truths in order to justify their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a big challenge for these Liberal members.  I think they 
need to very seriously consider what the implication of their 
vote is.  If they say no, it is really equivalent to the 
shredding of papers in the Somalia affair.  It is a possibility 
that we can have the non-disclosure of all this information. That 
is really all we are after.  Let us have the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing which underlies this question is that government 
decisions, especially as pertaining to the expenditure of money 
and the operation of the business of government which includes 
crown corporations, the mint, should be made prudently and be 
based on true facts. The decisions should be done wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, humbly I submit that some of the facts of 
the case here have been quite systematically ignored.  I want to 
see what those facts are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very briefly, the government proposed last year to build a coin 
plating plant in Winnipeg.  The cost at that time was projected 
to be around $30 million.  Since then there have been two other 
numbers that have been publicized, $31 million and $38 million. 
We do not know at this stage exactly what the final cost of the 
plant will be.  However, we do know that it is a plant of about 
56,000 square feet with a capacity for producing plated coin 
blanks of approximately one-third of the capacity of the Westaim 
plant in my riding which is at issue here.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is the question of savings.  In a press release 
last October it was said this would also lead to savings. The 
first number touted was a saving of $9 million per year and the 
second figure given was $9.5 million per year for a total saving 
of between $18 million and $19 million in a two year timeframe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a saving at all since moving the job from one 
location in the country to another at the expense of one and 
giving it to another is not a real saving.  Furthermore, the 
savings could have also been achieved simply by continuing at the 
original location. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this decision was based on the incorrect answers to 
three questions. First, is there security of supply?  The 
government said no.  I and the people in my riding and the 
Westaim Corporation emphatically say there is security of supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, are there cost savings?  As I indicated in my 
introduction, I will talk more about the real and perceived 
savings and how they can be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, should the government be in business competing with 
existing businesses and threatening them?  This is a 
philosophical question.  I am not sure we will get the answer 
from the papers but it is one which also demands an answer. 
Should government be in an industrial process business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the question of security of supply, Westaim Corporation has 
been a major supplier to the mint since 1961, albeit at that time 
under a different corporate name.  It is the same plant, the same 
organization and it has evolved over time.  Now it runs under the 
name of Westaim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1961 the corporation began producing nickel strip for the 5 
cent coin.  We call them nickels because they are made of nickel 
which came from the Westaim plant in my riding.  In 1968 it began 
supplying the blanks for the dime, the quarter and the 50 cent 
piece.  We all know what high quality coins Canadians have, so 
there is no question about the security of the supply and the 
quality of the supply.  The coin blanks are pressed into actual 
coins by the mint which is a proper function of that crown 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Westaim Corporation has subsequently supplied all the blanks for 
the loonie.  Everyone who has a loonie in their pocket is 
dragging around metal that was produced in my riding.  I want 
everyone, especially Liberal members, every time they look at a 
loonie or spend one to think of the wonderful riding of Elk 
Island just out of Edmonton, Alberta because that is where it 
originated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nickel strip portion of the two dollar coin is made at 
Westaim in my riding, so we have a large contribution to the 
coinage of Canada.  Westaim in its coin production has been a 
solid business for over 30 years.  It is doing just fine. For 
anyone to imply that the security of supply is at risk is totally 
incorrect.  This is an international company.  It produces coin 
products for markets all around the world, including recent large 
contracts to China and Brazil.  Besides supplying Canada's 
domestic market it is a large exporter, thereby helping greatly 
in Canada's economy.  It also does high tech research and 
production.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really intrigues me, since my uncle died in a fire 
accident, is that Westaim produces a very high tech biomedical, 
totally sterile dressing for burn victims.  It markets this all 
over Canada and the United States. It is an expensive but very 
effective product.  It is very good at it.  It has a research 
department in advance display technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently it announced a breakthrough.  We all have these little 
desktop computers.  It could be that very soon computer 
manufacturers will be buying these thin screened, multicolour 
displays from Westaim Corporation in Fort Saskatchewan.  It has 
excellent surface engineered products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It recently announced a breakthrough regarding some fine powder 
materials which are used in the production of these high tech 
rechargeable batteries that all of us have in all our electronic 
equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that sound like a business that is not able to give a 
secure supply?  I guess not, so my contention is the decision was 
made based on less than perfect facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the security of supply and an answer to some of 
the things the minister said, even in this House as a response to 
questions that I raised and also that members of the other 
parties raised, Westaim has offered to the mint, if it is really 
concerned about it, to actually sign a contract, to dedicate the 
production from one line to the mint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, it is ready to say if at any time the mint wants 
to run the same kind of production it will be able to get out of 
its Winnipeg plant it is available right here and right now. 
That is because there is a worldwide oversupply in this market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just boggles the mind when one wonders why the government is 
trying to get into a business in which there is a present 
oversupply and in which there is not a foreseeable future of 
increase since we are moving more and more to electronics, credit 
cards and soon we will probably have cash cards.  Coins are not 
an ongoing growing industry.  They are level at best, with peaks 
admittedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Europeans bring in the new Eurocoin, zippo, there is a 
big demand for large coins.  Canadians decided to have a $2 coin. 
Suddenly there was a demand because from zero the whole country 
had to be supplied with all the coins needed in that 
denomination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the loonie is in production and has been for over 10 
years, the $2 coin now for a few years, the amount of production 
required to replace the coins that are lost or hoarded is not 
anywhere near what it is when a new coin is introduced.  It is 
not a matter of the government getting into a business for which 
there is a huge ongoing and increasing demand.  It is one where 
really what it is doing is upsetting the market and intruding 
into a business that is currently totally adequately covered by 
Westaim Corporation in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say parenthetically with respect to the offer of the one of 
the three lines in the Westaim plant, the minister made a false 
statement in the House on March 24 this year when he said that 
the president of Westaim refused this offer.  That is wrong.  The 
president of Westaim made the offer.  Again, I think we need to 
deal with actual facts when making these decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get to my second question, cost savings. They claim there 
will be a saving of around $9 million to $9.5 million per year. 
The fact is that only a small portion of that saving can be 
attributed to the fact that they will be producing their coin 
blanks in-house instead of purchasing them from Westaim.  The 
largest component of that saving is due to the fact that they are 
changing from a nickel base to a steel base for their coin 
blanks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just the change in material and the cost of the process would 
produce this change and if they were to simply enter into a long 
term arrangement with Westaim, that saving could be achieved, 
just as with their new plant in Winnipeg they are proposing. 
There is only one difference, that the saving could be achieved 
almost immediately instead of waiting for two years until this 
plant is in full operation.  At least we hope it will be in full 
operation.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be a brand new untested plant and, as with all new 
plants, it will have start-up pains. Therefore instead of saving 
$9 million to $9.5 million per year starting in the year 2000 or 
later, we could save that right away.   There is another $18 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister in the House said this is not going to cost the 
taxpayer anything.  That is not true.  The mint is a crown 
corporation.  If it makes money that money accrues to Canadians. 
If it looses money that is money that is lost to Canadians.  If 
it reduces its total net profit that comes essentially and 
eventually from the pockets of the taxpayers of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that if we take the price of $38 million for the plant 
and $9 million a year for two years in savings, we are looking at 
a total of $56 million that the mint is expending when if it 
simply stayed with the present set-up there would be $56 million 
less to spend which is money saved and equivalent to money in the 
taxpayers' pockets. When the minister says this is not going to 
cost the taxpayer anything, it is not so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This comes to my next topic which I am not up to yet but these 
things overlap a bit. They claim to be making money but the fact 
is they will not be making very much money if they are not going 
to compete internationally.  The minister said we were not going 
to compete internationally.  If they are not going to I do not 
know where they will get the money to provide all the domestic 
needs in this country. Unless we get into the business of issuing 
a new coin and a new denomination every other year there will not 
be that big domestic demand. Either they are going to contradict 
what the minister said and compete internationally or they are 
not going to make any money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, if the claim they will be making money it is 
inevitable that they will be making it at the expense of an 
existing corporation, a taxpaying corporation in this country. 
Any business they get which will allow them to make money will be 
money taken directly away from Westaim Corporation in my riding. 
I think that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already spoken about the premise of increasing demand. 
Frankly, the documentation available shows that not to be so. 
That is not correct information.  There is of course a present 
peak in demand for coin production because of the Eurocoin but 
when that passes it is expected to level off and, as I said 
before, the excess of supply in both plated and non-plated coin 
products is somewhere in the neighbourhood of between 30% and 50% 
which is the excess of supply right now.  It is absolutely 
foolish to be getting into this business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me address my third question.  Should the government be in 
the business of competing with business?  My answer is a hearty 
no. It may not do this.  It is an affront to our concept of 
justice and decency for the government to use its clout to 
compete directly in a business with private enterprise.  Would 
we allow if it were to say let's start a factory to build cars 
and compete with the car manufacturing places?  What about a used 
car lot?  Would anyone buy a used car from our Prime Minister?  I 
do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of businesses is the government going to get into?  It 
may not compete directly.  Furthermore, a recent bill in this 
House proposes to give the mint not only additional borrowing 
powers but additional borrowing powers from the consolidated 
fund.  It is terribly unfair to have business <I>A</I> run by the 
government being able to use taxpayer money directly borrowing 
from the consolidated fund in order to compete with a private 
enterprise firm that is doing very well, thank you, as long as 
the government butts out and keeps out of this business.  It has 
no business intruding there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a very great contradiction.  It is the policy of 
this government to not compete with business.  We have noticed 
how it has been privatizing.  NavCan is an example.  All the 
airports in the country are being privatized.  Even some 
components of the military operations are now being put out to 
contract for private involvement.  We also have the government 
printing operations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples of it.  It is getting out of the 
business of being in business in order to let private enterprise 
do its thing.  We already have private enterprise being very 
successful.  The government is incorrectly intruding in it, in 
violation of every decent principle that we could possible think 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge the government to vote in favour of this motion 
of the production of papers.  When the facts are disclosed and 
truly known, and when we look at the contradictions in the debate 
so far, because there are some real sincere questions, hopefully 
we can rationalize this and  even at this late date we can stop 
the government from this inappropriate intrusion into private 
business.

consider it poetic justice that Mr. Epp and I face off once 
again.  We are no longer on private members' together selecting— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know the parliamentary secretary 
would want to refer to the hon. member for Elk Island. I know she 
will want to comply with the rules in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my apologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found the machinations the member for Elk Island went through 
interesting.  He knew we were going to vote for his motion.  I 
guess it gave him an opportunity to rent his clothing and rail 
against the winds for his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion P-16 requests that the Royal Canadian Mint produce 
documents concerning the construction of a new coin plating 
facility at the Royal Canadian Mint location in Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Elk Island already knows, the Standing 
Committee on Natural Resources and Government Operations asked 
for these documents last June.  The Royal Canadian Mint complied 
and sent the documents to the clerk of the committee.  The 
committee will soon reconvene and the documents requested will be 
available for review.  We are on division going to vote for this 
today.  We are going through the exercise, but it must be 
completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the House why we are using our valuable time and resources 
to debate a motion when its goal has already been achieved, 
except for the opportunity for Elk Island to get up once again 
and state his position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me address the benefits of the new plating facility to all 
Canadians. The initial guarantee is that it is a secure cost 
effective supply of plated coinage.  Plated coinage is the 
technology of the future.  Plated coins are less costly to 
produce and are just as durable and attractive as the coinage 
used in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By building this facility, the government will achieve quite a 
large saving.  The mint will pass on savings to the government of 
approximately $10 million per year.  This is extremely important 
to a government that is counting each one of its pennies very 
carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mint is the only corporation mandated for the production, 
sale and distribution of coins in Canada.  It supplies Canadians 
with coins that are of high quality, are cost effective and are 
delivered on time.  The mint must also generate a profit for its 
shareholder, the Government of Canada, by successfully marketing 
its minting services in coinage products worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Canadian Mint is not an appendage of the government as 
was the implication of the member opposite.  It competes in a 
global environment.  Business fundamentals such a market 
analysis, sales, competitive positioning, leading edge technology 
and investment in human resource development are daily 
essentials, as they are with any corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mint does not receive government subsidies.  All its 
operating costs are paid through its revenues or by securing 
financing from private financial institutions.  The member 
opposite knows this.  Making coins for other nations keeps the 
mint presses running at high speed and around the clock, which is 
the most cost effective production technique available. In 1997 
the mint produced over one billion coins for 16 foreign 
countries.  This year it will have upped that number to two 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is expected that the mint's new plating technology will 
continue to be in high demand around the world.  The mint 
estimates the new facility will enable it to generate an 
additional $300 million in annual profits. Construction of the 
plating facility began in April. Construction is on schedule and 
on budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that the entire project has been 
financed by the mint through commercial financial institutions. 
One hundred to one hundred and thirty construction jobs were 
created over the three years of the construction period.  On 
completion it will add 25 to 30 new permanent full time staff to 
its Winnipeg workforce.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Elk Island is understandably concerned about 
the well-being of a company in his riding, Westaim Corporation. 
Let me assure the House that the Royal Canadian Mint does not 
compete with Westaim.  Westaim has been a supplier of the Royal 
Canadian Mint for many years and will continue to be one of 
several suppliers that provide the Royal Canadian Mint with the 
materials it needs.  Westaim is the sole supplier for the 1$ coin 
blank because it holds the patent for this project.  Suppliers 
from Canada, the United States and Europe provide the mint with 
metal strip and coin blanks for the other coins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the world there is a growing demand for lower cost 
circulation coinage.  There will be many opportunities for both 
Westaim and the mint to work together to compete against foreign 
mints which are also expanding to meet the growing demand for 
lower cost coinage, in particular plated coinage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As early as 1991 Westaim informed the mint that it wanted to get 
out of the coin business and we had to make other plans. Westaim 
wanted out of the business and it is not considered to be a 
secure supplier for the mint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mint's coins are preferred by vendors who require two years 
to retool their machines, so let us look at what the cost would 
be to private enterprise.  The mint's process is environmentally 
safe and produces high integrity coins.  The mint needs the 
plating facility to fulfil its mandate and to meet the 
expectations of its customers at home and around the world.  The 
mint is a totally independent crown corporation charged with the 
task of making money, both coins and profit. The plating facility 
is an essential tool that will enable the mint to fulfil its 
mandate to produce secure top quality but cost effective coins 
for Canada and profits for Canada through marketing its coinage 
expertise around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plating facility is essential for the mint to succeed in the 
international coinage business in which it is an active and 
extremely successful player.  It is a dynamic and innovative 
organization in a highly competitive international market.  For 
now and in the future it will continue striving to be the world 
leader in minting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the Royal Canadian Mint has already 
produced the documents requested by Motion P-16 in response to a 
similar request made by the Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources and Government Operations last June.  These documents 
will be available for review as soon as the committee reconvenes. 
Any member of the House may obtain a copy of those documents 
from the clerk of the committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today in the House in support of the motion 
moved by my colleague, the member for Elk Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should comply with such a request.  It is a 
request for clarity.  Parliamentarians should be clearer in the 
requests they routinely make of the government.  When 
constituents tell an MP there is something odd, it is important 
that people can finally say that parliamentarians and MPs are 
really there to stand up for their interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public 
Works gave us the history of the Royal Mint, and of this new 
project. 
This is why I am supporting the motion. She did well to give the 
background, but I support a motion for greater clarity.  That is 
something I find very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a very fast-paced world, and a project of this sort 
involves more than $5 million.  As the Reform Party member says, 
perhaps it is bigger than they think.  We are talking about a 
project involving over $30 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge the House to support the Reform Party member's 
proposal and motion, and tell him that he has the support of 
Bloc Quebecois members.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the member for Elk Island for pursuing this very 
important matter in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the beginning our party has opposed the construction of the 
Royal Canadian Mint's new plant which will manufacture coin 
blanks.  We believe the mint has not been forthcoming with 
Canadians on this new facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion the member has proposed today would give taxpayers 
and members of parliament the opportunity to examine in detail 
the decision making process at the mint which has led government 
to support the decision which will have very terrible 
consequences for Westaim, for its employees and for taxpayers as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me review a few of the facts and arguments that our party 
has talked about in this particular case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Bill C-41 the Liberal government has moved to increase 
the borrowing authority of the Royal Canadian Mint, allowing it 
to build a coin plating plant, another patronage plum, 
incidentally, in the Minister of Foreign Affairs' backyard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That facility would put the mint into direct competition with 
Westaim of Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta.  Because the world market 
for coin blanks is going down, either Westaim will be forced out 
of the business and 110 employees will lose their jobs or the 
Royal Canadian Mint's new venture will go down in flames and 
taxpayers will be on the hook for a minimum of $30 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should the deal be stopped?  Westaim is a legitimate 
Canadian business which has supplied the Royal Canadian Mint with 
coin blanks for 35 years.  It employs 110 people in Fort 
Saskatchewan and the entry of the Royal Canadian Mint into the 
industry would jeopardize the Westaim division and its 110 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry experts agree that the market for coin blanks will 
experience a slight blip in demand as the newer European currency 
starts up and then will continue on a steady decline as 
electronic transactions become more popular and the need for 
coinage and paper money decreases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new coin plating plant will not only replace Westaim as the 
source of supply of coin blanks, but will compete against Westaim 
in the world market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs of getting the mint into the coin blank business are 
enormous.  The $30 million announced is only to build the plant. 
Start-up costs are substantial for a new competitor in a mature 
to declining market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mint will be required to compete against established, 
experienced, well-entrenched competitors who have had years to 
build their expertise and economies of scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only will the Royal Canadian Mint have to contend with a 
high cost structure, but like any brand new business it is going 
to make many mistakes as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is currently a 30% to 40% oversupply in the world coin 
blank market.  The entry of the mint into that market will likely 
either drive Westaim and its 110 employees out of business or it 
will spectacularly go down in flames and take millions of 
taxpayer dollars with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though there is no direct subsidy being proposed in that 
venture, because all money spent by a crown corporation reduces 
dividends paid to the government, ultimately the taxpayer is the 
one who pays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has not approved Bill C-41 that would give the Royal 
Canadian Mint the authority to borrow the money for the new 
plant.  Westaim still has an unresolved lawsuit against the mint 
involving the softening process necessary to make these coin 
blanks.  The mint cannot legally proceed with that venture unless 
it settles both of these outstanding matters, yet construction of 
the plant started in March. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting government right is a Liberal government policy that has 
been around since 1993.  Among other things it stipulates that 
where the private sector can provide a service equal or superior 
to a government department or agency, then government should not 
be in that business.  This venture violates that Liberal 
government policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only reason this is being allowed to happen is because it is 
a patronage plum for the foreign affairs minister's backyard. The 
Westaim plant is in an opposition-held riding.  It is as simple 
as that.  If Westaim were in a Liberal riding this venture would 
never have made it past the cabinet table.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to look any further than the fiasco that the 
Liberal government created in the oil industry in the 1970s to 
know that it does not make sense for the government to take over 
part of an existing industry to compete with private companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back then the Liberals nationalized Petrofina and created the 
national energy program.  That hurt the industry.  It cost jobs 
and taxpayers ended up paying out millions and millions of 
dollars.  All that money was paid out quite unnecessarily.  The 
same problem will happen with the Royal Canadian Mint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June of this year my colleague, the member for 
Tobique—Mactaquac, had the pleasure to meet with the master of 
the mint, Mrs. Danielle Wethrup, and her vice-president of 
finance and administration.  The meeting was an opportunity for 
our party to exchange views and information with the management 
of the Royal Canadian Mint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They made some very convincing arguments concerning security of 
supply.  But when we asked them to show us their business plan, 
they refused.  When we asked them to show us their market 
projections which they claimed indicated a healthy growing 
demand, they did not do that.  When we asked them to show us any 
piece of evidence that could reassure us that the $30 million of 
taxpayer money that was on the line would not be a risky venture, 
they said “You are just going to have to trust us because we 
cannot do that as well”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot trust them in that regard.  As I have indicated, every 
bit of information we have seen on this matter reinforces our 
view that this scheme of the mint's will put Westaim and its 
employees out of business.  It will put 110 people on the 
unemployment rolls and possibly on the provincial government's 
welfare rolls.  It is going to cost millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy at least that government members are going to vote 
for the motion to give access of information to the opposition. 
The motion will give our party access to the information that we 
need to determine the advisability of this proposed venture, and 
specifically if we should support Bill C-41. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the mint to make public all relevant papers on the 
coin plating facility.  I am very pleased indeed that all members 
are going to support that part of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  If the hon. member for Elk Island 
speaks now, I must advise the House that he will close the 
debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is 
exactly what I am going to do.  I am going to thank all members 
of the House for their kind consideration of this very important 
private member's bill.  I appreciate the tone in which the debate 
was held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to respond by saying two things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in a quick response to the letter that was quoted, I do 
not want to do what I think we are finding others guilty of, so I 
would like to simply ask two questions with respect to the 
letter.  I am talking about the statement that is repeated over 
and over by the minister that Westaim gave an intention to go out 
of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask whether the government, in quoting this 
letter, would at some time totally and accurately describe the 
actual circumstances under which the letter of intent was signed. 
Second, is the government prepared to disclose the date on which 
that letter of intent expired and became null and void? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that Westaim is in the business.  It 
was in the business at the time the mint announced its intentions 
to build the plant.  It is a strong company.  It is not a 
question of whether it is intending to vacate that field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize that and to indicate to the government 
that the continued use of that statement is really quite 
inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last statement I would like to make is that I hope as a 
result of this discussion we can get into a wider discussion on a 
basic philosophical question. 
That is, should the government be in the business of competing 
with business?

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One person in my riding, not specifically on the Westaim 
question but on another one, asked whether the government should 
be in the business of competing with business thereby driving out 
the business. It is a fundamental principle which we recognize 
that where the taxpayers are behind the government, it gives the 
government funded operation a huge and unfair advantage. There is 
another case which I did not mention because I ran out of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who buys coinage products?  Everyone probably knows there are 
two main buyers.  There are those who buy some types of coins and 
medals or coins commemorating sovereigns or whatever, and the big 
market is governments.  When any government around the world is 
looking for a supply of coinage products, we have little old 
Westaim, and I say little old strictly and only in comparison to 
Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To many foreign governments, dealing with another government is 
very important.  They have a huge advantage without even talking 
about the actual price at which they bid.  It could happen that 
Westaim in future international bidding contracts could have the 
lower bid and a superior or at least equal product, but would 
lose the bid because other countries want to deal with the 
government instead of a private enterprise. Government has 
absolutely no business being there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that this debate today will be enlarged so that we can 
carry on with that larger debate. I think this is so crucial to 
our whole situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I thank the members of the House.  Let us move 
forward to see if we can bring the facts to the table and get a 
resolution to this deeply philosophical problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is the House ready for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is it the pleasure of the House to 
adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> On division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  That concludes Private Members' 
Business for today.  Although it is not 2.30 yet, we will call it 
that. The House will accordingly stand adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
