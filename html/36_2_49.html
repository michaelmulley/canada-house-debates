</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  You all know our dress code in the 
House.  At times we do permit voting by males who do not have 
shirts and ties on.  Today I am giving special permission to one 
of our members to speak in the House.  He will be wearing a 
turtleneck.  I refer to the hon. member for New Brunswick 
Southwest who has just had a medical procedure.  We will 
therefore relax the rules today as he cannot wear a collar around 
his neck.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in my hands a document offering a brief overview of 
monetary unions of independent states, entitled “Un court 
historique des unions monétaires d'États indépendents”. 
In light of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs' 
introduction of a bill denying the fundamental rights of 
Quebecers, I am requesting the unanimous consent of the House to 
table this document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before continuing, I want to point out that yesterday I 
received a letter from another member concerning a point of

to the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-23 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a question of privilege with regard to Bill C-23, an act 
to modernize the statutes of Canada in relation to benefits and 
obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government let it be known that it would table Bill C-23 on 
Friday, February 11, 2000.  The 
bill was tabled at noon on that day which is the prescribed time 
for tabling bills on a Friday pursuant to Standing Order 30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an e-mail that was sent from John Fisher, Egale@sympatico.ca, 
the author outlined in detail his analysis of Bill C-23.  It was 
sent at 10.56 a.m. on Friday, one hour and four minutes before 
Bill C-23 was tabled in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to do an analysis 
of a omnibus bill such as Bill C-23, the author would have had to 
be in possession of the bill many hours before his e-mail 
transmission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With references from the authorities on parliamentary procedure 
and rulings from two distinguished Speakers, I will attempt to 
defend the integrity, the dignity and authority of the House.  I 
will try to defend against what I view as a mockery of the 
parliamentary system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question of privilege holds the Minister of Justice 
responsible for leaking information and the author of the 
aforementioned e-mail for obtaining and using information 
contrary to parliamentary law and practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This problem is not new.  On April 20, 
1999 the matter of the government leaking a government response 
to a report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs was 
raised in the House.  The next day the government House leader 
apologized for the leak and assured the House it would not happen 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very next day after the apology, the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development stood 
up in the House and quoted from an in-camera meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the parliamentary process is circumvented in this manner, 
the role of the House is misrepresented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 10, 1989 the integrity of the House was also under 
siege and ironically the member who came to the defence of 
parliament was the hon. member for Windsor West, the now Deputy 
Prime Minister.  The Deputy Prime Minister was quoted in a 
Speaker's ruling as saying that it was clearly contempt of 
parliament to misrepresent the role of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Speaker in 1989 did not rule a prima facie question of 
privilege, he did say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the House to understand very clearly that if your Speaker 
ever has to consider a situation like this again, the Chair will 
not be as generous. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 6, 1997 the Speaker said of a similar matter: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the chair acknowledges that it is a matter of potential 
importance since it touches the role of members has legislators, 
a role which should not be trivialized.  The dismissive view of 
the legislative process, repeated often enough, makes a mockery 
of our parliamentary conventions and practices.  I trust that 
today's decision at this early stage of the 36th Parliament will 
not be forgotten by the minister and his officials and that the 
department and agencies will guided by it. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 95 of Marleau and Montpetit it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much like a court of law, the House of Commons enjoys very wide 
latitude in maintaining its dignity and authority through the 
exercise of contempt power, which is inherent to any superior 
court.  In other words, the House may, through its orders 
consider any misconduct to be contempt and may deal with it 
accordingly.  This area of parliamentary law is therefore 
extremely fluid and most valuable for the Commons to be able to 
meet novel situations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House can no longer allow its dignity and authority to be 
mocked in this way.  The consequence of inaction only encourages 
it to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very recently the Prime Minister announced the date of the 
budget outside the House.  As far as I know, this has never been 
done before.  Not only did it put egg on the face of the Minister 
of Finance, but the Prime Minister showed arrogance and 
disrespect for the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not that long ago when the Minister of International 
Trade who on March 30, 1998 sent out a press release entitled 
“Marchi Meets with Chinese Leaders in Beijing and Announces 
Canada-China Interparliamentary Group”.  At that time there was 
no Canada-China interparliamentary group.  The minister gave the 
impression to some one billion people in China that the 
association existed when parliament had not approved it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the naming of the head of the Canadian Millennium 
Scholarship Foundation by this government before there was 
legislation setting up the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the matter raised by the member for Prince George—Peace 
River regarding the Canadian Wheat Board on February 3, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another case involving the Department of Finance was argued on 
October 28, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a litany of cases of leaked committee reports that go 
unchecked and unchallenged.  It is time that we take this matter 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, if you rule this to be a prima facie question of 
privilege, I am prepared to move the appropriate motion today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is important to note that the Speaker ruled in previous cases 
that this problem, an ongoing problem, would not be dealt with so 
kindly in the future as it has been in the past.  In other words, 
I believe the Speaker expressed a good deal of concern that 
information, which should be coming first to the House, is being 
given, for whatever reasons, to other groups and organizations 
and leaked to the media.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that in his past ruling the Speaker said 
that enough is enough and that it is time for the government to 
treat this institution with the respect it deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing which is important to note in this case 
as we enter into the debate on Bill C-23. The objection is not 
with the bill itself which we will oppose for other reasons that 
will be brought forward shortly in debate, but it is for the 
disrespect the government chooses to exhibit toward this place. 
It should be treating this place with the dignity it deserves and 
members of parliament with the dignity they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite seems to think it is just fine to take a 
bill that should be tabled in the House, give it to other people 
ahead of time and get them to issue press releases.  They get 
advance copies even before members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, that is the problem.  That is why I ask that you 
rule that this is a prima facie question of privilege.  The 
member could move the appropriate motion and we could discuss 
this further because again it shows disrespect for the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
member opposite raises a point which is raised in the House from 
time to time.  Members are quite appropriately sensitive to the 
parliamentary traditions and the rules that we follow in 
particular with respect to impending legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case there is an allegation that someone outside the 
House had knowledge of impending legislation.  Of course that is 
not a surprise or a secret to anyone because this legislation had 
been speculated on frequently over the last few weeks.  In fact, 
the government did quite a bit of consultation with citizens on 
the bill.  Notice of the bill being introduced in parliament was 
tabled in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth noting that nowhere is there a suggestion here that 
the individual referred to had a copy of the bill.  It is clear 
that the individual would have had some knowledge of some 
elements of the bill as did members of parliament around the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frequently the press is able to put together enough 
information about impending legislation to write about it before 
the bill is actually introduced.  That is one of the things that 
happened in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just note that the government does consult with citizens 
and groups.  Ministers do it, ministries do it and members of 
parliament do it.  Consequently members of the public do have 
knowledge of elements of impending legislation.  I suggest that 
is what has happened here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that it is not the government, the 
minister or the ministry which has prepared the briefing or 
publicly sent a letter attempting to analyse the bill.  It was a 
citizen. I hope there is no fault alleged in relation to the 
minister here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event I make those comments for the record and hope that 
they will assist the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have listened to the explanation of 
the deputy government House leader. I find it quite ironic that 
he can indicate that an individual would make an in-depth analysis 
of his feelings of the ideas behind a bill. When someone uses the 
term in-depth analysis, it implies that they have the document in 
front of them and have been able to analyse what it all means.  I 
find it is very hard to believe the comments of the deputy 
government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have heard the 
comments from the other side. I want to advise the House and 
yourself that I have in my possession an in-depth analysis that 
has been done on the bill by this particular group which we feel 
this bill was leaked to prior to its being delivered to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The in-depth analysis comments on the terminology used in the 
bill.  It comments on sections of the bill that were included and 
parts that were omitted.  It talks about a detailed analysis of 
this bill. 
I would be quite prepared to table this document for your review, 
Madam Speaker, in consideration of this prima facie breach of the 
integrity of this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
following the introduction of a racist bill denying the 
fundamental rights of Quebecers, I wish to table in this House 
an article from last December 17th's <I>Le Devoir,</I> entitled 
“Jacques Parizeau to <I>Le Devoir</I>: Canada will have no choice but 
to negotiate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to table this document in order to provide some

for unanimous consent to table a document that will enlighten 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document is entitled <I>Le maintien d'une union monétaire avec 
un Québec séparé</I>, and deals with maintaining a monetary union 
with a separate Quebec. I can even quote an excerpt “Since most 
studies show it would be in the interests of a Quebec separated 
from the rest of Canada to uphold a monetary union, why would 
the latter not accept this solution?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the answer “Using a foreign currency is something much 
more complicated than simply declaring it legal tender. A viable 
monetary union would imply a few legal agreements and common 
institutions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I think the hon. member has

is required to process applications for the program and maintain 
a high quality of client service. For instance, the AIDA

free line from producers in Manitoba and Saskatchewan alone. To 
date, more than 51,000 producers across the country have applied 
for assistance and more than $308 million has been paid out to 
applicants. The bulk of applications, more than 36,000, were

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 amends federal legislation so that it reflects these 
values. It ensures respect for the principle of equal treatment 
before the law of persons living in recognized stable 
relationships. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 ensures that federal laws reflect the core values of 
Canadians, values that are enshrined in the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental tenets of Canadian society—fairness, tolerance, 
respect and equality—are touchstones of our national identity 
and serve to enhance our international reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 brings federal statutes into line with these values. 
It ensures that the principle of equal treatment under the law, 
in relation to individuals in committed common law relationships, 
is respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally important, Bill C-23 does so while preserving the 
existing legal definition and societal consensus that marriage is 
the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all 
others.  Let me briefly elaborate on this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This definition of marriage, which has been consistently applied 
in Canada and which was reaffirmed last year through a resolution 
of the House, dates back to 1866.  It has served us well and will 
not change.  We recognize that marriage is a fundamental value 
and important to Canadians.  That value and importance is in no 
way undermined by recognizing in law other forms of committed 
relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timing of this bill is important.  As Canadians have pointed 
out, society is ready for this change.  In fact there have been 
numerous challenges before the courts and human rights tribunals 
concerning the equal treatment of same sex couples.  The results 
of these processes have invariably been the same.  Common law 
same sex couples must be accorded the same access as common law 
opposite sex couples to the social benefits programs to which 
they have contributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ignore either obligations or benefits is discriminatory and 
in violation of both the charter of rights and freedoms and the 
Canadian Human Rights Act.  Indeed, this was the ruling of the 
Supreme Court of Canada in the case of M. v H.  But while the 
courts have provided us with a road map of what needs to be 
changed, the onus is on us as parliamentarians to determine how 
to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Important matters of social policy should not be left to the 
courts to decide.  If parliament does not address the issue, the 
courts will continue to hand down decisions in a piecemeal 
fashion, interpreting narrow points of law on the specific 
questions before them.  This guarantees confusion and continuing 
costly litigation.  Most worrisome, it risks removing us from the 
social policy process altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent surveys more than two out of three Canadians agreed 
that same sex couples should have the same legal rights and 
obligations as their common law opposite sex counterparts.  The 
changes we are proposing are consistent with our previous efforts 
to adapt policies to changing values.  They are also consistent 
with the efforts of other jurisdictions and the private sector. 
For example, last year parliament passed Bill C-78, which 
extended survivor pension benefits to same sex partners of 
federal public service employees.  Manitoba, Quebec, 
Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova 
Scotia, Yukon, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories have 
undertaken similar initiatives for their public service 
employees.  As well, several provinces have already begun to 
amend their legislation more broadly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1997 British Columbia has amended numerous statutes, 
including six core statutes, to add same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year Quebec amended 28 statutes and 11 regulations to grant 
same sex couples the same benefits and obligations that are 
available to opposite sex common law couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall, to comply with the supreme court decision in M. v H., 
the Government of Ontario passed omnibus legislation to bring 67 
statutes into compliance with that court ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most large cities in Canada and more than 200 major private 
sector Canadian companies currently provide benefits to the same 
sex partners of their employees, as do many smaller 
municipalities, hospitals, libraries and social service 
institutions across Canada.  We are on the right side of public 
opinion and we are on the right side of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is against this backdrop that I would like to clarify what 
this legislation will do.  This omnibus bill provides a 
responsible, balanced and legally sound framework within which to 
amend relevant Canadian laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will enable us to modernize existing federal laws 
affecting some 20 departments and agencies.  In all, 68 statutes 
will be affected, including, among others, the Income Tax Act, 
the Canada pension plan and the Old Age Security Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the comprehensive nature of this legislation we will 
now be able to ensure that our laws confer both benefits and 
obligations equally to all common law relationships, whether of 
the opposite sex or the same sex.  This is a critical point, the 
significance of which must not be lost.  This law is about 
equality, and equality is a two-way street.  We are not simply 
extending access to certain social benefits to same sex couples, 
we are also imposing new obligations on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated earlier, Bill C-23 maintains the clear distinction 
between married and unmarried relationships.  Wherever possible 
neutral terms are used to define relationships and the partners 
within them.  For example, the term survivor is used in the 
Canada pension plan context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where a neutral term could not be used the act uses the term 
common law partner—conjoint de fait en français to encompass 
people in common law relationships, both opposite and same sex. 
The term spouse—époux en français—will now be used exclusively 
in relation to married couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 will bring fairness to the application of government 
benefits and obligations to all common law couples.  Let me cite 
just a few examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the issue of benefits first we can see that the 
new laws will treat Canadian couples more fairly.  Under the 
Canada pension plan, for example, the surviving spouse in a 
married relationship or the surviving partner in a common law 
opposite sex relationship may qualify for survivor's benefits 
based on his or her spouse's or partner's contributions to the 
plan.  Bill C-23 would provide that in similar circumstances the 
surviving partner in a common law same sex relationship would 
qualify for the same benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time however, the changes are, as I mentioned 
earlier, not one way.  Common law same sex couples will also be 
subject to the same obligations as common law opposite sex 
couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of bankruptcy, for example, the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act limits the ability of married people to transfer 
ownership of their home or property to their spouse prior to 
declaring bankruptcy.  Yet, because this statute refers to 
spouse, it does not apply equally to common law opposite sex or 
same sex couples.  In this instance the changes would provide for 
similar obligations for married and common law couples.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also obligations associated with eligibility for the 
GST-HST credit.  In married and common law opposite sex 
relationships the combined income of the two partners is used to 
determine eligibility for the tax credit.  By comparison, people 
in same sex partnerships may currently apply for the credit as 
individuals.  With Bill C-23, in order to determine eligibility 
to receive this tax credit, same sex couples will now declare the 
income of their common law partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance has concluded that the cost of these 
measures will be minimal, if any.  Clearly this is not a cost 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not want laws that discriminate unfairly or that 
violate charter principles.  We must proceed expeditiously with 
this bill because it is clearly the right thing to do.  We should 
be proud to support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude, I would like to address the issue of other 
dependent relationships in which some members of the House have 
expressed an interest.  I would first like to emphasize that by 
moving forward with this legislation we are not precluding 
discussion which has already started on whether or how to 
acknowledge the nature and reality of the many types of dependent 
relationships that exist.  We know there is some interest in 
extending benefits and obligations to individuals in other 
relationships of economic and emotional interdependence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dependency is a complex issue with far-reaching consequences for 
both individuals and society as a whole.  It deserves to be 
studied carefully.  It is for this reason that we will be 
referring this issue to a parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, there is a qualitative difference between the 
relationships addressed in Bill C-23 and the types of 
relationships that may exist among relatives, siblings or friends 
living under the same roof and sharing household expenses.  The 
reality is that many adult Canadians currently reside with 
elderly parents, siblings and other relatives.  While benefits 
that reflect dependency would likely be welcome, it is not quite 
so clear whether the accompanying legal obligations would be 
equally well received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, one could take the case of an elderly woman living 
with her son and daughter-in-law.  Should the younger couple's 
combined income be included in the senior citizen's calculations 
of her eligibility for the guaranteed income supplement under the 
Old Age Security Act?  Or, consider the example children caring 
for parents in their home.  In one case a daughter supports her 
widowed father.  In the house next door, another woman provides 
for both her mother and father.  How would we treat these cases? 
Would relationships of dependency apply to any two people who 
live together or to unlimited numbers as long as they are under 
the same roof? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other issues also need to be resolved.  These include how 
dependency relationships would be defined and which relationships 
would be allowed.  Would individuals be allowed to self-identify 
their relationships or would the government require proof of some 
kind?  Would the government exclude any relatives from these 
relationships of dependency, as France has done, or exclude only 
opposite sex common law couples, as Hawaii has chosen to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not trivial issues and they are not amenable to easy 
answers.  It is for this very reason that we must consult broadly 
with Canadians.  These issues are too important to act on before 
talking to Canadians about what it means to take the benefits and 
also what it means to accept the obligations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Others have endorsed the notion of domestic registries for 
unmarried adults living in dependent relationships.  Under this 
system two adults living together whether they are unmarried 
sisters, elderly parents living with an adult child, or lifelong 
friends who are roommates could register for benefits and 
obligations. Proceeding down this path requires discussion with 
those likely to be affected and an assessment of costs and 
discussion with the provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover it is not clear that voluntary registries are the best 
solution.  What happens for example where a clear dependency 
exists but one partner refuses to register in order to avoid 
obligations?  Should the relationship be deemed to exist and if 
couples can register, under what circumstances can they 
deregister and what if only one of the partners wishes to do so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also important privacy issues to consider.  Presumably 
a registry would be open to the public in the same way registries 
are for births and deaths. This might result in people being 
forced to have their relationship publicly known.  More 
important, if such a system were created at the federal level, it 
would have limited utility as it would apply only to areas of 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada where the many pieces of legislation that grant 
benefits and impose obligations are divided between or shared 
among the federal, provincial and territorial governments, a 
registry would require the unanimous agreement of all levels of 
government.  This would be necessary to help assure Canadians 
that a registry would work effectively, efficiently and fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proceeding with such a policy on a unilateral basis without 
public hearings, without assessing the costs and without 
consulting with the provinces and territories would be 
irresponsible and unrealistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All parliamentarians agree that in considering changes to the 
system we must encourage rather than discourage people to take 
care of each other.  We must be careful to ensure that any legal 
changes would not impose obligations that act as barriers to 
people supporting each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is about ensuring that Canadians in committed 
common law relationships are treated equally and fairly.  This 
bill is about tolerance and respect.  I invite all members of the 
House to support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>   Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  I wish to advise the Chair, pursuant to Standing Order 
43(2), that Liberal members for the balance of the debate on Bill 
C-23 will be splitting their time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the short title of Bill C-23 is the modernization of benefits and 
obligations act.  This bill will affect 68 different federal 
statutes and 20 different departments and agencies to extend 
benefits to same sex couples on the same basis as opposite sex 
common law or married couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill states in the preamble that it is intended to reflect 
values of tolerance, respect, equality with respect to the 
benefits and obligations of all couples.  The bill is the 
government's poorly thought out quick fix approach to an issue 
which requires a much more thoughtful and comprehensive approach 
in order to realize the values it says it is intending to 
reflect.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will primarily be examining two aspects of the bill that make 
it so weak in its current form that no thinking person could 
possibly support the bill.  I will also suggest some ways to 
improve the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by reminding the House of a particular motion that 
was debated and passed in the House by a four to one margin just 
a few short months ago in June 1999.  That motion stated that in 
the opinion of this House it is necessary, in light of public 
debate around court decisions, to state that marriage is and 
should remain the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion 
of all others, and that parliament will take all necessary steps 
within the jurisdiction of parliament— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  We all listened intently and politely to the minister.  I 
wonder why she is not here to listen to our speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member knows 
very well that we do not comment on the presence or absence of 
members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Madam Speaker, we hope that she is 
listening out there somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion that was passed by the House back in June was a very 
clear directive from the Parliament of Canada and the people's 
representatives to the Government of Canada to make sure that the 
definition of marriage does not change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-23 the government has ignored that directive from 
parliament.  It has done nothing to strengthen the current 
definition of marriage in law.  Bill C-23 provided the government 
with an opportunity to respond to the direction from parliament 
and secure the definition of marriage in federal legislation. 
This is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have become increasingly concerned that the definition of 
marriage in Canada needs to be strengthened and protected before 
the courts because of case rulings one after another that 
increasingly suggest that the opposite sex definition of marriage 
may soon be deemed unconstitutional by the courts.  In the last 
two years alone, 84 members of the House have presented petition 
after petition totalling thousands of names, calling for 
parliament to enact legislation to define that marriage can only 
be entered into between a single male and a single female.  The 
people of Canada are speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are Canadians overreacting or do they have justifiable concerns? 
Let us examine some of the recent events that have added to 
public concern about the erosion of the definition and concepts 
related to marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until recently Canadians understood the word spouse to be either 
a husband or a wife in a marriage.  I can point to the 
immigration bill that was recently introduced in the House, Bill 
C-63, which would give the minister and the bureaucracy under her 
the power to define what a spouse is, whatever they deemed it to 
be that particular day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 was pushed through the House.  It was the 52nd bill 
the government forced closure on.  It dealt with the public 
service pension plan.  The bill removed every reference to wife, 
widow or spouse and replaced them with the word survivor in order 
to extend benefits previously reserved for marriage to same sex 
relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fall the Minister of Human Resources Development went 
beyond the Canada Pension Plan Act to extend pension plan 
benefits normally reserved for married couples to same sex 
relationships, even though there was no legal or legislative 
authorization to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a number of court cases have served to erode the 
distinctiveness of marriage and the concepts, rights and 
obligations tied to it.  Many Canadians are concerned about this 
trend.  The petitions are evidence of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the courts, the Liberals refused to appeal a tax code case, 
known as the Rosenberg case.  A provincial court redefined spouse 
to mean two people of the opposite sex or the same sex, even 
though every dictionary, including all the legal dictionaries, 
have always understood and still do understand spouse to be 
either a husband or a wife in a marriage. 
But the justice minister across the way, her law, the federal 
law, chose not to appeal the new definition of spouse. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are watching this trend.  Some say the last thing that 
remains is the full blown establishment of homosexual marriage in 
Canada as a normative practice.  It becomes somewhat self-evident 
that sooner or later the opposite sex definition of marriage will 
be challenged in the courts.  If the courts can rule that the way 
Canadians use the word spouse is unconstitutional and must 
include a same sex definition of spouse, why could they not rule 
that the current definition of marriage is unconstitutional 
unless it includes same sex and possibly a variety of other 
relationships as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the lack of accountable leadership from the Liberal 
government, the courts end up setting social policy often derived 
from a single case using charter arguments.  The Liberal 
government follows the courts with legislation saying that the 
courts made the government do it.  The people of Canada are 
totally left out of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage as it has been defined throughout history is 
significant to people for a variety of reasons.  It would be 
presumptuous of me to attempt to adequately capture all the 
values and the rationale Canadians have that are associated with 
why the current definition of marriage is so important to them. 
It is enough to say that the institution of marriage has been 
important to Canadian society from the very beginning of our 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In marriage a man in relationship to a woman gains the insights, 
sensitivities and strengths that she brings to the relationship 
and vice versa.  A lifelong committed union of a man and a woman 
in marriage creates a unit that is stronger than the sum of the 
individuals because their differences complement each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Corbett v Corbett the court said that marriage is an 
institution upon which the family is built.  In other court cases 
the importance of marriage has been underlined.  Let me reference 
a comment made by Justice La Forest in the Egan case where he 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal institution of marriage exists both for the protection 
of the relationship and for defining the obligations that flow 
from entering into a legal marriage.  Because of its importance, 
legal marriage may properly be viewed as fundamental to the 
stability and well-being of the family and, as such, parliament 
may quite properly give special support to the institution of 
marriage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The kind of positive character modelling we see in marriage with 
access to both genders does not stay confined to the home but 
continues with children outside the home and adds a stabilizing 
and strengthening component to all of society. Recent Statistics 
Canada studies report that children in home relationships with 
both parents, mother and dad, have far fewer behavioural problems 
and a significantly higher percentage complete high school. 
Marriage is more than just a legal concept defined here; it is an 
institution that works for families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a 1991 review of research in the <I>American 
Journal of Orthopsychiatry</I> competency levels of children are 
influenced more by the quality and quantity of their interaction 
with their parents than by the parents' income or occupation or 
any other social variables.  What kids need from their parents is 
mainly the parents themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1986 book <I>Single Mothers and Their Children</I> 
political scientist Sara McLanahan found that teenage girls 
raised with their fathers are far less likely to get in trouble. 
Fatherless girls are 111% more likely to get pregnant and 164% 
are more likely to become single mothers.  A girl needs her 
father. We can make the same argument for the influence of 
mothers on children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting to note that a recent study of young 
people in Canada found that they aspire to have strong families. 
In a recent poll 93% of youth predicted that their family would 
be the most important part of their life.  Eighty percent believe 
that the currently defined marriage between a man and a woman is 
for life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also share a comment from one of the editors of a paper 
in my own city.  It captures well the importance of marriage and 
why marriage needs to be clearly defined in legislation which 
does not currently exist at the federal level. 
That is one of the major improvements that is needed to Bill 
C-23.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote from Peter Menzies of the Calgary <I>Herald</I>.  He 
says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laws defining marriage and common-law relationships were not 
designed just to protect the interests of two people involved in 
an intimate relationship.  They were designed primarily to 
protect the interests of children.  This is because heterosexual 
intimacy alone results in babies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Societies decided to do this because: a) procreation is 
fundamental to the biological survival of the species, and, b) it 
is by consensus and statistical fact in the best interests of the 
cultural survival of the species to have its offspring raised in 
a stable home involving a mother and a father who have made a 
commitment to each other in sickness and health, until death do 
them part. That is because society has decided, through tradition 
and experience, that a male-female marriage is a form of 
relationship—due to its procreative nature and the depth of 
commitment required—best suited to act as a societal 
cornerstone, from a biological and cultural point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To marry, you must be willing to make a lifelong monogamous 
commitment to the person of the opposite sex. Commitment, 
monogamy and possibly procreative sex are all typically 
necessary. If one, the procreative restriction, is not—as the 
court believes—justifiable in a free and democratic society, 
then surely monogamy and commitment are just as discriminatory 
against polygamous and those who wish to keep their options open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of this guarantees that all marriages result in perfectly 
functional families or that non-married relationships are by 
definition dysfunctional.  Statistics, however, support the 
broadly-held view that—in general—the marriage model remains 
worthy of the exclusivity society has granted it, even though an 
increasing number of people prefer—and are free to—live 
otherwise. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage is important.  Marriage is good for kids and marriage 
needs to be defined in legislation.  This is important to 
Canadians.  We have seen the trend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get back to the concerns that many of the petitioners 
have raised in the House. It is reasonable for them to assume, 
based on the trends they have seen, that some day there will be a 
constitutional challenge to strike down the opposite sex 
definition of marriage in Canada, but why wait until that 
happens?  Why continue to let the courts lead, as the Liberal 
government chooses to do on a regular basis, not just on this 
topic but on many topics?  Why not respond?  Why not let 
parliament for once lead instead of having the courts lead?  Why 
not let the voice of the people represented by their elected 
representatives be what sets the agenda, as opposed to the courts 
always leading? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not act now, when the courts say later that the charter 
made them do it, then the Liberals say that the courts made them 
do it, the question of using the notwithstanding clause will come 
up again.  Would the Liberal government use the notwithstanding 
clause to defend the current definition of marriage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the Liberals have a position that seems to say that 
they will never use it.  They will do everything in their power 
to make sure no one else does as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that Premier Klein of Alberta recently made a 
pronouncement that if the courts ever ruled in favour of same sex 
marriage, he would invoke the notwithstanding clause.  That is 
encouraging, but will we ever hear that from the federal 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the provincial government has the 
authority to perform or solemnize marriages, but it is the 
federal government that determines what marriage is.  Currently 
there is no federal statute that states that marriage must be 
between a man and a woman.  Marriage is defined simply in common 
law, by case law, by judges.  It has been decided in the courts 
over the years that it is a union of a man and a woman, to the 
exclusion of all others.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the court's demonstrated willingness to redefine 
language and write into law within the context of the charter and 
there determine what is “reasonable”, it is clearly reasonable 
for the people's representatives in this parliament to 
proactively define in legislation that the definition of marriage 
must remain the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of 
all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, because the justice minister did not take the 
opportunity, Bill C-23 does exactly that, to follow the lead and 
the expressed will of the House to do that.  If, and some would 
say when, the day comes that the Liberal appointed judges 
determine that limiting marriage to opposite sex partners is 
unconstitutional, having marriage defined in statute rather than 
in common law will allow for the expeditious use of the 
notwithstanding clause to uphold the legislation.  Without an 
existing definition of marriage in statute, one would have to be 
drafted and put in place if the common law was overridden by a 
new ruling of the court. Therefore, why are we waiting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 is a perfect opportunity for the government to act on 
the vote held here last June that called on the government to do 
everything possible to protect the current definition of 
marriage.  I remind the House that it was four to one in favour 
of that motion.  There was a large majority in favour that 
expressed the will of the Canadian people.  This is an 
opportunity to put the statute in place that defines marriage. 
There would definitely be broad support in the House if the 
government would include marriage legislation as part of Bill 
C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move to the second aspect of Bill C-23 which warrants 
examination and substantial reworking.  This part of the bill is 
so horrendously weak, so ludicrous that it is hardly possible to 
rework it, but we will try to work with this as best we can. I am 
talking about the part of the bill that defines the new concept 
of a common law partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 defines in statute that a common law partner is an 
individual person who is cohabiting with another individual in a 
conjugal relationship, having so cohabited for a period of at 
least one year.  To put this in layman's terms, this basically 
says that if I live with someone and I have some sort of a 
conjugal relationship with the person, I now have a common law 
partner.  It does not matter if it is a man or a woman, as long 
as we live in a house for a year and have some sort of conjugal 
relationship I now have a common law partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 extends every benefit and obligation that we currently 
have in place for marriage and for family to this new common law 
partner definition:  under the same roof, conjugal relationship. 
Except for the Divorce Act, there is no difference between a 
married relationship and a common law partner relationship in the 
way government policy looks at those relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many types of gender relationships:  siblings, 
friends, roommates, partners, et cetera.  However, the only 
relationship the government wants to include is when two people 
of the same gender are involved in a private sexual activity, or 
what is more commonly known as homosexuality.  No sex and no 
benefits is the government's approach to this bill.  Even if 
everything else is the same, even if there is a long time 
cohabitation and dependency, if there is no sex there are no 
benefits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 is a benefits for sex bill.  It is crazy.  Under Bill 
C-23, benefits will be extended to any person who has had, as the 
bill says, a conjugal relationship, regardless of sex.  It could 
be male, it could be female, it could be two males or two 
females. The bill refers to the phrase “conjugal relationship”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to <I>Black's Law Dictionary</I>, conjugal means sexual 
activity.  That is how ever major Canadian dictionary defines it, 
but the bill does not define it in any way.  It does not make 
reference to the definition.  It just uses the term and throws it 
back to the courts.  It has added a new legal expression:  A 
relationship of a conjugal nature.  With absolutely no definition 
of what it means in the bill, we are left to assume that it means 
what Canadian dictionaries tell us.  The government seems 
determined to make private sexual activity between two people, 
regardless of gender, the primary condition for benefits, which 
is what Bill C-23 does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 is a compliance verification nightmare.  Given that 
sexual relations seem to be the sole criteria for obtaining 
benefits, one wonders how the government will know whether a 
couple is truly having a conjugal relationship or simply trying 
to obtain a benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the difficulties in proving the conjugal aspect of 
the benefits equation, the government would be opening up a whole 
new front of litigation in the future.  Upon one cohabitant 
moving out of a shared residence, he or she could find himself or 
herself in a position of having to prove that there were no 
conjugal relations if his or her former roommate claimed common 
law partner status.  That is not too different from the recent 
M. v H. case we saw ruled on in the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, these new common law partners are not required to 
register anywhere in order to qualify or claim benefits, nor are 
there provisions for information sharing between federal 
departments.  Thus couples could apply for conjugal benefits 
under one piece of legislation, while maintaining they were 
simply roommates or friends for another piece of legislation. 
That might impose some of the obligations that the justice 
minister waxed so eloquently about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation would allow these people to say that they are 
conjugal to get the benefit, but because there is no information 
sharing they do not have any of the obligations.  They are saying 
that they are just roommates or friends in another piece of 
legislation.  This does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about all the people who are left out?  The minister talks 
about equality and fairness.  Let me share a story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an elderly gentleman in my riding who was a friend and 
was down on his luck.  This is a senior who is living on a meagre 
pension.  A wealthier person took him in as a friend. They have 
been sharing accommodation for years.  They basically share 
everything in that household.  They have a deep friendship, but 
it  has never crossed their minds, and I doubt if it ever will, 
for these two men to have any kind of physical physical intimacy 
or sexual relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Conjugality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Madam Speaker, with respect to the 
comment made by the member behind me, that is exactly what would 
be required for them to qualify under Bill C-23.  Bill C-23 
totally excludes the kind of relationship that I just spoke 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way for survivor benefits or any of the benefits to be 
extended to a person who might otherwise be dependent on the 
public purse is for these two gentlemen to enter into some sort 
of physical intimacy or sex which they do not want to even 
entertain.   They are left out of this.  This is the equality 
bill.  This is equality and fairness, as the justice minister 
says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill leaves out all kinds of people.  The sole criteria is, 
is it conjugal, is there sex.  It is inappropriate and 
unworkable. If the government is intent on extending some 
benefits, it would be better to extend them based on some stated 
dependency agreement which people voluntarily enter into rather 
than have them excluded all together, which is what Bill  C-23 
does. 
Without this consideration of dependency, dependency really means 
nothing in Bill C-23 and sexual activity is a qualifier as I have 
said.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when Bill C-78 went through the House.  It had a 
similar kind of approach to this issue.  I questioned the 
treasury board minister at the time in committee.  I asked him 
about it and he responded kind of weakly and kind of meekly that 
the courts made him do it, that the lawyers wrote it this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government serve the people by letting the courts set 
policy and the lawyers draft the legislation in the whole 
process?  Where is the voice of the people?  It is not there.  We 
are not hearing it.  The Liberals do not want to hear it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We launched a lot of committees across the country to get input 
from people, to hear what they had to say.  I remember being a 
member of the committee that travelled from coast to coast on the 
issue of custody and access situations that had to be dealt with 
in divorce.  We heard from hundreds, if not over a thousand 
Canadians, their input on what needed to be done to restructure 
family law to cope better with marital breakdown and make the law 
more beneficial to families with these kinds of problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that members of the House travelled with all kinds of 
committees.  The finance committee travels every year to hear 
input from Canadians.  Here we have a piece of legislation that 
changes 68 statutes and will affect 20 different departments, and 
what are they taking as their guide?  They have an Angus Reid 
poll that is telling them that this is what people want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Angus Reid predicted that Mike Harris would lose the Ontario 
election.  Angus Reid said the Liberals would win in Ontario, and 
they lost.  This is what they are using as the basis for 
justification for bringing forward a bill that affects 68 
statutes and 20 areas of the government.  They do not want to 
have any public consultation on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talked a bit about public consultation at the end 
of her speech, but she is implementing a bill without any of it. 
What I suggest is that the government put it on hold.  Let us 
hear what the people have to say.  Let us launch a committee. 
There are 68 statutes being changed.  How about some public 
hearings, public input? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded too of the comprehensive report we put together on 
the custody and access committee.  There was a lot of agreement 
around the table by all members of the House.  There was a whole 
screed of recommendations.  The justice minister said she would 
not act on it because she wanted to think about it.  Maybe in 
another three years or so we will do something with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the voice of the people coming through the committee 
process being shelved.  The bill says that they like the results 
of a poll, the court told them to do it.  Boom, it is done and 
people are shut out.  Bill C-23 is weak because the Liberals have 
not allowed the people to have input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members opposite and all other members that every word 
spoken in the House is recorded and bound in volumes which are 
kept in the Speaker's office.  Everything we say and every vote 
is recorded.  In a sense it is our accountability.  In a sense we 
might say it is a legacy we leave to our families and those who 
follow that may want to reference what we said and where we stood 
on issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members to consider their positions on Bill C-23.  It 
takes every benefit and every obligation we currently extend to 
marriage and families and gives them to two people living 
together for a year, provided they have sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill needs to be sent back for a redraft.  It needs to 
include a clear definition in law, in legislation, that marriage 
is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others. 
Let us get that in the statute. 
That is what people have asked for in petitions.  That is what 
the House has voted in support of.  It is time to do it. 
Unfortunately the justice minister has missed an opportunity to 
do exactly that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also needs to be redrafted to include respect for people's 
private intimacies.  To make benefits subject to the private 
sexual activities of individuals is clearly inappropriate in our 
opinion.  If the government is intent on drafting legislation to 
allow benefits to flow to relationships between two people of the 
same gender and to make benefits contingent upon their having 
some sort of sexual relationship, it is inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not more reasonable to focus on demonstrated 
interdependencies and the social contribution of the relationship 
when considering benefits rather than on the private physical 
intimacies of the person being considered?  I believe, Mr. 
Speaker, you would even agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members of the House to send Bill C-23 back for 
an improved redraft.  Let us protect marriage in legislation and 
let us focus on dependency, not on conjugality.  In its current 
form this is an unworkable piece of legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I rise to speak to this bill, and I 
hasten to congratulate the government on finally taking action 
to respect human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the debate that is beginning today, many speakers, 
particularly from this side of the House, from among the Reform 
Party members, will try to persuade us that this is a bill that 
undermines the rights of the family, that undermines the 
institution of marriage, and that it is therefore an 
unacceptable bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that one would have to be of singularly bad faith not 
to recognize that the bill before us today is a bill relating to 
human rights.  It states that, in future, parliament, the 
lawmakers, this lofty decision-making centre that is the House of 
Commons, will not accept any form of discrimination whatsoever 
toward same sex partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are speaking of here.  The purpose of the bill 
we have before us is to amend 68 pieces of legislation in all 
sectors of life in Canada and in Quebec, whether the Criminal 
Code, the Citizenship Act, pension plans, banks, all sectors of 
society, anywhere there is a “heterosexist” definition of 
spouse, so that in future, if this bill goes through, there will 
be a “homosexist” definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit that this has nothing to do with the 
family, nothing to do with marriage.  That does not mean that 
one day down the road we will not have to debate that as 
parliamentarians.  I do not hesitate to state that, in my 
opinion, parenting ability has nothing to do with sexual 
orientation.  They are two completely different things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is not what we are dealing with today.  I believe 
it is very important to be extremely clear about this, for the 
benefit of our fellow citizens.  There is, however, one point on 
which I am forced to agree with our Reform Party colleagues: it 
was high time for the legal activism that started back in the 
early 1990s to come to an end, and high time for us to assume 
our responsibilities as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all the judgments pronounced in recent years, be it in the 
Haig case, the Nesbit-Egan case in 1995, the Rosenberg case or, 
more recently, the M. v H. case, the various courts of justice, 
and often the supreme court, have told parliamentarians to 
fulfil their obligations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased, first of all because there are pioneers in 
this House who have paved the way. In that regard, I believe we 
must pay tribute to the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas. Once the 
way was paved, a movement started to emerge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us ask ourselves the question. For the second time in less 
than a decade, parliamentarians will be voting on the 
recognition of same sex spouses. The previous time was in 1995. 
Yours truly, who was still very green as a member of parliament, 
having been elected in 1993, had asked his parliamentary 
colleagues to pass a motion asking that the government and the 
House recognize same sex spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, no more than 55 parliamentarians voted in favour of 
the motion. All members of the NDP voted in favour, as did 85% 
of the members of the Bloc. What is significant—and I do not mean 
this to be a breach of our rules, I mention it strictly for 
information purposes—is that, except for the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, there were no cabinet members in the House when the 
vote took place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention this for information purposes, to show the incredible 
progress made, resulting in the Minister of Justice, and she is 
to be commended for that, coming before the House today with a 
commitment from cabinet and asking us to support an act 
recognizing same sex spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice is able today to table a bill like this 
one because of a change brought about by people speaking out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday morning, I took part in a press conference held in 
Montreal, in the gay village, by the Coalition pour la 
reconnaissance des conjoints du même sexe.  I said to these 
people “Same sex partners will be recognized, and 
parliamentarians will take this profoundly significant step 
because individuals and groups in society have spoken out and 
said they were involved in same sex relationships, they were 
living true love with all of its heights and its depths, with 
its obligations and its benefits, and demanded to be given full 
consideration”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we come to this debate, when we vote and when we consider 
this bill in parliamentary committee, I would like all 
parliamentarians, especially the Reform members, to ask 
themselves the following question: Can we decently, in all 
knowledge, argue in this House that two men or two women who 
love each other feel love differently from a man and woman who 
love each other? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no difference in the feeling of love.  There is no 
difference in the way couples live.  A man in love with another 
man feels the same range of emotions, experiences the same 
feelings.  An individual living in society pays the same taxes, 
is governed by the same laws and participates in the same civil 
society.  This must be the focus of our concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Non-recognition of same sex partners is a matter of discrimination. 
It cannot be a matter of religion.  We cannot, as 
parliamentarians, take a religious or moral stand on this issue, 
which does not mean that we are not people of principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an individual, I have my principles.  I have my values.  My 
colleagues have their principles and their values.  But when one 
is passing a bill, when one is a lawmaker, it cannot be issues 
of morality that guide us, because, in politics, such issues are 
the most likely to suffer from the passage of time. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider what would have happened if those who passed the 
Divorce Act had allowed themselves to become hung up on moral 
considerations and had decided not to pass the legislation 
because the predominant moral stance thirty years ago did not 
approve of people being able to dissolve their marriage through 
a legal mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One principle alone must guide us as lawmakers and that is 
equality between individuals.  This is how the Minister of 
Justice started off her speech.  We cannot agree on 
constitutional issues and, as members know, we are unhappy about 
Bill C-20.  We cannot reach agreement with respect to the 
economy. 
We do not see eye to eye on economic policy, but it is 
impossible that we, as parliamentarians, cannot agree on what 
should motivate our actions, what should be at the heart of our 
concerns, and that is the equality of all individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This principle is so important, so deserving of our attention, 
that the lawmakers, acting as a constituent body in 1981-82, 
enshrined it in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that this is clear for those listening, the principle of 
recognizing same sex spouses flows not just from extremely noble 
sentiments between individuals, that is reciprocal love, but 
from the recognition enshrined in section 15 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given its importance, I am going to quote it to you, if I may. 
What does section 15 say?  It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the 
right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law 
without discrimination and, in particular, without 
discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, 
religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the text that existed in 1982.  I would point out as an 
aside that, at the time of the constitutional conferences as far 
back as 1982, some people were grouping together.  Who was the 
Minister of Justice at that time?  The present Prime Minister 
and member for Shawinagan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far back as 1982, people were lobbying to have sexual 
orientation included in the illegal grounds for discrimination. 
This was not done, but I will not go into that any further.  In 
1995 there was a cause célèbre, probably one of the most 
important cases in Canadian law: Nesbitt-Egan.  This concerned a 
British Columbia couple—British Columbia being one of the most 
interesting places to live in Canada—who had been living together 
for more than 40 years.  Not many couples have been together 
more than 40 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a homosexual union, a couple who had been living 
together for more than 40 years.  One of them challenged the 
constitutionality of one of the sections of the Old Age Security 
Act dealing with the spouses' allowance, claiming that it was 
unconstitutional under section 15, which I have just quoted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court unanimously—all nine justices—acknowledged that 
indeed, in future, section 15 of the 1982 Charter of Human 
Rights had to be read as including sexual orientation among the 
illegal grounds for discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how the supreme court came to acknowledge that it was no 
longer possible for the lawmakers to discriminate, on the basis 
of section 15.  This was a very great moment in the annals of 
legal history.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today as parliamentarians we must, naturally, with the distance 
that must accompany our deliberations and in the direction the 
supreme court has indicated, tell our fellow citizens that we 
will not tolerate discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  It is never easy to acknowledge one is 
different from others.  It is never easy to belong to a 
minority, and it is no easier belonging to a sexual minority.  I 
am 37.  I know I look very young.  I regularly have to show 
proof of age at clubs, but nevertheless, I am 37. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I told my parents at age 18 that I was a homosexual it was 
not easy for me and it was not easy for my parents either. Let 
us go back in time. My parents had raised children in the early 
1960s.  I turned 18 in the early 1980s, and I do not think that 
my parents in their ideals of raising family and having children 
in the 1950s, 1960s or 1970s had wanted a homosexual son, 
because it was a period in which society rejected homosexuals. 
Homosexuality was considered an illness.  People made fun of 
homosexuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That did not prevent my parents from moving on and understanding 
that homosexual relationships may be extremely gratifying and 
that we are full citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the whole thrust of the debate today. 
Every member rising in this House to vote against Bill C-23 will 
send a negative message to Canadians and Quebecers, who will 
think that when one is gay, one does not deserve full 
protection in every piece of legislation passed by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the message that these members will send when they vote 
against this bill. Let us not forget that even in optimum 
conditions, when one discovers that one is gay, at age 13, 14 or 
15, it cannot be easy. 
It is in our interest as lawmakers to contribute to a better 
acceptance of each other, to help people accept each other for 
who they are, to see that people reach their full potential. 
This is why the legal framework defined by us lawmakers must 
promote the development of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this, in my opinion, is the thrust of the debate. As 
parliamentarians, do we accept the view that people engaged in 
homosexual relationships with same sex partners must be 
recognized as full fledged members of society? Make no mistake 
about it. This is not a financial issue, not a monetary issue. 
Of course, the benefits to be provided by the act will have a 
financial impact, since the Canada Pension Plan Act will be 
amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So will the Income Tax Act, to make it possible for a same sex 
spouse to get a spousal allowance, to receive compensation. This 
will become possible and it will also be possible to claim a 
deduction for a dependent spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill's financial impact is not its main feature. 
Those who may be tempted to vote against it cannot argue, if they 
are properly informed, that this bill will have a major impact 
on the treasury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us never forget that, in a number of cases, same sex spouses 
who will be granted benefits are already paying for these 
benefits as taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, at the time of the Rosenberg case, when the Department 
of Finance was asked to evaluate the financial impact of 
recognizing same sex spouses, what did it say?  First, there is 
obviously no one right now who can give a precise evaluation of 
what it would cost Canadian taxpayers to recognize same sex 
couples.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not possible because no one has a clear idea of the number 
of homosexual couples in Canadian society.  It does not exist in 
the census and it is not something one declares in one's tax 
return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basis of evaluations done by the Department of Finance on 
the consumer habits of Canadians, it is estimated that, if 
between 2% and 6% of Canadians took advantage of the various tax 
deductions that could apply to same sex couples, the cost would 
range between $4 million and $12 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this is not primarily a financial or monetary issue, because 
we are talking about an amount between $4 million and $12 
million, according to the figures filed with the Ontario Court 
of Appeal in the Rosenberg case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to give a bit of background so that people are clear 
about what we are discussing.  The term homosexual itself goes 
back to 1869.  The word originated in Germany, apparently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, in 1948, a sexologist and sociologist by the name 
of Kinsey published a report in which he said that something 
like 10% of the population might have engaged in homosexual 
relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1969, the government amended Canada's Criminal Code, 
decriminalizing homosexual acts between consenting individuals 
over the age of 21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These historical landmarks are important to a proper 
understanding of how this all came about and of how long ago the 
recognition we are now preparing to give to same sex couples 
began, how deeply it has been rooted in history, and how long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine, Canada had its first gay demonstration on Parliament 
Hill as far back as 1971.  In 1973—just to show what a tenacious 
prejudice this has been—the American Psychology Association 
removed homosexuality from its list of definitions of abnormal 
behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the early 1950s until the mid-1970s, when the medical 
profession dealt with homosexuality, it considered it 
pathological.  Today, who could argue that homosexuality is 
pathological? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members are aware, I myself am of homosexual 
orientation, and I do not believe that I have ever presented any 
sign of dysfunctional behaviour, unless it is to sometimes be a 
bit long-winded, but I do not think anyone would fault me for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1977, Quebec amended its legislation, its human rights 
charter, in order to include sexual orientation among the 
forbidden grounds of discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1979, the Canadian Human Rights Commission recommended in its 
annual report that the Canadian Human Rights Act be amended to 
include sexual orientation.  And that is interesting. It must be 
kept in mind that the Canadian Human Rights Commission played a 
fundamental role in obtaining more rights for the homosexual 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to point out that the Haig case in the early 1990s 
was really because of the Canadian Human Rights Act, and section 
10 of that legislation was struck down because it did not put an 
end to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

who was the Minister of Justice. She decided that a decision 
that could have applied only to Ontario would be binding 
throughout Canada. We must be grateful to Kim Campbell for being 
open-minded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know of course what happened in 1982. In 1985, section 15 
came into force but, unfortunately, it did not include sexual 
orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986, Ontario became the second province, after Quebec, to 
amend its human rights code, which is the equivalent of Quebec's 
charter of human rights, and to include sexual orientation as a 
prohibited ground of discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988, a breath of fresh air came from the church. The United 
Church of Canada, which represents the largest Protestant 
community in Canada, voted in favour of ordaining homosexuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how a society changes. It is truly the joint forces of 
the judiciary, the church, the political institutions and 
society that contribute to the shaping of mentalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989, a court recognized for the first time that sexual 
orientation was a prohibited ground of discrimination under the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, Ontario extended its social benefits, with the 
exception of surviving spouse benefits, to same sex spouses for 
the whole provincial public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the Supreme Court of British Columbia decided 
that the interpretation of “spouse” as defined in the Medical 
Service Act, which denied same sex partners the benefits 
provided, was an infringement of section 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One year later, in 1992, a commission of inquiry established 
under the authority of the Ontario Human Rights Code held that 
the refusal to give survivor benefits to same sex partners 
contravened the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how the issue of sexual orientation gradually worked its 
way through the annals of law and into the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, there was the Nesbit-Egan decision. This is not an 
insignificant decision, and I would like to cite it.  I remind 
the hon. members that this decision arose from action taken by a 
British Columbia couple who had lived together for over 40 
years. 
Mr. Speaker, I am sure that you, a model of fidelity, have not 
yet reached so many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court found that sexual orientation ought to be 
included in section 15 as prohibited grounds for discrimination.

cause of the gays.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the decision in the case of Rosenberg v Canada.  On 
April 23, 1998, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled unanimously 
that the definition of “spouse” in the Income Tax Act was 
unconstitutional as it applied to registered pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The words “of the opposite sex” in the definition as it existed 
in the Income Tax Act prevented the Canadian Union of Public 
Employees from extending the application of its registered 
pension plans to the surviving spouses of gay or lesbian 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Union of Public Employees therefore relied on 
section 15 in challenging the discrimination which had taken 
place, the result of which was that the Department of National 
Revenue, which administers the Income Tax Act, refused to 
recognize same sex employees' registered pension plans, thus 
denying them the corresponding deduction and the plans legal 
recognition.  Once again, the courts enlightened matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, another extremely important decision was handed 
down in the case of M. v H.  On May 20, 1999, the Supreme Court 
of Canada ruled eight to one in favour.  This was an extremely 
strong show of support.  The judges were not divided. 
This was not a decision with a slim majority, but an extremely 
solid one, almost unanimous, one of only a few supreme court 
decisions, with eight justices out of nine ruling that the 
definition of “spouse” in the Ontario Family Law Act contravened 
section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was involved here?  Two lesbians had been living as a 
couple for several years, since the early 1980s.  They broke up. 
It should be pointed out that, during their life together, 
wealth had been accumulated, and one of the two had acquired a 
business for which the other worked.  Therefore, support 
payments were demanded at the time they broke up. 
Obviously, the Ontario legislation known as the Family Law Act, 
at section 29 if I remember correctly, did not recognize same 
sex partners, and so, despite having lived with a same sex 
partner for some years and having contributed to the wealth of 
the couple, the woman had no recourse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that this went all the way to the supreme 
court.  Why am I taking the time to refer to the decision in M. 
v H.?  Because, for the first time, the supreme court 
acknowledged that homosexual relationships should be considered 
as spousal relationships.  And it was recognized that, 
ultimately, it would be possible for support payments to be 
obtained in the case of same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the supreme court showed some reservations, as the 
provincial court had earlier in the Nesbit-Egan case, and refused 
to invalidate the act completely, or to require the Government 
of Ontario to amend all of its legislation.  It made a 
declaratory judgment limited to section 29 for a 90-day period. 
Hon. members will see that the court was exhibiting wisdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>M. v H. is an important decision because it makes it clear to 
the homosexual community that justice is aptly represented by a 
scale with two sides, since it involves both obligations and 
benefits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must know as parliamentarians, and the homosexual community 
must know, that if this bill is passed, it will also lead to 
obligations.  When a couple's total income is taken into 
account, there may be advantages and disadvantages arising from 
considering the total income, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>M. v H. is a case involving support.  When an individual enters 
a homosexual relationship, consideration must be given to what 
may arise should the relationship break up after a period of 
time.  There are a number of responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to return to the heart of the debate. 
Once again, I believe that we would be mistaken as 
parliamentarians if we failed to recognize that the issue here 
is to put an end to discrimination once and for all.  We know 
that the ten major cities, including Halifax, Vancouver, 
Montreal, Toronto and Moncton, have recognized same sex partners 
at the municipal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many private firms recognize same sex partners.  The situation 
would be paradoxical to say the least if same sex partners were 
recognized by lower level authorities, at the municipal level 
for example, but not by us here, in the federal government, in 
the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, last year, the National Assembly, with the 
government of Lucien Bouchard, one of the best governments to 
have occupied the government benches, gave full recognition to 
same sex partners. 
It amended 28 laws of Quebec, including the act respecting 
income security and the automobile insurance act.  Major pieces 
of legislation were amended in order to recognize same sex 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the process is not complete, since the civil code 
remains to be changed.  I cannot wait for that, and I am eager 
to get Mr. Bouchard's government moving on to the next step, that 
of amending the Civil Code of Quebec.  As hon. members are 
aware, we have two separate legal systems: one based on common 
law, which governs English Canada; one governing Quebec, the 
civil code.  This code is a law, but it does not recognize 
heterosexual partners, and so obviously it does not recognize 
homosexual partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am anxious to convince the Quebec government to jump on the 
band wagon and amend the civil code. Again, this is not about 
family or marriage. Earlier, I listened to what the Reform Party 
members were saying, and I think some serious soul-searching is 
in order, because one cannot promote law and order as they do 
and not want to respect the charter. That is not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday at a press conference the Canadian Coalition for the 
Recognition of Same Sex Spouses stressed how untimely and 
inappropriate it would be for parliamentarians to vote against 
this bill. 
By voting against this bill, parliamentarians will in fact be 
indicating that they think they are above the Canadian charter. 
This means they do not recognize a value that is fundamental, 
regardless of where one lives in Canada, of one's profession, of 
one's age and of one's judicial record. There is a principle 
that must be adhered to, and that is equality for all.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It can never be overstated that this bill enshrines the 
recognition of full, total and uncompromising equality for all. 
I cannot imagine the Reformers, who will very soon opt for the 
united alternative, sending the gay people in Alberta, 
Saskatchewan and British Columbia the message that, as 
parliamentarians, they do not recognize them as full-fledged 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there will be an extremely heavy price to pay in terms 
of the implications. 
I believe that voters will be very critical of members who rise 
in this House and do not recognize that the principle of 
equality between individuals applies to all citizens and that 
this equality should be the focus of our concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will do everything it can to have this bill 
passed quickly, because recognition of same sex spouses has been 
too long in coming.  We will examine the issue seriously in 
committee.  We will hear from witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those who believe in equality must do something that is 
extremely important in democracy and that is to speak up.  We 
must rise up and engage in dialogue at every opportunity.  We 
must go to see the Reform Party members and all parliamentarians 
who are not convinced that the bill has merit. 
We must engage in dialogue in order to convince them that this 
has nothing to do with marriage and the family, but that it is a 
matter of equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the coming days, that is what I will be doing.  That is what 
all parliamentarians should be doing.  I am convinced that

Egan and his partner Jack Nesbitt, who took to the Supreme Court 
of Canada the issue of the recognition of gay and lesbian

inclusion of sexual orientation in our charter of rights.

want to acknowledge her work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some who ask why the government is doing this.  The 
government is doing this because we as parliamentarians and 
provincial legislators gave the courts the duty and the 
responsibility of interpreting the charter of rights.  They did 
not seize that; we gave them that responsibility.  Indeed, the 
highest court in the land, the Supreme Court of Canada, has ruled 
that section 15 of our charter prohibits discrimination based on 
sexual orientation and, as well, that that discrimination 
includes discrimination in the relationships of gay and lesbian 
people.

ruled.  The courts have ruled that where benefits are extended to 
heterosexual common law couples, those benefits must as well be 
extended to those involved in committed, loving, same sex 
relationships.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, groups that have historically been the target of 
discrimination cannot be expected to wait patiently for the 
protection of their human dignity and equal rights while 
governments move toward reform one step at a time.  If the 
infringement of the rights and freedoms of these groups is 
permitted to persist while governments fail to pursue equality 
diligently, then the guarantees of the Charter will be reduced to 
little more than empty words. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are achieving today.  It is a recognition that 
the guarantees of the charter must be made reality by changes in 
law, changes that involve both rights and responsibilities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a couple words about what this bill is not about. 
This bill is not about special rights for anyone.  It is about 
fairness and equal rights.  It is a recognition that gay and 
lesbian people pay into benefit plans and, up until very 
recently, have been denied the benefits that should flow. 
Indeed, outside the House stands a man with a sign saying “No 
special rights for homosexuals—Repeal Bill C-23”.  Again, I 
emphasize, this is not about special rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also not about money.  If anything, Reformers should be 
supporting the bill because it will help to reduce the federal 
deficit and debt.  According to a study that was tabled in the 
Rosenberg case, an affidavit that was signed by a senior tax 
policy officer in the Department of Finance said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—extending spousal tax treatment to same-sex couples would 
result in an overall cost savings to the federal government of 
about $10 million per year. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the facts from the Department of Finance.  It does not 
cost money to extend equality because in this particular 
legislation we are recognizing both rights and responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In M. v H. it was recognized that one lesbian partner had 
financial responsibilities to her former partner which flowed 
from that relationship.  It is clear that, to the extent those 
responsibilities are recognized, that will reduce the financial 
burden on the state as well.  I would have thought that would 
have been something the Reform Party would have welcomed and 
supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about special rights.  It is not about extra money. 
Most offensively, in the Reform Party's characterization the 
member for Calgary Centre said “This is benefits for sex”.  Let 
me say how demeaning, how dishonest and how offensive that 
characterization of the bill really is for the Reform Party to 
say it is benefits for sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at this for a minute.  The member for Calgary Centre 
said “How do we prove they are actually partners?  How do we 
prove they have actually been involved in a sexual relationship? 
What if they are trying to scam the system?”  I remind the House 
that for some years now common law heterosexual relationships 
have been recognized.  I have not heard the Reformers say “No, 
no, do not recognize those relationships because we cannot prove 
that the man and woman are involved in a sexual relationship.  We 
cannot prove that they are really committed to one another”. 
No, they have been silent about common law heterosexual 
relationships because they know that many Canadians are involved 
in those relationships and they are not challenging those 
relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reformers do not have the intellectual integrity to 
recognize the complete bankruptcy of their argument when they say 
“How do we prove this?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the member for Calgary Centre said “All you have to do is 
shack up with somebody for a year, have sex with that person and 
you will be recognized”.  That is a totally false argument 
because the Supreme Court of Canada and the Ontario Court of 
Appeal have both talked about what a conjugal relationship means. 
Does it just mean living with somebody and having sex 
occasionally?  No, it does not.  Some conjugal relationships 
involve no sexual relationship at all.  They are very clear about 
that.  Some heterosexual couples are actually in loving, 
committed relationships and they do not have sexual relations.  I 
know the member for Calgary Centre might find that an incredible 
revelation.  That is amazing, is it not?  Yet, those are conjugal 
relationships according to the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion that benefits for sex is what this is all about 
trivializes and diminishes the quality of gay and lesbian 
relationships.  My relationship with my partner, Max, is not just 
about living together and having sexual relations.  Of course 
that is important, but it is much deeper and much more profound 
than that, and that is what makes, ultimately, a conjugal 
relationship.  We share our lives, the good times and the bad, in 
sickness and in health.  We share the ownership of our home. 
We have a joint bank account.  We are beneficiaries in one 
another's wills.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a deep emotional commitment in that relationship which 
is trivialized and demeaned and denied by the kind of suggestions 
by the member for Calgary Centre.  We are saying that these 
relationships should be recognized and affirmed and celebrated in 
this country and not denied any longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would note as well that each and every one of those members of 
parliament who is now speaking out against this bill is saying 
that they should oppose this bill because it does not go far 
enough, it does not recognize other dependent relationships like 
two sisters living together or two elderly gentlemen sharing a 
home. Without exception each and every one of those members has 
spoken against basic equality for gay and lesbian people.  That 
is their agenda.  They do not believe in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member of the Reform Party in the House today who was in 
this House during the vote on the Canadian Human Rights Act 
amendments, Bill C-33, voted against that bill.  They do not 
believe in equality and let no one be fooled into suggesting 
otherwise.  That is their agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course it is true that there is still not full equality. 
There is still much to be done.  This bill does not deal with the 
immigration law for example.  There are Canadians who fall in 
love with other Canadians and there are some who fall in love 
with citizens of other countries.  I appeal to the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration to move forward quickly to recognize 
the relationships of gay and lesbian people in the new 
immigration act which will be tabled shortly.  We must look 
seriously at the provisions of the criminal code with respect to 
hate literature as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yes, dare I say it, we must also recognize that couples who 
wish to involve themselves in committed loving relationships and 
have those affirmed by the state in marriage.  That too is part 
of equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members on all sides of the House who say that no, 
marriage cannot be extended to gay and lesbian people as this 
would be the death of marriage, the downfall of the moral fabric 
of society.  Is marriage really that fragile?  How on earth would 
it threaten the marriage of the member for Calgary Centre or the 
marriage of the member from Ontario to recognize and affirm the 
relationships of gay and lesbian people who choose to marry? That 
will come as part of full equality. In the Netherlands the 
government has recently tabled a bill to extend those rights as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close by reading from a letter from a woman who speaks 
far more eloquently than I, with far more power and passion about 
what it has meant in her life to have her relationship denied 
full equality and why this bill is so important. I am proud to 
say that her name is Donna Wilson.  She wrote a letter in 1996 to 
the Prime Minister saying this:

</I></B></P><P align=left>We shared everything as life partners.  We were emotionally and 
financially interdependent.  Every aspect of our lives was 
connected, inter-related.  We celebrated our lives together and 
were embraced by family, friends and many diverse communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We shared in the parenting of two children.  I continue to care 
for them and support them as a co-parent myself and also on 
behalf of their mother who has died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our relationship was rendered invisible time and time again by 
the laws in our country.  We lived without the supports and 
benefits available to the vast majority of Canadians.  There were 
no tax credits or benefits available to assist us as a couple or 
a family.  There was no recognition of the value of our 
relationship, our family and our contributions to Canadian 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even now I'm not considered a widow or survivor and I'm not 
eligible to receive my partner's pension.  I know the same 
devastating grief as every other widow and I share the same 
financial fears and insecurities as many who survive the death of 
a spouse or life partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After my partner died I contacted the office of the Canadian 
pension plan.  With great pain I explained my circumstance.  The 
woman at the other end of the phone expressed no condolences, no 
compassion. Instead, she stated that I wasn't eligible to receive 
pension benefits since “there was no surviving spouse”.  When I 
restated that I was the surviving spouse she asked for my name 
and “the name of the deceased”.  Two women's names confirmed 
it. “There was no surviving spouse”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our 13 plus years together in a committed relationship meant 
nothing.  My partner's wishes meant nothing.  My needs as a 
survivor meant nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout her life my partner was committed to employment that 
contributed to the lives of others. She paid into the Canadian 
pension plan. She wanted her pension contributions to be 
available for me, to assist me with recovering from care giving 
and to heal from grieving.  She wanted to provide for my 
well-being as we had done for one another and our children 
throughout our relationship.  She didn't want me to have to worry 
about moving right away and all the other things that many 
survivors/widows need to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to my partner's death we discovered that her RRSP could 
not be rolled over into mine even though we were life partners 
and I was the designated beneficiary.  My partner was very 
distraught to learn that upon her death our retirement savings 
would be deregistered and taxed at a high rate. She was angry 
that our retirement savings could not remain as such whereas a 
heterosexual couple, even a common law couple after only one 
year, would be able to roll over RRSPs from one spouse to the 
other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My partner's outrage, sadness and concern motivated her to file 
a human rights complaint....

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is the government going to recognize that lesbians and gay 
men have a right to the same benefits and assistance available to 
all other tax paying citizens?  When is the government going to 
be honest with all Canadians and let them know that the rights of 
lesbians and gay men have already been recognized in the courts? 
When is the government going to put a stop to fear tactics and 
lies about financial resources being depleted if benefits and tax 
credits are extended to lesbians and gay men? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This isn't a matter of “special” rights or privileges.  It's 
about recognizing the fullness of diversity within our 
communities and facing the fact that Canadian laws need to change 
in order to reflect current realities and the equality of all 
citizens.  It's about putting an end to homophobia and 
heterosexism.  It is about action, not lip service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It's time for the government to act and to end all forms of 
discrimination against lesbian and gay Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Donna speaks with eloquence and passion for gay and lesbian 
people across this land.  They join with me today in commending 
the government and urging that the bill be adopted at the 
earliest possible time so that we can finally achieve much fuller 
equality for gay and lesbian people.

good points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I would like to learn more about from the 
hon. member.  I know he has researched this subject in great 
detail.  What is the status of a brother and a sister who share a 
home and a relationship and who may want to extend benefits one 
to the other when one passes away?  Under the current law would 
they be able to undertake something like that?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for the question.  This whole issue of looking at other 
relationships of dependency, economic dependency and emotional 
dependency, is one that I certainly have no objection to 
parliament examining carefully.  Indeed, an argument can be made 
that there are relationships which should have benefits extended 
to them.  I am pleased that the Minister of Justice has 
recognized this and I understand she is referring this issue to a 
committee for further study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case of a brother and sister who have lived together for 
many years and who are involved in a situation of economic 
dependence is something we can examine.  In fact many of us are 
asking why benefits necessarily have to be extended on the basis 
of a relationship to another person at all.  Many of us want to 
know whether we should look at another means of achieving the 
extension of benefits, whether they be health, dental or other 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to acknowledge what this bill does.  It responds 
to the Supreme Court of Canada particularly in the M. v H. 
decision and the earlier decision in Miron v Trudel.  It 
recognizes that where benefits are extended and where there are 
obligations for common law heterosexual partners, that justice 
and equality means that those same benefits should be extended to 
same sex partners.  That is what this bill is addressing. The 
other issues in terms of other relationships will be addressed by 
committee and I look forward to that discussion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I think the hon. member made reference in his speech that the 
requirement for a conjugal relationship in Bill C-23 in order to 
qualify for benefits was inclusive of people who did not have a 
sexual relationship.  His definition of conjugality, which he 
quoted from some particular document, would not require that 
there be a sexual relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it his understanding of Bill C-23 that there does not need to 
be a sexual relationship in order for two people to qualify for 
benefits?  That certainly is not spelled out anywhere in the 
bill.  I suggest that conjugality does require a sexual 
relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Madam Speaker, first of all let us 
look at this question logically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are heterosexual common law partners who have lived 
together for many years in a deeply committed loving 
relationship.  Is the hon. member for Calgary Centre and the 
Reform Party seriously suggesting that if for whatever reason 
that couple does not still have a sexual relationship that 
somehow that relationship is not a genuine common law 
relationship?  That is absolutely ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the Supreme Court of Canada and the Ontario Court of 
Appeal have talked about what is involved in a conjugal 
relationship and what are the generally acceptable 
characteristics of a conjugal relationship. This is from Justice 
Cory in M. v H.  They include shared shelter, sexual and personal 
behaviour, services, social activities, economic support and 
children, as well as the societal perception of the couple. 
However, these elements may be present in varying degrees and not 
all are necessary for the relationship to be found to be 
conjugal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly an opposite sex couple may, after many years together, 
be considered to be in a conjugal relationship although they have 
neither children nor sexual relations.  Obviously the weight to 
be accorded the various elements or factors to be considered in 
determining whether an opposite sex couple is in a conjugal 
relationship will vary widely and almost infinitely.  The same 
must hold true of same sex couples.  Courts have wisely 
determined that the approach to determining whether a 
relationship is conjugal must be flexible....There is nothing to 
suggest that same sex couples do not meet the legal definition of 
conjugal. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the courts have ruled.  Frankly it is disingenuous 
of the member for Calgary Centre to suddenly raise these concerns 
about how we can establish the legitimacy of conjugal 
relationships and common law relationships when Reform did not 
ask one question when it was just about common law heterosexual 
relationships.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were not asking at that point how to prove they had a 
sexual relationship or how to prove they were really living 
together in an intimate relationship.  They did not care about 
that then.  They certainly did not raise questions then about 
other dependent relationships when they extended this to common 
law relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Reformers really care about is that we are actually 
recognizing that the relationships of gay and lesbian people 
should be treated with equality, dignity and respect. That is 
what Reformers do not believe in because not one of them voted 
for equality even in the Canadian Human Rights Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member 
for Burnaby—Douglas spoke quite personally about a lot of 
issues.  What needs to be brought out a little further is the 
actual physical danger that gays and homosexuals may face in our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the defence of provocation allows a man to murder 
another man on the basis of a sexual advance just because it is a 
man.  I would like him to elaborate on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from Yukon for the question and for her leadership on 
the issue of the question of the defence of provocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that in some areas of the law there still exists a 
so-called gay panic defence.  Unbelievably some courts have 
recognized the gay panic defence, which suggests that if a man is 
so traumatized by having a sexual advance made on him by another 
man that he takes that other person's life it is defensible.  The 
member for Yukon is quite correct that significant challenges 
remain with respect to a defence of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the ongoing issue of violence and gay-bashing in 
our community, there are people who are beaten up simply because 
of their sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. 
There are huge concerns about gay, lesbian, bisexual and 
transgendered youth who still have levels of suicide, attempted 
suicide and alienation that are devastatingly high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the other issues that we clearly must address. 
This bill is not in a position to address them, but when we speak 
of full equality we must recognize there is still a lot of work 
to be done in many of these areas and the whole area of 
affirmation of our relationships, the diversity of our 
communities and the education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine children who are raised in an environment with a 
parent who has the kind of narrow intolerant views of some of the 
members on my right, those from the Reform Party.  What kind of 
attitude or signal will that send to them about respect for gay 
and lesbian people in our communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still tremendous work to be done on the road to full 
equality.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member for Burnaby—Douglas did not 
answer the question posed to him by the member for Calgary Centre 
who specifically asked whether this member could embrace the fact 
that the term conjugal relationship meant two people having a 
sexual relationship as defined in almost every dictionary that 
has been printed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the question of the member for Calgary Centre the member was 
asked if he believes that conjugal does not mean necessarily 
having a sexual relationship.  Then why does the minister have 
such a narrow focus in this bill?  Why not open it up so that it 
includes everyone in a dependent type of relationship whether or 
not they are having a sexual relationship?  Why is this member 
not arguing with the minister that this is a discriminatory bill 
in many respects?  The member for Burnaby—Douglas is not doing 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member 
just does not get it.  I do not know if the hon. member has 
brothers or sisters, but if he is suggesting that his 
relationship with his brother or his sister is qualitatively the 
same as his relationship with his wife, that is a ludicrous 
suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at other relationships of dependency, but the fact 
of the matter is that they are qualitatively different from the 
relationship that gay or lesbian people have with their partners.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to this piece of very 
important and timely legislation, one that has obviously raised 
emotions on all sides of this debate.  I congratulate the 
previous speaker and in fact all speakers who have represented 
their parties and their country well in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate in terms of the debate and the time that the 
legislation was introduced that we are once again put in the 
position as opposition to rush to judgment on the legislation, to 
hurry along in our remarks, and to somehow push this issue to one 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the tone, the emotion and the very important considerations 
that are brought forward by the bill and the very important 
debates that will no doubt take place in our communities, this is 
not a healthy approach.  This is not the way that we should be 
dealing with issues of such depth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was tabled in the House on Friday, February 11.  We 
have had the ensuing weekend, and here we are on Tuesday, forced 
in essence to dissect and discuss in detail hundreds of detailed 
pages which affect 68 federal statutes that will be amended. 
There are also the provincial implications and voluminous case 
law very much encompassed by the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one, as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party, do 
take great exception to and in fact resent the way in which the 
government has gone about tabling this issue.  I also question 
the timeliness in terms of its proximity to what is perhaps one 
of the biggest scandals in the country's history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an obvious attempt to deflect attention away from that, 
to somehow create an illusion that another issue will come on the 
agenda and perhaps bury the issue of the mismanagement that has 
taken place in Human Resources Development Canada, mismanagement 
that is perhaps systemic in many government departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This omnibus legislation will extend benefits and obligations to 
same sex couples on the same basis as opposite sex couples under 
the current laws of the land.  The bill is entitled the 
modernization of benefits and obligations.  There is an important 
inclusion of the word obligations in this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something we cannot gloss over.  We cannot forget that 
with the entitlement aspects of the bill there are also 
obligations that will flow.  In some instances, when we are 
talking about the tax implications, there are what could be 
viewed as or deemed negative consequences for homosexual 
individuals who will now be in a position where they will be 
paying a greater tax.  They will in fact be disentitled by virtue 
of being deemed as in what is tantamount to a common law 
situation.  That element is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The modernization as well is an encapsulation, a title which 
does represent something that is happening, a social change.  It 
is an acknowledgement in the legislation that there has been a 
step toward recognizing the social reality that we have same sex 
couples living in common law situations or what is equivalent to 
a common law situation, as we speak.  Regardless of what the 
legislation says or seeks to do, this is a social reality that 
the bill very much attempts to recognize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's reasoning behind the legislation is very much a 
result of a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada in May 1999. 
I am speaking about the M. v H. case, which made it very clear 
that governments cannot limit benefits or obligations by 
discriminating against same sex common law relationships.  The 
legislation is very much an attempt to reflect and codify what 
the supreme court already said in May of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that previous cases have also moved in 
this direction in supreme courts across the country.  In various 
provinces there has been a recognition of the obligations and a 
codification of the fact that there are rights and obligations 
that stem from a relationship between same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also very important to point out, and it bears repeating, 
that the principles of equality enshrined in the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Human Rights Act are very 
much a part of this debate, very much a part of the consideration 
by all courts, most important the Supreme Court of Canada, and I 
suspect very much at the foundation of what is behind the 
legislation, an attempt to legislate and put in place the 
protections that exist in the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is no stranger to borrowing from the supreme 
court.  We have seen what it has tried to do with the clarity 
bill.  The court has already made a pronouncement in its decision 
about the status of the situation in Quebec.  It refers 
specifically to the percentage of a majority and the question 
itself.  The government has tried to encapsulate that through 
Cartesian thinking in legislation that again has been foisted 
upon parliament and the country at a time when we should be 
discussing other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to diminish in any way the importance of this type 
of legislation.  If this were a priority, if we take the 
government at its word and this were truly a priority, why did it 
not introduce the legislation much sooner in its mandate?  Why 
did it not introduce it back in the fall session when we resumed 
after the lengthy summer recess the government orchestrated with 
the late recall?  What legislation were we faced with when we 
returned?  It was not legislation that I would suggest reflected 
the importance of the particular bill.  Here we are being forced 
to deal very quickly with very important legislation in a matter 
of days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, as indicated, will affect a great number of statutes, 
some 68 in total, legislation such as the Criminal Code of Canada 
and the Income Tax Act.  It will have many financial implications 
for all.  The government sat on the legislation for many months 
and dropped it in our laps at a time when it needed an issue that 
would deflect attention away from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation needs a great deal of examination.  It needs a 
great deal of study which will occur at the justice committee. 
Unfortunately the justice committee is backlogged at this point 
with legislation such as the new youth criminal justice act.  We 
have a mandate from this place to deal with organized crime.  We 
have a mandate to deal with changes to the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act.  However, this legislation is coming and 
will go to that committee.  There will be an opportunity to 
dissect the legislation in greater detail, which obviously will 
not occur on the floor of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I would describe as a very technical bill.  I know 
there is a tendency to delve into the moral issues and moral 
implications that arise from this discussion, but the bill is 
written in a very calculating way—and I do not say that in a 
negative way—to reflect a reality on which the courts have 
pronounced, toward which society has moved, and toward which the 
provinces are heading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give the government credit in the sense that for a change it 
is trying to be out in front of what the courts are pronouncing. 
For a change we are seeing an actual proactive attempt to reflect 
Canadian reality in this place as legislators rather than wait 
for judge made law to be imposed upon us or foisted upon elected 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces that have already  moved in this direction include 
British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario.  They have very much 
attempted to implement their own legislation, with which this 
legislation is consistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly suggest there have been indications in the private 
sector that this is reflective of a reality that has occurred. 
Many companies in the private sector have extended the type of 
benefits the legislation would also extend.  In fact many 
institutions in the country including churches have accepted and 
looked at some of the realities the bill will put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public policy, therefore, is not a sideline issue.  It is not 
the sole purpose or the actual intent of the legislation.  The 
subject of the bill or the reading of it is not about families. 
It is not about families per se and definitions.  It does not 
speak of the definition of marriage.  It does not use the term 
spouse.  It is about fairness and financial equality. 
It is not about infringing on an individual's moral or personal 
beliefs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is anything we can learn from this debate that we are 
undertaking today, it is that we should be very careful in our 
choice of words.  I am very fearful of the rhetoric and the 
ratcheting up of the rhetoric that can occur because of the 
emotion and the strong moral beliefs that are felt and held on 
both sides.  If anything, we have to be respectful of both sides 
of this debate.  This is an issue that has been with us for time 
immemorial.  This is not an issue that will be settled by this 
debate or by the passing of one piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conjugal relations certainly denote an element of intimacy. 
However, this legislation is not, I would suggest, about 
governments making judgments or being intrusive into the bedrooms 
of the nation.  This is about reflecting responsibilities and 
obligations upon individuals who have entered into a relationship 
upon which there is a degree of dependency. The bill is about the 
fiscal responsibility of the state in recognizing this human 
dynamic, this relationship that exists between both same sex and 
opposite sex partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has already been, as some would call it, a disintegration 
of the institution of marriage in the sense that the law now 
recognizes common law.  The legislation, in my view, takes it one 
step further.  It expands the definition of common law to include 
same sex partners, that is all.  It recognizes a reality that is 
very much in place in this country.  There are same sex couples 
living together in a relationship that is akin to the 
relationship that occurs between opposite sex couples.  This is a 
legal codification or recognition of the rights and obligations 
that flow from that human dynamic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bounds of matrimonial relations obviously have legal 
implications in and of themselves.  This is not an infringement 
on those legal obligations.  This is more about property, money 
and pensions.  This is about the ability of the state to support 
individuals who may be in need or entitled to a pension plan for 
which they have contributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation also requires that the same obligations, in 
terms of the contribution and the eligibility, be met, whether it 
be by a same sex or opposite sex couple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an element of logic that has to prevail here.  I know 
it is very difficult at times to move the debate from the moral 
and personal element of this.  However, there is a very sterile 
and reasoned approach that we have to take when examining the 
issue of legal responsibility and the responsibility of the state 
to care for people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not undermine the morality and the traditional 
beliefs that individuals have in their definition of family.  Let 
us be very honest and blunt about this; what has been viewed for 
many centuries as the traditional family is now different for 
many people.  It is different in their views.  The family support 
system has become very different.  I need not go further than to 
mention the example of a single parent, whether they be male or 
female.  That should in no way diminish the degree of dependence 
and unconditional love that might flow between a parent and a 
child just because he or she happens to be a single parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic issues can never be completely devoid of moral 
implications, but let us not confuse the two.  Let us not make a 
mistake in our characterization of the legislation.  This is 
about extending financial benefits to those who may be in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation has only been in our hands for two working days. 
I again question the priorities and the timing of the government. 
The Conservative Party members are looking forward to the 
opportunity to delve into the legislation at the committee level, 
to hear from witnesses and to see what the broad reaching 
implications may in fact be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My initial reading of the legislation is as I indicated at the 
outset. 
It is an attempt to codify and put in place a reality that 
exists, a legal trend through precedent and through case law that 
has emerged from our courts.  I would suggest that this 
legislation still maintains a clear and distinct designation 
between married and unmarried relationships.  It does not tread 
on that sacred ground.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term “spouse” refers and will refer, irrespective of this 
legislation, to married couples.  That term has not been touched, 
altered or removed from mainstream thought as a result of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term “common law partner” does change.  It would now be 
expanded to include both same sex and opposite sex couples.  This 
is different.  This is perhaps the major differentiation between 
the bill and the Ontario legislation in the sense that Ontario 
designates same sex and opposite sex partners in its legislation. 
It makes that clear line of distinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be ample opportunity for all members of the committee 
and, by virtue of their membership, members of their parties and 
Canadians whom they represent to make amendments and suggestions 
as to how the bill might be improved.  Some of the improvements 
may be to remove certain clauses of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it does speak again to both benefits and obligations 
and the responsibilities that flow therefrom.  Same sex couples 
will have access, by virtue of this type of legislation, to the 
same level of support, the same pension and the same financial 
benefits that other Canadian couples of the opposite sex 
currently have based on social benefits.  The important 
underlying element is, if they are eligible and if they have made 
sufficient contributions, they will still have to meet that 
criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is consistent with what the provinces have been 
looking at.  I believe that many provinces will wait to see how 
this place and the other place deals with the bill.  They are 
hinging their future plans to encompass this type of legislation 
in the provinces on what we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make no mistake.  The federal legislation will have an 
impact on much of what the provinces do already.  It will have an 
impact on things such as adoption and family maintenance.  This 
is why I think it is important for us to realize that the bill 
does have very far-reaching ramifications that we should not take 
lightly.  We should not be diverted from looking at the bill in 
detail as to what it actually does and does not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there has been a great deal of discussion by some. I 
would suggest, with the greatest of respect, that there is some 
veiled attempt to perhaps hide what may be a negative view of the 
legislation by suggesting that the bill is not broad enough, that 
it somehow does not include a parental relationship, such as a 
mother and daughter, a father and son, two sisters or two aunts 
who may live together.  There is obviously a mechanism to deal 
with that situation and that is again in the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am led to believe that there will be ample opportunity to look 
at the possibility of expanding the legislation if that is what 
some members and some witnesses choose to do.  Let us not hide 
behind the rhetoric.  Let us not somehow put forward the position 
that we wish to make it broader when truly the attempt and the 
intent is to make it narrower and to undermine and take the bill 
off the agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that what we are looking at is a bill that has the 
financial element to it:  tax breaks on retirement savings plans, 
greater access to employment insurance, collector survivor 
benefits under the Canada pension plan upon the death of a 
partner, old age security.  This is the element of the bill on 
which we should be focusing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Homosexual couples who have lived together for at least one year 
would qualify for those types of benefits, with the same time, 
the same qualifications and the same elements of accountability 
that are currently applied to common law couples. The cost is 
something that has been touched upon.  Sources in government 
indicate that there will be an initial cost associated with this. 
However, this will be offset by the responsibilities and 
obligations that are created and the offsetting disentitlement 
that will be created by this designation of same sex couples.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Conservative Party will reserve our final judgment. We 
will reserve our position until we have an opportunity to look at 
this bill in greater detail at committee.  I believe this is very 
forward looking legislation but it is legislation that can be 
improved.   We must go forward with a view to improving this in a 
reasoned, moderate and tolerant approach.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I was very intrigued by the hon. member's speech.  I believe it 
could have been delivered by the justice minister who, I am sure, 
found himself in something of a strange anomaly in the 
presentation of his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member regret that this occasion has not been used by 
the government to articulate the definition of marriage in 
legislation?  As the hon. member well knows, the definition of 
marriage has been recognized for about 150 years in common law as 
being between a man and a woman.  However, as the member also 
knows, common law is subject to judicial interpretation and can 
be changed.  One day after the passage of this legislation some 
justice could change the definition of marriage to something 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member see that as a difficulty and as something 
that could have been addressed in this legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
question from the hon. member opposite.  I have a great deal of 
respect for the work that he does both on the justice committee 
and here in the House.  I know he has also examined this bill in 
great detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definitions in this particular legislation, for whatever 
reason, steer clear of defining a marriage.  They steer clear of 
the words that would invoke the emotion and the judgment of 
members and Canadians generally when it comes to defining what 
marriage really means.  There are obviously religious and 
spiritual connotations.   As the member has pointed out, there is 
a long history that transcends boundaries and cultures when it 
comes to marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this legislation attempts to remove some of the 
emotional elements and focuses in on other very fundamental 
elements such as equality, justice and humanity.  I believe this 
is very much the direction in which we should be moving.  If we 
try to mix the two, the purpose of the bill can, unfortunately, 
be clouded and the objectives of the bill may be lost.  I think 
we should stay away from what is strictly defined as a spouse and 
trying to define what a family is using words like tradition. The 
implication being that somehow the bill takes away from those 
definitions is the danger that is averted by the wording used 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take to heart what the member has said and look forward to 
working with him at committee to improve this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
applaud the member for his speech.  As a lawyer, he has done a 
masterful job of talking for an hour and not taking any firm 
position on this particular bill.  I have listened to him, and at 
times I thought he was for it and at other times against it.  At 
the end of the day, I do not think anybody knows where he is on 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to clarify for the record a couple of 
points, if possible.  Does the member or his party see any 
legitimate, unique public policy interest in recognizing the 
institution of marriage?   Bill C-23 applies every benefit and 
obligation, with the exception of the Divorce Act, to what is 
called a common law partner, which is subject to a conjugality 
term.  We now have every benefit and obligation for marriage 
applied to these common law partnerships.  Is that the way the 
member wants to go or does he see a unique public policy interest 
in the institution of marriage?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
question from the hon. member and I will try to be very clear in 
elucidating my position as to whether I think there is a benefit 
that can flow from having a definition of family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the definition of family and a person's view and belief 
of what constitutes a family is very much an individual question 
for every individual to determine what is his or her family and 
what benefits and obligations flow from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came from a family of a single parent.  If the traditional 
view of a family were that there would have to be two parents 
living in a household to be considered a family, my personal view 
is, that would be wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the common law recognition of two people who profoundly 
care for one another and want to share their lives together 
exclusive of others.  It takes away the element of the ceremony 
and perhaps the religious or spiritual practices that are 
involved in the ceremony of marriage, but it does not remove the 
human elements of caring and sharing, living together and mutual 
respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not trying to avoid the question.  Do I think there is 
value in recognizing what is a family?  Yes.  Do I think there is 
value in defining family in rigid, exclusive and exclusionary 
terms?  No, I do not.  That may be a debate for another time.  If 
this is about giving individuals the ability to have financial 
freedom and financial entitlement in a broader, more open way, 
perhaps that is where we should be going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reserve the right to look at this legislation in greater 
detail at the committee.  I do not think that any member of the 
House or any Canadian should be forced to decide this in 48 
hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to follow 
up on a previous question and ask the hon. member who has just 
spoken whether he agrees with the petition that he presented in 
the House on June 12 in which the petitioners asked that 
parliament enact legislation so as to define in statute that a 
marriage can only be entered into between a single male and a 
single female.  He presented that petition.  Was he in support of 
it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for bringing forward that issue.  As the member knows, when we 
present petitions on behalf of our constituents, we are 
instruments of their voices.  We are bringing to parliament a 
certain view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do I ascribe to the view that the definition of marriage is 
between a man and a woman, and that particular institution, with 
all that flows from it?  Yes, I do.  If an individual wants to 
have that definition placed to one side, recognizing that there 
are other definitions such as common law and the expanded view of 
common law that this legislation would bring about, I see no 
problem with that, as long as it is not exclusionary and as long 
as it is not used in an intolerant way to say that because we are 
married we are somehow entitled to something that another is not 
on a financial basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens between a couple in what is deemed to be a 
marriage, I have no difficulty in saying that I personally 
ascribe to the view that that involves a man and a woman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should there be another definition?  The Reform Party member's 
colleague from Edmonton has brought forward a very interesting 
suggestion that we should have something called registered 
domestic partnerships, which would create another definition, 
separate from this view of what is marriage.  Perhaps that is 
something we should look at as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member across has indicated that this is a debate which has 
been around for centuries.  We are not going to cure it in 48 
hours, but at least at the committee we will have an opportunity 
to look at some of the options and try to achieve the largest 
umbrella that will help the largest number of people, which is, 
at the end of the day, what we all should strive for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Scarborough East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak in favour of 
Bill C-23, the modernization of benefits and obligations act.  I 
begin by commending the Minister of Justice, the Minister of 
Finance, the President of the Treasury Board, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development and the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration for their joint efforts, co-operation and 
collaboration in enabling the government to table this omnibus 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this legislation is straightforward.  The bill 
will amend legislation to recognize the principle of equal 
treatment for all common law relationships.  Same sex partners 
will be included in the new definition of common law partners. 
They will be granted the same benefits and obligations as 
opposite sex common law partners.  Same sex spouses who have 
lived together for at least one year will qualify for benefits, 
the same length of time as common law spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 will amend 68 federal statutes, affecting 20 federal 
departments and agencies.  The legislation affected covers a wide 
range of subject matter, from the Bank Act to the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act, to the criminal code and the Firearms Act, the Indian 
Act, the Public Service Employment Act, the Trade Unions Act and 
the War Veterans Allowances Act, just to name a few statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes are about fairness.  The changes are not 
about granting special rights; they are about equality before the 
law.  The changes are about fairness, tolerance and 
non-discrimination.  These changes are a reminder to us all that 
it is not acceptable to discriminate against any person at any 
time or at any place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes will ensure that our laws reflect the 
values of Canadians, and Canadian values, values that are 
enshrined in our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak about the values of Canadians it is not surprising 
to find that the majority of Canadians believe, as I do, that 
same sex couples should receive equal treatment.  According to an 
Angus Reid poll taken in September 1999, 67% of Canadians agreed 
that same sex couples should have the same legal rights and 
obligations as a man and woman living together as common law 
partners.  Regional support was broken down as follows:  in my 
province of Ontario, 66% of Canadians were in support; in B.C. 
support was at 68%; and in Atlantic Canada support was at a high 
of 75%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I would like to applaud the federal government for taking 
bold leadership on this issue, unfortunately I cannot do so.  On 
the day the bill was introduced in the House of Commons the 
Minister of Justice stated:  “Canadians are probably way ahead 
of legislators on this issue”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes come almost a year after a Supreme Court of Canada 
decision ruled that same sex common law couples are entitled to 
the same benefits under family law as heterosexual couples.  On 
Friday the Minister of Justice confirmed that the court gave the 
government the direction in which it needed to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both federally and provincially there have been many challenges 
before courts and human rights tribunals regarding the benefits 
of same sex couples.  In its May 1999 ruling in M. v H. the 
Supreme Court of Canada made it clear that government cannot 
limit benefits or obligations by discriminating against same sex 
common law relationships.  Denying equal treatment before the law 
to same sex common law partners is contrary to the principles of 
equality enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
as well as the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several provinces have already begun to amend their legislation. 
Since 1997 B.C. has amended numerous statutes, including six core 
statutes, to add same sex couples.  In June 1999 Quebec amended 
28 statutes and 11 regulations to grant same sex couples the same 
benefits and obligations that are available to opposite sex 
common law spouses.  In October 1999 in Ontario, to comply with 
the supreme court decision in M. v H., the Harris government 
passed omnibus legislation to bring 67 statutes into compliance 
with the ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is not the first time the federal government has 
passed legislation to extend benefits to same sex partners. 
In fact parliament passed Bill C-78, which extended survivor's 
pension benefits to same sex partners of federal public service 
employees.  All three territories and a number of other provinces 
have also passed similar legislation.  These provinces include 
Manitoba, Quebec, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Ontario, New 
Brunswick and Nova Scotia.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be noted that Bill C-23 will not have an impact 
on the private sector.  However, it is equally worthy to note 
that over 200 private sector employers have already extended work 
related benefits, such as dental care and pension benefits, to 
same sex partners for their employees, as do most municipalities, 
hospitals, libraries and community and social service 
institutions across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon the federal government to act now.  While 
some of the provinces have amended their statutes, Canadians must 
remember that under the Constitution Act, 1867 legislative 
jurisdiction is divided between the Parliament of Canada and the 
provincial legislatures.  For example, Ontario amended 67 
provincial laws that were the exclusive responsibility of the 
province, most notably the Family Law Act.  This omnibus bill 
tabled by the government will amend only federal statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give some specific examples.  Under the Income Tax Act a 
married person or a common law opposite sex partner may claim a 
tax credit for a dependent spouse or partner.  The changes would 
provide that a same sex partner may also now claim the tax credit 
for a dependent partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Old Age Security Act a married person or a common law 
opposite sex partner may claim an income supplement depending on 
the combined income of both partners.  The changes that were 
tabled today would provide an income supplement claim for a same 
sex partner, but it would also be based on combined income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see from the two examples I have used that the bill 
strikes a balance by extending both benefits and obligations to 
committed same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give another example to illustrate the point I 
have just made about this balance.  A household's income is one 
of the criteria used to determine a common law couple's 
eligibility for the GST or the HST tax credit.  Because our laws 
do not presently recognize committed same sex relationships, 
individuals in such relationships can claim eligibility for these 
tax credits based on their personal income.  Under the proposed 
legislation their eligibility would be calculated based on 
combined income, representing, in total, some savings for the 
government.  On the other hand, we estimate that awarding 
survivor's benefits to surviving partners of committed same sex 
partners will represent a modest cost to the CPP.  However, 
overall we estimate that the fiscal impact of these amendments 
will be minimal, if at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent court rulings have confirmed for legislatures the need to 
address the constitutionality of certain laws that discriminate 
against same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians it is our responsibility to amend these 
statutes to ensure they conform with the charter.  In the absence 
of legislative action the courts will continue to address cases 
in a piecemeal fashion.  The status quo is not an option. It 
promises confusion, unfairness, and continuing and costly 
litigation.  Equally important, it risks making the courts the 
arbiters of social policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our proposed bill affirms parliament's primary responsibility 
for social policy.  It provides a responsible, balanced and 
legally sound framework within which to address recent court 
decisions and, most importantly, to ensure that same sex couples 
receive fair and equal treatment under the law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
find myself in somewhat of an unusual position, being opposed to 
this bill while being on the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is fairly simple.  It really could be written in one 
line:  common law heterosexual relationships are the legal 
equivalent to common law homosexual relationships.  Therein lies 
the entire issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT45"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT45"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1345

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of what any of us think, the face of the Canadian 
family is changing.  It is really quite revolutionary.  In the 
course of my lifetime the divorce rate, for instance, has gone 
quite high.  Something in the order 40% to 45% of marriages fail 
over the course of the lifetime of a marriage.  I dare say that 
in the House the rate is even higher.  The cost of marriage 
breakup is pretty difficult to quantify.  My own view of it is 
that frankly the children pay the price for marriage breakup, 
which is a very regrettable fact in our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill turns common law homosexual relationships into the 
legal equivalent of common law heterosexual relationships, which 
for many purposes is equivalent to marriage.  However no one 
seems to get into the issue of equivalency and whether it should 
be treated as such.  To say that marriages break up over the 
course of a lifetime at a rate of about 40% or 45% is and of 
itself a regrettable statistic, but common law relationships 
break up something in the order of 60% to 65% over the course of 
five years.  From what I understand, gay and lesbian 
relationships break up at the rate of about 90% over the course 
of one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For public policy purposes one has to question whether they 
should be treated as equivalencies in law.  Statistically the 
relationships are clearly not equivalent.  My view for public 
policy purposes is that they should not be treated as the same 
before all purposes of public policy.  However the bill does 
precisely that.  I will not argue the point that common law 
relationships, be they homosexual or heterosexual, are not as 
committed, as loving or as whatever as any other relationship, 
but I do not think that frankly is the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not be basing public policies on some dubious notions, 
shall we say, of commitment and care for each other.  Rather we 
should be basing public policy on the basis of the encouragement 
of what works and the treatment of other relationships as not 
offensive to equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is anyone in this debate who argues with 
the basic point of equality and treating relationships in so far 
as possible on a basis of equality, but it seems that the 
government of the day, regardless of political stripe, needs to 
encourage the relationships that form the bedrock of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arguments that support the passage of the bill are as 
follows.  The first argument is that the courts made us do it. 
That is what I call the bunker Mike Harris argument.  Mike Harris 
thought that the best way to deal with a difficult political 
policy issue was to empty the legislature and have first, second 
and third readings all on the same day.  Then he simply hoped 
that the fallout would be minimal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been cited by some as a way to handle a difficult 
issue, and I quite agree that this is a difficult issue.  It is 
not overly democratic, but what the heck.  We get through it and 
get on with other things.  It is called political expediency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What disappoints me most is the unwillingness and the inability 
of our government to give serious consideration to the dependency 
model legislation.  Not only does that dependency model 
legislation enjoy significant support in the caucus, but in my 
view it would enjoy significant support in the House.  It was a 
great opportunity, to turn a phrase of Prime Minister Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau, to get the nation out of the bedrooms of the 
nation and to remodel public policy based upon need or dependency 
rather than upon one's sex life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By choosing this route the government has exacerbated the 
divisions both within caucus and within the House rather than 
leading members to points of reconciliation and harmonization of 
views.  The government has bought into the bunker Mike Harris 
mentality without every having read the cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any fair minded reading of the lead case in the area of M. v H. 
shows that the courts are more than willing to defer to 
parliament.  In fact, they have given four and a half or almost 
five years for parliament to debate the issue and deal with it. 
Now we are told that we will have about two weeks in which to put 
the legislation through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The management or control of this issue is well on its way to 
achieving that which it tried to studiously avoid. 
I believe the House could have come together on a dependency 
model and that parliamentarians could have articulated the views 
to and for Canadians, but instead in the haste to control 
government has made the issue divisive.  I am perfectly prepared 
to concede that the issue is complex and fraught with 
difficulties, but the bill in my view is the refuge of the 
intellectually bankrupt and is the least that can be done under 
the circumstances.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not leadership in the field.  It is frankly leadership 
by doing the minimum.  Canadians have every right to wonder why 
together, whatever one's sexual persuasion, is the legal 
equivalent of marriage.  For those of us who hold a high view of 
marriage, this is an amendment that is irksome and may well be 
damaging to the overall health of society.  One year is frankly 
just like getting socks and underwear in the drawer.  To make it 
the legal equivalent of marriage is something that needs to be 
thought about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes that having socks and underwear in a 
drawer is the legal equivalent of marriage and in fact prefers 
that relationship over the commitment by a son or a daughter to 
look after an infirm or disabled parent or child.  When we put it 
in that phrasing we realize that we are going down a path of 
public policy which many Canadians may well not wish to go down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something not quite right here.  The bill will not 
enjoy my support.  One of the sales points of the bill is that 
the government would leave the definition of marriage alone. 
Instead of articulating the definition of marriage in the bill 
the government has chosen to say nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course one day after the passage of the bill there is nothing 
to stop a justice of any court saying that in his or her view the 
definition of marriage is old, antiquated, out of date and should 
be modernized.  Then once again we will be going through this 
dance of the dialectic in the courts.  We will be complaining 
about judicial activism and that parliamentarians will not have 
any say in the issue.  Instead of dealing with the issue at this 
opportune moment, we are not dealing with the issue at this 
opportune moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again Canadians will not have their say in what they 
believe to be the essence of marriage and all the resolutions 
passed in the House will not matter at all, which is quite 
regrettable.  A court will once again decide social policy, which 
is probably one of the last places one should deal with social 
policy.  Then the justice minister of the day will introduce a 
bill amending the Marriage Act, arguing that he or she had really 
no choice but to follow the wishes of the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a criticism of judicial activism.  Rather it is a 
criticism of parliamentary inactivism.  Canadians do not have a 
say through their elected representatives because the elected 
representatives do not insist on having their say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a multitude of good reasons to oppose the bill, but the 
most significant one is that the government could have done so 
much more and has chosen to do so little.  It did not define 
marriage and it could have.  It could have got out of the 
bedrooms of the nation and it did not.  It could have adopted a 
dependency model legislation and it did not.  It could have 
reflected the changing face of Canadian families in our society.

done so.  In spite of pressure in his own caucus he has brought a

that is definitely needed.  I encourage him in his analytical and 
well reasoned approach to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He and I personally are on side on a number of the issues, on 
the weaknesses of the bill.  I was just wondering, if there was 
one thing that could be changed, what would be the number one

bill to reflect the resolution of the House last May or June that 
the definition of marriage be put in legislative form.  To my 
mind that would have put to rest one of the most significant 
arguments.  It would have allowed all of us to deal in a policy 
atmosphere which I think is fairer, more equitable and recognizes 
that the face of the Canadian family is changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only needs to think of the attempt to deal with the Canada 
pension legislation.  When the Canada pension legislation was 
introduced 30 years ago there were eight workers for every 
dependant.  Presently there are five workers for every dependant. 
When other baby boomers and I reach the dependency stage there 
will be three workers for every dependant.  That will put 
enormous pressure on our system of caring for Canadians.  That 
reflects in a profound measure how the face of Canadian society 
will change. 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I also congratulate the member for Scarborough 
East on a very well thought out speech.  I do not think he will 
be the only member on his side with that point of view by the 
time we get through this debate.  I agree with him that the bill 
is intellectually bankrupt.  I will be the next member to speak 
for our party and will say more about that when I give my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member agree with me that it would be good if we just 
put the bill aside for a while and had a committee tour the 
country to talk about the dependency model?  Literally tens of 
thousands of people will be discriminated against.  It will not 
be too long before the bill goes before the supreme court because 
someone does not fall under the category of having conjugal sex. 
Then we will have to come back with some other kind of bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would we not be saving the country a lot of money and a lot of 
effort if we had a committee tour the country and listened to all 
the different models?  In her speech this morning the minister 
said that we had to start looking at these models.  Why is there 
a big rush to put the bill through today?  Why do we not do it 
right and when it comes to the House the next time it will be 
done properly for everyone who is dependent on someone in Canada 
and not just certain groups of society specified by conjugal sex? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the overall 
principle that we should be looking at other dependency models. 
The face of the Canadian family is changing and is changing quite 
dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot buy the argument for the issue of haste in terms of 
this bill.  We have had something in the order of four and a half 
or five years since the lead decision from the supreme court.  To 
my mind we have wasted those four or five years while we have let 
courts and activists decide the issues.  In my view it is time 
for the Canadian people to be heard.  If there was a fair hearing 
on the issue of dependency, I think Canadians would speak very 
vociferously on that issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, democracy 
is the principle underlying civilized human relations in 
society. Contrary to an all too common notion, it is fragile 
because it is based on a tacit agreement between 
parliamentarians and citizens that the most diverse points of 
view should be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that respect, our political system leaves a lot of room to 
the executive branch, which controls the legislative branch and 
which appoints the judges who administer justice. This is what 
gives particular importance to our parliamentary committees. 
These committees are the one forum where partisanship can and 
must be avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the committee examining Bill C-20 ignored this tacit 
agreement and gave the worst example of blind partisanship by 
government members.

forgetting that democracy is both a means and an end—

</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the human resources minister had a very hard 
time trying to explain why she kept shovelling millions out the 
door even after she admitted that her department told her it was 
operating with virtually no administrative controls, or, in her 
own words, in the dark ages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that she has had a day to get advice from her image 
consultant, perhaps she can try again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, after learning of a $1 billion bungle, did the minister 
just reach for her chequebook? 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the only ones who are asking for a stop 
to these programs are the hon. members in the loyal opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us understand that the programs we were approving went to 
communities in opposition ridings like Lac-Saint-Jean where the 
unemployment level was 17.9% and a transitional jobs fund or a 
Canada jobs fund can really make a difference; or in the riding 
of St. John's East where the unemployment level was 13.8%.  We 
know it is these kinds of programs that make a difference. 
<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the minister did not answer the question.  It appears 
she is more interested in damage control than in fixing the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day after she learned about the audit she was just concerned 
about continuing to shove as much money out the door as quickly 
as possible.  No new controls were in place and no management 
changes had been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask again, why did the minister write $3 million in grant 
cheques immediately after she found out that $1 billion had been 
bungled? 
<P><A NAME="LINK153"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, unlike the hon. member who would like to 
cut $15 billion out of the social programs of the government, we 
do not feel that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting is that it is not all members of the Reform 
Party who want these programs stopped.  In fact, as late as 
November 12 the member for Nanaimo—Cowichan wrote to me saying 
“I have received several complaints from constituents who have 
been very frustrated over the time it takes for Canada jobs funds 
to be approved”.   He said that he could understand the 
frustrations experienced by applicants but that he was wondering 
if there was any way that the waiting period for Canada jobs 
funds could be shortened. 
<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let us try again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the minister's assurances to the House over and over 
that everything was just hunky-dory with these programs, she 
found out the truth at some point.  She did not share it with the 
rest of us but she did find out.  She found out that her own 
department was out of control, that the moneys that were going 
out, instead of doing the good things she claimed they were 
doing, were simply uncontrolled and mismanaged.  Yet she 
continued to spend the money and send it out the door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very simple and I would like an answer:  Why? 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again let me remind the House that we 
have a very strong strategy to deal with the administrative 
deficiencies in my department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member to ask her seatmate, the member for 
Skeena, who even today, yesterday and the day before had his 
office call my office asking why we could not hurry up the 
approval of the Canada jobs fund.

we are on our second day and the minister has yet to answer a 
question.  The question is pretty straightforward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a Liberal could think that handling a billion dollar 
boondoggle could be best fixed by hiring another communications 
expert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's first reaction to the audit was to spend another 
$3 million.  She waited two full months before she started to put 
the brakes on any spending.  I am not convinced she ever did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question again, very simple again and for the second day in 
a row is why did the minister wait two months before she stopped 
the spending at HRD when she knew that the bungle was going on in 
her department? 
<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

do not know why the minister thinks she is going to get away with 
this.  She has not answered the question for the second day in a 
row.  It is as if being a Liberal means somebody else has to say 
that they are sorry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They hired communications experts to try and give them a new and 
creative spin on it, but this is what happened after she knew 
what was going wrong in her department.  She did not call her 
managers on the carpet and say that this had to stop.  She did 
not freeze all new spending.  She did not order an immediate 
audit of the grants that were going out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did she do?  She swept the audit off her desk, opened up 
her chequebook and continued to write the cheques.

spending—

Prime Minister is forgetting one thing.  The National Assembly 
was unanimous on the school board issue.  People were calling 
for change, which is far from being the case now, because all 
parties in the National Assembly are opposed to Bill C-20.  The 
four opposition parties in this House are asking that the 
committee be allowed to travel, as the fisheries committee is 
going to do and as the committee on free trade has already done.

<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when there was a constitutional amendment, the Government of 
Quebec did not want to hear from a single witness or strike a 
committee to hear from those who had objections.  What is more, 
I allowed a free vote in the House of Commons.  And they are 
accusing us of being undemocratic?  They accused us of being 
practically traitors because we allowed our members to vote 
freely on a matter as important as religion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have nothing to learn from people who did not wish to hear 
from a single witness on such a fundamental matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister and his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
claim they are passing Bill C-20 to protect Canadian democracy. 
They must have a pretty poor idea of what Canadian democracy is, 
because all that they are doing is preventing it from being 
expressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Prime Minister tell us what his government is so afraid 
of that it needs to so restrict the time for the committee 
debate, to limit the number of witnesses and to refuse to go and 
meet people where they live?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

about what the committee is doing.  On the contrary, I 
congratulate it on its accomplishments so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty-five witnesses will be heard.  Meanwhile, the members of 
the opposition across the way, who claim to be in favour of 
democracy, were spending their time trying to table press 
clippings in the House of Commons, instead of engaging in any 
real debate on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has acted in a reasonable manner.  It is doing

one might well wonder which government it was that imposed a gag 
order on this House during the second reading of a bill of such 
importance to the future of the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the Prime Minister not just admit that, if he refuses to 
allow the committee to travel to Quebec and to the rest of 
Canada, it is because he knows that the people of Quebec are 
opposed to his bill and that his government is not fit to show 
its face anywhere in Canada because of the terrible way it has 
managed public funds at Human Resources Development Canada?

Thomson Newspapers has announced that it intends to sell all its 
newspapers with the exception of <I>The Globe and Mail</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that this raises the alarming prospect of an incredible 
concentration of ownership in the print media in this country, 
and given that this issue has been with us since the Kent

could tell us, whether the government now intends to act in some

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the Prime Minister or the minister in charge whether 
or not the government has a contingency plan to bring in the kind 
of legislation recommended by the Kent commission almost 20 years 
ago, to make sure that we are not studying this after the fact 
and to make sure that we do not have a House of Commons committee 
looking at the fact that we have a monopoly in the print media in 
this country.

Perhaps the committee should look into it right away.  I have no 
objection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Industry could look into the problem 
of too much concentration in the private sector.  Perhaps the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the Minister of Human Resources Development quoted 
figures from 1995 to justify spending by her department in her 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did her department rely on data from 1995 for 1998 and 1999 
projects? How many years must one go back to justify spending in 
ridings represented by ministers?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the statistics from Statistics Canada 
that were used for the transitional jobs fund were those that 
were available in 1995 for the Canada jobs fund.  It is those 
that are available in 1997. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the minister referred to pockets of unemployment in her 
riding.  Therefore her department must have prepared 
documentation for her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do these same pockets of unemployment apply to determining the 
hours one needs to qualify for employment insurance?  Do these 
same pockets apply? 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

context of employment insurance and employment how pleased we are 
to find ourselves in circumstances with the lowest levels of 
unemployment since 1974.

rise on a point of order.  During the course of question period 
the HRDC minister answered a question by saying that I had been

to be going to my constituency.  That is a lie.

we cannot use that word in the House.  It could be that there is 
a difference of opinion on both sides, but the hon. member is one

disregarding the authority of the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to the authority granted to me by Standing Order 11, I

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
during question period the Minister of Human Resources 
Development also made statements that I was constantly phoning 
her office.  I want you to know, Mr. Speaker, that was not true 
and I would ask her to withdraw those comments.  They were 
misleading the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We have the hon. minister with us now. The 
hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

with regard to the representations of the member for 
Kootenay—Columbia, I would want to clarify that it was his 
office that called my office on January 5 and January 17, the 
staff in his office.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, with regard to the member for Nanaimo—Cowichan, I was 
quoting from a letter that he wrote to me on November 12 which 
read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Mrs. Stewart: 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received several complaints from constituents who have 
been very frustrated by the time that it takes for CJF (Canada 
Jobs Fund) to be approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I, along with the applicants, do acknowledge that this is 
a grant extended by the government the time involved before 
confirmation of acceptance is obtained often leads to financial 
hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of my constituent...he has leased facilities in 
Chemainus, B.C., where he has a potential of creating much needed 
jobs for about 15 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My request from HRDC for concurrence was received June 16, 
1999...and a representative from HRDC has informed me that the 
application has just now been forwarded to Victoria, B.C., where 
it is expected to be for up to three weeks. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Question period was a bit feisty today as it 
often is.  We have opinions from both sides.  Many times the 
preambles to the questions have words that incite all of us, and 
the answers which the government gives are sometimes the same 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we would all agree that this was not necessarily the 
best question period we have had.  I think the sooner we get on 
with the business of the House the better off we will be.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a statement in question period by the minister where she 
quoted some information she had.  We have a member saying that is 
not quite so.  We have the minister on the other side explaining 
why she said it.  I think that is debate.  I do not think that is 
a point of order.  I would like to let that point of order rest 
there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the member for Kootenay—Columbia.  What the 
member did following question period was accuse the minister of 
saying something that was improper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I will hear what the hon. 
opposition House leader has to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  When the minister returned to the House 
and made a statement, she said that she would like to clarify it. 
In fact, she had not heard the member from Kootenay—Columbia had 
not phoned her office, he had not contacted her and she called it 
a clarification.  But that was exactly the point the member for 
Kootenay—Columbia made.  He said that he had not phoned her 
office and the minister knows— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  When I ask a member of parliament to 
withdraw a word is really apart from anything else.  It is 
between myself and the member of parliament.  I simply did not 
want him to use that word.  I asked him to withdraw twice.  He 
refused to withdraw the word that he had used and that is why he 
was expelled.

Wednesday, February 9, the member for Timiskaming—Cochrane said

<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my point of order arises from question period 
and from what has just transpired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would ask once again, as we have made similar requests, that 
the minister table the document that she referred to today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as you will know, there were previous occasions 
where this has happened.  The Prime Minister referred to a number 
of documents last week.  The Speaker referred to the citation in 
Beauchesne's, section 495, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A minister is not at liberty to read or quote from a dispatch 
or other state paper not before the House without being 
prepared to lay it on the Table. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, with respect, I believe you had reserved 
judgment and were intending to review <I>Hansard</I> to see the 
specific references that were made by the Right Hon. Prime 
Minister.  We would again request that those documents be 
laid before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As to the member's second point, I made a 
decision on that day.  I reviewed everything and there was no 
need to come back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the document that was quoted today, if these were notes 
that a minister had, then these are not within the purview of 
what we would ask to be provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough referring specifically to the 
letter that the minister was reading? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, from my vantage point, the 
minister read directly from a letter or a memo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I ask the hon. minister, if she has the 
letter that she quoted from, will she please table it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be pleased to 
table it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
agree with you 100%. In a civilized world we do not have to use 
words like lying.  I would like clarification from you, Mr.

was over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to see that we 
are getting the offer to table some documents.  However, my 
understanding is that the Chair has to ask for unanimous consent 
for the minister to table a document.  I do not believe you asked 
for that.  The reason I suggest that is that there may be a 
problem of confidentiality between the member— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. opposition House leader will know 
that when a private member asks to place a document on the table 
he or she must have unanimous consent.  When ministers quote from 
a document, it is their duty to lay it on the table.  This is an 
official document and it should be tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if it is the duty of a 
minister to table a document that has been quoted, why was she 
asked to table it?   Why did she not offer to do it herself?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MODERNIZATION OF BENEFITS AND OBLIGATIONS ACT

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-23, an 
act to modernize the Statutes of Canada in relation to benefits 
and obligations, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, Agriculture; the hon. 
member for Acadie-Bathurst, Employment Insurance; the hon. member 
for Cumberland—Colchester, Airline Industry.

<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in the debate on 
Bill C-23, same sex benefits, better known as the bedroom bill 
because if nothing is happening in the bedroom one does not 
qualify. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Right Honourable Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the former Liberal 
Prime Minister of Canada, said in 1967 that “The state has no 
business in the bedrooms of the nation”. Unfortunately, the 
Minister of Justice and her government have decided that it was 
really necessary to introduce a bill whose purpose goes against 
that historic statement. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister introduced the bill on Friday she kept 
repeating terms like tolerance, inclusion and acceptance.  It is 
too bad the minister and the government do not practise what they 
preach.  The bill is an inappropriate intrusion and in fact is 
discriminatory.  It extends benefits based on sexual activity and 
excludes all other types of dependency relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is particularly disturbing at a time when more and more 
dependency relationships that do not include sexual activity are 
growing.  Here we have the Minister of Justice, representing a 
party whose mantra was the government has no business in the 
bedrooms of the nation, introducing a bill that makes private 
sexual activity the sole criterion for eligibility and benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How times change.  We have the government that preaches 
democracy and inclusion excluding thousands of individuals who 
are in dependency relationships, thanks to the economic situation 
caused by this uncaring government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has one spin and it is based solely on conjugal 
relationships.  It is unfair.  Seventy-one per cent of Canadians 
feel that benefits and obligations should not depend on 
relationships like spouse but on any relationships of dependency 
where people are living together. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat that for my colleague over there from Vancouver 
city. Seventy-one per cent of Canadians feel that benefits and 
obligations should not depend on relationships like spouse but on 
any relationship of dependency where people are living together, 
such as elderly siblings living together or a parent and an adult 
child living together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the government is out of step on this issue by basing 
benefits on private sexual intimacies rather than on cases of 
dependency.  The Liberals will have to hire sex police to apply 
the legislation, and will that not be interesting?  They may 
laugh at that right now but we will have sex police, mark my 
words, before this bill is finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see a lot of litigation surrounding the bill and, more 
important for all those Liberal friends over there, a lot of new 
legal practices in Canada.  The government seems to do a lot of 
drafting of bills and setting things up so that lawyers have more 
work to do.  That is wrong.   The bill should not be about 
lawyers.  It should be about people living together and depending 
on each other.  Sex should not be involved in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 8, 1999, parliament passed a motion with 216 in favour 
and 55 against.  The motion called on parliament to take all 
necessary steps to preserve the definition of marriage as the 
union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.  I 
was very proud like many of those other hundreds of people here 
to vote in favour of that bill.  One would have thought this bill 
would have presented the government with an opportunity to 
enshrine this motion, but not a word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems the Liberals have a problem with the institution of 
marriage.  Simple recognition of this institution would have gone 
a long way in fostering support for Bill C-23.  The bill gives 
out marriage-like benefits by failing to define marriage.  What 
is the problem with the government?  Is it afraid to define 
marriage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be honest.  We all know why we have the bill before us 
today.  I feel sorry for the legislative drafters at justice. 
They must have burned a lot of midnight oil over the last week or 
so in putting the bill together.  Imagine the rush they were put 
to.  All this was in an attempt to deflect attention away from 
the debacle at human resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How obvious can one get in one's attempt to salvage the 
squandering of one billion dollars?  I would have thought the 
spin doctors in the PMO would have come up with something more 
novel and creative than this.  It is an insult to think that one 
can detract attention away from an issue that has shaken the 
faith of Canadians in the system, but this government always 
tries that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance department estimates that 1.6% of couples are gay 
which would indicate some 140,000 homosexual couples.  In 
preparing this rush job to save its political skin, did the 
government consult, contact or discuss the situation for others 
who were in dependency relationships but who were not engaging in 
sexual activity?  In a bill like this one would we not think that 
would be important?  When we are taking a major step, how much 
time did we take to talk to people who were not engaged in sexual 
activity?   It looks like very little if none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a right to ask why we are moving forward a step 
at a time.  Why are we moving one step?  Which couple will be the 
first to go to the supreme court and say “We do not have sex but 
we think we also have rights?”  That couple will go to the 
supreme court and win, and we will be back here drafting more 
legislation.  Why do we not get it right the first time?  Let us 
get it right before we proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the government for a moment give that element any thought? 
The Minister of Justice is a master at consulting for years and 
years on other issues.  On the Young Offenders Act it was years 
and years.  On drunk driving it was years and years.  On 
consecutive sentencing it was years and years.  I could go on and 
on.  The minister is an expert at consulting and getting no bills 
through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes this issue any different?  The minister got orders 
from her political masters, the supreme court.  If the Liberals 
had it their way, all legislation would be drafted by the court.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government loves this judicial activism.  If the court says 
so, we must comply.  On the other hand the court has used and 
abused the charter for its own purposes and with the inertia of 
the government it is the court making the laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the introduction of the charter to the Canadian 
constitution, a great departure began from the historic division 
of responsibilities between parliament and the courts.  The 
consequences of this departure include the replacement of the 
supremacy of parliament with the supremacy of the constitution as 
interpreted by judges.  Power has been transferred from 
parliament and legislatures to the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, this charter has thrust unelected judges with no 
direct accountability to the people into the realm of decision 
making and political activism.  I do not think Canadians ever 
wanted their judges to be involved in political activism.  That 
is what is happening in this country because of the Liberal 
government and the Tory government before it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences of this new but improper alignment of the roles 
of parliament, the administration and the courts have been far 
reaching and dangerous.  Frankly it is time to re-establish 
several hundred years of constitutional convention whose premise 
is that parliament makes the laws, the administration administers 
the laws, and the courts are there to interpret the laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the Prime Minister get up in the House many times 
when we have talked about the Senate.  He has said that we have 
done things traditionally for a long time and that it was good 
for this country.  He has changed in these areas; he should also 
change on the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any delegation of law making by the executive to the courts by 
default, which is what the government does, or any proactive 
assumption of law making by the courts is a violation of the 
basic constitutional principle.  It needs to be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has given tacit approval to this misalignment of 
responsibilities by its vagueness in drafting laws and passing 
the buck to a supreme court only too eager to employ the charter 
in each and every instance.  We have to get away from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This parliament has to draft laws that do not need big 
interpretations and then come back to parliament.  We should be 
doing our job in the House and we should not have to blame any 
judges.  But we are not doing the job in the House.  The minister 
admitted that this morning by saying that this law is not perfect 
and that we have to look after all these other people.  Where is 
it?  It is not in this bill.  What is the rush?  Let us get it 
right before we proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By its vagueness in drafting laws and passing the buck to the 
supreme court, which I mentioned is only too eager to apply the 
charter in each and every instance, the government provides every 
opportunity to the court to flex its charter muscle.  The 
government plays cat and mouse with the court, particularly on 
sensitive national issues and thus encourages and nurtures the 
role of the court as a law maker rather than an interpreter of 
the laws. The Reform Party would put an end to this charter 
madness and judicial activism by way of a three part program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, an all party judicial parliamentary committee should be 
struck to review the fitness of all supreme court nominees.  It 
is time the people had some say, not just the leader of the 
government. We have a three part plan which makes some sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, all legislation should be reviewed for its charter 
compatibility before it becomes law.  My colleagues on the 
Liberal side seem not to understand this.  They are not doing 
their jobs on that side.  They are producing laws that are being 
shot back to us from the supreme court all of the time.  They 
should be ashamed of themselves for making laws that keep on 
coming back here from the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  How many sides have you sat on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Madam Speaker, they ask how many sides 
I have sat on.  I have been on one side, the right side, not the 
left side.  I know it really upsets them when we have good ideas. 
The people sitting on the backbench on that side are not allowed 
to have any ideas. They have to rubber stamp what comes from the 
front row. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very nice to see my Liberal friend from Scarborough East 
get up this morning and say that this bill was not a good bill 
and he could not vote for it.  I hope a few others on that side 
do the same.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, all supreme court decisions should be reviewed to see 
if they gibe with the intent of the laws passed by this 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke earlier about the rush to get this legislation to 
parliament.  One has to really wonder about the Liberals' sense 
of priority and condemn their manipulation of the events that 
take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a country which has been in limbo for over a year 
on the issue of child pornography.  Despite the minister 
promising to act swiftly and decisively on the issue, we will 
wait around probably for another six months or more before we 
have a decision.  Where is the justice minister on that issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and the government refused all attempts by the 
opposition to have the notwithstanding clause invoked to 
reinstate the possession of child pornography as an offence. 
Sixty-four government members wanted to use that too but they 
voted against it when the Prime Minister said so.  They saw no 
urgency in protecting our children from pedophiles who perpetrate 
this perverted behaviour.  They ignored a petition with 500,000 
signatures calling for reinstatement of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing how the Liberals jump to attention for other 
groups.  What is more of a priority, same sex benefits or 
protecting innocent young children?  We will see how quickly the 
minister acts on this issue if the law is struck down by the 
supreme court.  Will it be a priority then?  That will be a big 
issue in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other criminal justice issues cry out for attention.  Surely the 
conditional sentencing mess requires attention.  Surely the issue 
of drugs in prisons and the proliferation of drug use and its 
terrible social consequences are very much priority issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took the minister three years before we got her to act on 
young offenders.  It took her three years on young offenders. She 
can sure study things to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer we finally got around to the issue of impaired 
driving.  How many years did that take?  We await the 
finalization of this initiative.  It is on the Order Paper, but 
obviously same sex benefits is more of a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister made a big issue about her animal abuse bill last 
December.  It was so important.  Where is it now?  It got the PR, 
it got the flack, but where is it now?  Same sex legislation took 
over from that.  It was good politics at the time, but it 
currently is not so important now that certain lobby groups are 
appeased for the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This opportunism is truly the hallmark of the Liberal 
government.  Everything is put on a back burner so the government 
can play politics in its feeble attempt to deflect attention from 
the real issues of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another bill, proceeds of crime, languishes on the Order Paper. 
Of all criminal justice issues confronting this nation, the 
minister drops everything because the supreme court sets the 
agenda for her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime has become the single greatest threat to 
Canada's sovereignty according to those who fight crime for a 
living, the policemen.  They tell us that organized crime has 
become the biggest single threat to Canada's sovereignty. What 
are we doing about it?  We passed the motion in the House. I have 
not seen the other side coming to this side and saying let us get 
that committee going.  Let us get that before the House of 
Commons.  No, no.  The House agreed unanimously to look at 
organized crime.  We have done nothing about it since it was 
passed in the House because it is not a priority of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The breadth and scope of organized crime is immense. It has 
penetrated any area where there is an illegal dollar to be made. 
Would the minister consider this a priority?  It certainly does 
not seem so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the weekend Toronto's new chief of police had some advice 
for the minister and judges on what are the priority issues in 
Canada.  Allow me to elaborate.  He said “Kids are vulnerable to 
sexual predators, pornographers and the dangers of a life of 
crime”.  He went on to say that legislators and judges should 
get a reality check on life itself.  This man is the chief of 
police of the largest city in Canada and knows what he is doing. 
I will repeat that.  He said that the legislators and judges 
should get a reality check on life itself.  Is that not a message 
that everybody in the House should take seriously? We have to 
have reality checks and we are not getting them from the other 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He further indicated on the issue of child pornography and Robin 
Sharpe that Canada has been made the subject of international 
scorn and ridicule.  To quote the police chief, he said, “I can 
tell you with a whole lot of shame that even third world 
countries are more civilized and conscientious about our duty as 
adults to protect the most vulnerable components of society, our 
children”.  The chief of police said that third world countries 
are better than we are at protecting the vulnerabilities of our 
children.  As I said before, where are the minister's priorities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Fantino cites drugs, prisons and organized crime as 
requiring our attention. 
Chief Fantino says that Canada is known as a country where crime 
really does pay.  Canada, he says, has a reputation as a country 
that is soft on crime and that those who come here from elsewhere 
to pursue their criminal activities have little fear.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not scary?  Those who come here from other countries to 
commit crimes have little fear.  This is from the man who is 
leading the police force in the largest city in Canada.  I am 
sure the chiefs of police of Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, 
Regina, Saskatoon, Winnipeg and all across the country would 
agree with the chief of police of Toronto. He says that it is a 
scathing indictment on our criminal justice system.  This really 
should give the minister pause and impetus to get down to the 
real issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Fantino, south of the border Canada is seen as a 
sort of strainer leaking from a thousand holes.  He asks if it is 
any wonder that even deported criminals and undesirables keep on 
coming back.  And boy, with our immigration system we let them 
right back across the border as soon as they come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alas, instead of attacking real and substantive issues, the 
minister plays defence for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 is a convenient smokescreen to get the government off 
the hook.  Instead of supporting the call for more assistance to 
police to fight crime, the minister chooses to send the sex 
police into the bedrooms of the nation. As I said earlier, a 
former prime minister of this country said that the government 
has no place in the bedrooms of anyone in this nation.  Would he 
not be ashamed of this government bringing in legislation that 
gets involved in the bedrooms of the nation? I am sure he is 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bedroom bill, and it is a bedroom bill, will not deflect 
the attention away from the human resources debacle.  It is 
shameful that the government would be so manipulative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the minister said that if parliament does not 
settle the issue, the courts will. What kind of leadership is 
that in a country?  If parliament does not settle the issue, the 
courts will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other dependent relationships and the minister said we 
will have to look at those.  We will look at those and we will 
start to travel the country.  Why did we not do it before we 
brought this bill in?  Why try to be divisive in the country and 
leave other people outside the fence?  We should be united in the 
country.  As a parliament we should be working properly to do 
everything that is good for all Canadians, not just any special 
groups in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-23, an 
act to modernize the Statutes of Canada in relation to benefits 
and obligations, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  We will go to 
questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I listened to the hon. member.  I understand his position and his 
point of view and I respect his right to table it.  He did say a 
couple of things I would like to comment on. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT73"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT73"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1730

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he made some reference to the need for sex police.  With 
due respect, that is not a fair assessment.  In fact under the 
current income tax laws common law couples declare their 
relationships within the Income Tax Act.  We are on the honour 
system.  The representations of the taxpayers are accepted and 
there is no checking.  It is somewhat ludicrous to suggest that 
somehow there is going to be any checking of such an activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the member spent an awful lot of time talking about how 
the Supreme Court of Canada forced parliament to do this.  I 
would point out that this parliament, through Bill C-33, amended 
the human rights act to include sexual orientation as a 
prohibited grounds for discrimination.  The human rights 
commissioner of the day said that in implementing that change to 
the legislation there would be consequences, and these are the 
consequences that are appearing now.  Indeed, parliament is the 
reason we are here today dealing with Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member if he would not agree that anyone in 
Canada who makes a declaration and who has this dependency 
relationship is entitled.  It has nothing to do with sexuality; 
it has to do with dependency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Mississauga South for his comments.  I would suggest to him that 
this bill does not mean anybody living together.  This bill says 
conjugal sex.  It is involved with such.  That is what we are 
saying is wrong.  We are saying that this bill should include 
everybody who lives together and wants to declare that.  We 
should not be defining it on whether or not they have sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many people who are of a certain age are living together, 
are married, but are not having sex?  If they are going to define 
sex as the answer for paying this out, it is wrong.  We think it 
is wrong and most Canadians think it is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga South also said it was not a police 
issue.  I disagree with him.  Does he not have any constituents 
calling about these new guys that are running our tax system in 
Canada?  They are harassing people all the time.  If he thinks 
they are not going to start harassing people on this issue, he is 
wrong. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let us be very clear about what is going on here.  This 
has nothing to do with a concern of the Reform Party about 
dependency relationships.  Common law heterosexual relationships 
have been recognized in Canada since 1995 and not once has a 
Reform Party member stood in the House and said “My God, we are 
going to have to get the sex police out there because these 
common law couples will abuse the law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this is all about is not so thinly veiled homophobia.  The 
fact is that this party does not accept equality for gays and 
lesbians anyway.  The fact is that every single member of the 
Reform Party who was in the House when it came time to vote on 
the human rights act amendments for basic equality voted no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not believe in equality and it is a phony, dishonest 
argument to suggest that there are going to be sex police.  They 
do not care about equality.  All they care about is denying 
equality to gay and lesbian partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that question was phony 
and dishonest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This party believes in equality.  This party wants equality for 
everyone in the country.  The member speaks for one group, and I 
respect that fact.  I respect the fact that he speaks for one 
group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not like the fact that the member will stand to accuse us 
of being dishonest.  My speech was quite open.  We are saying 
that this bill should have been a full bill.  The member believes 
in human rights.  Why does he not believe that everybody should 
have the same rights?  That includes other people living in 
dependent relationships, other than just homosexuals and gays or 
married people.  It should be equal for everybody.  We should not 
be afraid to argue that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have made speeches about that for many a year, but you do not 
listen to speeches.  You only like to hear yourself talk.  You do 
not like to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I would ask members 
to address each other through the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with what the hon. 
member recently said.  I think the point is simple.  To date, 
there has been recognition of conjugal relationships. 
Those relationships have been marriage and common law 
relationships for heterosexual persons who have been living 
together for a year or more.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court has told us that we have discriminated against 
other conjugal relationships that are not heterosexual.  We are 
bringing this to a level playing field.  It is about fairness. 
It is about equality.  It is about human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the member bring up a red herring about dependent 
relationships when he knows full well that the minister has said 
that the issue of other dependent relationships will be brought 
up in the future, but that it entails federal and provincial 
jurisdictions and will need a great deal of work?  Was the member 
not listening to the minister when she spoke?  Can he answer me 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would love to answer 
that question.  The minister did say that this morning.  She did 
say that this bill is not complete and that we should be helping 
people with other dependencies.  Our answer from this side of the 
House is that it should have been done with this bill.  Why do we 
have to wait?  Because they have to talk to the provinces?  My 
God, they talk to each other every day at this level.  I have 
been in provincial government and we talked to the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Vancouver is the one using a red herring because 
her government has a bill which discriminates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked me if I listened to the minister.  It is this 
minister who will do nothing about pornography.  She has done 
nothing about drunk driving.  She talks and talks about the Young 
Offenders Act.  The government delays bills in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be happy to debate with those members the fact that this 
bill discriminates against people in Canada, and it is not fair 
to many thousands of Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with some interest to the member opposite.  I 
know he has had a long and I would like to say distinguished 
career because I understand he was first elected when he was in 
his twenties.  Through opportunities he has made some changes 
over the years, in terms of to which party he has belonged and 
such, but I would have thought that given that long career he 
would have known the kind of process that we in Canada deal with 
when it comes to governing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have thought, for example, he would know that parliament 
sets the rules and makes the laws.  I would have thought he would 
know that the role of the civil service is to carry out those 
laws.  I would have thought he would know that the role of the 
judiciary is to interpret those laws.  Yet, again we hear from 
him, as we often do from Reform members opposite, judiciary 
bashing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent 10 years on the Waterloo regional police force and as 
chairman I dealt not only with police, young offenders, 
pornography, drunk driving and all the things he was talking 
about, I also interacted with the judiciary.  I want to ask the 
member what purpose he and his party have in repeatedly bashing 
one of the finest judiciaries in the world?  People from around 
the world look to Canada for—

a question from somebody who really has the wrong premise.

government operates.  I have no trouble attacking the judiciary 
if they are not doing their job properly.  That is not shameful. 
I am doing my job as a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have more fun attacking the Liberals because they 
make the laws.  The member was in the House this morning, but he 
was obviously not listening when the minister admitted that we 
have to add these other people.  It is only fair that they should 
be in this bill.  Why are they not doing it now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has had lots of time to look at the bill.  It 
has had lots of time to defend these other people who have 
dependencies.  The Liberals can do all the talking and insulting 
they want, but the fact is that this is a poor bill because it 
does not represent all Canadians and it should represent all 
Canadians.  That is why we are here.

Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the eloquent member for 
Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I rose to make my maiden speech in the House in 1994, I 
pointed out that my riding contains the largest gay and lesbian 
population in Canada.  They bring a sense of diversity to our 
city and enrich many areas of our community, including the 
artistic and cultural life of our city.  These citizens, fellow 
citizens of ours, look to the government to fulfil long unkept 
promises of many previous governments to ensure that 
discrimination in their lives and in their employment will cease 
so that they may play their full role in society.  It is their 
right to live in a world with a level playing field and we owe 
that to them.  That is what I said in my maiden speech. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later that year, on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, I 
said that, “As Canadians, we can be proud of our contribution to 
the international community on the issue of human rights and on 
the development of international standards to which we adhere”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This said, we must also be ever vigilant that our human rights 
respect international standards and ensure the right of all 
Canadians to live free from discrimination in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent decision of the United Nations human rights committee 
ruled that sexual orientation is protected by the equality 
guarantees of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, a document which Canada helped prepare and which binds 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us, in remembering World Human Rights Day, recognize that it 
is our duty to ensure that our laws in this country are amended 
to eliminate all forms of discrimination, including any based on 
sexual orientation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the House has an opportunity to fulfil that duty and with 
it to achieve one of the most important tasks for which we are 
elected:  the implementation of laws which guarantee that all our 
citizens may live in equality and dignity.  In so doing we as 
Canadians know that all of society will benefit as we have so 
often found in this great country where our tradition of 
tolerance and acceptance of diversity has enabled us to create a 
nation which is the envy of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have news for the member from West Vancouver.  This is not a 
diversionary tactic for my constituents.  This is the process of 
fulfilling long overdue longstanding obligations of the most 
fundamental kind.  This is a priority for real people who are 
living with real problems.  They merit our attention and they do 
not deserve to be denigrated by the words such as were used by 
the member who last spoke in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The path to this moment has not been easy.  The need to take 
these steps was recognized by governments long before ours, but I 
am proud to say our government has had the political courage to 
deliver on something that many had recognized was the right thing 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was proud to be part of the government elected in 1993 which 
recognized the need for these measures and implemented them.  We 
started with Bill C-41, the sentencing act.  We then passed Bill 
C-33 to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act.  We then adopted 
Bill C-78 which extended pension benefits to same sex federal 
employees. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this legislation had the support of such associations as 
the National Association of Women and the Law, the Canadian Bar 
Association, the Canadian Jewish Congress, B'Nai Brith Canada, 
the Canadian Foundation of University Women, and the Canadian 
Association of Statutory Human Rights Agencies, for the very 
good reason that they represent basic Canadian values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a good number of these important institutions, these are 
important measures, contrary to what the Reform member who has 
just spoken said. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also had the support and encouragement of our courts which 
in a series of charter cases such as Egan, M. and H. and 
Rosenberg recognized that our charter of rights and freedoms 
required total equal treatment for gay and lesbian couples. There 
is no justification in a free and democratic society, to employ 
the language of the charter, to discriminate against them in the 
manner in which our laws recognize the rights of those who live 
in a conjugal relationship and contribute to society together.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today this measure completes and complements the reasoning of 
our courts.  It enables us as legislators to voice our views on 
this issue and to complete the work we started when we adopted 
the landmark changes to our human rights act, changes which 
foresaw and necessitated the measures being considered by the 
House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard what was said by our colleagues opposite about this 
measure.  They spoke about its irrelevancy, its lack of relevance 
and pertinence to the life that takes place in Canada today; but 
we already debated the appropriateness of the measures before the 
House when we debated the changes to the human rights act some 
years ago.  We decided then by a free vote in the House, 
supported by 75% of the members voting, that the basic values of 
our Canadian society require that we eliminate all forms of 
discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time we knew our view was shared by the vast majority of 
the Canadian population, that some 70% of our fellow citizens 
across the country were in favour of that measure.  That was then 
and the same 70% is in favour of these measures now for the same 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the legislation do?  Quite simply, where there is 
discrimination it eliminates it.  It guarantees that throughout 
our laws there will be equal treatment for all common law 
relationships in relation to benefits and obligations.  As 
pointed out by the member from Mississauga, this is not a matter 
that changes anything.  This is extending to common law 
relationships the same rules and regulations.  That is the 
essence of the discrimination that is being eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not go as far as some of my constituents would have 
liked.  For example, there are those who might have wanted to see 
crafted some form of matrimonial relationship for couples of the 
same sex; but those who would have preferred that solution know 
the complexity of this issue as was referred to by my colleague, 
the minister from Vancouver.  This issue requires political 
co-operation between the provinces as do all matters dealing with 
marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure they agree with me that what we needed to do today was 
to address the inequality of treatment in our statutes and to 
eliminate it wherever it is found.  The bill accomplishes that. 
In so doing we have dealt with such issues as those addressed in 
Rosenberg.  I am sorry my colleague who spoke about the courts 
and denigrated them earlier is not here to hear what the court in 
Rosenberg stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Differences in cohabitation and gender preferences are a reality 
to be equitably acknowledged, not an indulgence to be 
economically penalized.  There is less to fear from acknowledging 
conjugal diversity than from tolerating exclusionary prejudice. 
As L'Heureux-Dubé J. said in Canada (Attorney General) v 
Mossop...“Given the range of human preferences and 
possibilities, it is not unreasonable to conclude that families 
may take many forms. It is important to recognize that there are 
differences which separate as well as commonalities which bind. 
The differences should not be ignored, but neither should they be 
used to delegitimize those families that are thought to be 
different”— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the formulation of the court and I respect the 
formulation of the court.  I say to members of the House that 
when our courts speak this way they are speaking forcefully. They 
are speaking with the voice of the majority of the Canadian 
population which accepts that we live in a society of tolerance 
and respect for others, and not with the voice of those who say 
that we should sweep away the courts which speak for no one, 
sweep away the Constitution of Canada, get rid of the whole idea 
of the charter of rights and freedoms which is one of the 
fundamental notions of what this country is all about, sweep it 
all away and we will somehow live in a world where we can apply 
all our discriminatory views and all our worst views of one 
another and impose them on ourselves and on one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We chose to have a charter in this country.  We chose to give 
our courts authority to interpret our laws.  I respect the 
decisions of those courts because I think they have fundamentally 
followed their requirements under the constitution.  I am pleased 
to say that I think my constituents support the decisions of the 
courts too.  They support this statute because it is important to 
gay and lesbian communities that discrimination be eliminated so 
they can contribute fully to society.  It is important to send a 
signal to everyone that discrimination is not a part of our 
social fabric.  It is also important for society in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have pointed out on numerous occasions, many institutions 
in Canada like universities and important companies wish to hire 
the best people possible.  They want the Income Tax Act changed 
so that they are not discriminated against when they enable their 
finest employees to work for them in a non-discriminatory manner. 
This is why these measures have been adopted by many other 
jurisdictions, provinces and countries.

the House and whose indefatigable work in favour of justice and 
equity brought us to this historic moment in our life as a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member opposite gave an impassioned speech, particularly near 
the end.  I would like to get some clarity from him because I 
think Bill C-23 lacks much clarity and that is what is causing 
some of the confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we read the bill the sole criterion for extending to same 
sex couples access to every benefit that we have previously given 
to married couples and families is a term referred to as 
conjugality.  There needs to be a requirement of a conjugal 
relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard some pros and cons.  The member is on the 
government side.  Would he say if there were no sexual relations 
between two people that they would still qualify for the full 
suite of benefits offered under Bill C-23?  Some are arguing that 
they would or would not.  I would suggest that if they would not 
qualify then the very thing he is concerned about, 
discrimination, is a key factor in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate the 
member has insisted on the term clarity in the House at this 
time.  It perhaps might evoke reaction from other parties of the 
House that have trouble with that concept, but I will leave that 
aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is obscuring something here.  This is not that 
complicated.  The member knows, as does everyone who knows 
anything about the way in which society has evolved recently, 
that at one time the only way in which one got benefits under 
pensions or many other statutes was if one were married.  We 
moved away from that concept to one where we recognized common 
law relationships.  This was in the law of the provinces.  It was 
recognized that men and women could live together in a 
relationship that was not blessed by holy matrimony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the bill does is assimilate relationships between people who 
are living together in similar circumstances to that of a 
heterosexual common law relationship and same sex couples who are 
living in the same relationship.  That is all it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole business of sex police and everything is some sort of 
myth.  Are there sex police going around now knocking on the 
doors of heterosexual couples and asking “Are you really 
sleeping together?  You made a declaration that you are common 
law”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what the hon. member opposite just said prompts me to 
ask a question which has bothered me as I listened to everyone 
talk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a married man.  Therefore my marriage is registered.  I 
wonder if with CPP, Revenue Canada, life insurance, accident 
insurance and spousal benefits it is not absolutely imperative 
that these these relationships will have to be registered 
relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is inconceivable to me that one could change partners without 
deregulating it somehow in the same way as if I divorced my wife. 
None of that is in the act.  If we do not have this term in the 
act, who will register these people?  Will it be the provinces? 
Who will do it?  It is not in the act.  Unless we have some kind 
of registry this whole thing will be awry all over the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Has the member ever heard of a 
common law relationship? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham:</B>  Mr. Speaker, somehow we are getting the 
debate going over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Let us give the member 
for Toronto 
Centre—Rosedale a chance to answer the question, shall the 
member for we? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham:</B>  Mr. Speaker, they can duke it out over 
there if they want to.  It is kind of fun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Burnaby put his finger on it.  The problem 
existed in the country that there were many heterosexual people 
who were living in relationships that were not protected by the 
law.  They were not married and the courts and we as legislators 
both in the provinces and the federal government said this was 
not fair.  Women were being discriminated against. 
We assimilated a common law relationship to that of a matrimonial 
relationship.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a married person in the province of Ontario.  The whole of 
the Family Law Reform Act was introduced after my wife and I had 
been married for 20 years.  It completely changed the nature of 
family law as it applied to us as couples, our children and 
everything else.  That is what we did in our society.  All this 
is doing is moving couples of the same sex into the exact same 
category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they want to do is turn back the clock.  They want to say 
that we cannot have any common law relationship because they are 
not registered.  They have the same problem that the member 
raises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is not a problem for common law relations, it cannot be a 
problem for the bill.  If it is a problem for the bill then it is 
a problem for common law relationships.  I suggest that the 
member and his party go to the Canadian public and say that they 
intend to turn back the clock 25 years and get rid of all forms 
of common law relationships.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I understand that some hon. members have been doing some homework 
and research.  I admit this issue has followed me around somewhat 
in my political career.  I never saw more acrimony and concern 
than when I sat in opposition in the province of Ontario when Bob 
Rae and the New Democrats brought in a bill.  It was almost 
violent.   The legislature was taken over by a mob.  It could be 
described as nothing else.  The majority of members of the 
provincial Liberal Party voted against the NDP legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain that I too voted against it at that time because 
nobody should either receive rights or lose rights based on their 
sexual preference.  It is very important that we quote both.  I 
could not accept the changing of the definition of marriage, 
which is what Bob Rae and his government put forward.  The bill 
does not do that.  That is the fundamental difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to come out of the closet and tell you, Mr. Speaker, 
that I am hopelessly heterosexual.  My wife would tell you that 
the operative word is hopelessly, but I do not think that has a 
darn thing to do with any of this.  It should not matter or enter 
into the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view what we are seeing is hopeless homophobia on the part 
of certain members who are colouring their positions or changing 
them.  They are totally off base and off issue.  They do not want 
to come right out and say that they are against the bill because 
they are against homosexuality and gays and lesbians.  In my view 
that is position of many of the speakers, not all to be fair, who 
put forward arguments on behalf of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard comments about the Toronto police chief making 
speeches to the Conservative caucus that met in Niagara Falls. 
Interestingly enough it was the same Conservative caucus and 
Conservative government in the province of Ontario that are held 
up as the great example of how to run a government.  This is the 
same government, Mike Harris and his people, that passed an 
ominbus bill which does exactly what this bill would do.  It 
passed it in 24 hours with no debate.  It brought in what these 
people always cry about, closure.  It brought down the hammer and 
adopted legislation to ensure that amendments take place that 
will bring justice and fairness to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we ever satisfy those who are homophobic?  Can we ever 
satisfy those who call us?  I had a call the other day from 
someone who introduced himself to me as a reverend.  I will not 
mention his name. 
He was a part time evangelical minister and I wish him well in 
his endeavours.  He has made up his mind.  He believes that only 
God can make this decision.  He uses words like sodomy and says 
that the whole act of homosexuality is unnatural.  He goes on and 
on.  There is no possible way that I could ever explain any of 
the details in the bill to that individual.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just about every day we see someone outside this building who 
has that same attitude.  Is there any point trying to put across 
the fact that there is a certain group of Canadians who are 
clearly being discriminated against for a reason that is 
irrelevant to the issues of benefits and obligations:  their 
sexual preference.  I do not care what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that we do not need to be in the bedrooms of the nation. 
This idea of a sex police is just laughable.  Earlier today I 
heard one speaker in this place say that people would take 
advantage, that people would claim they were living in a conjugal 
relationship so that they could access some form of benefit. When 
I thought about that I said that it was preposterous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anyone here know any heterosexual male who would stand up 
in public or in front of his family and claim to be gay so that 
he could access a dental plan?  Are we serious about this? Would 
he then go on to explain to his buddies in the hockey dressing 
room and to his mom and dad that he really is not gay, he just 
had a cavity?  I use the example perhaps in the extreme, but it 
is such utter nonsense to think that someone would claim to be 
gay just to access some form of benefits.  If a person is 
heterosexual, the last thing in the world he wants is to be 
accused of is being gay for any reason.  It is just not reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the bill do?  The members opposite talk about what the 
judiciary is doing in terms of making laws.  That is absolute 
nonsense.  I heard the member for Vancouver West stand in his 
place and say that parliament makes the laws, the government 
enforces the laws and the courts interpret the laws.  That is 
exactly right.  Would we want it any other way?  Would we want 
the courts not to have the ability to interpret the laws? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What saves this vote for me and what makes it so fundamentally 
different from the one in the province of Ontario that took place 
under the leadership of Premier Bob Ray is the fact that the 
definition of marriage has not been touched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague for Scarborough East, for whom I have a lot of 
respect, said that it should be put in a statute. Why?  Why 
should it not remain where it has always been?  It is in common 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share something that reinforces this fact.  In one of 
her speeches, I believe on June 8, the minister said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario court, general division recently upheld in Layland 
and Beaulne the definition of marriage.  In that decision a 
majority of the court stated the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—unions of persons of the same sex are not “marriages”, 
because of the definition of marriage.  The applicants are, in 
effect, seeking to use s.15 of the Charter to bring about a 
change in the definition of marriage.  I do not think the Charter 
has that effect. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court said that this was fundamentally important for all 
Canadians who are concerned about the deprivation of the 
institution of marriage or concerned that somehow the hordes of 
homosexuals, as a result of getting access to justice and to 
benefits, were going to somehow infiltrate all of our 
institutions and our schools and poison our minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We liked that decision by the court.  Maybe there are some other 
interpretations or decisions that we do not particularly like, 
but the courts are not there to please us.  The courts are there 
to interpret the laws that are put forward by the duly elected 
parliamentarians.  They have a responsibility that is different 
from ours. 
Because we like the one that says that this is the definition and 
therefore the sanctity of marriage, but we do not like another 
one, we get in a dither and say “We should invoke the 
notwithstanding clause”.  The reality is that we do have a 
judicial system that has its warts, but it is a system that is 
free and independent.  We do not elect judges like the Reform 
Party would likely do if it was given the opportunity, or as they 
do in the United States where Boss Hog rules the day.  We do not 
subject the public to making decisions like that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to ask the member a very different question from what his 
speech was all about, which was just a bunch of rhetoric about 
homophobia. I am tired of hearing about that.  My question deals 
with the justice department, which has brought forward this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the polls announced what issues concerned Canadians across 
the country, more than anything else, the issue contained in this 
particular bill appeared in the 1% to 2% range, while other major 
issues, such as high taxes and justice in general, were quite 
high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member explain why we waited six years to deal with 
the young offenders legislation, which has not done a thing?  Why 
are we allowing 11, 12 and 13 year old children to be exploited 
by pimps on the streets of our cities and we are not doing 
anything about it?  Why have we not brought in legislation to 
deal with gangs that are exploiting our youth all across the 
country and violence is getting out of hand?. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why in the world do we deal so vehemently with legislation that 
apparently the public is not really interested in when they are 
really concerned about these— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, some of the issues the 
Reform Party raises are legitimate issues and some, frankly, are 
fearmongering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I heard the Toronto chief of police stand up at that 
convention and say what he said, I wondered if there was any 
chance that he was lobbying for an increase in the upcoming 
budget that he might have to fight for from the Toronto city 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people say we are a haven, I do not think most Canadians 
believe that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are that there are some problems with youth justice in 
this country.  The member knows full well that we have made 
changes.  We have lowered the age.  We have allowed for youth who 
are accused of violent crimes to be tried in adult court.  We are 
allowing for their names to be— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Okay, we are going

<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question will be very brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the support of the hon. member for this 
legislation, but I did want to give him the opportunity to set 
the record straight with respect to one comment that he made. 
That is with respect to the issue of Bill 167 in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a copy of that bill.  Surely the member will recognize 
that nowhere in that bill, nowhere, was there any reference to 
the definition of marriage whatsoever.  I have the bill here. The 
Liberal Party in Ontario did oppose that legislation.  It later 
flip-flopped.  It has been back and forth but I think it supports 
it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the hon. member.  Does he not acknowledge that 
nowhere in that bill, not one line, was there any reference 
whatsoever to marriage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Very quickly, we are 
going to be relevant.  We are on Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker, we should stick to 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just say to the member that he did not see the 
regulations that we saw which would have made the changes.  That 
member knows with his experience that not all the changes have to 
appear in that regard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am rather surprised that nobody on the other side has 
been willing to admit or has even drawn the House's attention to 
the fact that this rather incomplete bill has been brought 
forward primarily in a pathetic attempt to draw the attention of 
opposition members and the press away from the scandal in the 
Department of Human Resources Development.  It is pretty easy to 
see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also a little surprised in that I noticed the member seems 
to agree with Pierre Elliott Trudeau that the state has no 
business in the bedrooms of the nation, but most of the people 
who have spoken over there most emphatically seem to believe that 
the state should be in the bedrooms of the nation. I would rather 
subscribe to the notions of Mrs. Patrick Campbell when she said, 
“I do not really care what people do as long as they do not do 
it in the street and frighten the horses”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Well, thank the Lord that in 
Mississauga the horses are not in the street, at least not at the 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you might be interested to know that the city of 
Mississauga has made changes to all of their laws to allow for 
same sex benefits for same sex couples, as has Victoria, Burnaby, 
Edmonton, Regina, Winnipeg, Barrie, Kanata, Montreal, Ottawa, 
Kingston, Toronto and Halifax.  The provinces of Quebec, B.C. and 
Ontario have done so, as have the companies of Canada Post, Bell, 
IBM, Canadian Airlines, Air Canada, Bank of Montreal, TD Bank, 
General Motors, General Electric, and the list goes on. They are 
ahead of the government on this.  It is time we brought all of 
our laws into line with what most Canadians believe is fair.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
today to speak to Bill C-23, an act to modernize the Statutes of 
Canada in relation to benefits and obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve participated 
very intensively in the debate, giving it more than his all.  We 
know how involved our colleague is with respect to the 
recognition of same sex spouses, and I believe that the member 
for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve has succeeded not only in stating the 
Bloc Quebecois position on this issue, but also very certainly 
in influencing the positions of certain other parties in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This 166 page document, which I recently examined, is an 
important bill, as all omnibus bills are, let there be no 
mistake. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT82"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT82"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1815

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bill that has a major impact, because it amends 68 
federal statutes to include same sex spouse in the definition of 
common law partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of this bill becomes evident when we look at the 
number of ministers sponsoring it.  I looked into this and 
identified five such ministers, from the Department of Human 
Resources Development, to the Department of Finance, Treasury 
Board's human resources directorate, the Department of Justice 
and the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are major changes involving over 20 departments and 
agencies. 
Basically, this bill has one purpose: to restore equity.  This 
equity will make it possible to modernize certain regimes by 
introducing equality in the law for common law couples but also 
for same sex or opposite sex couples, in accordance with a May 
1999 supreme court decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a few moments to review this important decision 
pronounced on May 22, 1999.  This lengthy decision boils down to 
this: A couple is a couple, regardless of sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it strikes down a section of the Ontario Family Law 
Act which makes a distinction between heterosexual couples and 
homosexual couples with respect to the entitlement to 
maintenance upon the break-up of a union, whether it be a 
marriage or a common law relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The immediate consequence of this judgment was that it rendered 
that section of the act inoperative in Ontario.  In fact, this 
supreme court decision marked the end of the legal 
debate.  From that moment on a new debate ensued, one which 
became political, parliamentary, and inevitably involved the day 
to day administration of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government therefore had no choice but to come up with 
Bill C-23 in order to comply with the May 22, 1999 decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a chronology of the events of the various changes 
that have occurred, as well as of the facts. It is 
important to point out that, as far back as 1977, the Government 
of Quebec was the first to ban discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far back as 1979, the Canadian Human Rights Commission 
recommended that the Canadian Human Rights Act be amended to 
include sexual orientation.  This recommendation is contained in 
each of the commission's annual reports, up to and including 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another date that must be recalled is 1982, when the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms was incorporated into the 
Canadian constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985, section 15 of the charter came into effect, the section 
on the right to equality.  The report by the parliamentary 
Sub-committee on Equality Rights, “Equality for All”, called for 
the banning of all discrimination based on sexual orientation by 
the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, the Ontario appeal court found that the Canadian Human 
Rights Act needed to be interpreted as forbidding discrimination 
on the basis of sexual orientation. 
As well, during the same year the Canadian Forces 
announced that they were terminating the restrictions on 
enlistment and promotion on grounds of sexual orientation.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bills S-15 and C-108, whose aim was to add sexual orientation to 
the Canadian Human Rights Act, were introduced in the Senate 
and the House of Commons respectively.  They both died on the 
order paper in September 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected the allegation 
that “family situation” included same sex couples.  In 1994, the 
Government of Ontario introduced Bill 167, which was intended to expand the 
definition of conjugal relations in Ontario legislation to 
include homosexual couples.  It was rejected at second reading 
by a vote of 68 to 59. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the Supreme Court of Canada gave its first decision 
under the terms of section 15 of the charter on sexual 
orientation and the awarding of benefits to same sex spouses. 
The nine members of the court decided that sexual orientation is 
an analogous ground for the purposes of section 15, and a majority 
of the justices decided that the definition of spouse in the Old 
Age Security Act as a person of the opposite sex contravened 
section 15.  However, a majority felt that the contravention was 
justified under section 1 of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also point out, as I mentioned in the 
first part of my remarks, that on May 20, 1999, in an eight to one 
decision, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that the definition 
of spouse as in part III of the Ontario Family Law Act, which 
prevented same sex partners from seeking support at the breakup 
of a relationship, contravened section 15 of the charter and was 
unjustified under section 1.  The court ordered this provision 
repealed, but suspended reparations for six months to enable the 
legislators in Ontario to correct the contravention of the 
charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. member for Rosemont.  I would like to know whether the 
member intends to share the time allotted him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> No, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> You therefore have 11 
minutes left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, I had not indicated when I 
began that I would be sharing my time, because I intended to use 
my full allotted time, that is, 20 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 25, the House of Commons passed Bill C-78.  This important 
pension reform bill included amendments to replace the 
provisions authorizing the payment of survivor benefits to 
unmarried opposite sex spouses with provisions authorizing the 
payment of benefits to spouses without distinction as to sex. 
Bill C-78 is the first federal statute to explicitly provide for 
benefits to same sex spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 10, Quebec's national assembly unanimously passed a bill 
to amend various legislative provisions concerning common law 
couples. 
This omnibus bill amended the definition of common law spouse 
in 28 statutes and 11 regulations so as to include homosexual 
couples, giving them the same status, rights and obligations as 
unmarried heterosexual couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amended legislation has to do primarily with compensation 
for accidents in the workplace, health and security in the 
workplace, labour standards, pension benefits, public sector 
pension plans and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October, Ontario passed an omnibus bill amending 67 statutes 
to bring them into line with the decision of the 
Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the government had to follow suit. 
Unfortunately, the government has once again waited for certain 
decisions of the courts, including, of course, the supreme 
court, before introducing this omnibus bill, which will amend a 
certain number of statutes.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to point out that the proposed amendments 
do not all go one way.  In effect, they offer new benefits to 
same sex couples, but they also impose new obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislative amendments will preserve the 
fundamental importance of marriage in our society, in that the 
definition of marriage will remain unchanged. I mention this to 
reassure those Liberal members or members of the opposition who 
are rather conservative, and we know a number of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that members of homosexual couples have been denied 
spousal allowances has generated criticism, as we are well 
aware, but this criticism was often basically a matter of 
principle. Gay rights advocates argue that homosexual couples 
who pay taxes are unfairly denied social benefits and do not 
receive anything in return for their direct contribution to 
certain plans, and that they in fact fund the plans of 
heterosexual couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others contend that the state should continue to not recognize 
homosexual couples, because granting rights to these couples 
threatens family values. Also, some gay and lesbian couples 
refuse to accept the legal obligations and benefits that result 
from this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public also expressed its opinion on the issue on a number 
of occasions. Several public opinion polls were conducted and 
the results were released. I should point out that the Angus 
Reid poll conducted for the Department of Justice in the fall of 
1998 clearly shows that this bill reflects the will of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, according to that poll, 74% of the respondents agreed 
with granting federal benefits to gay couples, while 67% felt 
that same sex couples should get the same benefits and face the 
same obligations as common law couples. Moreover, 84% of the 
respondents felt that gays and lesbians should be protected from 
discrimination. Finally, 59% were of the opinion that homosexual 
couples should be included in the definition of spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, we have a number of elements, but several 
arguments show that Canada is lagging behind on this issue. If we 
consider, among other things, the omnibus bill introduced by the 
Quebec government, the ruling issued by the supreme court on May 
22, and the action taken by the Ontario government on this issue, 
it is clear that the changes proposed in Bill C-23, which, as I 
said before, will impact on 68 federal acts, are necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be very pleased to support this bill.

<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to talk about the World Trade 
Organization, agriculture and the plight of our farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The World Trade Organization talks broke down in Seattle last 
year and it is a good thing they did.  This hiatus gives us some 
time to reflect upon the Liberal government's blind pursuit of a 
trade agenda that has been destructive to our farmers.  They are 
hostages of the government's cult-like adherence to the ideology 
of free trade at any cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true the government's friends at the Business Council on 
National Issues repeat the mantra with zeal “free trade, free 
trade, free trade” and our so-called national newspapers sing 
the same hymn “globalize, globalize, globalize”.  Our trade 
minister, our agriculture minister, our Prime Minister are all 
choirboys in the same chorus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in my part of the country are asking interesting 
questions.  They are saying that if this free trade is such a 
wonderful thing, then why are we, the grain farmers, in such dire 
straits today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture exports have increased by 65% over the past five 
years and farm receipts have increased by more than 43% over the 
last 10 years.  Why is it in these circumstances that farmers' 
net income has actually dropped by 11%?  Why are the very people 
whose hard work provides the statistics the government uses to 
promote its trade agenda losing their farms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the Christmas break I visited some of the farm 
communities in my riding.  I was told that one small community 
had lost four families since last fall and the prediction was 
that it would lose at least that many again before spring 
seeding.  I have spoken with farmers, with their family members, 
with regional municipality councillors and reeves.  Believe me, 
there is a very crucial need for some support and reinvestment in 
rural Canada, especially in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the government to come out of its trance and to 
realize that farmers in western Canada are paying the price for a 
warped trade agenda.  They are paying with their farms, with the 
break-up of their families and some tragically with their lives 
as they are unable to bear the stress any longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers, in particular those who grow grains, are 
facing the worst situation since the Great Depression.  The 
government's own income statistics and forecasts tell us that the 
next five years will not be any easier for the thousands of 
families that put bread on our tables.  For farmers in my 
province of Saskatchewan the news is grim.  Incomes for 2001, 
2002 and 2003 will be below zero in the negative range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Seattle talks had gone as the faceless WTO bureaucrats 
had wanted, our farmers would have been even more vulnerable to 
the cold winds of international trade. Since 1993 our federal 
government has cut its support for grain farmers by 60% all in 
the name of liberalized trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the New Democratic Party and I have been 
calling for the government to set aside $1 billion from the $100 
billion forecast surplus for the next five years, a mere 1% of 
that, to pay for some support to farm families who need it 
terribly badly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers represent a mere 3% of our population.  Through 
their hard work they support about 14% of our jobs and 
one-quarter of our trade surplus, but they are asking why they do 
not benefit from it.  We are saying that it is the government's 
responsibility to see that they do benefit from it rather than 
being left to twist in the wind. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

to the House.  We congratulate him on his byelection win in 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with the points he has raised and the general and 
severe challenges being faced by the farm sector.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the 
government clearly recognize the very serious nature of the 
financial situation many Canadian farmers are currently facing. 
Our government is taking the broadest possible approach to this 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The WTO agriculture negotiations are an important opportunity to 
seek greater disciplines in the use of production and trade 
distorting subsidies.  Canada's initial position in these trade 
negotiations, which was developed through two years of extensive 
consultations with Canadians, makes it clear that we will seek 
the complete elimination of agricultural export subsidies and 
maximum reductions in production and trade distorting domestic 
support programs, including an overall limit of all sorts and all 
types of domestic support programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The close co-operation between the government and the Canadian 
agriculture and agri-food industry that characterizes the 
development of Canada's initial agriculture negotiating position 
was also fully present at the Seattle WTO ministerial conference 
held at the beginning of December 1999.  The continuation of this 
team Canada approach as the negotiations progress will ensure 
that Canada will achieve the very best results possible for 
farmers right across Canada. While I recognize that the 
negotiations will take time and they likely cannot make the 
situation better in the next year or two, they are the only way 
to solve the problem of subsidies distorting agricultural markets 
once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to an industry request on January 13 of this year, 
the Government of Canada made a new commitment of up to $1 
billion for the next two years to design a new disaster program 
to assist those producers most in need.  Also a new spring 
advance payment program will provide assistance quickly before 
spring crops are planted. Individual farmers will be able to 
access up to $20,000 in interest free loans to help get their 
crops in the ground.  Applications should be available in the 
coming weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly 
this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to
