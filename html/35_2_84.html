	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the late Fritz Ziegler of Vancouver, who died while in his early 
nineties, was one of the last of the west coast romantics who helped 
lay the foundations for B.C.'s current economic prosperity. He was 
also tireless in promoting co-operation between the province's 
many different ethnic communities and in heading fundraising 
drives for community health and charitable organizations.
<P>
	Honorary Consul for Monaco and Grand Prior for the Americas 
of the Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem, his imaginative 
and his practical construction skills are symbolically combined in 
the Gothic castle, King Ludwig of Bavaria style, that he built in the 
forests above Langley, B.C., and that one understands will 
eventually be devoted to public educational purposes.

	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Lower Laurentians region is facing a dramatic 
situation after being hit by three major economic setbacks in the 
past few months.
<P>
	First, Kenworth went out of business. Quebec is trying to save 
this company but needs the co-operation of the federal government 
to do so. Second, all international flights were transferred from 
Mirabel to Dorval following an ADM decision. Despite being 
asked to do so by the official opposition, the federal government 
has not seen fit so far to demand public hearings so people could be 
heard. Third, a strike recently broke out at GM.
<P>
	I wish to express my solidarity with the people in my riding who 
are affected by this triple tragedy. I call on all those concerned at 
Kenworth, GM and ADM to adopt a conciliatory attitude and show 
they care about the public interest, as this is the only way to meet 
this triple challenge and save our region from the threat of 
economic stagnation.

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, research tells us 
that tobacco product advertising tends to associate smoking with a 
wide range of desirable traits: beauty, popularity and even health. 
Research also shows that young people are twice as likely to be 
influenced by cigarette advertising as they are by peer pressure.
<P>
	In recognition of the impact of tobacco advertising on youth, the 
U.S. FDA is banning all tobacco company sponsorships.
<P>
	To date the government has done nothing. Why? Is it because the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has a big Imperial 
Tobacco plant in her riding? Is it because the Minister of Finance 
was a member of the board of Imasco and expressed concern over 
the health of the tobacco industry at the time that tobacco taxes 
were being debated in 1994? Is it because the Liberal senator from 
South Shore, Nova Scotia, is on the board-

Canada Post mandate review. The report made a number of 
recommendations, including privatizing some of Canada Post's 
commercial activities, which the minister says she will study. She 
also hinted that the government might consider privatizing Canada 
Post if it ceases to fulfil a public policy role.
<P>
	The Liberals seem to be moving in the direction of withdrawing 
government from providing a public service, with decent jobs and 
decent wages, toward a low wage environment that would only 
benefit the large corporations and would not guarantee adequate 
service.
<P>
	We have seen this movie before. With cuts to the CBC and the 
privatization of CN, Air Canada and Petro-Canada, this 
Liberal-Tory government's ideology is to destroy everything of

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the crisis affecting the Armed Forces is slowly subsiding, 
with the departure of the former minister of defence, and of the 
former chief of defence staff who, in my opinion, took the only 
action possible under the circumstances. There is, however, another 
problem: the Prime Minister's inability to admit to the facts, 
because he wants to protect the integrity of his government.
<P>
	Questioned in the House yesterday, the Prime Minister stated 
that he had been informed on the morning of  October 2 that his 
Minister of Defence had seriously breached the Cabinet code of 
ethics. That same Wednesday, in the afternoon, the Prime Minister 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5287"> 5287 </A></B>
<P>
stated, and I quote: ``I have a lot of confidence in the Minister of 
National Defence'', adding that he would keep him in that job.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister, after learning that very morning 
that his defence minister had gone against the code of ethics, repeat 
in this House, barely hours later, within mere hours, that he had 
confidence in his former minister and even tell us that he would be 
there for a long time? How can he explain this?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> As I stated 
in the House, I was informed in the morning that there was a 
problem, not one connected in any way to the duties of the Minister 
of Defence, but perhaps one connected to the performance of his 
duties as a member of Parliament serving one of his constituents.
<P>
	I therefore referred the problem to Mr. Wilson, the ethics 
counsellor. I did not know what his conclusions were going to be, 
but I had confidence in the Minister of Defence, as always. I repeat 
that he did an excellent job in his three years as Minister of 
Defence, both for the Department of National Defence and for 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is all very well for the Prime Minister to say that he did 
not really know whether what the Minister of Defence had done 
was a problem, when the underlying principle of his code of ethics 
is that ministers shall neither interfere, nor appear to interfere. The 
former Minister of Defence had written a letter. The Prime 
Minister cannot expect us to believe today that he was not really 
sure whether or not he had contravened the code of ethics. That is 
just too facile.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, in response to General Boyle's letter of 
resignation, the Prime Minister wrote that he had served with 
courage, dignity and integrity.
<P>
	How, knowing that the accusations made under oath by Mr. 
Gonzales were weighing heavily against General Boyle, could the 
Prime Minister be so sure and praise the integrity of the chief of 
defence staff without even knowing the outcome of the ongoing 
inquiry with respect to him?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, General Boyle had testified, and had himself said that he 
was not aware of certain facts which the commission was 
investigating in this connection.
<P>
	In the performance of his duties as chief of defence staff, he has 
done a good job. He had a very difficult task, arriving as the new 
head of the Armed Forces just as the commission was starting up. 
That was hard. This was the first time in history that there had been 
an inquiry of this nature. I believe that General Boyle did his best, 
and  acquitted himself honourably. At the end, he realized that he 
was the subject of controversy and he submitted his resignation in a 
most honourable manner, and I accepted it.
<P>
	As for myself, should the commission comment on this at some 
point, I shall have something to say, but it is the custom in 
Canada-and a very good one-that no one is declared guilty until 
there is a verdict.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister ought to take care to add to that 
statement: ``And, if there are accusations hanging over someone's 
head, the Prime Minister ought perhaps to hold back on his 
congratulations until there is a verdict''.
<P>
	The House is faced with a problem at the present time, and this is 
it: the Prime Minister, who was aware that his minister had 
intervened and broken the code of ethics, admitted it only after it 
became impossible for him to avoid doing so, when he was forced 
to do so. In his letter to General Boyle, the Prime Minister was still 
praising the General's integrity and good service, while fully aware 
that there is an ongoing inquiry, which may lead to some 
conclusions. At any rate, there is at least some reasonable doubt.
<P>
	What are we to think of such an attitude on the part of the Prime 
Minister? Are we to understand that, for him, the integrity of his 
government is intact, just as long as no one is actually caught 
red-handed.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this entire incident of last week was made public, and the 
decisions were made before the press was informed. I was 
informed on the Wednesday morning. I was informed, and the 
Minister of Defence received Mr. Wilson's opinion on the 
Thursday. He came to see me at 6 p.m. and I accepted his 
resignation the following morning. I think that this is totally 
reasonable.
<P>
	It amuses me a great deal that the opposition has nothing much 
to say against the government and has to resort to rehashing the 
past. I must therefore congratulate my entire cabinet for doing a 
good job with the rest of government, since the opposition has 
nothing to say these days.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. By the way, we noticed that he 
said ``the rest'' of affairs were being managed well, so we 
understand that that particular one was not.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that the decision of his former defence 
minister was in no way linked to the Somalia affair, but rather to 
the code of ethics issue.
<P>
	But yesterday, the new defence minister very clearly linked the 
departure of the former minister and that of General Boyle to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5288"> 5288 </A></B>
<P>
Somalia affair, stating, and I quote: ``In recent days, two people 
have taken some very difficult steps. First my colleague, theformer 
Minister of National Defence, resigned, and now today, General 
Boyle has done so as well''.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister aware that in his desperation to save the 
face of his government, he is going so far that his new defence 
minister no longer dares to follow him?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, what is very 
interesting in the line of questions we are hearing this afternoon is 
that we know that it is thanks to the actions of this government in 
calling for an inquiry into what went on in Somalia. That is why we 
have some facts and expect many more to come out.
<P>
	And as for the issue of my predecessor's resignation as Minister 
of National Defence, there again we have an action that was 
undoubtedly very difficult for the former Minister of National 
Defence. Why did he decide to hand in his resignation? Because of 
the guidelines established by the Prime Minister of Canada and his 
government to ensure that the government runs well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> my supplementary is 
for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell us whether the fact that his new 
Minister of National Defence keeps coming back to the need to get 
to the bottom only of the events that took place in Somalia is a way 
for his government to divert attention and to bury once and for all 
the document altering and cover-up operation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Not at all, Mr. Speaker. First 
of all, it was the hon. member and other members in this House 
who asked for a preliminary report from the investigators on the 
questions having to do with the whole situation concerning General 
Boyle. All I said was that, with General Boyle's resignation 
yesterday, this topic has obviously been dealt with to a certain 
extent.
<P>
	I will accept the proposal of the hon. member and other members 
in this House and assure them that not only will we get to the 
bottom of what interests you today, but that we will get to the 
bottom of what interests Canadians: what went on in Somalia. It is 
for that reason that I am in agreement with those who want the 
Commission of Inquiry to deliver a report at the end of March, as 
scheduled, precisely so that when we go into an election there is no 
cover-up.

Speaker, the government now has some very serious blots on its
<P>
performance record, its broken GST promise and the fiasco at 
national defence to mention two.
<P>
	However, the biggest blot of all is still the government's failure 
to deliver on its election promise of jobs, jobs, jobs. There are 1.4 
million unemployed, 2 million to 3 million underemployed and 4 
million workers worried about losing their jobs; almost one-half of 
the entire Canadian labour force.
<P>
	Where is the government's plan to create the millions, not the 
hundreds of thousands, of new and better jobs required to fulfil its 
election promise?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have a very definite plan concerning that. We have 
managed to create 665,000 new jobs in the Canadian economy over 
three years. We have also managed to run the economy with 1.5 per

<P>

government's deficit, has always managed to do better than the 
plan he had put forward. That is the way we do things. In two years 
time there will be no need for the government to borrow money, 
something that has not been done in the last 25 years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is one glaring weakness in the Prime Minister's 
answer. The only way to have job creation in the numbers required 
to satisfy Canadians is through lower taxes and through leaving 
more dollars in the pockets of consumers and private sector job 
creators. However, this government cannot deliver lower taxes. In 
fact, it is doing the opposite. It is taking $25 billion more out of the 
pockets of taxpayers than it did in the year it was elected.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	When is the government going to make major tax cuts to 
generate the millions of new and better jobs required by 
Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I remember campaigning, and the only problem the 
country faced at that time was the reduction of the deficit. That was 
the only speech the leader of the third party had. It is amazing that 
he has not found a new one.
<P>
	Jobs have been created in Canada; more than in Italy, more than 
in Germany, more than in France and more than in Great Britain all 
together.
<P>
	It is not a priority of this government to give a 10 per cent tax cut 
to those with a million dollar per year income. When we have room 
our priority will be to make sure that some of the benefits will go 
first to those in  society who need them most. That is certainly not 
the preoccupation of the member from the third party.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the real reason the Prime Minister cannot talk about tax 
cuts is that his government has been one of the slowest in the 
country at deficit reduction.
<P>
	He points to European countries and yet his government is 
behind Alberta on deficit reduction. He is behind Ontario on deficit 
reduction. He is behind Nova Scotia on deficit reduction. He is 
behind Newfoundland on deficit reduction.
<P>
	Around the kitchen table, as distinct from the cabinet table, 
Canadians are worried about a drop in their disposable income. The 
after tax income of the average Canadian family has dropped 
$3,000 since the Liberals came to power.
<P>
	What is the Prime Minister going to do to address the $3,000 pay 
cut which his government has delivered to Canadian families?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to give one example, because of the good management of 
this government the interest rate went down by 3 per cent or 4 per 
cent in the last year and a few months.
<P>
	Somebody with a mortgage of $50,000 will pay $1,500 less after 
tax. Somebody with a $100,000 mortgage will pay $3,000 less after 
tax. Somebody who has bought a car for $15,000 will pay $500 less 
in interest each year. This is because we have a good Minister of

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is directed to the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence said in the House that he 
wants a thorough investigation of what happened in Somalia. The 
official opposition agrees with him. But if he wants to find out what 
really happened in Somalia, he should first of all have a thorough 
investigation of the document tampering that went on afterwards.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say they are pretty 
touchy today!
<P>
	If the minister refuses to order an interim report on the document 
tampering, could it be because the cover up occurred under the 
current Liberal government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, like the hon. 
member, we want a thorough investigation of everything that 
happened in connection with the situation in Somalia.
<P>
	The mandate of the Commission of Inquiry on Somalia is quite 
clear. The commission is to consider all aspects, and we hope to 
have some answers as soon as possible and, especially, some 
recommendations.
<P>
	I could not agree more with the hon. member. If the members of 
the commission of inquiry think they should produce an interim 
report, that is up to them. We are not going to give instructions to 
the commission. I am sure all members of this House realize that 
one should not interfere with the work of the commission of 
inquiry.
<P>
	That being said, I hope the hon. member will join our efforts to 
ensure that there is a thorough investigation of what happened in 
Somalia and that the commission of inquiry will report as 
scheduled on March 31, 1997, so that everyone, all Canadians and 
all members of the Canadian Armed Forces and members of this 
House will have the information they need to make an informed 
decision if by any chance an election is called in 1997.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
minister admit that the government is trying to arrange things so 
there will be no release of any report on document tampering by the 
commission of inquiry before the next election, to save the face of 
the government and that of the Prime Minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I will try and do 
some face saving for the benefit of the hon. member. This was my 
answer to this question: Yes, if the members of the Commission of 
Inquiry on Somalia believe it is in the best interests of all 
concerned and it is part of their mandate, and if they wish to 
publish an interim report, they can go ahead. I am not asking them 
to do so because I do not want to interfere with the work of the 
inquiry. But if they think it should be done, I have no objection.
<P>
	In fact, and I say this to avoid any misunderstand, I hope to get to 
the bottom of all this, not only of the facts that are of interest to the 
hon. member but of who did what in Somalia, how this was 
possible, how it was covered up, if there was a cover up, who is 
responsible, and how we can make sure this will not happen again.
<P>
	I would like to have, and I am sure all members of this House are 
with me on this, all the answers to everything connected with the 
Somalia affair before the next election. This does not mean I know 
the date. That is always at the discretion of the Prime Minister. It is 
after all his prerogative. I hope the commission of inquiry will

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, many 
Canadian families would like to have the option to have one parent 
stay at home if they so choose, but under the current tax system the 
typical single earner family with an income of $60,000 a year pays 
$7,000 more in taxes than does a family with the same income and 
both parents in the workforce.
<P>
	Can the finance minister tell the House why he and his 
government continue to promote discriminatory tax policies that 
deny families the freedom to make the parenting choices for their 
children?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the member cares to take a look at the Income Tax Act or at 
government policy he will find out that the situation is really quite 
different than the one which he has described.
<P>
	As an example, within the existing system, to the benefit of 
married families, is the married credit which reduces income taxes 
by as much as $1,500 for a couple under the circumstances which 
the member has described.
<P>
	At the same time there is a special supplement under the child 
tax benefit for parents who care for their preschool children at 
home. The child tax benefit is based on family income, so it 
automatically increases when a parent gives up a job to stay at 
home.
<P>
	The fact is the tax system directly answers the member's 
question. He might do a bit of research before standing up so 
quickly.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, $7,000 
may not be a lot of money to the millionaires of this world, but it is 
a lot of money to regular Canadians.
<P>
	Can the finance minister explain to Canadians why one form of 
child care is worthy of a tax credit while the other is not? Can he 
explain why his government is yet again interfering with the 
private parenting choices of Canadian families? Why is there 
discrimination?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
again it is quite the opposite. We are not interfering with the 
question of choice. What we have is a system that provides 
considerable benefits where one of the two parents decides to stay 
at home for precisely the reasons which I think the member is 
trying to allude to.
<P>
	If we immediately went to the kind of system that the member is 
talking about, the second spouse entering the workforce would 
immediately face crippling taxation. That makes no sense.
<P>
	Another thing is a number of the European countries, in fact 
virtually all of the European countries on a family basis are now 
shifting to the same kind of taxation that we have in Canada, which 
is by far the best.

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is the prerogative of the Prime Minister to appoint 
someone to the cabinet when he decides to do so. The minister 
handed me his resignation for very honourable reasons and I 
accepted it with much regret. I maintain that he has done an 
extraordinary job as Minister of National Defence, under extremely 
difficult circumstances.
<P>
	The previous government had seven defence ministers in nine 
years. The minister who resigned last Friday succeeded in making 
huge cuts and in reducing military personnel, including the number 
of generals, which went down from 125 to 70. The former minister 
has earned the thanks of this House for a job well done.

on October 2, and I quote: ``It is exactly because I want the 
commission to finish its work that I will not prejudge the

family week and Canadians want to know what the Liberals are 
doing for families who continue to support their children who 
cannot find jobs.
<P>
	Recently the finance minister admitted that employment 
insurance works as a deterrent to new hiring. With the huge surplus 
built up in the EI fund, when will the new Minister of Human 
Resources Development announce a cut in the premiums so that 
Canadian youth can find the jobs they are so desperately seeking?
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no doubt about the importance of reducing payroll taxes.
<P>
	In the first year that we took office the UI premiums at that time 
were supposed to go to $3.30 but we did not allow that to happen. 
In fact under this administration they have gone down to $3.07, to 
$2.95 and to $2.90 last year. At the same time we have introduced a 
whole series of measures such that since we have taken office we 
have reduced the unemployment insurance burden on salaries by 
$1.8 billion, precisely to put people back to work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
finance minister talks about the first year in office. The first year in 
office the debt was at $490 billion. It is approaching $600 billion 
and we still have 18 per cent unemployment among our youth.
<P>
	The employment insurance system discriminates against young 
people, even those with jobs. Full time students are forced to pay 
premiums even though by law they are never able to collect those 
benefits. Premiums are monies they badly need for texts and 
tuition. Will the new Minister of Human Resources Development 
act immediately to exempt full time students from paying 
premiums for insurance they cannot collect?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member talks about helping young people. Let us look at 
the record.
<P>
	The fact is when the previous Minister of Human Resources 
Development increased the amount of money to be made available 
for summer students, the Reform Party opposed it. When this 
government increased the tuition credits for students going to 
school, the Reform Party opposed it. When this government made 
more money available to caregivers so that they could go to school 
while their children were taken care of, the Reform Party opposed 
it.
<P>
	The Reform Party has opposed every single measure brought 
before this House to help students, to help young Canadians. The 
fact is members of the Reform Party are disconnected from the 
reality of the Canadian public.

the Alberta Court of Appeal's decision last June to strike down the 
provisions of the federal law prohibiting third parties from 
spending more than $1,000 on advertising during election

<P>

unbelievable excuse for not releasing his secret ethics guidelines

tradition that prevented him from making the guidelines public. 
The Prime Minister must know that the British government 
released its guidelines in this connection in 1992.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister again, will he now make the ethics 
guidelines for cabinet ministers public?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, these guidelines are instructions from the Prime Minister 
to his ministers and they are obliged to follow them. There is an 
officer who advises them and when ministers feel they have a 
problem, they receive guidance.
<P>
	These are instructions that the Prime Minister gives to his 
ministers. As I said, at the end of the day, in the British tradition, it 
is the Prime Minister who is responsible for the conduct and I have 
always accepted full responsibility in those matters. The guidelines 
are instructions for my ministers. Communications between the 
Prime Minister and the ministers by the nature of our system are 
confidential.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister apparently feels that ethics are a 
private matter between himself and the ministers. He will not 
release the guidelines and he only uses them when it is to his 
political advantage, as in sacking the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Ethics are a public matter. For the public to judge whether the 
conduct of the Prime Minister's ministers is ethical, they need to 
know what the guidelines are. How are Canadians supposed to 
know whether the ethics guidelines followed by cabinet ministers 
are ethical if the Prime Minister will not make them public?
<P>

<P>
	I can assure all Canadians that our goal in introducing this new 
employment insurance system is to move away from passive 
measures and toward active measures that make work more 
attractive, thereby helping workers go from unemployment to 
employment.
<P>
	This is a much more positive approach. And I would like to draw 
the hon. member's attention to the fact that a larger number of 
Canadians are covered under this system than the old one and that a 
larger number of women are benefiting in particular.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister will have to make a quick review of the issue, because I 
am asking him whether he realizes that these active measures

increase, while at the same time more than $65 billion will be paid

	What is the minister doing to protect our hog producers from the 
damaging results of this United States action?
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Department of Commerce 
has for quite some time now been reviewing the countervailability 
of a number of Canadian farm programs both federally and 
provincially, particularly in that period between 1991 and 1994.
<P>
	I am happy to tell the hon. gentleman that as a result of the most 
recent DOC review of Canadian programs there are two very 
important pieces of good news. First, Canadian hog producers will 
be receiving a refund of $28.5 million on duty that they have 
already paid and that they will be getting back.
<P>
	Second, in the course of its work the U.S. Department of 
Commerce has also taken a look at the Canadian net  income 
stabilization account program, the NISA program, which is the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5294"> 5294 </A></B>
<P>
whole farm core of our safety net system in Canada, and the DOC 
has confirmed that the program is not countervailable. It is trade 
neutral, which verifies the policy position taken by this 
government.

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Finance who, in a half hour from now, will 
likely dislocate his shoulder trying to pat his government on the 
back for its financial performance over the next little while.
<P>
	On January 12 of this year in the <I>Citizen</I> the Minister of Finance 
was quoted as saying: ``As soon as I can, as soon as our financial 
situation allows, I will address the serious issue of child poverty in 
Canada''.
<P>
	With 1,747,000 children living in poverty today, how soon will 
the Minister of Finance be able to act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member's question strikes very much a resonant cord with 
the government. Indeed it is for that reason that over the course of 
the last 15 months we doubled the working income supplement for 
families with small children. The Minister of Justice brought in a 
comprehensive package dealing with guidelines on support 
payments for custodial parents.
<P>
	There is no doubt that as a government we wish we could do a lot 
more and we intend to do so. The hon. member is quite right when 
he points out that while we are bettering the financial condition of 
the country we must also bear in mind the need to better the 
financial conditions of individual Canadians.
<P>
	One of the greatest frustrations I think we have is the clean-up of 
the mess that somebody else created so that we can do precisely the 
job that the member wants us to do.

	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak 
to the House about Women's History Month.
<P>
	Women's History Month was created in 1992 by the federal 
government to foster greater awareness of the historical 
contributions of women to our society.
<P>
	The impetus for Women's History Month came from my home 
province of British Columbia but was soon supported by 
organizations across the country.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For the past five years, the month of October has been 
designated Women's History Month in Canada. It is a time for all 
of us to recognize, discover and celebrate the accomplishments of 
women in Canada throughout all spheres of society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	October seemed the most appropriate month to acknowledge 
women's achievements because October 18 also marked an 
historical milestone in the struggle for women's equality. It was the 
day women legally gained the status of persons in Canada. On that 
day, a short 67 years ago, five Albertan women, Nellie McClung, 
Louise McKinney, Emily Murphy, Irene Parlby and Henrietta Muir 
Edwards, finally won the long struggle to have women fully 
recognized as persons in their own right, no longer to be seen as 
chattel or second class citizens.
<P>
	This is a time to recognize and celebrate Canadian women. So 
much of women's contributions to the economic and social 
development of this great nation has been overlooked by traditional 
historians, by the classroom and by the media.
<P>
	We often have to dig deep to find the forgotten and the 
overlooked. But as we do we gain a greater appreciation of the vital 
role women have played in the shaping of Canadian society. The 
history of women is one of struggle, of courage and of heroism.
<P>
	Women historically were denied education, barred from certain 
professions, denied the support they needed to enter public service 
and political decision making, and yet despite these tremendous 
barriers women managed to make important contributions to 
Canada's development.
<P>
	Women's History Month is a time to tell women's stories and 
celebrate their impressive victories, to speak of their efforts in 
peace and in war, as pioneers and scientists and daily heroines who 
raised families despite poverty and deprivation, violence and 
exclusion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5295"> 5295 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This year, the fifth Women's History Month, we are honouring 
women in the arts. We are honouring our cultural legacy. 
Throughout history, women's artistic and cultural contributions 
have often been undervalued and ignored, largely because of 
women's unequal status in society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Women have been active participants in the cultural evolution of 
our country, forging our identity within Canada and to the world; 
women such as Emily Carr, Mary Pickford, Gabrielle Roy. From 
the writings of early French Canadian novelist Adéle Bibaud to the 
turn of the century wilderness photographs of Geraldine Moore, 
each has a story to tell of struggle for recognition and victory.
<P>
	It has been said that history is a work in progress. Women's 
History Month adds fuel to that progress. Remembering, 
discovering and celebrating women's history has a clear impact on 
Canadians. Canadian women have built an astonishing cultural 
legacy that expresses the diverse and changing experiences of 
women in Canada.
<P>
	I encourage all my colleagues in the House to take the time to 
discover and celebrate the women who have played an important 
role in the cultural legacy of our country, to give them a place of 
honour as role models to future Canadians, men and women; and in 
doing so, to lay the groundwork for the future, a future in which 
men and women are viewed as equals and with respect.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, October 
is Women's History Month. Women's names do not appear in our 
history books as frequently as we would like, especially not to the 
extent of their involvement in society.
<P>
	Many women remain in the shadow, and today I would like to 
pay tribute to them. History books are usually written by men who 
make decisions without consulting half the population and leave 
their names behind for posterity. This is not a criticism, but merely 
an observation.
<P>
	I wish to thank the Secretary of State for the Status of Women 
and Multiculturalism for taking the initiative to mark Women's 
History Month by making a ministerial statement today. This 
House, which unfortunately has few female members, will hear a 
little about us today thanks to the initiative to draw attention to 
Women's History Month.
<P>
	Thinking about women's history brings to mind some heroines 
who, despite the difficulties that existed in their day, marked the 
times in which they lived and moved women closer to equality.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Quebec recently lost one of its greatest feminists, Claire 
Bonenfant, who was president of the Fédération des femmes du 
Québec and gave Quebec its first integrated policy on the status of 
women, a feminist policy called Equality and Independence. Ms. 
Bonenfant was supported by a champion of women's rights, Lise 
Payette.
<P>
	These contemporary women follow in the footsteps of the 
professional women and ordinary citizens who invested in the 
betterment of their communities. From Marie Guyart, better known 
as Marie-de-l'Incarnation, to Agnes McPhail, Marie Gérin-Lajoie, 
Carrie Derick, Thérèse Casgrain and Laure Gaudreault, they all 
shared the same goal: improving the lives of women and children, 
since the two are too often linked. They all helped make our society 
better without regard for their own situation.
<P>
	Again, I want to pay homage to Claire Bonenfant and convey our 
sincere thanks for her dedication, warmth and honesty. She 
provided us with a model of feminism by remaining faithful to her 
convictions, even after she became a top public servant as president 
of the Council on the Status of Women.
<P>
	But history is a continuing process. Unfortunately, we still often 
talk about the first woman appointed to this or that position. For 
example, the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata recently 
mentioned the appointment of Lyse Lemieux, the first woman to 
become chief justice of the Quebec superior court.
<P>
	These women are making history, and we hope that the 
increasing number of such appointments will bring us closer to the 
day when we have a tradition of appointing women to positions of 
leadership and authority.
<P>
	In this month of October 1996, the more specific objective is to 
stress the presence of women in the fields of arts and culture. We 
cannot help but remember the cuts imposed by the Liberal 
government on major cultural institutions, in spite of firm 
commitments made in the red book. Studio D, at the National Film 
Board, is unquestionably the service most affected by these cuts, as 
far as women and culture are concerned. Since 1974, the year it was 
established, Studio D, whose mandate was to produce films on the 
status of women, made over 120 films and won more than 75 
international awards, including one Genie and two Oscars. This is a 
big loss for women and for the cultural world.
<P>
	But the government did not stop there. Year after year and, again, 
in spite of the promises made in the red book, it makes cuts in the 
cultural sector. These cuts result in the loss of jobs and, 
consequently, in fewer cultural products.
<P>
	According to the latest survey on the labour force in the cultural 
sector, women outnumber men in the visual arts and the dance and 
choreography sectors. It just so  happens that these are the two 
sectors where the average income is the lowest: $8,800 for painters, 
sculptors and those involved in related activities, and $12,800 for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5296"> 5296 </A></B>
<P>
dancers and choreographers. It is no surprise that visual arts are the 
cultural activity sector getting the least federal funding. So, the 
cuts imposed on culture primarily affect women.
<P>
	In conclusion, I remind the government that, while ministerial 
statements may be encouraging for women, they do not put bread 
and butter on the table. Since it came to office, the government has 
abolished the sub-committee that reviewed issues relating to the 
status of women, and also the Canadian Advisory Council on the 
Status of Women.
<P>
	Similarly, the federal government, which made firm promises 
concerning child care during the election campaign, today, like a 
spoiled child, angry because the provinces are unwilling to go 
through the hoops it is holding out, is taking back its child care 
program and sulking. But the money for child care services belongs 
to women and families, and the federal government must return it 
to them without delay.
<P>
	And what can we say about the new criteria in the Employment 
Insurance Act, with its new rules that penalize women because of 
the temporary and precarious nature of their employment?
<P>
	I understand that it is women's month and that this needs to be 
underscored, but politics is politics, and I think that the 
government's new policies with respect to women penalize them.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	There are also the cuts made by this government to community 
groups in Canada, which are not only working to make the public 
aware of women's issues, such as domestic violence, but which 
also provide services in a number of other fields of activity. There 
as well, there have been cuts that hurt women.
<P>
	To date, the actions of the federal Liberal government show how 
little importance it accords to the status of women.
<P>
	To these criticisms, the federal government will reply that it has 
developed an equal opportunity program. But everyone knows that 
it has not yet produced any results. This is not surprising, because 
there was no financial envelope for it.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to remind members that the history of 
women in Quebec and in Canada contains many acts of courage 
and tenacity. The work of achieving equality for women goes on 
daily. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the women 
working today in the women's movement. It is not easy, when the 
focus is on the deficit and downsizing, to generate interest in social 
and legal rights-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the hon. member's time is 
up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to have the opportunity to speak about Women's 
History Month.
<P>
	Women have worked alongside men from the beginning of time 
in making history and have accomplished great things, sometimes 
independently and sometimes in partnership with others.
<P>
	I do not accept the assertion of the minister responsible for the 
status of women that women's contributions to history and 
civilization have gone largely ignored. Great women have been 
recognized for their greatness in every generation. Political leaders 
from ancient civilizations through modern times such as India's 
Indira Ghandi, Israel's Golda Meir, Britain's Margaret Thatcher, 
have all been esteemed for their unique contributions.
<P>
	Many other non-political examples also exist, including 
Florence Nightingale, Mother Theresa and Canada's own Laura 
Secord whose actions saved Upper Canada from Americans 
invading from the south.
<P>
	The primary focus of this year's Women's History Month is 
culture and arts but it is important to recognize the significance of 
women in the whole of history and recognize the extent of their 
success even before any affirmative action movement for women's 
rights came into existence. In terms of this year's particular focus, 
women have in fact been the most significant contributors to 
culture throughout history.
<P>
	Most in this House are probably well acquainted with the saying: 
``The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world''. This reflects once 
again the truth that the transmission of culture and tradition takes 
place primarily in the home. In this respect women have left an 
indelible mark on the lives of history makers throughout time.
<P>
	Women's History Month is a celebration of women's unique and 
diverse accomplishments. This year the fifth Women's History 
Month honours women in the arts and their contribution to culture. 
I recognize and applaud the contribution women have made to the 
artistic and cultural development of our country.
<P>
	In addition to the many individuals who have been mentioned 
today, I assert that equal recognition is well deserved for the role 
that women have played and continue to play in the preservation 
and protection of the family, a role that requires creativity, 
inspiration and compassion.
<P>
	I salute the women who daily meet the realities of day to day 
living in their homes, striving to create order and harmony in an 
increasingly complex society. Women have a unique place in 
society as strategic partners in the  future economic, social and 
cultural direction of our country. As key players in our families, 
they enhance this important and fundamental building block of our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5297"> 5297 </A></B>
<P>
society. They play a key role in the transfer of our nation's values 
and cultures.
<P>
	Women both inside and outside the home deserve our 
recognition as pivotal players in the growth of our nation.

it should consider restricting an MP's right to ask such questions.

should have the answers to these questions at their fingertips.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the consideration.
<P>
	I have two petitions today. The first one comes from Edmonton, 
Alberta.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that managing 
the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable 
profession which has not been recognized for its value to our 
society.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
choose to provide care in the home to preschool children, the 
chronically ill, the aged or the disabled.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ALCOHOLCONSUMPTION">ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition comes from Kingston, Ontario concerning the 
labelling of alcoholic beverages.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that the 
consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health problems or 
impair one's ability, and specifically that fetal alcohol syndrome 
and other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent preventable 
by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to enact 
legislation to require health warning labels to be placed on the 
containers of all alcoholic beverages to caution expectant mothers 
and others of the dangers associated with alcohol consumption.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Evidently the hon. parliamentary 
secretary to the government House leader did not request that the 
remaining questions be allowed to stand. I wonder if he wishes to 
do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask 
that all questions be allowed to stand.
<P>
	While I am on my feet, I ask that all Notices of Motions for the 
Production of Papers also be allowed to stand.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I wish to inform the House that, because 
of the ministerial statement, Government Orders will be extended

	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (for the Minister of Justice)</B> moved 
that Bill C-54, an Act to amend the Foreign Extraterritorial 
Measures Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am happy to speak in support of Bill 
C-54, an act to amend the foreign extraterritorial measures Act. 
There is no doubt in my mind that we must resist any foreign 
intervention in our affairs. Under the Helms-Burton Act, the United 
States is extending its reach to threaten legitimate business 
between companies from other countries and Cuba. We cannot 
accept that the foreign extraterritorial measures Act (FEMA) is our 
answer.
<P>
	We find ourselves at loggerheads with the U.S. on Helms-Burton 
partly because of very different approaches to dealing with Cuba. 
We both share the desire for a strong democracy in that country, 
fully respecting human rights. But we have been taking different 
paths to that goal. We believe in engagement and dialogue; the 
United States favours isolation.
<P>
	So let me talk about our relations with Cuba before I go further 
into FEMA.
<P>
	At the outset, let me say that I am proud of our Cuba policy. It 
has strong support from all political parties and from interested 
Canadians. It is also quite similar to that of most other countries in 
Latin America and Europe.
<P>
	Canada values its friendship and over 50 years of unbroken 
relations with Cuba. Unofficial links go back much further, 
building on trade and investment links with Atlantic Canada. For 
decades, Canada and Cuba have discussed common goals and 
interests, learning from each other. There has been co-operation to 
our mutual benefit in such diverse fields as international fisheries, 
social policies, the environment, science, culture and international 
arms control issues.
<P>
	There are also numerous links between Canadian and Cuban 
organizations, research centres and universities, and between 
ordinary canadians and Cubans.
<P>
	Our goal overall is to help bring Cuba into the community of 
democratic nations with a genuinely representative government 
and an open economy.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Unlike the US approach, which has been characterized by 
punitive measures such as the embargo, we prefer a policy of 
engagement and dialogue. A significant part of that dialogue 
indeed focuses on human rights, democratic reform and good 
governance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5300"> 5300 </A></B>
<P>
	Our longstanding relations, however, have not stopped us from 
expressing our concerns on Cuba's human rights performance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada has publicly pressed the Cubans concerning violations, 
such as last February when we condemned the shooting down of 
two U.S. civilian aircraft by the Cuban air force and the tragic loss 
of life resulting from this incident. This action, taken by the Cuban 
government, was an excessive and inappropriate use of force which 
violated internationally accepted rules for the interception of 
civilian aircraft.
<P>
	Canada has raised individual human rights cases with the Cuban 
government. Human rights was a major item on the agenda during 
the visit last year of Cuban foreign minister Robaina. I should add 
that during his visit minister Robaina also met with the UN 
commissioner for human rights, who was also in Ottawa at the 
time, Mr. Ed Broadbent of the International Centre for Human 
Rights and Democratic Development, and Mr. Jean-Pierre 
Kingsley of Elections Canada.
<P>
	Canada was also among the first to express concern at the severe 
sentence handed down last year against Cuban human rights 
activist Francisco Chaviano. We have also responded very strongly 
to the harassment early this year of the Concilio Cubano, an 
emerging coalition of human rights activists. Canadian embassy 
officials in Havana also meet regularly with human rights activists 
and have attended trials of dissidents.
<P>
	This constant dialogue which Cuba has had with Canada and 
other countries has helped lead to reforms. Cuba is moving ahead 
with changes to economic policy. There are changes as well in the 
human rights areas. For example, Cuba ratified the United Nations 
Convention Against Torture in May of 1995.
<P>
	Our well known commercial ties, which are the target of the 
Helms-Burton legislation, are but one element in a range of 
connections that Canadians and Cubans have made over the years.
<P>
	Parliamentary exchanges are an important part of our strategy 
with Cuba. They allow each country to understand better their 
systems of governance and perhaps benefit from each other's 
experience.
<P>
	The president of the Cuban National Assembly visited Canada in 
April 1995. The Speaker of the House of Commons travelled to 
Cuba in October of 1995 and at the same time provided a major 
donation of medical supplies.
<P>
	In May of this year Senator Jacques Hébert and other members 
of the parliamentary friendship group Canada-Cuba had the 
opportunity to welcome another parliamentary delegation headed 
by the Cuban minister of education. During these meetings Cubans 
posed extensive questions on the workings of the Canadian 
parliamentary system, and Canadian members were able to make 
strong representation supporting further progress in democratic 
reform and in the protection of human rights.
<P>
	We are also working with the Cuban government to pinpoint 
areas where Canadians can help Cuba modernize some of its key 
economic policy institutions. Assistance to the Cuban ministry of 
finance to develop a new taxation system has begun with technical 
assistance from Revenue Canada. This program will include 
training in tax collection and client relations and computerization 
of taxation information. Assistance to the Bank of Cuba from the 
Bank of Canada, on the other hand, is concentrating on upgrading 
its informatics and basic training in economics and accounting.
<P>
	Encouraging Cuba to open to the rest of the world and to 
modernize its machinery of government and its key economic 
bodies will help the majority of its citizens. We are working with 
the Cuban government to bring about a better future for all the 
people.
<P>
	In the area of social programs, the marked decline in the Cuban 
economy from 1989 to 1993 has resulted in significant 
underfunding of all social programs.
<P>
	When I went to Cuba in June of 1994, Canada launched a small 
but important package of assistance channelled through the 
non-government sector.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	This has allowed Canadians in the non-governmental sector to 
assist Cubans at a time of economic difficulty and to build bridges 
with Cuban institutions such as the university system. By the end of 
that year a small bilateral program was under discussion and this 
has led to the development of several projects that I have just 
outlined.
<P>
	As a result, Canadian NGOs, churches, labour unions and 
universities are working with a variety of Cuban organizations, a 
number of which are in transition from a very close association 
with the Cuban government to a more independent stance. We are 
eager to support this transition.
<P>
	Last March CIDA and OXFAM Canada signed a co-operation 
agreement for a major effort to strengthen the NGO sector in Cuba. 
With nearly $1 million over the next three years, the project will 
support the work of Cuban NGOs and churches with, for example, 
income generation projects for poor women, training for 
independent small farmers and linkages with Canadian NGOs, 
including internships for five Cubans at Canadian agencies.
<P>
	Prior to 1994 when we put in place our assistance package for 
Cuba, several Canadian universities already had co-operation 
agreements with Cuban universities. Since 1994 many more 
universities, community colleges and institutions have joined 
them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5301"> 5301 </A></B>
<P>
	I could go on about the many links that Canada has now and 
is developing with Cuba, links with the Canadian and Cuban 
artistic communities for example. Jazz musicians like Vic Vogel 
and Jane Bunnett have travelled to play with Cuban counterparts. 
On a recent trip Bunnett arranged to have three Toronto 
technicians give much needed instrument repair workshops for 
young musicians in Havana. The Quebec television and film 
industry has shot several feature films and a major television 
series in Cuba. The list goes on and on.
<P>
	However, there have also been linkages established between 
labour unions. Last year Bob White of the Canadian Labour 
Congress travelled to Cuba to meet with representatives of the 
Cuban Congress of Workers. They in turn sent a delegation to 
Canada on a fact finding mission.
<P>
	One hundred and forty thousand Canadians visit Cuba each year.
<P>
	We believe it is through this multitude of engagements at many 
levels that Cubans will undertake their own reform which will 
eventually open their society to more liberal, economic and 
political institutions.
<P>
	As I said earlier, we do not quarrel with the American objective 
of moving Cuba peacefully to a more democratic society. We do 
quarrel with the use of Helms-Burton as a tool to fix an American 
problem with Cuba. Helms-Burton targets companies and other 
countries doing legitimate business with Cuba.
<P>
	The United States could have followed the same route as other 
countries and settled its dispute bilaterally. Having chosen this 
path, the U.S. risks hurting its friends and allies while aiming at 
Cuba through Helms-Burton. In this situation we had to do what we 
could to protect Canadian citizens and Canadian firms.
<P>
	The Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act was a logical path to 
take and the changes it proposes are necessary. However, it is my 
sincere hope that it will not be necessary to use them. That of 
course will depend on whether the Helms-Burton claims provisions 
and other similar measures are used against Canadian firms.
<P>
	I hope that Helms-Burton is just a brief blip on the screen. The 
Canada-U.S. relationship is a strong and fruitful one and we should 
not have to squabble over irritants of this kind.
<P>
	In closing this part of the debate, I regret that I will not be able to 
be in attendance for the rest of the debate this afternoon due to prior 
engagements, but I will look with interest at <I>Hansard</I> so that I can 
have the opportunity of reading further on this debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak again today to Bill C-54, which, 
as we know, and as my hon. friend said previously, is intended to 
counter certain effects of  the extraterritorial measures contained in 
the U.S. legislation referred to as the Helms-Burton act, legislation 
which has been referred to many times in this House in the past few 
days and the past few months.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is not opposed to the passage of this bill, 
quite the contrary. As we have said from the very beginning, we 
support any attempt to protect Quebec and Canadian businesses 
from illegal measures, measures we call illegal, imposed by the 
Americans.
<P>
	In fact, as soon as the Helms-Burton act was passed, the Bloc 
Quebecois vigorously objected to this initiative by the American 
government which initially attempted to impose on all countries its 
policy of economic sanctions against Cuba, this in flagrant 
violation of international law and the sovereignty of states.
<P>
	From the outset, the Bloc Quebecois has asked the federal 
government in this House to strongly condemn the Helms-Burton 
act and to do everything it could to have this act declared null and 
void. However, the Liberal government's only response has been 
Bill C-54, which is now before the House. Seven months, seven 
long months after the Helms-Burton act was passed, the 
government tabled its own Bill C-54 in the House, saying that it 
was responding to an urgent need to counter the effects of this 
legislation which, need I remind you, is still in effect, since it has 
not been contested before the courts, and has been in force since 
August.
<P>
	I have already commented in this House on the late arrival of 
Bill C-54 and its lack of substance. However, what I want to 
discuss today is the irresponsible attitude of the Liberal 
government and its ministers to this issue.
<P>
	The government's lack of political will and its failure to show 
that it wants to be serious about the Helms-Burton act have become 
intolerable. The government never intended to have the 
Helms-Burton act declared null and void, although it is the only 
effective way to get rid of this legislation and show the Americans 
that Canada is very serious about protecting its trade policy and its 
territorial sovereignty as well. When the Americans attacked, 
Canada fired back with water pistols. Although some water pistols 
look like the real thing, they are useless in combat.
<P>
	Recently, appearing before the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade, the Liberal government again 
refused to demand a special panel for the settlement of trade 
disputes under NAFTA-although it has been entitled to do so 
since July 29-claiming that it was waiting for the right time. The 
right time was July 29. Ever since that day, we have had the right, 
the opportunity to ask for a special committee. We should have 
taken action at that time, not the day after the presidential election 
in the U.S.
<P>
	The government tells us it did everything in its power to respond 
to the urgent situation, but it has known  about the Helms-Burton 
law since it came into effect on March 12. The government could 
have taken action as early as March or April. It would not have 
taken very long to make eight or nine short amendments to an 
existing act in order to cover the Helms-Burton law. How long did 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5302"> 5302 </A></B>
<P>
they wait? Seven months. It took them seven months to amend an 
existing act and table Bill C-54 before the House.
<P>
	The government has demonstrated a total lack of leadership in 
this matter, considering it was in the best position to act against the 
Americans. Frightened, our government let so much time pass that 
the European Union had to take it upon itself to challenge the 
validity of the Helms-Burton law.
<P>
	In fact, the European Union announced last week that it would 
ask for arbitration and, if need be, for a special trade dispute 
settlement committee under the World Trade Organization on 
October 16, before the U.S. election is held.
<P>
	The member states of the European Union understood the urgent 
need to act. How can the Minister for International Trade now boast 
to the media that he wants to participate in this process before the 
WTO, given the importance of the situation? If we were in his 
shoes, we would be slightly embarrassed to have missed the boat 
and to follow in the wake of other states in challenging a law the 
Canadian government should have challenged seven months ago 
under NAFTA. But no, they would rather leave this to the WTO and 
trail behind the European Union.
<P>
	Once again, the Liberal government has demonstrated its lack of 
leadership and its inability to effectively protect Quebec and 
Canadian businesses against foreign pressure.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	To prepare for an eventual arbitration regarding the other 
American extraterritorial legislation, the Iranian and Libyan 
economic sanctions law of 1996 penalizing companies that make 
oil and gas investments in Iran and Libya, the European Union also 
decided to undertake consultations within the WTO, while Canada 
has done nothing so far to challenge this law.
<P>
	Obviously, there are not a multitude of Quebec and Canadian 
companies investing in the oil and gas industries in Iran or Libya. 
That is not the problem. The problem is that, on the one hand, we 
challenge the Helms-Burton law, claiming that it is not right, but on 
the other hand, we delay acting. Then we face a fait accompli. 
Instead of seeing reason, the American government comes back 
with another extraterritorial law, taking another tack; it is the 
principle of the law that the Canadian government should have 
challenged. But they wait and wait, while time goes by.
<P>
	It would seem that foreign affairs ministers in Europe have more 
courage than our Canadian ministers, who dare not attack either the 
American President or American policies during a U.S. 
presidential election. Unlike our Canadian ministers, European 
foreign trade commissioner Leon Brittan does not see any reason to 
defer arbitration.
<P>
	To conclude, I wish the government would make sure the 
Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act will be enforced and not 
shelved. As the Minister for International Trade or the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs often says: ``We made amendments but, and we say 
so in the House and to the media, we hope we never have to 
implement this act. We amend the act, we make it more rigorous, 
we increase the amounts to be paid or recovered, but we hope we 
never have to use this legislation''. If the government keeps saying 
it hopes to never have to use it, the international community will no 
longer support this legislation.
<P>
	I should also point out that Bill C-54 does not counteract all the 
perverse effects of the Helms-Burton act. Indeed, title IV is still in 
effect, and officials of the companies doing business with Cuba, 
including Sherritt, a Canadian company, are prohibited from 
entering the United States, as could be executives from other 
Quebec or Canadian companies, and their families.
<P>
	By introducing Bill C-54 as a means to deal with an urgent 
situation, the Canadian government only solves half of the issue, 
namely the case of Canadian or Quebec companies that could be 
sued for conducting business with Cuba.
<P>
	However, title IV, which prohibits company executives and their 
families from entering the United States is still in effect. We, Bloc 
Quebecois members, say to the Liberals that, if they want to 
abolish title IV, if they want to eliminate the sword of Damocles 
hanging over the head of Canadian and Quebec executives doing 
business with Cuba, they can easily do it, because, since July 29, 
they have been able to apply to a special panel under NAFTA to 
invalidate the Helms-Burton act. The Liberal government can, not 
with Bill C-54, but under the rules agreed in NAFTA, oppose the 
whole Helms-Burton act and thus eliminate the dangers posed by 
title IV for executives of Canadian and Quebec companies, and 
their families.
<P>
	We propose concrete solutions to the government, because it 
does not act. We know that, the day after the presidential election, 
if the U.S. President abolishes titles III and IV or sets them aside, 
this government will say: ``You see, we were right to wait, nothing 
came out of it''. But what happens if the U.S. President decides 
otherwise? We will have waited nine months, or a year, to either 
decide not to go before the special panel, so as not to hurt the 
President's feelings, or to finally decide, after the Europeans, to 
take concrete action?
<P>
	In spite of all this, and even though its effect is quite limited, we 
will support Bill C-54. But rest assured: we will not give the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5303"> 5303 </A></B>
<P>
government any medal for its response to the American 
administration. The government should, once and for all, learn 
from its mistakes and redo its homework.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we 
are addressing Bill C-54, which is an act to amend the Foreign 
Extraterritorial Measures Act, commonly known as the blocking 
legislation for the Helms-Burton bill in the United States.
<P>
	I am pleased to be able to speak at this the third and final reading 
of Bill C-54. During a previous debate on the bill I was interested 
to note that members of the other opposition parties felt the way the 
Reform Party does, that this bill should be supported but that it 
does not go far enough. I will outline the reasons.
<P>
	This is only a stop gap measure, a half measure if you like, that 
needs to be advanced a lot further. I have stated repeatedly that this 
bill should go further. Canada must act in other ways to get this 
situation resolved quickly.
<P>
	It is fine to have legislation on the books to be used if we need to 
do so. It is there on the shelf, but as the Minister for International 
Trade stated himself, we hope we never have to use it.
<P>
	While every well stocked medicine cabinet contains an antidote 
for accidental poisoning and snake bites, it is hoped they never 
have to be used but it is pretty nice to have them there if they are 
needed. It is far better though to eliminate the problem from one's 
territory and remove the deadly poisons from one's household.
<P>
	What I am getting at is that the United States must be told that 
not only is the Helms-Burton bill unwise, it is illegal. Titles III and 
IV of the Helms-Burton legislation are in clear violation of the 
NAFTA agreement which the United States has signed. Title III 
further violates international law and the sovereignty of all 
countries that invest and trade with Cuba.
<P>
	Even though it is nice to have an antidote, let us get rid of this 
poison and this problem once and for all. Canada has been in the 
position for some time to call a dispute settlement panel under 
NAFTA. I submit that had we done this when this problem first 
arose in June, it could have been settled by now. We could have 
been finished with it and eliminated some of the potential for 
problems.
<P>
	We know the President of the United States has given Canada a 
six months reprieve and may do so again. However, it is election 
time in the United States and we can never be sure if that is going to 
happen. In fact, President Clinton, or perhaps it will be President 
Dole at that stage, may be in a position to extend the six months 
further or he may not. On the other hand, a new crisis may occur 
which will force the president to allow  lawsuits to go ahead. We do 
not want our companies to be in that position.
<P>
	Furthermore, the metre on the claims continue to tick. We are 
still being exposed to these claims and the liabilities are continuing 
to accumulate. This bill does nothing to protect certain Canadian 
executives and their families who may be turned away when trying 
to enter the United States. That issue continues to be unresolved. 
We need to have the Helms-Burton bill overturned. We can only do 
that by challenging the legislation at a NAFTA panel.
<P>
	There is another reason for getting Helms-Burton overturned. 
Canadian companies operating in Cuba have to decide whether or 
not to do business with Cuba. They can follow the U.S. rules. If 
they do that, they are hit with a fine of $1.5 million Canadian, or 
they can decide not to follow the U.S. rules and get hit with a fine 
of $1 million U.S. That is a little like a choice of being hit by either 
a brick or a baseball bat. Really, it is not much choice at all. The 
only real solution to this problem is to resolve it once and for all 
with a decision by a NAFTA panel.
<P>
	It disturbs me that time and time again this government has 
allowed itself to be pushed around by the Americans. A persistent 
pattern has developed in this area. It certainly has.
<P>
	We can go back to 1994 with soft wheat, the pasta wheats. 
Canada caved in on a dispute with the United States and accepted 
export caps. What happened was that the free trade agreement 
stated that Canada had the right, if we have any economic 
advantage, to export into the United States just as they had the right 
to export into our country. The subsidies are equal. That is not what 
we settled on. We settled on export caps on wheat deliveries to the 
United States. That deal has now expired and we hear rumblings 
that they may want to start it again.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	We have caved in on the softwood lumber issue. Instead of 
taking it to a softwood lumber panel under NAFTA or the World 
Trade Organization, again we have accepted caps on exports. In 
that case it is even worse because we have to administer this 
bureaucratic nightmare ourselves.
<P>
	The lumber industry has been waiting six months to have a 
process put in place it can comply with. Now it has learned it is 
going to take at least another month before provincial quota 
allocations will be decided, never mind the whole problem that we 
are going to get into with allocating to the different companies once 
that happens.
<P>
	I will say again that a persistent pattern has developed and that 
Canada has been afraid to take on the Americans under these 
dispute settlement processes that we have worked so hard to put in 
place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5304"> 5304 </A></B>
<P>
	I would submit that we cannot allow ourselves to be pushed 
around. Furthermore, there is absolutely no need for it. Our trade 
agreements give the protection we require here. We have worked 
very hard to put these processes in place but when it is time to 
test them we always seem to be afraid and back away.
<P>
	I also submit that it is very important for us to test these 
agreements when we feel we can win. How credible can Canada be 
in further reforms that we want to take place at the World Trade 
Organization and further dispute settlement mechanisms that we 
want to put in place when we have not even used the processes that 
we have negotiated in the last round?
<P>
	I would like to talk a bit about the country that is being affected 
in addition to Canada over the Helms-Burton legislation. That little 
country of course is Cuba. We should take every opportunity to 
remind the Americans that their dispute is with Cuba and not with 
Canada. Although we share America's desire to see a more 
democratic, market driven country in Cuba, we think there are 
other means to achieve this. We know that the United States has 
used an isolationist policy and I do not believe that has worked. We 
have 40 years in which that has taken place and we still have a 
communist government in Cuba.
<P>
	I believe that Canada shares some responsibility for the 
problems there too. We continue to trade and I think we should, but 
we have other tools that we can use.
<P>
	We heard the Secretary of State for Latin America a little while 
ago speaking about the gains that have been made in terms of 
human rights and economic reforms and what Canada is doing to 
help. I think that is laudable that we have been helping out where 
we can, but we have not heard of too many gains that have taken 
place in trying to make that a more open, democratic country or any 
result in multi-party open elections, freedom of voting, freedom of 
expression. Those are all very restricted.
<P>
	For 40 years we have had a policy of trading with Cuba and what 
is the result in terms of the other side of this, the engagement part? 
Very little, it seems, and I think we have to work a lot harder to 
accomplish an open, democratic country in Cuba. We have to work 
with the OAS to achieve this. We in the Reform Party believe that 
engaging Cuba is the right approach. We think there are other 
methods and I will outline those.
<P>
	I think trade in this case is our carrot and we can use other 
methods such as the carrot and stick approach if we like, but we do 
have to trade with Cuba and use the opportunities to discuss the 
serious issues where we are not making gains.
<P>
	We can make aid conditional upon improvements in certain 
areas like human rights and democratic reform. We can insist that 
Cuba get no special deals in terms of bilateral aid from Canada, no 
Canadian partnerships in CIDA for example that go bilaterally, 
which came to about $500,000 in 1994-95, and that there be no 
technical support from IDRC, the International Development 
Research Centre.
<P>
	We have to see some movement, some improvement in those 
conditions in the United States before we should offer these kinds 
of technical supports. We should certainly not have any more 
dipping into the Canada fund to support activities in Cuba until we 
see some progress made in the areas I have just identified.
<P>
	We should continue trading in the private sector but do what we 
can in terms of engagement to encourage change and restrict 
Canadian aid programs until some improvement is made.
<P>
	In conclusion, Reform supports this bill but we do not think it 
goes nearly far enough. There needs to be a resolution at NAFTA, 
but it is a stop gap measure and to that extent I think it is probably 
necessary.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	In addition, we must take a more hard nosed attitude when we 
deal with the United States in these types of disputes. Canada must 
clearly challenge the United States, which is way out of bounds on 
this issue. I believe the United States does not respect countries that 
cave in, and that seems to be our history in the last while. We 
should challenge the United States when we feel we are clearly in 
the right, and this is one of those times when we should challenge 
the United States.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister for International Co-operation.
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to support Bill C-54, an act to amend 
the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act at third reading. This bill 
is timely and greatly needed.
<P>
	The Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act, FEMA, was passed 
in February 1984 to block unreasonable laws or rulings of a foreign 
power from being applied in Canada. The time has come to bring it 
up to date to ensure that it remains a credible act. I am pleased that 
both opposition parties are supporting this legislation and will 
ensure its speedy passage.
<P>
	Bill C-54 and the amendments put forward will better prepare 
Canada to block countries in applying unacceptable laws and 
rulings in Canada. In the case of the Helms-Burton act, the United 
States has overstepped legal boundaries and has violated the 
purposes and principles of the United Nations charter. 
Furthermore, the act infringes on the sovereignty of Canada and 
that of other friendly trading nations.
<P>
	Our Canadian foreign policy and trade relationships are 
determined here in Canada and not in the United States. The United 
States has every right to determine its own trade policy with Cuba. 
It is unfair of the American government to impose its policies and 
laws on us.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5305"> 5305 </A></B>
<P>
	Overall, our relationship with the United States has been 
positive. As the Canadian chairman of the permanent joint board 
on defence, I know of the kinds of close working relationships 
our two countries have in defence matters and North American 
security. The United States has shown time and time again that 
it works well with its partners. Our trade relationship with our 
neighbour is a strong one.
<P>
	However, we must assert ourselves in this instance. 
Helms-Burton creates a dangerous precedent for future trading 
relations. The Prime Minister of Canada is absolutely right when 
he says friends are friends and business is business. However, the 
Helms-Burton bill is no way of doing business or no way to treat 
your friends.
<P>
	We live in a global economy where countries are interacting 
more now than ever. In the case of Canada and Cuba there has been 
an unbroken official relationship since 1945. Canada and Cuba 
have maintained good relations in many key areas including 
fisheries where Cuba has supported the Canadian view on the need 
for measures to end high seas overfishing of straddling and high 
migratory fish stocks.
<P>
	Good relations have also been maintained in the areas of 
agriculture, natural resources development and tourism; over 
120,000 Canadians visit Cuba each year. In my former role as 
parliamentary secretary I had the pleasure to open an additional 
honorary councillor office to serve Canadian tourists there. This 
was in addition to the services we provide through our embassy in 
Havana.
<P>
	Last year Canada exported goods worth over $274 million to 
Cuba comprising mainly of agri-foods and manufactured goods. In 
return, Canada imported close to $321 million worth of products 
from Cuba, mostly sugar and nickel.
<P>
	In October 1994, I had the privilege to visit Cuba in an official 
capacity to attend the Havana International Fair. I met with 
representatives of 24 different Canadian companies which were 
doing business with Cuba. These companies included Sherritt 
Incorporated of Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta; Romet Limited of 
Mississauga, Ontario; J.D. Irving of St. John, New Brunswick; 
Galax Incorporated of Montreal, Quebec; United Tire and Rubber 
Company Limited of Rexdale, Ontario.
<P>
	I saw firsthand the many advantages that resulted from Canada's 
relationship with Cuba. I am also in full agreement with the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs when he said that Canada shares the 
U.S. objectives of improving human rights standards and moving 
to a more representative government in Cuba.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	Canada and the United States have differed significantly in the 
approaches we have taken toward these very important goals. 
Whereas the United States implements a policy of isolating Cuba, 
Canada encourages a policy of dialogue and engagement.
<P>
	Canada has taken a number of measures to promote democratic 
reforms in Cuba which have created real results. Canada has been 
developing a technical assistance program to help modernize 
Cuban economic institutions. Through the partnership program the 
Canadian International Development Agency has provided funding 
to Canadian non-governmental organizations working with 
grassroots partners in Cuba.
<P>
	A policy of openness, dialogue and interaction is an effective 
way of assisting Cuba to become a pluralistic society. It is obvious 
that the Helms-Burton legislation does nothing to advance sound 
policy in the short and long term.
<P>
	On a more positive note, in July of this year President Clinton 
suspended the right of U.S. companies to file law suits under the 
act for six months. While this is a positive move forward, it still 
leaves the threat of future law suits unresolved.
<P>
	Unfortunately some Canadians have already been informed that 
they are no longer welcome on U.S. soil. It is completely 
incomprehensible to me that any person, individual or company, as 
well as the spouse and all dependants of such a person doing 
business in Cuba would be excluded from the great United States.
<P>
	Canadian companies need tools to defend themselves, and Bill 
C-54 will strengthen FEMA by giving Canadians recourse to 
Canadian courts to recover any amounts awarded under foreign 
rulings, along with their court costs in Canada and the foreign 
country, a measure known as a clawback.
<P>
	The attorney general will be able to block any attempt by a 
foreign claimant to enforce a judgment under any objectionable 
foreign law such as Helms-Burton.
<P>
	Hopefully these changes to FEMA will deter U.S. firms from 
taking action against Canadians. Canadian companies sued in the 
United States will have the right to initiate counter-suits against 
interests of the U.S. firms here.
<P>
	In conclusion, the object of Bill C-54 and the amendments is 
very clear. It is to enforce the sovereignty of Canada.
<P>
	The Helms-Burton Act draws third countries into a bilateral 
political squabble between the United States and Cuba. That is not 
right and sets a dangerous precedent.
<P>
	Strong opposition from the European Union and Latin American 
countries suggests that Canada has powerful and ready made allies.
<P>
	The bill and the amendments reinforce the position that Canada 
has every right to pursue trade and other commercial links with 
Central American and Caribbean countries and to strengthen its 
own diplomatic, trade and development co-operation relations with 
Cuba.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5306"> 5306 </A></B>
<P>
	Again I thank the opposition parties and all members who saw 
the importance of this legislation for their co-operation in ensuring 
it receives speedy passage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Cooperation, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too rise in 
support of Bill C-54, an act to amend the Foreign Extraterritorial 
Measures Act. I do so by asking about the logic of the American 
bill which inspired this response, the Helms-Burton Act.
<P>
	The logic is simply this. The principle underlying it, if it is fully 
implemented, is that a nation may and should provide means for its 
citizens who have had property in a foreign state confiscated to sue 
those who are presently enjoying the property for compensation, 
even those who are not nationals of the confiscating nation, and to 
sanction those people by denying them entry to the United States.
<P>
	I have often asked myself what would happen if we applied this 
new standard of international morality to other revolutions, present 
and past. What would happen if we applied this new high standard 
of international morality to American history, to that great 
revolution which created the United States, the American 
Revolution of 1776? Would we not in fact have a complete 
parallel?
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	From 1776 to 1783 the property of well over 100,000 Americans 
who were in disagreement with a revolution, who upheld the 
principles of ordered government and who upheld the principles of 
private property, were deprived by revolutionary courts in the 
American states of their civil rights and of their property. Many of 
them, like the Cubans after 1959, fled from the United States to 
Canada, to Britain and to the West Indies, being like many of those 
Cubans who went to the United States after the Cuban revolution, 
without their property.
<P>
	Unlike the current situation however, in 1783, at the conclusion 
of the war between Great Britain and what was to become the 
United States, there was a treaty of peace signed in Paris in 
September of that year. Article V of that peace treaty had the 
Americans agreeing to the restitution of all the estates, rights and 
properties which had been confiscated. Unlike the Cubans, the 
Americans promised to give back confiscated territory and 
property but they did not do so.
<P>
	If we were to apply the logic of Helms-Burton to the American 
revolution, we would find that the Americans have completely 
neglected their own principles. What they did was they ignored the 
treaty. The Cubans never signed a treaty promising to do anything. 
The Americans actually signed a treaty. The issue simply was never 
resolved.
<P>
	The Americans went their merry way without compensating 
those 100,000 people who fled: 40,000 to Canada, now three 
million of us who are their  descendants with legal, rightful and 
unsatisfied claims for confiscated property; another 40,000 to the 
United Kingdom; and 20,000 to the West Indies. Some of us are 
asking if what is good for the goose is good for the gander. Is it 
possible that we could apply the Helms-Burton principle to an 
earlier revolution, admittedly a little earlier than 1959? We are 
going back to 1776. What would happen?
<P>
	In support of this bill, I would like to say that a couple of us are 
going to be bringing forward a private member's bill. It will be 
known in response to Helms-Burton as the Godfrey-Milliken bill, 
which will mimic in every detail the Helms-Burton bill. I have to 
declare here that as a loyalist descendant I have a lively interest in a 
certain property in Virginia. My colleague, the member for 
Kingston and the Islands, has quite a lot of territory coming to him 
in New York's Mohawk Valley.
<P>
	The principle of our bill is going to be very simple: it is just and 
equitable that Canadians who are heirs to loyalists whose property 
was confiscated, stolen or destroyed by the American 
revolutionaries should be afforded the same assistance as is 
provided by the United States government to its citizens who have 
had property in Cuba confiscated by the revolutionary government 
there, in our bill we are going to apply exactly the same sanctions.
<P>
	We are going to establish a list of claims, which I have already 
started to do so on my Internet site. If I may be allowed to 
advertise, www.johngodfrey.org is where those of loyalist descent 
can get in touch with us. We can register the claims and make sure 
that we hot link them to Senator Helms and Congressman Burton 
just so they can keep a running tally of how much their folly is 
costing them.
<P>
	We will say that any person who has a reasonable claim to an 
interest in a confiscated property may bring an action in the Federal 
Court of Canada and that the court may determine whether the 
claim is valid. If it is valid, the court will order that the property be 
restored to the people who are descended from those loyalists and 
that compensation be paid either directly, or damages of three 
times the value. Sounds familiar. We may also bar from entry into 
Canada those persons who head up institutions which are 
trafficking in our property, whether that person is the head of an 
agency, a department of government or a municipality, a 
corporation, or is a shareholder or an individual, and indeed their 
spouse and dependants.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	I admit there may be some practical difficulties with the 
application of the Godfrey-Milliken bill should it ever receive the 
approval of the House. One person who has been in touch with us 
informed us that 700 acres of downtown Washington belonged to 
her family. That would mean the chief executive officer presiding 
over a  great deal of that real estate, the President of the United 
States, would be barred from entering Canada. Should he still be in 
place after November, his daughter and rather charming wife would 
be barred from entering Canada, just as the heads of Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5307"> 5307 </A></B>
<P>
companies are currently barred from entering the United States. I 
admit it is tough but fair.
<P>
	In conclusion, the importance of supporting this bill is to realize 
it can be but the first step of an ever graduated series of responses 
to American provocation. We have powerful cannons-and I like to 
think of the powerful cannons of Fort York in Toronto-behind us 
to give a stronger riposte should they fail to heed our logic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it appears by the member's speech and his reference to 
early American history that he strongly supports property rights. If 
he were really serious about this, he would do something 
meaningful in that regard and would urge his government to 
support strengthening property rights in Canada, but that has not 
occurred. Federally the legislation in that regard needs to be 
changed.
<P>
	Why does his government not support the strengthening of 
property rights in Canada, rather than this approach which makes a 
mockery of the Canadian Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godfrey:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course it is a point of view as to 
whether this approach actually makes a mockery or draws attention 
to the illogicality of the act. I guess that is up for debate and 
discussion.
<P>
	I would say this about property rights. As the member may have 
possibly heard over the past few question periods, the government 
believes in the rule of law. It is the rule of law and the rule of 
contracts which govern relations between people and relations 
concerning property.
<P>
	This particular bit of law we are talking about today, Bill C-54, 
simply reaffirms a principle of international law. That is what has 
been violated. The notion that one country unilaterally can impose 
its standard on the rest of the world without consultation, without 
agreement, without consensus, is unacceptable to any sovereign 
country. It is particularly the case of this sovereign country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the parliamentary secretary, the member of 
Parliament for Don Valley West, and the former parliamentary 
secretary, the MP for Parkdale-High Park.
<P>
	I suppose the Reform Party does not really understand exactly 
what the hon. member was talking about. I wanted to point out that 
the hon. member for Don Valley West was referring to the great 
business relationships that many Canadians have with Cuba.
<P>
	I want to put on the record that when Canada was trying to 
manage its ocean resources through the United Nations, an 
organization called the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization 
was
<P>
formed. It was Cuba that joined with Canada. Cuba joined and the 
United States refused.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Canada had a crisis in its fishery on the nose and tail of the 
Grand Banks, which we all know about. An organization was 
formed made up of Japan, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the 
European Community, every nation, but the United States refused 
to participate.
<P>
	Cuba joined when Canada wanted to meet its responsibilities for 
conservation and each one of these times business relationships 
were struck up. When Canada wanted the scientific information 
from the oceans, the United States of America refused. Cuba is the 
only country on this side of the Atlantic where we have observers 
aboard all of its vessels. Just imagine, in international waters. Cuba 
volunteered and said it would put up the money for that scientific 
evaluation. The list goes on.
<P>
	With the United Nations today there is a requirement that 
Canada must form an organization of all of the nations which 
exploit the ocean resources off the east coast of Canada in order to 
manage the resource. There are meetings every year in Halifax, 
Nova Scotia. What happened? The United States refused to belong. 
Cuba said yes and sends its representatives.
<P>
	That is what the hon. member is talking about. It is all of these 
relationships that have been built up between companies, 
businesses and the scientific community. All of a sudden in my 
riding Cubana lands at Gander airport. Everybody who has 
developed a relationship with Cuba-which the Reform Party does 
not understand anything about-is now under the gun under the 
Helms-Burton legislation. That is what the hon. member is talking 
about. Perhaps he could further refer to his opinions regarding this 
matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godfrey:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is not only praising 
me but he is also a mind reader. I had no idea I was saying so much. 
Sometimes the subconscious speaks more powerfully than one 
knows. It is nice to know that what one says has such resonance as 
to afford this kind of interpretation.
<P>
	I would simply add this final thought. If we are to break the 
logjam with Cuba, and let us face it, it is not a regime that anyone 
here particularly approves of, but it is precisely the spirit of 
confrontation which is being perpetuated by the Helms-Burton bill 
which perpetuates the Cuban regime. It is a symbiotic relationship 
between the president of Cuba, Mr. Castro, and Senator Helms. 
They each need each other to perpetuate their own bogey people.
<P>
	If we can intervene and bring Cuba back under the rule of law, as 
my colleague has pointed out has already occurred so effectively in 
the fisheries, then we will have done a great service for ourselves, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5308"> 5308 </A></B>
<P>
for Cuba, for the western hemisphere and particularly for the 
United States.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-54, an act to amend the 
Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act.
<P>
	It is wise to look at from where the Helms-Burton bill comes and 
why the bill actually came about in the United States. It is driven by 
the Cuban ex-patriot community there.
<P>
	I do not think many people understand the power the Cuban 
ex-patriot community has in the United States. This is not a benign 
group. They are trying to forge and foist their ideas on American 
foreign policy and have successfully done so in the Helms-Burton 
bill. They seek redress of moneys and properties they feel were 
taken from them when they left Cuba. They will go to any lengths 
to do this. On speaking to congressmen and senators in the United 
States, they will go to the extent of threatening congressmen and 
senators to do this.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Their sphere of influence, not surprisingly, does not only exist 
within Florida and southeastern United States, but much to my 
surprise goes all the way up the east coast and toward California. 
Their power is extensive and they exert political and economic 
power on American foreign policy. The reason why the 
Helms-Burton bill was passed is because it is an election year. The 
congressmen and the senators who are running this year have had 
pressure put on them by the small but powerful group of ex-patriot 
Cubans.
<P>
	It is no wonder, and much to the credit of Canada, that we have 
stood up to this heinous bill that says to other countries that your 
friends must be our friends, your foes must be our foes and our 
foreign policy must be your foreign policy and if you choose not to 
do that, our laws will become your laws.
<P>
	It is much to the credit of Canada that we have stood steadfast 
against this gross and inexcusable action by a country that seeks to 
throw its weight around in the international sphere. Sometimes 
they do it in a beneficial way, but in this case they are doing it in the 
most deplorable way to a country that we have always thought to be 
their friend and ally.
<P>
	It is not only affecting Canada. It affects all the countries in the 
world. That is why I applaud the minister for taking up the 
initiative through NAFTA. I hope he will take it up through the 
World Trade Organization. I know he has taken up with the 
European Union. I hope he takes it up also with the Organization of 
American States.
<P>
	Collectively, these are initiatives that can send a very clear 
message to America that says: ``You cannot engage in this kind of 
behaviour in the international sphere. While you are one of two 
superpowers in the world, you too have to abide by the laws that 
govern the world, you too have to abide by the rules-based laws 
that we have in international trade and you are not big enough to be 
brought down by the countries in the world''.
<P>
	Collectively, these laws were set up for our collective benefit. 
For those out there who oppose free trade, this is a perfect example 
of how a country, one-tenth the size of America, can take a 
leadership role to make this large bear below us heel to the rules 
that govern all of us in international trade and international 
security.
<P>
	I would also like to applaud Canada for the role it has taken in 
Cuba. We have ignored threats from the United States in the past 
and we have engaged with Cuba in co-operative bilateral trade.
<P>
	This is very important. The Americans I think fail to see the 
importance of this. If they choose to ignore co-operative bilateral 
agreements, trade, initiative, social interactions and discourse with 
Cuba, then they seek to have another Haiti in our midst. We all 
know the penalty that we collectively pay for having the tragic 
situation, which is what we found in Haiti, in our midst. The 
western world, North America, the Caribbean and Central America 
do not need another Haiti.
<P>
	Cuba is at a very sensitive time in its history. I am very pleased 
that Canada has taken it on itself to take a leadership role in 
building bridges of understanding and co-operative trade to benefit 
the people of Cuba.
<P>
	The people of Cuba will not forget the effort that Canadians have 
made for their well-being. Anyone who has travelled to Cuba 
understands very clearly the terrible state of affairs that Cubans are 
in right now.
<P>
	There is a great opportunity for the expertise that we have within 
Canada to provide for bilateral trade, bilateral aid and bilateral 
initiatives that will help the Cuban people stand on their own two 
feet and develop a solid economic base on which peace is 
predicated.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	American foreign policy seeks to damage the Cuban economy 
and the Cuban people. A power vacuum will be left when Mr. 
Castro dies. What can happen under those circumstances, as we 
have seen in many other parts of the world, are tragic situations of 
conflict. This is another example of how Canada has taken the 
initiative in a very proactive way in trying to defuse a potential 
down the road situation where conflict can arise as we have seen in 
Haiti.
<P>
	This shows a role that Canada can take in the international 
sphere in the future, an area in which there is a void. In the 21st 
century power is going to come from  three sources. The first two 
are traditional, economic power and military power. The third is an 
area that no country in the world is looking at but one which I think 
that Canada and a handful countries can capitalize on, the area of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5309"> 5309 </A></B>
<P>
being the organizer. Canada could be that middle power which 
organizes the multinational initiatives. Reorganization of 
multinational initiatives is going to be required to address the very 
important geopolitical security and environmental threats that face 
all of the nations of the world.
<P>
	Not a lot of countries can do that, certainly not the United States 
of America. I do not believe it could be any country that is a 
member of the Security Council right now. I suggest to the minister 
that Canada ought to work with his counterpart the Minister for 
Foreign Affairs and the six to eight middle powers that have 
managed to retain a sense of neutrality, respect and skill in 
international diplomatic endeavours.
<P>
	Let us not forget that as a nation we have repeatedly done this in 
a superb way throughout the world. In numerous conflicts, 
Canadians through the diplomatic corps, through diplomatic 
initiatives, through intelligent foreign policy, have managed to 
save millions of lives and billions of dollars of economic 
destitution that would have occurred had these conflict not been 
either prevented or ameliorated.
<P>
	That is something of which Canadians from coast to coast ought 
to be proud. It is not only the diplomatic corps, but it is also our 
military in the peacekeeping forces that have put their lives on the 
line for the sake of peace and prosperity for the international 
community.
<P>
	This is a role that Canada can take. It can take a leadership role 
with other countries to exert pressure on the other powerful 
nations, such as the Security Council members, to truly prevent 
conflict rather than the current foreign policy that exists in the 
world which deals with managing conflict.
<P>
	I may digress for a moment on this important area. Historically 
we call conflict management conflict prevention. That is a big 
failing because the precursors to conflict are there years before a 
real conflict takes place. If those precursors had been identified and 
addressed, many of the tragedies of the late 20th century could 
have been avoided.
<P>
	The most prominent of these is the former Yugoslavia. Perhaps 
Burundi and Rwanda could not have been prevented but certainly 
the tragedies that we saw there could have been ameliorated if 
initiatives had been put forward earlier. It includes identifying the 
precursors that are taking place and ameliorating them.
<P>
	Canada has taken a role in that but our foreign policy is still 
focused on conflict management. Hence, the rapid reaction force, 
hence peacekeeping. Once we have to employ rapid reaction forces 
or peacekeeping it is too  late. The seeds of ethnic discontent have 
already been planted for this and future conflicts and it is too late.
<P>
	It is very sad because most of the time in these tragedies it is not 
the soldiers that are killed. Ninety per cent of the casualties 
occurring in conflicts in the 20th century are civilians. They did not 
ask for it, they do not want it. All they want to do is live in peace. 
Often because of the megalomaniac desires of a small cadre of 
individuals who choose to exert power, not for the benefit of peace 
but for the benefit of a small group of people who have absolutely 
no qualms whatsoever about killing their own civilians, many 
thousands if not millions of people will suffer.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	That is where Canada can play a role. We should not be sending 
our peacekeepers hither and thither. Certainly the collective 
community can take forceful initiatives to prevent conflict from 
taking place.
<P>
	Canada could take measures through the international financial 
institutions. Non-military, economic levers could be applied to 
individuals who choose to abrogate their responsibilities to a nation 
and to a people and who engage in behaviour which flies in the face 
of international security.
<P>
	Collectively we have sat on our hands and done nothing about it. 
That has cost the lives of our peacekeepers. Money has been spent 
by our defence department. Billions of dollars of reconstruction 
funds have been spent in our aid budgets. This money need not 
have been spent.
<P>
	One could argue that we should get involved early on the basis of 
humanitarian grounds. However, there is also a very pragmatic 
reason for getting involved early and that is cold, hard economics.
<P>
	Canadians want to know why we are getting involved in conflicts 
on the other side of the world. There are economic reasons. As 
well, many people who live in areas of conflict migrate to our 
shores. It is not that these true refugees are not welcome in Canada, 
but the fact remains that they would rather live in their own country 
in peace and security.
<P>
	I encourage our ministers to work together with ministers from 
other middle powers, such as New Zealand, Australia, Denmark, 
Norway and Sweden. The foreign ministers of these nations should 
get together to develop co-operative initiatives to deal with conflict 
prevention, rather than conflict management.
<P>
	Furthermore, I would strongly suggest to the minister that 
initiatives be taken through international financial institutions, 
such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as 
well as the United Nations.
<P>
	I have no delusions that these are very great tasks. I have no 
delusions that we will accomplish all we set out  to do. However, 
we must try. The geopolitical threats and the environmental threats 
of the future cannot be confronted by one nation alone. They must 
be confronted by all nations of the world. Those are the cold, hard 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5310"> 5310 </A></B>
<P>
facts. One nation cannot deal with these problems. There must be a 
collective effort in addressing them.
<P>
	We must look at this not only on the basis of humanitarian 
grounds, but also on the very pragmatic basis of economics, on the 
basis of saving our aid and on the basis of saving our military 
personnel. By doing this we will achieve savings in those areas.
<P>
	I strongly support the bill. It shows excellent initiative on the 
part of Canada. I hope it will be one of many initiatives which 
Canada will take in a leadership role in the international 
community. Interestingly enough, the outcome of the bill could be 
that Canada will have a much stronger reputation in the 
international community. That would increase our moral suasive 
power and our diplomatic powers. Again, that need not cost money. 
Perhaps we can use our diplomatic corps, very keen, intelligent and 
eloquent individuals with an enormous amount of experience. We 
might be able to use them more effectively in the initiatives I 
mentioned before.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	I know members from the Reform Party and I am sure the Bloc 
Quebecois would be very happy to work with the government in 
trying to engage in initiatives that will benefit our collective 
society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca 
for the very interesting speech he made, which had both an 
historical and an international aspect to it.
<P>
	I was a bit amazed to hear him applaud the statements made by 
the Minister of International Trade and say that Canada is big, 
beautiful, strong, nice, fast, etc. He must have used a dictionary of 
synonyms to come up with all these nice qualities for the Minister 
of International Trade and the government. By the way, the 
minister is indeed very nice, but the comments made by the Reform 
member do need to be toned down a bit.
<P>
	If the American bill was so disgusting and so totally 
unacceptable to Canada, as the hon. member put it, can he tell us 
why the Canadian government waited seven months before 
introducing Bill C-54? That is how long it took.
<P>
	So, my first question concerns the delay. Is the hon. member 
pleased with the ``speedy'' intervention of the government, with 
this seven months delay, since the U.S. government introduced the 
Helms-Burton law back in March?
<P>
	I also have a second question for my Reform colleague. He also 
praised the government for following in the wake of the European 
Union, instead of using the power it was granted on July 29, as I 
said earlier, and showing some leadership by appealing to a panel 
under NAFTA. Why is my Reform colleague so glad to see the 
Canadian government following in the wake of the European Union 
now, in October, when the government could have challenged the 
U.S. bill back in July through a NAFTA panel?
<P>
	So, the two questions I have are very simple. First, why is the 
hon. member so glad that it took seven months? Second, why is he 
so glad that we are following in the tracks of the European Union?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the Bloc Quebecois member for his question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
answer the hon. member's question, I would clearly agree with the 
hon. member that it took far too long for this to come to the House. 
I would also agree with him and my colleague, the Reform critic 
for international trade, that this issue should have gone to a NAFTA 
panel immediately. It is unfortunate that the government chose not 
to do that.
<P>
	I hope that in the future the minister will know that he can 
receive co-operation from this side of the House in bringing these 
initiatives much more quickly through a NAFTA panel or the 
WTO. If this does come up in the future, I hope he will take this 
initiative.
<P>
	Very soon after these initiatives take place, I am sure our Reform 
critic for international trade will be very happy to give his expert 
opinion on constructive ways we can resolve these very 
complicated issues in international trade.
<P>
	As an aside, I hope that in dealing with the Canada-Israeli free 
trade agreement the minister is also going to take note of the 
impact on the Palestinian people. If he chooses to ignore this he is 
going to do damage to a key linchpin on helping to resolve some of 
the major issues in the current Middle East crisis.
<P>
	Therefore I would strongly advise him to take heed and pay 
attention to acting co-operatively with the Palestinian people to 
ensure that the Canada-Israeli free trade agreement is going to deal 
with co-operative initiatives to improve the tragic and terrible 
economic situation that we see on the West Bank and Gaza strip.

TRADE AGREEMENT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-61, an act to implement the Canada-Israel 
free trade agreement, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to commence the debate on 
second reading for the bill with respect to Canada-Israel free trade.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This historical agreement is both significant and symbolic. 
Significant because it marks the first free trade agreement Canada 
has signed with a partner outside this hemisphere and symbolic 
because it stands as further evidence of Canada's commitment to 
freer trade around the globe.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It sends a very clear message. Canada is ready, willing and able 
to trade with the world. With this agreement we will stand on the 
same footing as the European Union and the United States, both of 
which have already signed free trade agreements with Israel.
<P>
	For the first time we will have direct access to the Israeli market 
without having to funnel our trade through the United States or any 
other country.
<P>
	The globalization of markets is one of the great waves of history 
and it is one Canada cannot afford to and does not intend to watch 
from the shores.
<P>
	In today's ever changing world no nation, however rich or 
powerful, can long remain isolated form the great economic 
currents of this day. Markets are opening up, barriers are falling 
down and free movement of goods, services and ideas is becoming 
simply unstoppable.
<P>
	Today Canadian companies quite rightly see the world as their 
marketplace, and the opportunities are boundless. We are 
vigorously and we are successfully winning new markets and 
opening new doors.
<P>
	As a result, our balance of trade with the nations of the world has 
tipped dramatically in Canada's favour to a record merchandise 
record surplus in 1995 of over $28 billion.
<P>
	Part of the success we have realized to date has been the 
co-operative approach taken by this government since coming to 
office. New partnerships have been created in every province to 
provide better export services to Canadian businesses with 
particular emphasis on dynamic small and medium size 
enterprises.
<P>
	We have also benefited from the Team Canada trade missions 
abroad which joined federal and provincial governments with the 
private sector to present a united and common front in searching 
out new opportunities for Canadian companies.
<P>
	To date the Team Canada trade missions have produced some 
$20 billion in contracts for Canadian companies signed at the time 
of the trade missions and signed by companies which will be hiring 
more people here in Canada to fill those contracts as well as to 
develop new ones. It is estimated that for every billion dollars in 
new trade 11,000 jobs are either maintained or created as a result.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	All of these activities I believe reflect the fundamental change 
on how Canadians view freer trade. We have come to realize that 
there is far more to be gained from globalization than to fear from 
it. We have come to realize that freer trade is the key to expanding 
Canada's and the world's economy. More to the point, it creates, it 
sustains jobs, lots of jobs.
<P>
	Looking at exports alone, one in three jobs in this country 
depends on export trade. Trade accounts for some 37 per cent of 
our gross domestic product, more than one-third of our economy. 
Quite simply, trade with the world has become the economic 
engine of this country.
<P>
	The choice before us is clear. We can expand and diversify our 
trade or we can stagnate and condemn ourselves and our children to 
leading lesser lives in a lesser land.
<P>
	This government is not prepared to let that happen. We are not 
prepared to sit back and watch the jobs, the growth and the 
opportunities pass to other nations. We are determined to put 
Canada in a position where it can realize its potential and not only 
sustain but enhance our standard of living.
<P>
	To do that we must constantly seek out new partners and new 
markets. With a relatively small domestic market we must look 
beyond our borders if we are going to maintain that standard of 
living. We must give our businesses the access they need to the 
most dynamic and robust economies in the world.
<P>
	That is why we signed the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, NAFTA, and why we are working to have Chile join 
that pact. That is why we are working diligently to help create a 
free trade area of the Americas. That is why we are such strong 
supporters of the World Trade Organization in its efforts to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5312"> 5312 </A></B>
<P>
liberalize trade throughout the world. That is why we are involved 
in the Asia-Pacific economic co-operation forum, known as APEC. 
That is why we have signed a free trade agreement with Israel.
<P>
	This agreement is a perfect complement to our efforts at trade 
expansion. Since November 1993 Canadians have created, as my 
colleague the Minister of Finance has said on many occasions, over 
600,000 new jobs. Canada is projected to have the highest 
employment growth of all the G-7 nations in 1996 and again in 
1997. The lesson is clear. Given the access to world markets 
Canadians will create jobs and they will produce prosperity.
<P>
	International trade is a subject involving large numbers, billions 
of dollars in trade and millions of jobs created. Sometimes amid all 
of those strings of zeros we lose sight of the fact that behind the big 
numbers are people, individual Canadians, men and women 
granted the dignity of holding a job; men and women beginning to 
plan for the future and building a better life for themselves and for 
their children; men and women who pay taxes and contribute to the 
economic health of their communities and to our country.
<P>
	Recognizing this, our government has set the goal of doubling 
the number of Canadian companies actively exporting by the year 
2000. We believe that this is the best way to encourage economic 
growth and create jobs.
<P>
	The free trade agreement with Israel represents another step 
toward our goal of freer trade worldwide. It is clear proof that 
Canada is prepared to match our rhetoric on free trade with 
concrete actions.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	Why Israel? Israel and Canada have long enjoyed close relations. 
Our relationship is rooted in common values and shared democratic 
beliefs: the belief in freedom and the dignity of the individual. Our 
relationship has been grounded in common hopes, hopes for peace 
and prosperity. With this free trade agreement we move toward 
cementing those ties and realizing the economic potential of our 
relationship.
<P>
	It was in November 1994 that the late Prime Minister of Israel, 
Yitzhak Rabin, and our Prime Minister began the process that has 
led to this historic agreement. It was in Toronto just a few months 
ago that I had the privilege of signing a final agreement with Natan 
Sharansky, the Israeli minister for industry and trade.
<P>
	If I might be permitted a personal word, it was a great honour to 
meet Mr. Sharansky whom I had read a great deal about. I followed 
his courageous crusade for human rights in the former Soviet 
Union back in the seventies and early eighties. It was wonderful to 
meet him personally and to discuss a wide range of issues.
<P>
	One of his most remarkable qualities is the ability to persevere 
and to transcend. For many years he was  deprived of his liberty, 
but he never abandoned his principles. Throughout the darkest days 
of Soviet oppression he remained one of freedom's torchbearers.
<P>
	With the signing of the agreement in July, both countries 
undertook to introduce enabling legislation into their respective 
parliaments. That is why we have introduced this bill. If the 
implementation process is completed on both sides by the end of 
this year, the agreement will come into effect on January 1, 1997.
<P>
	Before turning to some of the main features of the agreement, let 
me state clearly something important. While the agreement is 
between Canada and the Government of Israel, we intend to extend 
the same benefits to the Palestinians. We will be meeting with 
Palestinian officials to examine the best ways to go about this.
<P>
	Canada has always been firmly committed to the Middle East 
peace process. The relationship between peace and freer trade is 
clear. At its best free trade acts as a system of rules for peaceful 
economic relations. It will help to bring additional economic 
development which will help to bring stability to the region for the 
people of Israel and for the people under the jurisdiction of the 
Palestinian authority in Gaza and the West Bank.
<P>
	The late former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin once said that 
peace requires a world of new concepts. One of the most important 
new concepts shaping our world today is freer trade between 
nations.
<P>
	While recent developments in the Middle East have been a 
source of concern to all of us, they should not blind us to the 
progress to date, nor discourage us from the long term goals. We 
should be encouraged by the pledges recently made by both 
Chairman Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to renounce 
violence and continue negotiations toward peace. Those 
commitments are a clear indication that both sides have an 
appreciation for the stakes involved as well as an understanding of 
the simple truth that far more can be achieved by dialogue than by 
violence.
<P>
	We must recognize that the peace process has already brought 
concrete benefits to Israel. A large number of capital projects in the 
areas of transportation, energy and communications are being 
considered by Israel and her neighbours, a development which 
would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. Canada supports 
these constructive alliances and wants to be a full and active player 
in the future economic development of this region.
<P>
	This agreement is also important to Canada because of the nature 
of the Israeli economy. With a thriving private sector, an educated 
workforce, modern banking systems, an important stock exchange 
and an excellent communications system, Israel is one of the 
fastest growing economies in that region.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5313"> 5313 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	The new Israeli government's far reaching economic program is 
aimed at lowering taxes, reducing government spending, cutting 
red tape and reforming restrictive labour practices. As a result, 
residential construction is booming and foreign investment is 
growing. In fact, Israel has become something of a magnet for 
foreign investment which is supplying the capital Israel needs to 
grow and prosper.
<P>
	Israel has also been busy expanding its trade ties. It has signed 
free trade agreements with Turkey, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
as well with as I mentioned before, the European Union and the 
United States.
<P>
	Complementing Israel's economic reforms are its growing 
political relations. At the end of 1995 Israel had re-established 
relations with more than 40 countries that had broken ties in the 
1960s and 1970s.
<P>
	All of this is a welcome development and stands as further 
evidence of a new Middle East, a Middle East which is dynamic 
and outward looking, embracing change and expanding 
opportunities. It is a Middle East which will not allow its past to 
limit its future. It is in this Middle East that Israel is poised to 
become an economic power. It is therefore an opportune time for 
Canada to strengthen its presence in the growing market through 
the Canada-Israel free trade agreement.
<P>
	Trade between our two countries is modest, but it is growing. 
Two-way trade last year is up 37 per cent, to stand at $450 million. 
Our exports stood at $216 million in 1995, up 49 per cent from the 
previous year. I am confident that with the implementation of this 
agreement those figures will grow dramatically.
<P>
	In fact, even before this agreement was signed, companies in 
both countries began to retool and adjust their business plans. Air 
Canada's service to Israel is helping to speed the passage of 
business, goods and people between our nations.
<P>
	When we talk about visits, in 1995 more than 68,000 Israelis 
came to Canada as tourists. If this trend continues, as I understand 
it is, we will probably welcome more than 100,000 Israeli tourists 
this year.
<P>
	With the signing of this agreement, the pent-up demand, the 
close ties and the vast potential can all begin to be realized. 
Canadian and Israeli companies will have duty free access to each 
other's markets for industrial goods. They will benefit from the 
reduction or elimination of tariffs on agricultural products.
<P>
	Many Canadian companies, some well known such as 
Bombardier and Newbridge, and some not so well known such as 
Claridge Israel, Global Upholstery, Reikh International, Signatel 
and Telespace, are on the ground already exploring new 
partnerships and bidding on new infrastructure projects. These 
firms are spearheading an increase in exports and imports between 
our countries.  They are boosting investment and encouraging 
innovation through research and development and joint ventures. 
All of their efforts and those of others will be made much easier by 
the agreement we are considering here today.
<P>
	While Israel as a whole represents a healthy and expanding 
market for Canadian goods and services, there are some sectors 
that offer particularly strong potential for Canadian companies. 
These include advanced electronics and communications systems, 
power and energy projects, oil and gas exploration, as well as 
agri-food products and environmental technology. All of these are 
areas where Canada enjoys world class expertise, and all of these 
are areas of opportunity in Israel.
<P>
	This agreement provides access to the Israeli market. We realize 
that access is only half the battle. Companies must be made aware 
of the opportunities that await them. Canadian companies in the 
private sector wanting to expand into Israel will have a great deal 
of support. The Canadian embassy in Israel is working hard at this 
moment to line up potential partners and to match up Canadian 
goods and services with Israeli buyers.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	Another important vehicle which our companies can use is the 
Canada-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation. 
Established in 1993 to promote industrial co-operation, it has 
played a key role in matching Canadian firms with ones in Israel. 
To date the foundation has approved some 11 co-operative projects 
worth over $9 million in collaborative research and development 
efforts. The foundation also provides repayable grants for 
promising joint ventures.
<P>
	I am pleased to note this has been so successful that the 
Government of Alberta and the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency, ACOA, have signed agreements to co-operate and work 
with the foundation. A similar agreement is in the works for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development in Quebec, FORD-Q. The 
involvement of these governments and agencies is very 
encouraging because it means a much broader market will be able 
to tap into the benefits of the foundation. This in turn will lead to 
more partnerships and more opportunities.
<P>
	In addition, another agency of the government, the Export 
Development Corporation, EDC, offers four lines of credit for 
buyer credit financing in Israel. Canadian companies looking for 
financial or risk management services will find a ready source in 
the EDC.
<P>
	So the support is there. Now that governments have played their 
parts in establishing the infrastructure for free trade, it is up to the 
private sector in both countries to step forward and realize the 
potential of this new relationship.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5314"> 5314 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me turn briefly to the substance of the agreement. I will 
not go into a great deal of detail but I will outline the main 
elements.
<P>
	First, under this agreement all tariffs will be removed from 
industrial products beginning on January 1, 1997, all industrial 
product tariffs. At Canada's request, the only exception is that 
women's swimwear, and at Israel's request, certain cotton fabric 
will continue to be subject to tariffs. Even here however the tariffs 
are scheduled to be phased out over two and one-half years.
<P>
	Second, duty free access or low duties will be applied to a 
variety of agricultural and fisheries products exported by either 
country. For Canada such exports include grains, grain products, 
beef, salmon, maple syrup, alcoholic beverages and various 
processed foods.
<P>
	Third, the agreement also provides a clear and straightforward 
rules of origin, a key component of any successful trading 
relationship. I would point out that these rules of origin are 
generally less restrictive than those under the NAFTA, reflecting 
the structure and openness of our respective economies.
<P>
	Fourth, to resolve any disputes that might arise under the 
agreement, both sides have agreed to be governed by a binding 
dispute settlement mechanism.
<P>
	It is worth emphasizing the areas that are not covered by the 
agreement. As we would expect, supply managed dairy, poultry 
and egg producers are excluded. Cultural industries are also 
exempt. So to is the auto pact. Other areas of trade such as trade in 
services and government procurement continue to be governed by 
the multilateral rules being established through the World Trade 
Organization.
<P>
	These then are some of the benefits which this agreement brings 
to Canadians. I am proud of the work our negotiators have done. I 
congratulate them. I am excited by the prospects that this 
agreement creates.
<P>
	As trade barriers collapse around the world, and indeed they are, 
the possibilities for Canada are virtually limitless.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A world of opportunities is opening up before us and we are 
determined to place Canadians in a position to benefit from them. 
This agreement is an important step toward that goal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It gives us access to a dynamic and important market. Strong 
bonds of friendship will now be complemented by stronger 
economic ties. We will be partners not only for peace but for 
progress, not only for security but for prosperity, and not only for 
survival but for enrichment.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	This agreement is not a leap of faith so much as it is a declaration 
of confidence, confidence in the ability of  Canadians to compete 
successfully anywhere in the world. To those who say the old trade 
barriers are simply being replaced by new trading blocks, this 
agreement offers eloquent proof to the contrary.
<P>
	To those who say we must diversify our trade around the world, 
this agreement offers reason for optimism. With freer trade as our 
guide and our goal, let us continue to open up a world of 
opportunities to Canadians, confident that we can compete in the 
world and win.
<P>
	Let me in closing answer a couple of questions that I have heard 
with respect to this agreement. One has to do with the process that 
has been followed. The process that has been followed has been the 
normal negotiating process that is conducted in such matters. We 
have negotiated government to government and we have done so in 
a way to consult with the industries affected.
<P>
	I indicated that in a couple of cases we are phasing out the tariffs 
over a longer period of time because of the requests of those 
specific industries. That is the kind of process we use, whether it is 
directly with the industries affected or through the sectoral 
advisory committees on international trade that advise me on these 
matters. We do so in a consultation process to come up with an 
agreement which is beneficial and supported by the private sector 
because that is what is key to making this a success.
<P>
	We have followed that usual negotiating process. We have done 
the consultation and now the details of this plan are here before us 
today.
<P>
	The other question has been why now. The why now is 
sometimes talked about in terms of the present conflict that is 
going on in Israel, in the Middle East. Unfortunately there has been 
conflict on many occasions. Canada is committed to helping 
resolve the conflict and to help bring peace, stability and prosperity 
to the Middle East.
<P>
	Let us bear in mind that one of the prime purposes of proceeding 
at this point is that Canada business is disadvantaged in its dealings 
with Israel. Our competitors in the European Union, the United 
States and a few other countries have that free trade access and 
Canadian companies do not have it at the moment. I know of 
businesses in this country that partially produce a product and send 
it to the United States for completion so that they can take 
advantage of the United States agreement on free trade. That costs 
jobs here in Canada.
<P>
	We want to end this disadvantage for Canadian companies soon. 
We have set the date of January 1, 1997 to put this agreement into 
effect so that we can end that disadvantage and create a level 
playing field for Canadian business. It is an ambitious schedule, 
one that requires co-operation, which I hope members of the House 
will give so that we can pass this in time to put it into effect at the 
first of the year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5315"> 5315 </A></B>
<P>
	There is another reason why we should do this in terms of the 
present situation in the Middle East. It is a situation that I talked 
about a few moments ago. If we are going to have peace and 
stability we also need economic development. We need 
opportunities both for the Israelis and for those who live under 
the jurisdiction of the Palestinian authority.
<P>
	This agreement, as I have pointed out, is being offered to the 
Palestinian authority to cover the people in the Gaza and West 
Bank. The sooner we put that into effect for them, the sooner job 
opportunities will help flow through and improve their economy. 
That kind of economic development is needed to help bring about 
stability in the area.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I hope we will have full debate on the matter. I hope at the end of 
the day that all members of the House will join with us in 
supporting this piece of legislation to help Canadian businesses in 
their relationship with Israel and help Canadians to go out into the 
world and compete and win, creating jobs and economic growth 
here in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first, I know that there is no question or comment period but, since 
I listened so very carefully, almost religiously, to the speech by the 
Minister of International Trade, you will still allow me to make 
some comments on his speech. Maybe he will respond to my 
comments in a future meeting with yet other comments or answers.
<P>
	What surprised me the most was that he could not praise enough 
free trade with the United States, with Asia, and with the whole 
world as he even went as far as to say. This runs somewhat contrary 
to Liberal speeches of a few years past, when the Free Trade 
Agreement was being negotiated with the United States. We are 
very happy with this about-turn by the Liberal members, who are 
now all for the superb idea of free trade put forward by what is 
probably a majority of people from Quebec. We are very happy to 
see these conversions on the part of our colleagues.
<P>
	As for job creation, I know that many questions are asked and 
that a lot of figures are given, but I have a very simple question that 
Canadians and Quebecers probably also ask themselves. According 
to the minister, for every million in revenue, thousands of jobs are 
created each time a free trade agreement is signed or Team Canada 
goes on a mission. If all these jobs have been created, how come 
the unemployment rate, which was approximately 10.5 or 11 per 
cent when they took office, is still 10.5 or 11 per cent today?
<P>
	Whatever the number of questions of Statistics Canada, the 
finance minister, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
or anyone else, if they are that  good, how is it that the 
unemployment rate remains the same? That is another question I 
ask myself.
<P>
	But there is another part of his speech that I found. And here I 
would look in the dictionary for synonyms for the qualities 
mentioned earlier by my colleague and I would apply them to that 
part of his speech.
<P>
	When he said that free trade with Israel would solve practically 
every problem, would create lots of jobs, and so on, he forgot to 
mention three relatively important aspects. First of all, political or 
economic stability did not seem to be a prerequisite for Canada to 
sign a free trade agreement with Israel. So it is possible to trade and 
to talk about job creation with a country that does not enjoy 
complete political and economic stability.
<P>
	We just have to watch television or read the international section 
in the newspapers to see that, if it is so good for Canada to sign a 
free trade deal with Israel in terms of job creation, it does not 
necessarily mean that political instability makes Quebec's 
economy unhealthy. If we apply what the minister said to the 
situation in Quebec, that statement is true.
<P>
	If the Canadian government is so happy to sign a free trade deal 
with Israel, a country that does $450 million a year in trade with 
Canada-and that is the minister's own figure-I think we can 
assume that it would be all the more happy to sign such a deal with 
a country that does $250 billion in trade with Canada. So, the 
Canadian government and the minister, who will hopefully still be 
there when the time comes, will promote job creation and free trade 
without saying a word about political or economic stability.
<P>
	We will certainly keep this part of the minister's speech in mind 
and maybe one day, during an election or a referendum campaign, 
we will be able to use it and say: ``If it was so good at $450 million, 
it certainly will not be worse at $200 billion''.
<P>
	Those were the few comments I wanted to make following the 
speech by the Minister of International Trade.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Now, I can say that we are at last very happy to be able to debate 
this bill, Bill C-61 on the free trade agreement with Israel. The day 
has finally come when we have an opportunity to speak to the free 
trade agreement between our country and Israel. I admit that it 
gives me great pleasure.
<P>
	I must, however, point out that the Bloc Quebecois deplores the 
fact that everything surrounding this agreement has been kept so 
secret until now. Later on in my speech I will substantiate this.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will vote in favour of Bill C-61, and 
enthusiastically welcomes the signing of a Canada-Israel free trade 
agreement. We hope that this agreement will increase trade with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5316"> 5316 </A></B>
<P>
Israel, and subsequently with all the other countries in the world, as 
the minister said.
<P>
	We have always been in favour of the globalization of markets 
and free trade agreements. This agreement will benefit companies 
both in Quebec and in Canada, as well as in Israel. Our businesses 
in Quebec and in Canada need access to foreign markets in order to 
develop. The signing of a free trade agreement is therefore 
welcome in the present economic situation. Furthermore, the 
Export Development Corporation, the EDC, has funds available for 
Quebec and Canadian companies wishing to do business with the 
State of Israel.
<P>
	Although the Bloc Quebecois encourages increased trade 
between Canada and the State of Israel, because we believe that it 
can contribute to the peace process and to stability in the region, we 
call on the Canadian government to ensure that the State of Israel 
respects fundamental Canadian democratic values and human 
rights.
<P>
	In addition, we call on the Liberal government to urge the Israeli 
Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to re-establish and maintain 
peace with the Palestinian people, so as to stabilize the situation in 
the Middle East.
<P>
	We suggest to the Canadian government that it not exclude the 
Palestinians from trade resulting from this agreement. Discussions 
with Palestinian representatives are therefore necessary in order to 
look at the possibility of extending the agreement to this territory.
<P>
	With a population of some six million, the State of Israel, like 
Quebec, has a democratic system of government, a flourishing 
private sector and modern financial markets. It has a well 
developed economy based on high technology. Its main industries 
are financial services, consumer products, tourism and 
construction. Its average annual growth rate is 5 per cent, and this, 
since 1985. Its record year is 1993, when the rate reached 10 per 
cent; a year later, the rate fell back to 6.8 per cent.
<P>
	Israel is a door open on the Middle East for Canada, as the 
minister pointed out sooner. Canada has been among Israel's 
partners since the country's inception in 1948. In fact, Canada 
recognized Israel in December 1948. We have been trading with 
Israel for many years. We began trading with this country as soon 
as it was created.
<P>
	Various bilateral committees have been struck these last few 
years by Canada and Israel. We have, for example, the 
Canada-Israel Committee, which was formed in 1970 to discuss 
subjects such as human rights, the money issue; the Canada-Israel 
Chamber of Commerce; the Canada-Israel Foundation for 
Industrial Research and Development, which has been in existence 
since 1994; and, finally, the Canada-Israel Joint Committee, which 
was established a few years ago to discuss commercial issues of 
common interest to both countries.
<P>
	At the present time, our trade with Israel represents between 
$450 to $500 million a year. Of course, these figures do not 
compare with those for trade between the United States and Israel, 
which amounts to $1 billion a day. But with the free trade accord 
that we are about to approve, we can hope for a significant increase 
of our trade with Israel.
<P>
	There is a trade potential to be explored in Israel by businesses in 
Quebec and Canada. Israel's external trade accounts for 25 per cent 
of its GDP. Its imports amounted to $24.9 billion in 1994, and its 
exports totalled 6.4 billion in the same year.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	In 1995, Canadian exports to Israel reached a total of $216 
million Canadian, distributed mainly among the following 
products: aluminum, machinery, drugs, wood, pulp and paper. In 
the same year, Canadian imports from Israel amounted to $240 
million, mainly in diamonds, which is practical, clothing, 
machinery and electrical equipment.
<P>
	The main trading partners of Israel are the United States and the 
European Union. Israel signed free-trade agreements with both 
several years ago.
<P>
	The agreement establishing a free-trade area between the United 
States and Israel was signed on April 22, 1985 and came into effect 
on September 1 the same year. A declaration on trade in services 
was also signed at the same time. A joint committee was 
established to supervise the implementation of the agreement and 
hold consultations on issues regarding the functioning and 
interpretation of the agreement.
<P>
	This committee studies ways to improve bilateral trade. The 
main purpose of this agreement was to abolish import duties on all 
products, beginning January 1, 1995. Duties on some imports 
considered sensitive are being phased out on several years in order 
to allow production branches of both countries do adapt to 
increasing competition.
<P>
	With respect to agriculture, the agreement, while recognizing 
that it would be desirable to open up markets by eliminating 
customs duties, allows both countries to apply other restrictions in 
order to maintain their respective price support systems.
<P>
	The free trade agreement between Israel and the European 
Community was signed in May 1975. The agreement covers all 
industrial products, some agricultural products and some processed 
agricultural products. In 1976, an additional industrial, technical 
and financial protocol was included in this agreement. The 
implementation of the agreement ended in 1989. Since then, 
another agreement was signed, this time with the European Union, 
which has been in effect since January 1, 1996.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5317"> 5317 </A></B>
<P>
	In September 1992, Israel signed a free trade agreement with 
the European Free Trade Association, also known as EFTA. The 
objectives of this agreement are to promote the harmonious 
development of economic relations between the EFTA countries 
and Israel, to ensure fair competition in trading between the 
signatories, to eliminate obstacles to trade and thus contribute to 
the harmonious development and expansion of world trade and, 
finally, to improve co-operation between EFTA member countries 
and Israel. EFTA members are responsible for about 11 per cent 
of goods imported by Israel and receive 4 per cent of its exports. 
Under the agreement, which came into effect on January 1, 1993, 
customs duties were eliminated in the case of bilateral trade in 
industrial products, fish products and other seafood, as well as for 
processed agricultural products.
<P>
	The signing of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement will put 
Canadian businesses that trade with Israel on the same footing as 
American and European businesses that trade with this country.
<P>
	On April 29, 1994, the government of the State of Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, the PLO, signed an economic 
agreement, which gives the Palestinian authority extensive powers 
over taxation and the regulation of trade and banking, as part of the 
autonomy of the Gaza Strip and the region of Jericho. The 
agreement is to be extended to the West Bank. It is more or less the 
equivalent of a customs union, with two exceptions. One concerns 
the importation of agricultural products and labour in Israel, while 
the other concerns a difference in customs tariffs when trading with 
other countries, tariffs the Palestinians may apply to an agreed list 
of imports to be used within the territories.
<P>
	The agreement allows the Palestinian authority to collect taxes 
and import duties lower than those in effect in Israel, on a wide 
range of products, but only to meet the needs of Gaza and Jericho. 
All trading in goods between Israel and the Gaza Strip and the 
Jericho region will be free, with the exception of agricultural 
products, for a period of five years.
<P>
	The State of Israel has been a contracting party to the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade, also known as GATT, since 1962, 
and is a signatory to the WTO agreement.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-61 before the House today will implement the 
Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement signed last July by the 
Canadian government and the State of Israel. Clause 8 of the bill 
states that the House has approved CIFTA.
<P>
	Part II of the bill deals with the amendments necessary to bring 
Canadian laws into conformity with the agreement. The following 
acts will be amended: the Canadian International Trade Tribunal 
Act, the Export and Import Permits Act, the Customs Act and the 
Customs Tariff Act.
<P>
	If everything goes as planned, the agreement should come into 
force on January 1st, 1997. However, we suggest postponing the 
coming into force to a later date if the government is not satisfied 
that the State of Israel is really ready to implement this agreement, 
as provided under clause 62 of Bill C-61.
<P>
	This clause states that the Governor in Council may not issue an 
order bringing the agreement into force unless satisfied the 
government of Israel has taken satisfactory steps to implement it.
<P>
	The purpose of the free trade agreement, which was signed on 
July 31 in Toronto by the Canadian Minister of International Trade 
and Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs, is to eliminate trade 
barriers and facilitate the movement of goods between Canada and 
Israel.
<P>
	Article 2.1 of the agreement provides for the elimination of 
customs duties on all manufactured goods, except in two cases, as 
of January 1st 1997, Special treatment is provided for farm 
products.
<P>
	As requested by Israel, a special treatment applies to certain 
cottons, as is the case for women's bathing suits, as requested by 
the Bloc Quebecois. Customs duties on these items will be phased 
out over a period of two years and a half to be completely 
eliminated by July 1st, 1999.
<P>
	This exception made in favour of women' bathing suits is the 
result of considerable pressure from Quebec companies, including 
Shan, in Laval, and the Bloc Quebecois. Indeed, the Bloc raised the 
issue in the House on several occasions, bringing to the 
government's attention the concerns of Quebec bathing suit and 
lingerie manufacturers with regard to a possible free trade 
agreement with Israel.
<P>
	These companies were concerned because Israeli businesses 
benefit from the elimination of customs duty on European textiles, 
thanks to the free trade agreement with European countries, and so 
they have a definite advantage in the area of manufacturing costs 
for bathing suits and lingerie since they can save 25 to 35 per cent 
on the purchase of raw material. We must remember that Israel is 
Canada's main competitor in the area of bathing suits and lingerie.
<P>
	In 1993, the bathing suit and lingerie industry represented 10 per 
cent of all the Canadian industry and the annual sales of that sector 
reached approximately $450 millions. That equals the total trade 
between Canada and Israel.
<P>
	We must also mention that following the Canada-U.S. Free 
Trade Agreement, the North American Free Trade Agreement and 
the Uruguay Round, businesses in the fabric and garment industry 
had to make very major adjustments. It was quite normal that any 
new free trade agreement would upset them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5318"> 5318 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1995, Canadian customs tariffs on bathing suits and lingerie 
were anywhere from 18 to 25 per cent. The progressive 
elimination of these tariffs over a period of two and a half years 
is a lesser evil for businesses manufacturing bathing suits. That 
two and a half year period will allow Canadian and Quebec 
businesses to prepare themselves and to adjust to the competition 
coming from Israel.
<P>
	Furthermore, we hope that delay will give the Canadian 
government time to negotiate the elimination of customs tariffs on 
European textiles for our Canadian businesses, as the bathing suit 
and lingerie manufacturers have requested for several months and 
as Israeli businesses have obtained.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois regrets the fact that lingerie is not one of the 
exceptions mentioned in the agreement. Lingerie manufacturers, 
who very often are also bathing suit manufacturers, made 
representations to that end as well and their reasons for requesting 
an adjustment period in order to prepare for the opening of the 
Canadian market to their competitors are just as valid as those of 
the bathing suit manufacturers. But the lingerie manufacturers 
were the big losers in the negotiation process, as is all too often the 
case.
<P>
	The free trade agreement between Canada and Israel refers to 
several provisions of the GATT and WTO agreements, for instance 
those regarding the trade dispute settlement process. Canadian and 
Israeli cultural industries are not subject to the agreement.
<P>
	The negotiations with Israel concerning this free trade 
agreement started in November 1994. During the two years of 
negotiations, few people and few companies were consulted as 
regards the contents of the agreement. In fact, even the signing of 
the agreement was kept a secret. It seems to be the policy of this 
government to negotiate in secret and without consulting anyone 
free trade agreements having a direct effect on the Canadian public. 
The fact of the matter is that Canadians and Canadian companies 
have a right to know and should know ahead of time-not after all 
the decisions have been made, ahead of time-what trade 
agreements the Canadian government is negotiating and signing on 
their behalf.
<P>
	Before the House adjourned for the summer in June, we made 
repeated inquiries of the office of the Minister of International 
Trade about the status of the free trade agreement negotiations with 
Israel. We were told that it was out of the question that any decision 
be made before the House reconvened in September. That is why 
we were very surprised to read in the July 31 or August 1 
newspapers that everything had been signed. So we could fully 
co-operate and simply do our job, we asked to be kept informed on 
the status of negotiations between Canada and Israel.
<P>
	International trade officials told us that things were at a standstill 
for the summer, that they would come back in September and 
inform us of any developments. This shows that, as I said earlier, 
the other side would rather negotiate behind closed doors.
<P>
	Furthermore, these businesses must be kept informed. Quebec 
and Canadian businesses also have the right to express their 
opinions and to be duly consulted before the decisions affecting 
them are taken. History repeats itself with the free trade 
negotiations with Chile. Although we learned that the agreement 
should be signed when the President of Chile, Mr. Frei, comes to 
Canada in mid-November, we still do not know the content or even 
the main elements of the agreement.
<P>
	Again, as in the case of the free trade agreement with the state of 
Israel, Quebec and Canadian businesses were not duly consulted 
before the agreement was finalized. Again, the Canadian people 
will find out the details just a few months before the provisions 
affecting trade and the future of our businesses come into effect.
<P>
	The government must listen to what businesses, social, cultural 
and environmental groups, associations and anyone else have to 
say before signing similar trade agreements with other countries.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois will vote in favour of Bill 
C-61, but we want to issue a serious warning about the 
government's tendency to negotiate and sign free trade treaties on 
the sly.

lenges head on and we will overcome them today and in future 
years.
<P>
	Over the past number of years I have had the opportunity to 
speak to students in many of our schools. In my constituency of 
Carleton-Charlotte there are some 42 schools, plus 2 community 
colleges. I challenged myself to try to visit each and every one of 
those schools during my term of office and to speak about this 
wonderful country of ours we call Canada.
<P>
	With all of the differences that I mentioned earlier in culture, in 
language, in economies we start to look at what are those things 
that unite us. Whether we are on the far Atlantic coast of 
Newfoundland and Labrador, or the far Pacific coast of British 
Columbia, or in the Northwest Territories or the Yukon, or all of 
those wonderful provinces that are in between that make up this 
great country of ours, we have certain things that unite us and bring 
us together. Some of those things are displayed here in this House, 
as is our Canadian flag.
<P>
	Whether we are in Newfoundland, British Columbia, Ontario or 
the territories, our flag is the same. We should be proud of it. We 
should fly it on every public building. Whether it is on schools, 
whether it is on government buildings of any type, the Canadian 
flag should be flown with pride.
<P>
	In addition to that we have a national anthem. Again, regardless 
of which province or which coast we might be on, the national 
anthem or as we know it, O Canada, is the same. Whether it is sung 
in French or English it has the same meaning. It is our national 
anthem.
<P>
	I can recall when I was speaking to the schools, I began to think 
about all those things that unite us as Canadians from one coast to 
the other. I can recall as a youngster going to elementary school and 
reciting a pledge of allegiance.
<P>
	When first arriving here in Ottawa, I inquired if the pledge of 
allegiance was still used and available. I was assured that it was. I 
was told that over the years the words have changed slightly but we 
still had a pledge of allegiance.
<P>
	I asked for copies in both English and French. They were 
provided to me. On my card stock from my office I presented 
copies of the pledge of allegiance to the schools, the service clubs, 
the organizations and the municipalities throughout the 
constituency. I began speaking about it as I visited the various 
schools in the region.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	I began to get requests from jurisdictions outside of mine, from 
other constituencies in my home province of New Brunswick. One 
of the reasons I did is because the school districts overlap the 
federal jurisdictions. Of course, when I got requests from one 
school district and someone else found out about it, they began to 
expand. I got requests for copies of the pledge of allegiance from 
the great province of Ontario, la belle province de Québec, from 
every province in this country.
<P>
	It is not my pledge. It belongs to every member of this House, 
indeed to every Canadian. I want to make it available to every 
member of this House. I want to make it available to every 
Canadian. That is why I have brought the motion forward today.
<P>
	When I speak to assembled students in schools-sometimes they 
are very largely populated school and sometimes smaller, more 
rural schools-I always have a little questionnaire about this 
wonderful country of ours, Canada. We talk about all the provinces 
and the territories that make up this country. We talk about what the 
economies are and how they differ from fisheries to forestry to 
agriculture to mining to all of our wonderful resources that we are 
so fortunate to have in this country.
<P>
	We talk about provincial capitals and governments. I always 
throw a little cue in to see how well the students are doing, how 
much history they really know about Canada. I talk to them about 
how we are so influenced by our big neighbours to the south, the 
United States of America. We see their TV channels expanding into 
Canada. We see magazines. We are so influenced by our 
neighbours to the south that sometimes we know more of their 
history and geography than we do of our own.
<P>
	I always ask a little question. I always say to the students: ``By 
the way, who was the first president of United States?'' Of course 
they all raise their hands because everyone knows. They all blurt it 
out: ``George Washington''. I talk on a bit about the geography and 
history of our wonderful country and then say: ``By the way, who 
was the first Prime Minister of Canada?'' The room goes silent 
more often than not.
<P>
	I have a little analogy that I use for them. Members are welcome 
to use it. I tell them: ``When you go on vacation with your family 
during the summer and it comes lunch time and you see these great 
golden arches, what do you think of?'' They all shout: 
``McDonald's''. I say: ``Absolutely right, you got the first Prime 
Minister of Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald''. It is an analogy that I 
hope will help them to remember all the rest of their lives who the 
first Prime Minister of Canada was.
<P>
	It is important for us to realize our past as well as knowing our 
present, as we look with great anticipation to the future for our 
children and our grandchildren and as we continue to build this 
country for a better tomorrow for all Canadians, regardless of 
where they might live.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5321"> 5321 </A></B>
<P>
	As I mentioned, we display our national flag in this House. 
Every Wednesday, following the opening prayer, O Canada is sung 
by the members of the House.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	This motion I have put forward has been reviewed by the 
committee responsible. Although it is not a votable motion today, I 
will be requesting the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs to give every consideration to having the pledge of 
allegiance recited in the House.
<P>
	I am a firm believer that it is up to us to show the leadership for 
tomorrow's youngsters and students. They are, after all, going to be 
the future leaders of this country. Our sons, daughters, grandsons 
and granddaughters will be the future builders of this nation. We 
should give them the benefit of all of this information at the earliest 
possible date.
<P>
	Leadership should begin with the highest court in the land, the 
House of Commons. Therefore, I will certainly be pressing for the 
appropriate committee to consider allowing members of the House, 
at the opening of each day recite the pledge of allegiance in both 
our official languages.
<P>
	As I mentioned, this is our pledge. It is not that of the United 
States, France, Great Britain or any other country. It is made in 
Canada, so to speak, and it is ours to hold up, as we hold up the 
Canadian flag and as we stand in honour of our national anthem.
<P>
	As Canadians, we sometimes tend to be somewhat complacent 
about our patriotism, although I know that Canadians of every 
background love this country and love the opportunities that this 
country provides.
<P>
	For three years in a row the United Nations not only commended 
but selected Canada as the best country in the world in which to 
live. That does not say that we are perfect, that we do not have 
problems and challenges. Of course we do and we always will 
have.
<P>
	However, we have people in this House and elsewhere 
throughout our provinces who are prepared to take on those 
challenges, whether they are in a community with mayors and 
municipal councillors, whether it be in the provinces with premiers 
and legislative assemblies or in this place, we have a responsibility 
to set examples of patriotism and examples such as we see 
displayed here on either side of the Speaker's chair in our Canadian 
flag. Anything that I can do as an individual member, it is my 
responsibility to do that.
<P>
	As most members are aware, we had some great news today 
from the Minister of Finance when he made a presentation before 
the Standing Committee on Finance. The great news is that those 
challenges that were before us when we arrived in this place in the 
late fall of 1993 are being overcome. Those challenges were met 
head on, that tremendous deficit of $42 billion, a debt of over  $500 
billion. Everyone said if this were a business, my goodness we 
would look at putting the locks on the doors. The government did 
not run away. It accepted the challenge. The Minister of Finance 
accepted the challenge and said we will overcome.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	The great news today is that the goal of $32.7 billion deficit for 
the fiscal year 1995-96, which ended this past March, came in at 
$28.7 billion, some $4 billion less than had been projected. That is 
fantastic news.
<P>
	The finance minister went a step further and said we are going to 
give a new goal on our two year cycle. Today was the day to look at 
1998-99. Having met and exceeded our past goals, the Minister of 
Finance said that during the fiscal year 1998-99 we are going to 
have further reductions below the $10 billion mark. For the first 
time in 20 or 30 years it will be that low, and reaching 1 per cent of 
gross domestic product.
<P>
	I can see the day in the not too distant future, and with the turn of 
the century coming very shortly upon us, when we could have a 
balanced budget in this country. Is that not wonderful news? That is 
what Canadians said they wanted to see of their members of 
Parliament and of their government. They wanted to see a 
government that could balance the budget but without the cut and 
slash that we have heard so many times. Yes, it has been difficult. 
Quite frankly most politicians do not like to go into our 
communities and tell people that we have had to cut back.
<P>
	However, it has been accomplished by the Minister of Finance 
and the team effort of the government. We ought to be very proud 
as Canadians today that that day is upon us.
<P>
	As my time winds down I would like to read the pledge of 
allegiance to everyone in this House. I read it for the first time on 
September 30, 1994. Today I will read it again, the pledge of 
allegiance to the Canadian flag:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To my flag and to the country it represents I pledge respect and loyalty. Wave with 
pride from sea to sea and within your fold keep us ever united. Be for all a symbol of 
love, freedom and justice. God keep our flag. God protect our Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to Motion M-227 
presented by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Carleton-Charlotte.
<P>
	I have listened to my colleague attentively, and I am not 
questioning the sincerity of his feelings or the pride he feels in 
taking the oath he has been so kind as to read to us to close his 
speech.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	The comments I am about to make once again show the 
difference in perception between a French Canadian, a Quebecer in 
this House, and the hon. member.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5322"> 5322 </A></B>
<P>
	When I was a child, Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day was celebrated on 
June 24 in my village and in the neighbouring communities. There 
was a parade with the young Saint-Jean-Baptiste and his lamb and 
flags were flying.
<P>
	This was a paradox, like many other ones in the history of this 
country. One could see, flying side by side, the Union Jack and the 
flag of the Vatican. People loved symbols and cared little that one 
flag represented the Roman Catholic papacy, while the other one 
was the symbol of the Church of England and the United Kingdom. 
People showed a great deal of tolerance.
<P>
	In Canada, this spirit of tolerance was developed through the 
respect of various symbols. Occasionally, people would stray from 
this path, but they would easily come back when things would calm 
down.
<P>
	The Union Jack, which still flies over Westminster, the 
parliament of Great Britain, was ours by default for a long time. It 
was not until 1945, by order in council, while waiting for a new 
flag to be designed, that the Government of Canada replaced the 
Union Jack temporarily with the Red Ensign, which still featured 
the Union Jack in its upper left hand corner, although on a 
somewhat smaller scale.
<P>
	The new Canadian flag was still a while coming. Finally, in 
1964, debate began here in the House of Commons and in the 
Senate, and a resolution was passed requiring a Royal 
proclamation.
<P>
	It must be said that there was undoubtedly a certain feeling of 
identification with this symbol, the Canadian flag, examples of 
which can be seen to your left and to your right. There were epic 
battles. I recall speeches by Mr. Diefenbaker at the time, in this 
House, in which he vehemently objected to the adoption of a 
Canadian flag. I also recall that some members even tried to stop 
the process physically on February 15, 1965, when this flag, which 
had been adopted legitimately by members of this House elected by 
the Canadian people, was first raised over the Peace Tower.
<P>
	I think that February 15, 1965 was a momentous day, because it 
represented, for many, release from a tie that had perhaps been in 
place too long. Canada, it is true, had acquired symbols.
<P>
	But though I listened to the eloquent remarks of the member for 
Carleton-Charlotte and heard the pride in his voice, for me the 
Canadian flag is symbolic of something else. For me, the Canadian 
flag is a symbol of the Canadian federal state, somewhat like the 
flag of the European Union which is a symbol of that union. It 
represents union, the Canadian economic space, as we might call it, 
to echo the words so dear to Mr. Bourassa when he was in power, 
and one which even the federalists in Quebec generally use.
<P>
	So, it is the flag of union. It is not the flag to which I have first 
allegiance. My first allegiance is to the Fleur de  Lys, the emblem 
of the nation I represent in this House, and the flag which was 
adopted as the national flag of Quebec on January 21, 1948, or 17 
years before the adoption of the Canadian maple leaf flag.
<P>
	There are, therefore, two visions, perhaps irreconcilable ones. 
There are two parallel paths, but there is nothing to stop us from 
building bridges between them. Yet the text-and a very fine text at 
that-read by the hon. member for Carleton-Charlotte just now, 
can hardly be found suitable by a person who owes his first 
allegiance to the flag of Quebec and the Nation of Quebec. Let me 
reread it, in order for it to appear in <I>Hansard</I>, and also in order to 
analyze it. following the quote??
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	The pledge of allegiance to the Canadian flag:
<P>
	To my flag and to the country it represents<BR>
	I pledge respect and loyalty.<BR>
	Wave with pride from sea to sea<BR>
	And within your fold keep us ever united.<BR>
	Be for all a symbol of love, freedom and justice.<BR>
	God keep our flag.<BR>
	God protect our Canada.
<P>
	That is the pledge the hon. member for Carleton-Charlotte read 
to us a little while ago.
<P>
	It is hard to have two allegiances. The biblical saying that ``No 
man can serve two masters'' applies to me. My first allegiance is 
that I have promised certain things to the men and women who 
elected me on a platform aimed at making Quebec a sovereign state 
which, of course, would maintain links of friendship and fraternity 
with Canada. I cannot, therefore, swear that I am going to pray 
daily that Canada remain united. I want constitutional reform.
<P>
	Most certainly I want economic union, a common currency, a 
common passport. Everything that we can have in common, let us 
have, but let us rework political structures so that they will allow us 
to avoid these quarrels, these wars over symbols.
<P>
	Basically, both the hon. member for Carleton-Charlotte and the 
official opposition are right. No one can be wrong, because in this 
House people make use of the symbols they believe in, and to 
which they are firmly attached. While bowing to the values he 
holds dear, I am convinced that, in his heart of hearts, the hon. 
member for Carleton-Charlotte can understand, and 
respect-being the gentleman that he is-the values I hold dear.
<P>
	Yet, they are unfortunately irreconcilable, and that is why I 
cannot support the motion before us. It is rather unfortunate, but in 
my opinion it is statement of two irreconcilable visions of Canada, 
a difference that will one day have to be settled. When it is settled 
for once and for all, we shall probably be able to find some 
common symbols which will suit and please us all, and which will, 
no doubt, give rise to an almost universal allegiance.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am also pleased to speak to this motion this evening which would 
close the debate.
<P>
	I believe the member is well intentioned in bringing this motion 
forward. I believe he is motivated by a sincere love for our country, 
and for that he is to be congratulated. It seems nowadays that any 
display of emotion or love or passion for Canada is to be 
appreciated. In that sense I appreciate the motion he has brought 
forward today.
<P>
	In general it is fair to say that there is not enough patriotism in 
Canada. We can be very proud of our country. Although I am in 
opposition I am intensely proud of Canada and I am intensely 
proud of the opportunities we have and our position in relation to 
the rest of the world. We are very blessed with natural resources. 
We are very blessed with the people we have here and we have 
much to be proud of in Canada.
<P>
	This motion about pledging allegiance to the flag is similar in 
some respects to the singing of our national anthem. People feel 
that if we do some patriotic things, if we hang up the flag, if we 
sing our national anthem, that is good for patriotism and it is good 
for Canada. It is good for enthusiasm. It binds us together and so 
on.
<P>
	One of the reasons the member for Beaver River brought 
forward the motion to sing ``O Canada'' in the House of Commons 
was for its symbolic value. We said that it is good to sing the 
national anthem, it is good that it be sung here once in a while. 
There was a long procedural wrangle to make it happen. The 
motion was farmed off to the procedure and House affairs 
committee. It was debated back and forth. And now I believe the 
public is pleased that we do sing our national anthem in the House 
at least once a week. It is sung and it is heard here.
<P>
	This motion may be typical of what we are experiencing, a surge 
of patriotic sentiment. I believe this is largely because Canada is 
going through again another unity crisis of sorts. It seems to never 
go away. It has been with us off and on for many years, I suppose 
40 years. As is evidenced by the official opposition in the House, 
there is still an active movement to try to split Canada in two.
<P>
<B>(1845 )</B>
<P>
	We seem to be going through a slow motion unity crisis, if there 
is such a thing as that contradiction in terms. It is a crisis which 
lends immediacy to the problem. It is in slow motion and just 
seems to go on and on and on.
<P>
	This motion is a reaction to that crisis. In many ways it is like the 
debate and the questions on the flag program of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage. The minister is sending flags out all over the 
country to whomever asks for one in the hope that more will be 
hung from the nation's flag poles and that it will somehow bind us 
together again with that commonality and that common thread 
from sea to sea. We will rally around the flag, which is a symbolic 
thing, and somehow our national unity crisis will go by the by.
<P>
	I do not think that is going to work. If that is the extent of the 
federal government's national unity program, unless it can start to 
enunciate it better, it is not a very good answer to the separatists 
and to Canadians who are looking for systemic change within 
Canada. They are looking for something of substance, not a 
symbolic thing.
<P>
	I would have been much happier debating a motion from the 
member for Carleton-Charlotte if he had proposed a motion to 
decentralize the government, if he had proposed a motion to 
downsize government, if he had proposed a motion to quit 
spending so much money on the flag program. I realize all of that 
cannot be done in one private member's motion. Perhaps the hon. 
member should have brought forward measures that would have 
addressed a plan of how we are going to keep the nation together. It 
would have been more useful if we were debating something of 
more substance than what we are debating tonight.
<P>
	My fear is that we keep skirting the issue of what is wrong in 
Canada both constitutionally and systemically, the way we govern 
ourselves. We keep putting icing on the cake. We put the butter on 
the bread. We try to doctor it up but there are some real systemic 
problems. The issues that are being addressed by the government 
are dressed up and sold to Quebecers and to the rest of Canadians as 
real change. That is just not going to cut it. I wish we could be 
debating something of more substance.
<P>
	The motion reads: ``That, in the opinion of this House, the 
members of the House of Commons should recite the pledge of 
allegiance to the Canadian flag, in both official languages, each day 
at the opening of the House of Commons, following the opening 
prayer''.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, I do not object to shows of patriotism in 
this House; we could do with more of that in Canada. A couple of 
years ago during the debate on the national anthem I remember 
actually going out and singing the anthem on the front steps just to 
try to make my point that it would not hurt us to be a little more 
patriotic. Of course we now sing the national anthem here in the 
House.
<P>
	The proposal of reciting some sort of pledge to a flag every day, 
while it is not objectionable to me in most ways, has some practical 
problems. I would like to run through them quickly.
<P>
	First, there are a lot of time consuming rituals here in the House 
already. Although I realize it would only take a minute or so to do 
this every day, my concern is that by ritualizing it, in a sense we are 
taking the meaning out of it. We make it a daily occurrence. We 
stand up and say some words that pretty soon will mean nothing. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5324"> 5324 </A></B>
<P>
takes up some time in both official languages to run through that 
every day and my concern is it would soon be meaningless.
<P>
	The second problem is that the Americans pledge allegiance to 
their flag at each and every opportunity. I am not an anti-American; 
I think the Americans are our best friends. We are darn lucky to 
have them as our close neighbours geographically. We are tied to 
them in so many different ways and thank goodness we are. I am 
grateful that we have our American neighbours.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	Pledging allegiance to the flag at every single occasion is an 
American tradition. It is really quite American to do that. In a 
sense, I am just enough of a Canadian to get my dander up over that 
because it seems to take us down that path.
<P>
	My third problem is with the concept of pledging allegiance to a 
flag per se. I have always thought this was a little strange. I have 
admired the Americans' patriotism, but to pledge allegiance to the 
flag is not a Canadian answer to the patriotism problem.
<P>
	When we pledge allegiance to a flag, we should be pledging 
allegiance to what the flag represents. In a sense, our flag 
represents our country, our values and the things that make our 
country great. In that case, why use the euphemisms that are 
described in this bill to pledge allegiance to a piece of cloth?
<P>
	I have no trouble pledging allegiance to my country. I would be 
pleased to do that. Maybe even the oath of parliamentarians when 
they become members of Parliament could be changed to pledge 
allegiance to our country. I certainly do not mind the thought of 
that. But pledging allegiance to a symbol is a little strange.
<P>
	Now for my fourth point. Someone pledges allegiance to a flag. 
As has been mentioned by our colleague from the Bloc, many 
people used to pledge allegiance to the Union Jack but it has 
changed to the flag we now enjoy. However, many people say that 
it is not the style of the flag, it is the country they are pledging 
allegiance to. A flag can be changed, we can can hang it differently, 
we can do lots of things but really, it is a flag.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would prefer that there was a pledge of 
allegiance to our country rather than to our flag. If we are going to 
pledge allegiance to the flag, then there needs to be a lot of 
consultation on this. I do not think there is any unanimity on what 
the pledge should be and so on. I will stick to the country and we 
can leave the flag issue for another day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I think 
the previous speaker has missed the whole point of this debate. The 
bottom line is that the flag is not about pigment, about cloth. It is 
about the symbol of our nation. The flag is Canada. For that reason, 
I will not get into discussing some of the issues he raised in his 
speech.
<P>
	I thank the member for Carleton-Charlotte for bringing this 
matter to our attention. The people of Durham have been very 
supportive of the fly the flag campaign. Indeed, over 7,000 flags 
have been distributed to the people of Durham.
<P>
	When the member for Carleton-Charlotte was talking about his 
own speaking engagements in his riding, I got to thinking about my 
wife and myself. We have two cars on the road in the riding. We 
both have Canadian flags in the back of them. They are paper flags. 
Every time we go to an event, we make sure that all the kids have 
paper flags. It is a tremendous thing to go to Santa Claus parades 
and so forth and to be talking to people in a sea of Canadian flags. It 
makes me feel very proud to be part of this country, to know people 
love their country in that fashion.
<P>
	I was most interested in the comments from the member for 
Bellechasse. These are some of the problems of our country. We do 
not really think of how far back in history it was that this nation 
was made. It does not just go back to 1948; it goes back much 
further than that.
<P>
	Symbolism is a nation's struggle to define itself as a country. 
The member is quite right. From the time of Confederation in 1867 
to 1965, Canada never really had a flag. We had many things that 
we called flags. The Cross of St. George flew on Labrador in 1749. 
The Fleur de Lys was accepted as a Canadian flag. There was the 
Union Jack and later the Red Ensign, but none of them were 
officially designated as a flag of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	The French and the English have a common history in Canada. It 
was John Cabot that flew that flag of St. George on our eastern 
shores in 1497. It was Jacques Cartier that rose the Fleur de Lys in 
the Gaspé in 1534.
<P>
	The Fleur de Lys interestingly enough is also a flag of another 
sovereign. The Fleur de Lys in reality is a monarchial symbol from 
France. It was a symbol of colonialism, no different from the Union 
Jack. That is why I question why the Fleur de Lys could possibly be 
the flag of another nation when by definition it is a colonial 
symbol.
<P>
	The Maple Leaf has been with our country for many, many 
years, from the time of the first settlers. It was the first settlers who 
recognized the strength of the maple as it represented a source of 
food and furniture. In other words it was a sustenance of their 
existence in a new world.
<P>
	The emblem was used in the early 1700s and it was proper and 
very prominent on very early coinage of Canada. It was the 
emblem of the St. Jean Baptiste society in New France in 1834. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5325"> 5325 </A></B>
<P>
was in 1863 that  Principal Dawson of McGill University incited it 
as the emblem of the vitality and energy of a new country.
<P>
	That symbol has been carried into two wars. People have shed 
their blood on the Maple Leaf. It is now a symbol that is recognized 
around the world as Canada, not French Canada and not English 
Canada. By the way, people did not ask if those who shed that 
blood were French or English, it was the blood of Canadians.
<P>
	I have been proud to wear this symbol every day that I have been 
in this House of Commons and I am proud to wear it when I go 
around the world. I know other Canadians are as well, including 
those in the province of Quebec. Canadians and people worldwide 
recognize Canada as a country of tolerance, as a country of people 
who democratically work out their problems as we are doing in this 
House.
<P>
	The Maple Leaf has been an excellent symbol of what Canada is. 
It is a growing vital country with deep roots and its roots continue 
to grow. Its roots will continue to grow, not only in the maritimes of 
John Cabot and the Quebec of Jacques Cartier, but throughout this 
dominion from sea to sea to sea. Its branches are similar. We have 
branched out not only within our country to connect the people of 
this country together, but we have been able to branch out to the 
world. The world recognizes the Maple Leaf as a symbol of 
tolerance.
<P>
	In closing I would like to state how important it is for a nation to 
have symbols. This is the symbol of a united and strong country. It 
can easily be adapted and should be the symbol of all people of 
Canada including those in Quebec because they are very much an 
open society and that is basically the country we have tried to 
create here. The Maple Leaf is very much a symbol of French 
Canada as it is a symbol of English Canada.
<P>
	I thank the member for Carleton-Charlotte for bringing this 
matter before the House. He can be assured that I and the people of 
Durham are very supportive of his intentions.
<P>
<B>(1900 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Motion No. 227 
introduced by my hon. friend, the member for Carleton-Charlotte. 
I support the motion and I congratulate my colleague for his 
patriotism and his love for this great country.
<P>
	Members would know that I recently introduced Bill C-302, an 
act to establish an official pledge of allegiance to our flag. The hon. 
member's motion encourages the House to recite one of the 
unofficial versions. This version is used by Canada's Jaycees and it 
has been endorsed for use as an official version by the city of 
Windsor, Ontario.
<P>
	Since I introduced my private member's bill I have been 
overwhelmed by the support shown by Canadians  from coast to 
coast for an idea for a pledge of allegiance. I believe it to be 
appropriate for members of Parliament to recite the pledge in this 
very House. This is the national Parliament of Canada and as 
members of the House of Commons we speak not only for our 
constituents but for each and every Canadian.
<P>
	The hon. member for Carleton-Charlotte and all members of 
the House will be pleased to know that I have received over 1,650 
messages of support from every province in Canada, including 
Quebec. Canadians have telephoned, signed petitions, written 
letters and have suggested pledges. As well, 75 municipalities have 
endorsed the idea for an official pledge of allegiance. These include 
the town of Woodstock, the town of Sackville, the town of 
Dalhousie, the town of Sussex and the village of Minto in the hon. 
member's home province of New Brunswick. I am proud that in my 
own riding of Guelph-Wellington the city of Guelph and the 
township of Guelph have also supported my initiative.
<P>
	Canadians have been pledging allegiance to our flag for many 
years in a number of ways. Two former school teachers from 
Alberta have written to me reminding me that years ago students 
rose every morning and recited these words: ``I salute the flag, the 
emblem of my country, to her I pledge my love and loyalty''.
<P>
	Another Canadian told me that when growing up in Dartmouth, 
Nova Scotia she recited: ``I pledge allegiance to the flag and to the 
empire for which it stands; one nation indivisible, with liberty and 
justice for all''.
<P>
	According to a Canadian from Lakefield, Ontario, Canadian 
Shriners use the version similar to that of Shriners in the United 
States and Mexico. And as I mentioned earlier, Jaycees have joined 
the member for Carleton-Charlotte and use the version that has 
recently been endorsed by the city of Windsor.
<P>
	If I have received any criticism from Canadians for the idea of a 
pledge of allegiance, it is that some are concerned that the idea is 
too American. However, I suggest that our history is different than 
that of the United States and our love for our country is quite 
unique.
<P>
	Canadians are discovering the importance of our flag in our 
lives. Who can forget the flying maple leaf from British fishing 
vessels supporting our efforts to conserve fish stocks? We all 
remember the flag hovering over the thousands of Canadians who 
went to Montreal just days before the last referendum. Whether it is 
raised at the Olympics or at international hockey championships or 
worn on the sleeves of our peacekeepers, the flag represents 
tolerance, understanding and is an internationally recognized 
symbol of the best country in the world in which to live.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5326"> 5326 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe that at this critical time in our nation's history we 
should consider all that makes us Canadian. Patriotism does come 
from the heart but it is also displayed in our words and in our 
actions.
<P>
	The House of Commons has recently begun singing the national 
anthem on Wednesdays. ``O Canada'' itself, which was only 
declared official in the past 20 years or so, brings us all together. So 
does our flag. It is symbolic of the best country in the world.
<P>
	I want to take the remaining few minutes to share with the House 
some suggestions I have received from my initiative. Eleanor 
Hadley from Vancouver suggests the oath: ``With love and respect, 
I pledge my loyalty to Canada and to Canada's flag''.
<P>
	Mrs. Clara Jones from St. Hubert, Quebec writes: ``I am proud to 
be Canadian and I pledge allegiance to our flag which stands for 
freedom and justice for all of its people from coast to coast. United 
we stand, protected by the Canadian Constitution''.
<P>
<B>(1905 )</B>
<P>
	Evelyne Day from Saint John, New Brunswick, suggests: ``To 
the maple leaf flag, pride of our country, I pledge my allegiance 
with sincerity, dignity and honour''.
<P>
	David Evans from Victoria, British Columbia writes: ``As a 
Canadian citizen, I pledge my allegiance, my respect and my heart 
for our flag and to our country, Canada, unified from sea to sea''.
<P>
	I indeed do support this initiative and I am pleased to be a 
Canadian in this great country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in this debate on the motion moved by 
the member for Carleton-Charlotte, especially after having 
listened to the speech by the member for Bellechasse. I was much 
moved by his remarks because I feel they came very much from his 
heart. He presented to the House his dilemma as a Quebecer who 
feels a first allegiance to Quebec. He does not discount the rest of 
the country. Indeed, he spoke of a collective passport. I think he 
certainly is torn very much in his heart with respect to his loyalty to 
Quebec and to the country at large.
<P>
	The flag was born 30 years ago in the midst of just such a debate 
as we have here in the House of Commons now. Lester Pearson felt 
that Canada was threatened with division and even separation and 
contrived to start a debate on the creation of a Canadian flag in 
order to solve the problem at that time.
<P>
	I was a young man during the time when the maple leaf flag 
became our national flag. About 20 months later I was hitch-hiking 
in France with a young English student. The Englishman had a 
Union Jack on his flag and I had my Canadian flag and we set out in 
France. The Englishman asked: ``What is that red smear that you 
have on your rucksack?'' I said: ``Well, that is our new flag''. He 
said: ``Well, our Union Jack has been around for centuries''.
<P>
	When we were in Normandy we were standing by the roadside 
and a French farmer came pedalling by on his bicycle. In those 
days it was typical for them to wear blue serge and a blue beret. He 
stopped by our two rucksacks. He looked at the Englishman's 
rucksack and the Union Jack and then looked at mine. He said: 
``Vous êtes Canadiens. Les Canadiens sont bons''. He then jumped 
on his bicycle and pedalled away. That took place a mere 20 
months after our flag had come into existence.
<P>
	That flag in the past 30 years has become a flag that is 
recognized around the world as a flag which identifies Canada. I 
have to say, as did the member for Durham, that had I had on my 
rucksack a flag with the fleur-de-lis that Frenchman would not have 
known that I was Canadian and came from a separate country 
because the fleur-de-lis is a symbol used by other countries.
<P>
	Wherever we go in the world, our flag now means that we come 
from a country that is noted for its tolerance and its ability to 
debate away its differences which is part of the genius that is 
Quebec.
<P>
	Mr. Pearson brought in the flag in answer to a very difficult 
period that Canada was going through with its French Canadian 
component and it created a symbol which is very much a world 
symbol. That world symbol belongs as much to Quebec as it does 
to the rest of Canada because it was Quebec who caused the debate 
and created the flag.
<P>
	The debate today is on the pledge of allegiance. When we go 
through this similar debate today I am absolutely convinced that as 
long as there are members like the member for Bellechasse, who 
will give his real feelings to the Commons and to the country so 
that we can solve our problems, I think we are well on our way to 
becoming not a distinct society of various provinces but a distinct 
society that is very much Canada.
<P>
	The member said one thing that I would like to comment on. He 
said he did not think our differences were reconcilable because he 
had a first allegiance to Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1910 )</B>
<P>
	There is one thing we differ on, and it is only a nuance. When I 
think of Canada I think of belonging to B.C., belonging to 
Newfoundland, belonging to Quebec. He says that Quebec is his 
nation. I say to him that Quebec is my Canada too. Quebec is my 
nation as well. I am sorry I do not speak French fluently but I am 
working desperately on it because that is all part of the wonderful 
exercise that brings us every now and then as Canadians to debate 
and to examine our identities.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5327"> 5327 </A></B>
<P>
	We will always find that we are a tolerant and understanding 
people. We are constantly looking to our consciences because of 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I pledge allegiance to this flag and to the country for which it 
stands, one country indivisible for the benefit of all. I learned that 
in a rural school in Saskatchewan in grade one. It still stays with 
me. That is why I cannot emphasize more strongly support for this 
motion and the private member's bill which was read to us.
<P>
	Everything is falling into place nicely. If not each day, at least 
once a week members could stand up to salute the flag which would 
be saluting the country for which it stands. Then the children from 
coast to coast would have an example from us of what they could 
do in their schools.
<P>
	I have a challenge for Canada to take it a step further. Let us have 
a contest across the country. Canadians could come up with a flag 
song. That is something else I learned in Saskatchewan. The song 
was ``The Maple Leaf Forever''. We are on the right track when we 
are moving in this direction.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The time 
provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business has 
now expired and the order is dropped from the Order Paper.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HOLLINGERINCORPORATED">HOLLINGER INCORPORATED</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, last May 29, I asked the Prime Minister two questions, 
why did the federal government stand by and allow Hollinger 
Incorporated to acquire over 60 per cent of all Canadian 
newspapers, and what further threats to democracy and freedom 
will there have to be before the government takes action to ensure 
competition, freedom of speech and the public's right to know in 
face of this concentration of ownership in the Canadian newspaper 
industry.
<P>
	The reply stated that competition law deals with economic 
impact only. The fact that the Hollinger takeovers have had an 
economic impact on small independent newspapers in 
Saskatchewan was ignored. These papers have complained that 
Hollinger has threatened to drive them out of business if they 
choose to work co-operatively to advertise. This complaint was not 
addressed.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry ignored the fact that Hollinger 
Incorporated fired 182 people two days after  taking over the 
Regina <I>Leader-Post</I> and the Saskatoon <I>Star Phoenix</I>. These papers 
were making a healthy profit but according to Conrad Black they 
were not making enough profit.
<P>
	Hollinger Incorporated now controls all daily newspapers in 
Saskatchewan. When one person controls 60 per cent of the papers 
in Canada and 100 per cent of daily newspapers in a province, 
competition is diminished if not completely eliminated. It is 
certainly eliminated in provinces like Saskatchewan and 
Newfoundland where Conrad Black's Hollinger owns all daily 
newspapers.
<P>
	In 1981 the Liberal sponsored Kent commission made a 
recommendation that no more than 20 per cent of Canadian 
circulation should be owned by one individual or corporation to 
allow for competition in the newspaper industry. The Liberals are 
now ignoring these recommendations.
<P>
	The Bureau of Competition Policy has formally stated that it will 
not deal with these takeovers. Yet the bureau admitted that 
corporate concentration in the media has an effect on the 
newspaper quality, interference in editorial views and a significant 
decrease in editorial diversity across Canada. The bureau was 
quoted as saying: ``Although these are valid social concerns, it 
would not be appropriate for the director to comment on editorial 
diversity and newspaper quality''.
<P>
	The government is using this as an excuse not to do anything on 
this issue. This is a cop out and a flip-flop of the Liberal's position 
from their days in opposition.
<P>
<B>(1915 )</B>
<P>
	Concentration of ownership in the media must be dealt with 
immediately. In the past month three Hollinger newspaper editors 
have quit. All three have cited significant differences with their 
new employer Conrad Black as the reason for their departure.
<P>
	This is unprecedented but not surprising. Mr. David Radler, 
president of Hollinger, has said that Hollinger papers will not even 
bother reporting fairly on issues. He stated that he will not report 
on issues raised by New Democrats, who stand up for working and 
middle class Canadians, or any other organization that believes in 
the importance of social programs, fairness, community or 
co-operation.
<P>
	Conrad Black's extreme political views are well known. He is 
quoted as saying that the Tory defeat in 1993 was because they 
were too socialist, if we can believe that. None of the three 
newspaper editors who quit could be described as socialists but 
they were enough out of step with the narrow, big business agenda 
of Conrad Black that they were forced out of their positions.
<P>
	The Prime Minister appeared agitated and very uncomfortable 
when I asked him questions concerning Conrad Black's buying 
binge. I wondered why. Two days after I raised this concern of 
concentration of ownership  in the newspaper business, the Prime 
Minister spent three days partying, golfing, riding horses with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5328"> 5328 </A></B>
<P>
Conrad Black at an estate north of Toronto owned by the Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce. Of course the weekend was off limits 
to the media, but the fact is that Conrad Black is an influential 
friend of the Prime Minister and a financial contributor to the 
Liberal Party. He gave $13,000 to the Liberals and $11,000 to the 
Reform Party in 1995.
<P>
	Canadians are asking that the Liberal government do the right 
thing and establish an inquiry on the recent acquisitions by Conrad 
Black's Hollinger to ensure that Canadians receive balanced 
reporting in their newspapers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western </B><B>Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a few comments to make to the hon. 
member's submission.
<P>
	I invite the hon. member to point out where the government 
would find the authority to freeze any acquisitions that do not 
violate the provisions of any statute enacted by this Parliament.
<P>
	The government has no authority to freeze or block commercial 
transactions as he may be suggesting. In fact, he knows very well 
that his remedy is to go to his friends in the NDP in Saskatchewan. 
They are the ones who can remedy any matter about which he has 
complaints. But he will not go to those friends. He is trying to make 
this a political issue for the next election by simply running a smear 
campaign on what has been done thus far.
<P>
	Second, freedom of speech is guaranteed under the charter of 
rights and freedoms.
<P>
	Third, there are fundamental changes under way in methods of 
communications. Radio, television and now the Internet provide 
excellent vehicles for the exchange of information and opinion.
<P>
	The hon. member made reference to certain political donations. 
It is interesting that he never makes any comment about the 
political donations being made by the Bank of Nova Scotia to the 
NDP. The donations being made by others pale in comparison to 
what the Saskatchewan NDP has received from the bank and he 
makes these comments in the House, which are very surprising.
<P>
	The enforcement of the Competition Act is entrusted to the 
director of investigation and research who is an independent law 
enforcement official. His role under the merger provisions of the 
Competition Act is to review the economic implication and 
concentration of ownership. The director is not mandated to look at 
social issues such as editorial diversity which the NDP is pushing.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FISHERIES">FISHERIES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to revisit my question of May 17 to the 
<P>
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. I had the opportunity to ask the 
minister a question dealing with the proposed fish processing plant 
inspection fees.
<P>
	I was surprised when I first came to Ottawa to find a general lack 
of understanding of the fishing and fish processing industries and 
their problems. Many Canadians do not realize that Nova Scotia is 
the leading fishing province in Canada. We lead all other provinces 
in terms of landed weight and value. Moreover, fish and fish 
products are the number one export commodity of the province of 
Nova Scotia.
<P>
	My riding of South Shore is the most active fishing riding in 
Canada. I have a strong inshore fishery and a vibrant lobster, 
scallop and tuna fishery, among others. In fact, the minister 
recently announced an increase in the groundfish quota for cod and 
haddock in areas adjacent to my riding, the only such increase 
recommended in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	There are more than 100 fish processing plants located in 
communities spanning the entire length of my South Shore riding. I 
have the largest plant in Canada, National Sea Products, which 
employs approximately 615 people. I have some of the very 
smallest plants, enterprises that employ only one or two people.
<P>
	The proposed registration fees and inspection fees were a source 
of great concern to all processors but especially to many of the 
smaller ones.
<P>
	I want to thank the minister for recognizing the differences 
between fish processing operations and for taking action to help 
ease the burden of licence fees by capping registration fees at 
$1,000 for plants under 300 square metres and by imposing a cap of 
$10,000 per calendar year for product certification services to 
individual exporters which will go far in ensuring that our export 
sector remains competitive internationally.
<P>
	The minister's announcement about fees went a long way in 
demonstrating the government's willingness to listen to industry. In 
addition, a communications process has been implemented which 
is intended to bridge some of the gaps between Ottawa and the 
regions with respect to regulatory inspection issues.
<P>
	These positive developments have been encouraging to seafood 
producers, but there are still a number of outstanding concerns 
about future relationships between industry and seafood inspectors, 
especially since the introduction of Bill C-60 which establishes the 
new Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
<P>
	I have met on several occasions with representatives from Nova 
Scotia's major fish processing organizations. They have asked me 
to seek assurances from Ottawa that  the restructuring and 
amalgamation of food inspection services from three agencies will 
not 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5329"> 5329 </A></B>
<P>
cause further disruptions or jeopardize future competitiveness 
through new sets of rules and procedures.
<P>
	The fish processing sector has survived some very difficult years 
and has successfully adjusted to changes in the resource base, 
changes in the marketplace and changes brought forward by 
governments.
<P>
	I am not convinced that the industry can continue to weather a 
perpetual climate of uncertainty. I trust the minister is aware of the 
concerns being expressed by industry. Many fear that they may be 
swallowed up in a national food agency because the seafood sector 
is much smaller than the agriculture and pharmaceutical industries.
<P>
	I hope the minister will be able to assure fish processors that they 
will be well represented during the discussions about the structure 
and operation of the new food agency and that there will be a 
dedicated seafood division to oversee sector specific issues.
<P>
	The seafood companies in my riding would like to hear the 
minister's views about how the transition from fishery to the single 
food inspection agency will unfold and I will appreciate hearing 
what plans are in place to protect the interests of my province's 
leading industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his diligence in raising this important issue. The 
regulatory amendment dealing with cost recovery of fish 
inspection services is part of the federal government's overall 
program to reduce costs through increased efficiencies within all 
federal departments. In this regard, the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans has done its utmost to achieve overall government 
objectives.
<P>
	Within the DFO inspection program, costs to the taxpayers of 
Canada are being reduced from $33 million in 1990-91 to a 
projected $19 million in 1997-98. This projected figure includes 
$4.8 million that we are looking to raise through cost recovery. 
DFO is responsible for introducing a well recognized quality 
management program, which has produced greater efficiencies in 
providing the fish inspection services. Although efficiencies have 
been realized and costs reduced, it has not been sufficient to 
address the cost reduction figures to which the department is 
committed. Consequently, of the $14 million reduction in costs to 
taxpayers, $4.8 million will come from cost recovery.
<P>
	There is a regulatory process established by the Government of 
Canada dealing with implementation of cost recovery systems. The 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans has adhered to this process. In 
addition, during the summer of 1995, the department held a series 
of consultation session with industry. In March 1996, it provided 
industry with a communiqué informing that industry of theregulatory amendments and in April 1996, it pre-published the 
amendments in Part I of the <I>Canada Gazette</I> to allow for public 
comment.
<P>
	The process of consulting and developing the inspection cost 
recovery system has been ongoing for more than a year. The 
department has given consideration to all parties concerned and to 
all aspects of cost recovery. In fact, as a result of industry 
comments and in acknowledgement of the interests and concerns 
so eloquently and persuasively expressed by the hon. member, the 
minister did make adjustments to the cost recovery system for fish 
inspection. In addition to this, the department has committed itself 
to a review of the cost recovery system for fish inspection services 
after one year of implementation.
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	The department is committed to recovering a portion of costs 
incurred and providing fish inspection services. But it is also aware 
of the concerns of the industry. Industry consultations are part of 
the review process and have already been initiated.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FUELIMPORTS">FUEL IMPORTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, last week in the House I had the opportunity to ask the 
Minister of Natural Resources to comment on the proposal by 
Atomic Energy Canada and Ontario Hydro to import plutonium 
from the United States.
<P>
	That question was generated by several concerns that have been 
brought to me as the member of Parliament for 
London-Middlesex from the city council of London, Ontario, the 
county council of Middlesex County and other people in the area of 
southwestern Ontario who could be affected.
<P>
	There are several concerns that I would like to speak to briefly. 
The first and most important in my mind is the issue of public 
participation. The councils that I just mentioned and the private 
citizens who have contacted me are very concerned that there 
would be full public opportunity for input.
<P>
	Indeed the minister did assure me that would take place and I 
was very pleased with that answer. However, I am looking for a 
little more of a guarantee that there will be a full environmental 
assessment held before such a proposal would be approved and that 
throughout the province of Ontario there would be several 
opportunities for public input.
<P>
	The second concern is the issue of public health and protection 
of the environment. I think the question that needs to be asked after 
considerable analysis is whether we should even allow the 
importation of plutonium to Canada from foreign nations. There is 
consideration of importation from the United States and apparently 
from Russia as well.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5330"> 5330 </A></B>
<P>
	Third is the question of security and cost if such a proposal were 
to go forward. In all probability there would be importation 
through the city of Sarnia and transportation of such fuels to the 
Bruce nuclear plant some two to three hours drive, depending on 
the time of year and road conditions, along a very busy highway 
21, which is certainly not a major roadway. It is at times a 
dangerous and very busy highway. There is the question of 
security in the transportation of these fuels.
<P>
	Then there is the question of the need to enhance security at the 
plant itself, given the nature of the materials that would be stored at 
the Bruce nuclear power plant.
<P>
	Finally, there is the whole matter of radioactive waste which 
would be generated by the use of plutonium fuel. This obviously 
would become the problem of Ontario Hydro. That would then lead 
to the dangerous precedent being set that perhaps we would allow 
the importation of other radioactive wastes into Canada.
<P>
	That leads me to the issue of how one deals with such radioactive 
waste. There is a proposal being studied now that such wastes 
should be buried somewhere in the Canadian shield. There is a full 
environment assessment underway right now about that idea, but it 
all very uncertain.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would simply say that there are a number of very 
serious concerns which have been brought to my attention and to 
other colleagues in the House from southwestern Ontario in 
particular.
<P>
	While I appreciated the assurances the minister was able to give 
me last week on public participation, I am anxious to hear these 
other concerns addressed because my constituents are anxious as 
well to hear from the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the concept of 
using MOX fuel containing a small amount of weapons plutonium 
for the generation of electricity is attractive because it meets the 
swords into ploughshares objective and would result in positive 
non-proliferation and disarmament benefits. The use of MOX fuel 
in CANDU reactors is a concept under consideration by the United 
States and Russia and not an immediate project.
<P>
	If the studies and tests currently underway continue to confirm 
that the CANDU option is feasible, there would still have to be 
decisions taken on final disposition options by the United States 
and Russia. Any proposal involving the use of MOX fuel in 
CANDU reactors in Canada would be allowed to proceed only if it 
has the Canadian government's agreement.
<P>
	Any project proposal involving the use of CANDU reactors in 
Canada would have to meet all the requirements of strict federal 
and provincial legislation requirements such as the Atomic Energy 
Control Act and  the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. In 
other words, any project proposal would have to undergo
