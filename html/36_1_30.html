<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-16, in Clause 2, be amended by 
replacing lines 36 to 45 on page 5 and lines 1 and 2 on page 6 
with the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“529.5  A warrant under section 529.1 or an authorization 
under section 529 or 529.4 may be issued on an information 
submitted by telephone or other means of telecommunication and, 
for that purpose, section 487.1 applies, with any modifications 
that the circumstances require, to the warrant or authorization.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to this amendment with 
some regret that we are in this situation.  We are facing a 
problem within the Department of Justice when important 
amendments are being made to the Criminal Code that for all 
intents and purposes are being ramrodded through at the committee 
level and through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the supreme court decision in the Queen v Feeney, 
the Department of Justice was faced with a situation in which it 
had to fill a gap that had been left by the supreme court when it 
struck down sections of the Criminal Code that pertained to the 
powers of arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened here is akin to the trampling on the right of 
Parliament to actively and in a substantive way participate in 
the debate and the process to make recommendations as they 
pertain to the Criminal Code of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time was certainly of the essence. 
The supreme court, by virtue of a stay that was entered back in 
July of 1997, gave Parliament the time to react to fill the gap 
left by the decision handed down in the Queen v Feeney.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem that I have with this is that five and a half months 
have past.  The justice department was given ample opportunity to 
react, to make the appropriate amendments to address this 
situation.  By the time it reached committee stage, members of 
Parliament, the elected officials of this House, were given less 
than five days to consider it.  To be precise, they were given 
approximately eight hours to discuss, in the presence of 
witnesses and among each other, these very important amendments 
which affect the powers of arrest for all police throughout the 
land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee did have the benefit of hearing a number of very 
important witnesses.  The witnesses included the Canadian Police 
Association and the Canadian Chiefs of Police.  We heard from a 
victims' advocate group, the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims 
of Crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also had the benefit of hearing from a very distinguished 
criminal lawyer, a gentleman by the name of Irwin Koziebrocki. 
Mr. Koziebrocki is the treasurer of the Criminal Lawyers 
Association of Canada.  Of all the witnesses, he made a statement 
which I found quite startling.  He deemed one of the proposed 
amendments to be unconstitutional.  He said that it would not 
withstand a charter of rights challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that his opinion could not be wrong. However, 
when an experienced trial and appeal court lawyer makes this 
pronouncement before a committee, hours before the amendments are 
tabled and given third reading, that should give the department 
and all members of the committee reason to pause and to ponder 
whether we want to have this legislation pushed through in a 
flawed form, leaving it open to the possibility that within 
months, weeks or days we could be faced with another court 
challenge which may strike down, in the worst case scenario, 
these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment which I have put before the House pertains 
to the authorization of telewarrants in Canada. This amendment 
came about after some consultation with the Quebec bar 
association, which did not appear before the committee but which 
submitted a brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment speaks to the evolution of new technology in 
communications which should be made available to all peace 
officers in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of Canada, of this vast land, is that we are not all 
centred in large metropolitan areas like Calgary, Toronto or 
Halifax.  A great part of this country is spread out in rural 
areas.  Police officers are often working out of one or two 
person detachments.  They need to have access to justices of the 
peace.  They need to be able to get authorization to act quickly 
and in a very decisive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telewarrants, this new form of technology that we have with fax 
machines, with telephones and with cell phones, increase the 
possibility that a police officer can do something when faced 
with exigent circumstances.  Exigent circumstances is a newly 
coined phrase that came out of the decision of the Queen v 
Feeney.  Exigent circumstances often exist in the daily lives of 
police officers that are faced with very serious situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telewarrants permit police officers to contact justices of the 
peace, but that is all for naught if the resources are not 
allocated to make justices of the peace available.  It is easy to 
pick up a phone or to dial a fax number, but if no one is on the 
other end of the line to receive the information and authorize 
the warrant, a real problem exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that this amendment goes further than the 
present amendment as proposed by the government in enabling peace 
officers in broader circumstances to avail themselves of the 
ability to have a warrant granted. 
I want to add to that the necessity of the resources.  The 
resources have to go cheek and jowl with the ability to get these 
warrants.  We need to ensure that there are going to be more 
justices of the peace available, particularly in rural parts of 
the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would emphasize the remarks I made at the outset.  It is with 
some regret I find myself in this situation where we have to 
debate this further on the floor of the House of Commons.  The 
committee level, had it been conducted in a more professional and 
timely way, would have avoided this necessity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment is one that all members of the House should 
consider and support.  It goes to increasing the security for all 
Canadians and aids the police in their very important role in 
enforcing the criminal law within the country. As members of this 
House, particularly members of the justice committee, we have to 
be very strident in our attempts to oversee what is happening 
with the amendments to the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice, the chief executive officer for 
administering law in this country, can and should have at least 
contemplated the necessity of rising from her seat, walking down 
Wellington Street, knocking on the door of the Supreme Court of 
Canada and ask for an extension.  It would have avoided the 
necessity of pushing this through at the eleventh hour.  It would 
have allowed us to have proper debate at the committee level and 
if necessary on the floor of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak in favour of this amendment.  I would be very interested 
to hear the remarks of the hon. members present today.

<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to start by repeating what has already been said in the 
House, which is that the government was obliged by the supreme 
court to ensure that both sides of the House could meet a court set 
deadline.  This was not a deadline set by the government but 
imposed on us by the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also add that in my view sufficient time has been 
allowed, both in the House and in committee, for opposition motions 
to be brought.  Unfortunately, only one was received in committee. 
There was no discussion by the opposition on these motions. 
This is really stretching a point, because there was ample time 
available Wednesday evening for discussion and the opposition 
brought no amendments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that we feel that, yes, the deadline 
is a little short.  The deadline was imposed on us by the supreme 
court.  It was not a deadline that we imposed on this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there was ample time.  The committee members on the 
government side were more than willing to spend more time 
discussing any motion brought forward by any member of the 
opposition.  None of these motions was brought forward. There was 
discussion but none of the motions was brought forward to be 
discussed at the committee level.  The opposition members decided 
to bring them forward in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fearmongering from the opposition by saying this will be 
unconstitutional is presumptive on the part of the opposition. We 
do not know whether this will be declared unconstitutional. We 
had no constitutional experts that came before the committee to 
to testify except a lawyer.  I think that is an assumption that 
should not have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not able to support motion No. 1. This affects 
the very notion of practicability.  The rule with respect to 
telewarrants is that the police are not in a position to meet a 
justice of the peace in person.  This rule has been on the books 
for approximately 10 years.  It is nothing new and it is seen as 
necessary to defend the constitutionality of the entire 
telewarrant scheme in the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions 2, 4 and 6 all relate to the use of the singular to 
refer to dwelling house in the bill.  Some have argued that in 
order to allow for warrants to apply to more than one dwelling 
house we need to refer to dwelling house in the plural.  That is 
why we have the Interpretation Act. 
The Interpretation Act already provides that the singular 
includes the plural.  All federal legislation, and this 
legislation in particular, Bill C-16, has been drafted with that 
rule in mind.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment seems to undermine the way all federal 
legislation is drafted and would be a bad precedent in my 
opinion. It would make the interpretation of other statutes more 
difficult and uncertain in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not able to support this motion as it is inconsistent 
with other provisions of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Motion No 3, we are not able to support this motion either. 
The reason is that the motion addresses form 7 because it is a 
warrant for arrest. This warrant has been known to law for over 
100 years and requires that the person be identified.  If we 
cannot identify a person we should not be seeking a warrant for 
an arrest.  That implies a person has been charged with a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government would be amenable for supporting Motion 
No. 5, and I will speak to that motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment relates to form 7.1 and section 529.1 of the 
Criminal Code.  The amendment would make it clear in the form 
what is already permitted by section 529.1. That section makes it 
possible to obtain a warrant for entry in order to arrest someone 
who is identifiable as opposed to identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that if this form were amended as proposed by the hon. 
member we would be improving on the language in the bill by 
making it perfectly clear on the form itself that this is 
possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to this extremely important bill. Like the members 
who spoke before me, I think I will say a few words on the procedure 
imposed on the Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that it is following a decision by the Supreme Court of 
Canada in the Feeney case that the government was required so to speak 
to amend the provisions if it wanted to correct the situation. 
The ruling was made on May 22, 1997, in the middle of the electoral 
campaign. However, as I openly said in committee—and there is no reason 
to hide this—officials wisely held consultations across Canada and 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern in all this is that there were no consultations before 
the political side of this issue was addressed, that it was only on 
Friday of last week that Bill C-16, which is in fact very important, was 
tabled in this House, which has been sitting for eight weeks. It may not 
be the fault of the Liberal members, but it is surely the fault of the 
federal government's cumbersome bureaucracy and procedures if we have to 
accelerate the review process as we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, after consulting with people who have an interest in 
seeing this bill improve the Criminal Code, I believe that this bill is 
generally acceptable. We do not support it without reservations, but 
considering the time we have to review it, I believe that as a first 
step, it is something we can live with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with the amendments in each group. I will speak very 
briefly on the first group, which includes Motion No. 1. I think that 
the wording of Section 529.5 in Bill C-16 reflects in fact what is found 
in other provisions, other laws. I don't think we should amend this 
section as proposed by the member of the Conservative Party. I think 
that the wording in the section on telewarrants meets requirements that 
have already been established in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read it to you because I think it clearly indicates that 
such warrants may only be issued in exceptional circumstances.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rule is that the peace officer must appear personally before 
the judge to make an application for a warrant, but it can happen in 
exceptional circumstances that it would be impracticable, to use the 
words in the section, or impossible for the police officer to appear 
before a judge. It can also be an emergency situation—and there is a 
section that deals with these—, and the police officer cannot appear 
before a judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The section, which is very clear, says the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a peace officer believes that it would be 
impracticable in the circumstances to appear personally before 
a judge or justice to make an application for a warrant under 
Section 529.1 or an authorization under Section 529 or 529.4, 
the warrant or authorization may be issued on an information 
submitted by telephone or other means of telecommunication 
and, for that purpose, Section 487.1 applies, with any 
modifications that the circumstances require, to the warrant 
or authorization. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the wording reflects the purpose of this section, and 
to keep our laws in general as simple as possible, I believe that we 
should not amend this section because it is similar to all other 
sections dealing with telewarrants. That is why we will oppose Motion 
No. 1 as presented.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thought I might have to get up on a chair to get 
noticed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret very much the situation that the House finds itself in 
at the moment from a number of points of view.  I thought there 
had been an understanding to dispose of this matter by today. Now 
it appears that technically speaking that was not the case. There 
was only an agreement, technically speaking, to begin the debate 
today and this will now carry over, I presume.  It also means 
that some of us, having taken the agreement a little more 
seriously than others, find ourselves in a bit of difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamentally I think the government has to take some 
responsibility for this because I see a pattern emerging here.  I 
think this is the third time in this Parliament when we have been 
presented with something that has to be dealt with by a certain 
date.  There is always truth in that claim but the truth comes 
from the fact that the government has left it until the 11th 
hour, so to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition in some cases has been co-operative and in some 
cases not.  The government made a similar argument with respect, 
for instance, to the CPP, that it had to have this through by a 
particular time because it had an agreement with the provinces 
and were prepared to move closure on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In respect of this particular bill, we thought that the 
government's argument had more merit but was not entirely 
meritorious in the sense that this is something the government 
has known about since July.  It is also something Parliament 
could have been dealing with when we first got back. If the 
government had done its work between the time it was elected and 
the time that Parliament came back we would not be in the 
situation we are in this week where we only had one week to deal 
with these particular amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why these amendments could not have been moved in 
committee but I assume there must have been some good reason why 
the hon. member moved them now at report stage.  Perhaps he tried 
and the government prevented it in some way.  However, it is 
surely the case that the amendments we have now before us mean 
that this will be carried over until after the break unless there 
is some procedural way of dealing with this that I do not know 
about at the moment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am proposing in this amendment a very 
practical common sense solution that would go a long way in 
assisting police officers when encountering a situation where 
they are looking for an escaped criminal, breach of parole 
individual, or looking for a person wanted by the police for a 
serious or indictable offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its present form this amendment speaks of the naming of a 
single dwelling house.  I know the government's response may 
include the Interpretation Act wherein the singular includes the 
plural.  One of the purposes of parliament should be to create 
new, wordy and mellifluous sounding legislation and to simplify 
for the police, and as I said in the House yesterday for the 
purpose of the general public, understanding of the legislation 
that directly applies to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment is quite simple in its drafting.  It includes 
dwelling houses rather than dwelling house.  It would allow a 
police officer faced with a situation where he had to seek a 
warrant to go and speak to the justice of the peace and explain. 
It also allows him to name specifically the areas where he is 
looking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if a criminal was believed to be harboured in the 
home of a friend, at a clubhouse or at a residence that he was 
known to frequent, the police could quite simply place on the 
warrant a number of dwelling houses or house in which they were 
searching for him.  It gives the police more flexibility in their 
ability to investigate.  It is a very straightforward amendment. 
I would be surprised if the government were not quick to embrace 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to address a question posed by my hon. friend from 
the NDP with respect to why this is the forum in which to make 
these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated earlier, what occurred in committee was a simple 
ramrod railroad approach to clause by clause discussion of these 
amendments.  There was no opportunity to discuss or to put these 
amendments forward.  It was done in the blink of an eye without 
any ability to put the amendments forward in any substantive way, 
to the point where we were so rushed in the compromise of this 
committee that we did not even have the opportunity to speak of 
the ground rules that would govern the committee itself.  This 
was done after the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We brought this piece of legislation to the committee level 
without having set the rules to govern the committee that was 
going to be making decisions on the amendments.  This causes me 
great concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not blame the parliamentary secretary. 
I have empathy for her and the chairman of the justice committee 
who found themselves in this position and were doing the 
government's bidding in a very uncomfortable situation.

Speaker, I will not speak more than a few moments.  I want to 
reply briefly to what the member from the government side said 
and to support my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government made the point that it has an obligation to pass 
the legislation as quickly as possible.  The Liberals had six 
months. They knew it was coming but they have left it to the 11th 
hour.  We have seen time and time again in the last four years 
that they ram things through at the last moment.  I want to 
register my objection to the process here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not have the opportunity at committee to introduce a lot 
of these amendments.  I support the amendments that are being 
made.  I think they are being put forth in good faith.  They are 
proper amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is dismissing them at hand because they come from 
the opposition.  I do not think that is acceptable.  I would like 
to register my objection to these kinds of things happening in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For democracy to function properly we need time to look at 
legislation, to examine it properly and to make sure it is the 
best legislation we can have.  We have seen too much legislation 
being passed with time allocation, being rammed through at the 
last minute.  Then we come back and realize that we did not get 
it right, that we made some grave errors.  It is happening again 
and again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have done this months ago.  This could have been 
introduced at the beginning of this Parliament but it was not. 
That ought to be on the record to show that we do not like what 
is happening in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to 
the comment made by the parliamentary secretary that the 
government had to get this legislation through.  There was 
reference to the court essentially setting a deadline without any 
compromise.  That is not the case.  There is precedent that there 
can be extensions.  A request could have been made to the supreme 
court quite simply.  That is my point of clarification.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will take 30 seconds since I want this bill to pass 
today.  However, I want to add my voice to these three motions: 
Motions Nos. 2, 4 and 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say first off that I oppose these motions and I will 
tell you why briefly.  As we know, an arrest warrant, a warrant to 
enter a dwelling house or other similar warrants already 
contravenes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  It is 
somewhat similar, in fact, to what happened in the arrest in the 
Feeney case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the amendment proposed by the hon. member broadening 
the scope of arrest or entry warrants to apply to dwelling houses 
contravenes the charter.  It is too broad and too vague.  I think 
we are leaving ourselves open once again to criticism, and 
certainly to having these amendments to Bill C-16, or more 
specifically, clause 529.6, rejected by the courts as in the Feeney 
case.  This is our only reason for opposing these three motions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker. 
I have two points. First, unless I heard wrong, in calling the vote you 
mentioned only Motion No. 2, while the vote should have been on Group 
No. 2, which includes three motions: Motions Nos. 2, 4 and 6. A vote was 
called on Motion No. 2 only. This was my first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, while I sit at the other end of the chamber, it was obvious 
to me that the nays were louder than the yeas. I wonder if there has not 
been a misunderstanding here. If so, perhaps you could consider taking 
the vote over, specifying this time that the vote will be on Motions 
Nos. 2, 4 and 6.

<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it would be most unusual if the House were to somehow 
try to overturn your ruling by doing what I do not understand it 
to be permitted to do, which is to appeal your judgment of what 
you heard in terms of yeas and nays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to share the view that you heard differently than I 
heard.  But it is up to the Chair to judge what the Chair hears 
and to make that judgment.  It puts the House in a rather 
difficult position, because certainly had you ruled the other way 
with respect to yeas and nays, opposition members would have had 
a chance to decide whether they wanted a recorded vote on this. 
Perhaps they would have risen anyway.  The irony is that the 
government was forced by virtue of your ruling to cause a 
recorded vote on the very thing that it did not want a recorded 
vote on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the government regards that as unfortunate but whether 
it is reversible or not is another matter.

pertains particularly to the forms used in a warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In circumstances where the exact name of the individual sought 
is unknown to police officers, rather than put in the actual 
written name of that individual, they could put in a physical 
description, thus increasing their ability in investigations 
where the name of the person sought by police for whatever reason 
could be pencilled in. Obviously this will be at the discretion 
of the justice of the peace.  It is something that will be 
monitored.  It is not an arbitrary or frivolous change to the 
form that would be included in the warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would strenuously suggest that this is something to which the 
government should give due consideration in its adaptation of 
both amendments with respect to clause 3 in the bill, as they 
pertain to Form 7 and Form 7.1. 
For those reasons I would again solicit the support of the House,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on Tuesday, November 11 Canadians will mark a minute of silence 
for those who gave their lives for the freedom, democracy and 
peace we enjoy in this country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father was one of those men.  He was a navigator in the RCAF 
and never returned from the second world war.  As a result, I 
grew up with only a photograph and the stories and memories 
passed on by my mother to tell me what a wonderful man my father 
was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us can only imagine what it was like for those men like 
my father.  Their sacrifice was so great and so meaningful we 
must never forget the contributions made during the wars.  No 
words can convey that to anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore as the House will not be sitting on Remembrance Day, I 
ask that we remember November 11 is not a holiday.  It is a day 
to remember those who fought and died for this wonderful country.

Speaker, global climate change presents one of the most 
significant challenges the world has ever faced.  Reducing

the world's nations when they meet next month in Kyoto, Japan to 
reach an agreement to solve this problem.

it also presents a number of important opportunities for Canadian 
companies and know-how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has long been a leader in the development and export of 
environmentally sound technology.  The worldwide effort to reduce 
greenhouse gases will result in a growing foreign market for 
Canadian expertise abroad and the creation of jobs at home.

employ 1.7 million Canadians and provide 200,000 more jobs than 
the largest 100 Canadian companies combined.

I rise today to draw the attention of the house to Project 
Loophole.  Choices, a Winnipeg based coalition for social 
justice, is challenging in the Federal Court of Canada in Toronto 
the $2.2 billion family trust tax manoeuvre identified and 
criticized by the Auditor General of Canada.  The case is to be 
heard later this month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Choices is to be commended for pursuing this issue.  Tax 
avoidance is one of the far too hidden dimensions of why the 
government finds itself without the revenues it needs.  Yet this 
same government not only does not cite tax avoidance as a factor 
in its fiscal situation that needs to be dealt with, instead it 
actively encourages tax avoidance by sending departmental 
officials to act as resource persons at privately sponsored tax 
avoidance workshops on tax shelters, offshore havens, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no surprise really.  When we see the kinds of prices the 
Liberals are able to charge for their fund-raising dinners, we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, last 
night 1,500 people paid $500 each to attend the prime minister's 
exclusive fund-raising dinner.  I do not suppose many of them 
spend much time worrying about minor things like the Canada 
pension plan or unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for ordinary Canadians things just got a little 
rougher.  The national unemployment rate climbed back up to 9.1%. 
There were 104,000 fewer Canadians working in October than in the 
month before that, which means 104,000 families are facing 
serious trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians see the golf clubs, the caviar and the champagne so 
where are the job, jobs, jobs? 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are disappointed that employment fell slightly in 
October but it followed seven consecutive months of solid job 
growth.  Since the beginning of the year 268,000 new jobs have 
been created, which is nearly double the number of jobs created 
over the same period in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unemployment is down nearly a full point from where it was a 
year ago.  Therefore I am confident in saying that if we continue 
to work to create more jobs we will be accomplishing this with 
the policies that have worked well so far. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
suppose hope springs eternal in the heart of a Liberal, but he 
probably wrote that answer some time last night between cocktails 
and caviar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not think there is an excuse for these numbers.  Our 
number one trading partner and competitor, the United States, 
just reported that its unemployment rate is now 4.7%, just half 
of what ours is.  Across the border they are enjoying the lowest 
unemployment rate in 24 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has it come to this?  Is looking outside the country the only 
place that unemployed Canadians can expect to find work? 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. member's 
question, let us talk about the headlines in the paper just this 
morning:  “Dust off those resumés, the job market is heating 
up”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the fact that Statistics Canada recently 
stated that the jobs are here and that the help wanted index has 
hit its highest level in almost seven years.  The help wanted 
index is an indication of where those jobs and the employment 
level will be in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
suppose that kind of answer sold pretty well last night at the 
prime minister's shindig.  I bet it sounded good somewhere right 
around the Dom Perignon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ordinary Canadians, the kind of people the government seems to 
forget about, are now in the 85th consecutive month of high 
unemployment, seven solid years of unemployment above 9%.  Is 
this the best the Liberals can offer unemployed people?  Are 
Canadians really sentenced to 9% unemployment forever or just 
until the government is replaced? 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me repeat for the hon. 
member that 268,000 new jobs have been created since the 
beginning of this year, nearly doubling the number of jobs 
created over the same period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case the hon. member did not understand me the first time, 
the help wanted index is an indicator of where the employment 
numbers will be in the future.  They have hit the highest level 
in seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prospects look very positive for the employment numbers.  We 
will continue as a government to pursue the policies to ensure 
that employment is first and foremost in the numbers.

If further action is necessary it will be taken.

question is for the government which is in denial on 
unemployment.  It continues to spout numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think unemployed families today who are listening to 
this question period will be very impressed by the statistics. 
Rather, I would like to know why the government is not listening 
to the business community which repeatedly asks the government to 
reduce employment insurance premium rates so that we can create 
more jobs.  Why does it not act on this basic, simple 
recommendation which would allow more Canadians to get back into 
the labour market?

so.

what is wrong with the government.

inaccurate impression of the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not been raising unemployment insurance premiums.  We 
have been reducing them.  It was the Conservative government of 
which he was a part that let them go to record levels.  I have to 
admire his nerve to try to change the reality and facts of what

immigrants, the Government of Canada remains responsible for 
their admissibility and must therefore ensure they are healthy

areas of Canada that have been used for testing or training 
purposes are of concern.  There are quite a number of defence 
sites across the country that need cleaning up, not only of 
explosives and lethal devices, but also for environmental 
reasons. The government has a major program under way to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, of course, concern that this clean-up will involve 
substantial amounts of time as well as money.  But on behalf of

It allows me to point out that this summer the Atlantic salmon 
returns were possibly one-third of what was expected. This was 
the result of at-sea conditions.  The escapement from the rivers, 
the escapement from hatcheries, were as good for this year as in 
previous years from the fish that returned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However at-sea conditions resulted in a very substantial 
reduction.  It is a major matter of concern for the government.

and I will be happy to discuss them with the member more fully 
when I have more than 35 seconds, which is what the Speaker

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to read the conclusion of the joint 
committee's report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommend that the two houses of Parliament adopt the 
resolution to amend section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867, as 
tabled in the House of Commons on October 1, 1997, and in the 
Senate on October 9, 1997. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to say at the outset that the caucus of the Reform Party strongly 
believes that education is exclusively under provincial jurisdiction and 
that it is essential that this be fully respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we might add that the proposed amendment does not address 
minority language educational rights or the establishment of linguistic 
school boards. What is at stake here is the denominational rights 
protected by section 93 of the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments to the Constitution should never be passed without due 
consideration or in haste. We believe that before any constitutional 
amendment is passed, Parliament must make sure there is democratic 
consent, that the amendment respects the rule of law and that it is in 
the national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it adversely affects enshrined minority rights, Parliament must 
be especially careful that the democratic consent includes indisputable 
agreement on the part of the minority. We have come to the conclusion 
that the motion does not meet these requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Reform Party would rather see a provincial referendum 
before Parliament considers any amendment under section 93. This 
referendum should be on a clear question and the rules of the process 
should be fair. Such a referendun would have shown us how extensive 
public support is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we believe it is essential that the people of Canada, 
ordinary citizens, be consulted when major changes are contemplated, but 
the Quebec government has chosen not to hold any referendum on this 
issue. There have been neither public hearings on this proposed 
amendment to section 93 nor a free vote in the National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, this committee should ensure that what it proposes meets the 
second requirement: respecting the rule of law. Is the appropriate 
amending formula being used? Some have questioned the appropriateness of 
the bilateral process. The proposal was sanctioned by the Government of

Standing Order 36, I would like to present a petition on behalf

quite frequent. There are laws in Canada to protect children 
against this form of nudity in all media, but currently there are 
no laws protecting children in public places.

legislation to amend the Criminal Code, specifically sections 173

clearly state that a woman exposing her breasts in a public place 
is an indecent act.

like to draw to the attention of the House that managing the 
family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable 
profession which has not been recognized for its value to our 
society. They also point out that the Income Tax Act does not 
take into account the cost of raising children in its provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to 
pursue initiatives to eliminate this discrimination against

preschool children.

the second petition has to do with alcohol misuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that the consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health 
problems and particularly that fetal alcohol syndrome and other 
alcohol related birth defects are 100% preventable by avoiding 
consumption during pregnancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to

consumption.

the final petition has to do with our everyday heroes on the 
front line, police officers and firefighters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that our police officers and firefighters are required to place 
their lives at risk on a daily basis and that the public mourns 
the loss when one of them loses their life in the line of duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to 
establish a public safety officers compensation fund for the 
benefit of families of police officers, firefighters and other 
public safety officers who lose their lives in the line of duty.

British Columbia are urging the government to demonstrate support 
of education and literacy by eliminating the sales tax on reading 
materials. They also ask Parliament to zero rate books, magazines 
and newspapers under the GST. Also they say that as the provinces

materials must be zero rated under the provincial sales taxes as 
well as the GST.

petition is a large one. This brings to a total of nearly 15,000 
names from the greater Kamloops area that are on record as asking 
the government to remove section 745 of the Criminal Code which 
they say allows murderers to apply for a reduction in the number 
of years of imprisonment notwithstanding having been tried, 
convicted and sentenced in a court of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with their sentiment.  They are asking Parliament to

matter, petitioners from Kamloops and Clearwater, British 
Columbia outline a large list of reasons why the present tax 
system needs to be changed.  I will not go into the reasons 
because they are already clear on the public record. They are

the speakers are having trouble with that today.  It is 
prophetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel this matter can be given unanimous consent, but I want to 
rise to address it on two points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we are reverting to deal with this motion is that the 
government's process on how it has handled this whole bill and 
the amendments surrounding this bill along with the amendments to 
the bill itself has been so seriously flawed that, as it is 
trying to rush it through this House, mistakes were made earlier 
this day by people forcing a vote on this amendment. The 
government does not want an amendment because it wants it pushed 
through today and today it must go through.  None of us on this 
side of the House want to hold that up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what has happened is another example of what happens in 
this place when legislation is brought in at the last minute, 
when it is rushed through committee where there is no chance of 
bringing in amendments like this, when there is no chance to 
bring expert opinion to bear on amendments, when there is not an 
opportunity to hear all sides of it. That is what happens when 
this stuff is pushed through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said as much in committee.  I want to repeat it here again 
today. This is a problem with the flawed process of last minute, 
last ditch, knife at your throat, let us get this thing passed or 
else attitude that the government brings on this legislation. It 
is wrong, wrong, wrong.  I just want to point out that we are 
reverting to this motion because the process is so flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to caution the Speaker in accepting this motion. 
There have been discussions with all parties and we are in 
agreement to revert to this motion to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However earlier today, five members at least stood in their 
place and demanded a recorded vote on this motion.  The caution I 
have on that is what if those five members have now left the

unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to go on record to say that this cannot be construed 
as a precedent setting incident.  It is only because the 
government House leader assures me that the members who stood on 
his side of the House and asked for this vote are in agreement 
with this and will not be coming back on the House and accusing 
anyone in here of somehow doing something inappropriate in the 
democratic process.

I would like to say briefly that the point made by the Reform 
Party whip is a good one.  I too very much regret that we have to 
do what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be a bad precedent if it in any way were to be 
understood as a precedent.  I think this needs to be understood 
as an aberration.  I think the point is well made that one could 
certainly imagine a future circumstance in which the leadership 
of all parties, in fact all parties, might conspire to overturn 
the will of five members who might not have been acting in 
concert with their parties, causing a vote to be taken by 
standing and forcing a recorded division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should in no way be seen as a precedent in respect of any 
future circumstance.  In the future we would have to have 
guarantees, as we have today, that the members who caused the 
vote to be taken were in agreement with the procedure we are now 
following.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we take the

and has duly noted all the comments made by all the members on 
both sides of the Chamber concerning this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair also recognizes that a precedent is not set when 
unanimous consent is requested.  Any member of the House may deny 
unanimous consent and therefore a precedent is not set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to this bill, the House did give unanimous consent 
earlier to exceptionally deal with this legislation, to pass it 
at report and third reading stages today. Therefore the House has 
already expressed its desire to see this legislation proceed.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be very brief. I will deal with Motions Nos. 3 and 5, and I do 
realize that they have been separated. You separated Motion No. 3 from 
Motion No. 5, with unanimous consent. There will be a separate vote on 
these motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 3 and 5 are similar, but Motion No. 3 deals with the 
warrant for arrest. I realize that the member wants more flexibility and 
would like police officers to have more powers to serve a warrant for 
arrest. However, it should be remembered that with respect to the 
warrant for arrest itself, which is outlined on page 6 of the bill 
starting at line five, the police officers already know who the person 
involved is. 
This warrant for arrest applies to a known individual. We know his age, 
his address, his date of birth, his social insurance number, etc. 
Therefore with respect to the warrant for arrest that the member of the 
Conservative Party would like to broaden somewhat, I wish to say here 
that this is not necessary, since the police officers already have the 
information. So it is not necessary to give all those details. We will 
vote against Motion No. 3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Motion No. 5, and I will speak to it now so that I will not 
have to rise later, on the warrant to enter a dwelling-house, we agree 
with this and we will vote for this amendment because in this case, this 
is useful and it gives police officers more powers to obtain a warrant 
to enter a dwelling-house without necessarily knowing the name of the 
individual who is there, as long as they have a description. For 
example, he is tall, he is dressed in a blue suit, he has brown hair, he 
has brown eyes, he belongs to the Bloc perhaps. 
In this way we have more information and we can enter a dwelling-house 
without necessarily having the name of the individual, his date of birth 
and other similar information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, for these reasons, we will vote against Motion No. 3 but 
we will vote for Motion No. 5.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise again with respect to this amendment as it 
pertains to a revision or an adaptation to an amendment contained 
in Bill C-16.  This refers specifically to form 7.1 as it exists 
currently in the Criminal Code.  The amendment is aimed 
specifically at allowing a police officer in the form of the 
warrant to include a description as it pertains to a person the 
police are seeking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That person may be found within a dwelling House and may be 
unknown in terms of the actual name of the person sought by the 
police.  The acceptance of this amendment and including this in 
the form would allow the police to give a description to a 
justice of the peace that is acceptable to the justice of the 
peace to the extent that they might then fill out the warrant. 
The police could therefore go to the dwelling house named in the 
warrant and make proper arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still judicial discretion.  The justice of the peace 
will always have the discretion to refuse the police if that 
description is unnecessary.  So there are sufficient safeguards 
in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to speak at length.  The proposed amendment is 
very straightforward.  Mr. Speaker, I believe you will unanimous 
consent with respect to this amendment.

<A NAME="LINK247">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should support 
equality among the provinces and Canadians in general by ensuring 
that no province be recognized as a distinct society within the 
Constitution of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to begin debate on the 
private member's motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the recent Calgary declaration the merit of the 
motion should be self-evident to all Canadians.  Given the desire 
of traditional parties to cling to the concept of distinct 
society, I am under no illusions about the criticism they will 
offer today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To start, there will be those who will criticize the initiative 
before us as being anti-Quebec.  To those who feel this way I 
respond in advance that like the Calgary declaration the motion 
is not anti-anything.  It is in essence pro Canadian.  It is 
crafted with the desire to create a new Canada where everyone is 
proud to be a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this with a great deal of confidence.  The motion before 
us is pro Canadian in the sense that it recognizes a fundamental 
principle held in the hearts of all Canadians, namely that we are 
all equal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us is about advancing the principle of 
equality among all Canadians and entrenching the paramount 
importance of individual rights.  The protection of individual 
rights is also significant.  One of the major faults in the Meech 
and Charlottetown accords was that they sought to 
constitutionally entrench a collective right.  In doing so, there 
would have existed within the Canadian constitution the potential 
that individual rights could be made subservient to the 
collective right of a distinct society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This argument was based on the widely held and correct 
perception among Canadians that recognition of Quebec as a 
distinct society would confer some collective right on the 
peoples of that province not conferred on the others.  Therein 
lay the problem and the dilemma faced by constitutional framers 
and politicians, the same people who tried on numerous occasions 
to ram distinct society through with little or no regard for the 
real feelings of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the response from the traditional party leaders at the 
federal and provincial levels?  They resorted to labelling anyone 
who opposed the distinct society initiative as unpatriotic.  They 
also played on the fears of Canadians by saying that the country 
would fall apart without such an amendment to the constitution. 
The country is still here.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse still, there was a deliberate attempt to mislead Canadians 
about what distinct society really meant.  At the time we had the 
former prime minister of the last place party telling Canadians 
outside Quebec that distinct society was nothing more than a 
symbolic recognition of that province's place in Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to briefly touch on that symbolic recognition.  This is 
what distinguishes the Calgary declaration from Meech and 
Charlottetown.  Meech and Charlottetown attempted to entrench 
distinct society as an interpretive clause which would give 
additional powers to Quebec.  The Calgary declaration does 
nothing more than recognize what is a historical fact accepted by 
Reformers and Canadians in general, principally that the language 
and culture of Quebec make it unique but, and here is the key, 
this fact in no way takes away from the equality of Canadians or 
confers additional powers to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the problem with Meech and Charlottetown.  Both 
initiatives tried to craft this historical recognition into a 
constitutional power afforded only to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the while and within Quebec the former prime minister and 
the late Premier Bourassa were saying just that.  To hear them 
tell it, the clause would be used to enhance that province's 
powers within federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal doublespeak and actions on distinct society would be 
quite funny if they were not so terribly sad for the future of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to deal with what I see is the potential harm in the 
collective right of distinct society ever becoming entrenched. 
Granted this will be speculative because thankfully the clause is 
not in the Constitution.  That has more to do with the wisdom of 
Canadians than it does the foresight of traditional politicians 
who even now think entrenchment of distinct society will solve 
the unity problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, the arguments concerning the potential harm of 
entrenching distinct society are speculative but they are not 
without a historical precedent to back them up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to briefly discuss the precedent.  The lessons and 
arguments in that instance will serve to highlight what I feel 
are the pitfalls where distinct society is concerned.  Patriation 
of the Canadian Constitution was achieved to some degree because 
the federal government was able to secure an agreement with nine 
of the ten provinces.  The federal government had acted 
unilaterally but the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that some 
provincial support was needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of that court decision would figure prominently in 
the effort to settle on a text for the Constitution, but in the 
finished document that became the Constitution Act, 1982, there 
also was a clause known as the notwithstanding clause.  This 
clause was part of the price the federal government had to pay 
for getting an agreement on the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rationale behind the notwithstanding clause was to place 
some kind of a constitutional check on the powers of the federal 
government.  At the time some premiers believed this was needed 
to in part prevent legislation or new spending initiatives which 
might cross into areas of provincial jurisdiction.  It was also 
believed that this clause would help in securing Quebec's 
signature on the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from the rationale and intentions behind the 
notwithstanding clause, good, bad or otherwise, there were those 
who saw the potential danger in having a constitution which could 
allow a province to disregard federal legislation or a ruling by 
the supreme court concerning the constitutionality of a 
provincial law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This potential danger is significant because the arguments used 
to downplay the consequences at that time are the same ones used 
now with respect to distinct society.  In this regard it is no 
small wonder then that Canadians feel successive governments have 
learned nothing from past constitutional experiences.  They have 
little or no faith in the sincerity of politicians to do what is 
best or in their ability to deal with the national unity problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is truly tragic. 
And as someone whose name escapes me at the moment once said, 
“Those who do not learn from the mistakes of the past are 
destined to repeat them.”

foresight saw that a province might use the clause to override 
the charter of rights and that in so doing, the rights of 
individuals in that province could be damaged.  That is exactly 
what did happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we need not concern ourselves with the circumstances under 
which the use of that clause came about. We will visit that in 
due course. What is now relevant were the arguments used at that 
time to allay fears that the notwithstanding clause would ever be 
used by any province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we remember them well. They are hauntingly familiar to 
those used by former and present governments seeking to mollify 
Canadians about the constitutional impact of the distinct society 
provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, in response to a well-founded fear that some province 
might use the notwithstanding clause, the government of the day 
sought to minimize the chance of this ever happening. The 
political media and to a lesser extent, the academic elites, said 
“Oh, this will never happen.  No province would ever use the 
notwithstanding clause. The political price of using it would be 
too great for any province.  The court of public opinion in that 
province would stop a government from invoking the clause” and 
on and on it went. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, the predictions were ignored and political leaders 
felt secure in their belief that the override provision would 
never, ever be used.  But of course they were wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us fast forward from 1982 to 1989 when the Government of 
Quebec invoked the notwithstanding clause.  The province did this 
in response to a Supreme Court of Canada ruling which found 
Quebec's language law, bill 178, to be unconstitutional and 
violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not so much interested in why the notwithstanding clause 
was used.  It is far more revealing to delve into parallels 
between the potential dangers it posed and those which by 
extension are inherent in the distinct society clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The politicians of the day had not been completely wrong about 
the effect of public opinion surrounding Quebec's use of the 
notwithstanding clause. The problem was that the court of public 
opinion did not change a thing and its full impact reaction was 
well after the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, some negative fallout was incurred by the Quebec 
government on the issue. For as constitutional as their use of 
the notwithstanding clause had been, it did not sit well with 
people inside and outside of Quebec who expressed concern that 
the provincial government had effectively trampled on the rights 
of English speaking Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was needed then was an amendment to the Canadian 
Constitution, one that would allow Quebec to side step the 
charter of rights in matters such as language and not put the 
province in the awkward position of having to use the 
notwithstanding clause in order to do it. Such an amendment must 
allow the province of Quebec to make laws similar to bill 178. 
However, it must also ensure that such laws could not be 
challenged as unconstitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the Canadian Constitution would have to be interpreted 
in such a way as to recognize the province's rights to make such 
laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the very beginning of that notion is born the idea of 
distinct society, in effect, an amendment which would allow 
Quebec to override the Constitution by giving it the power to 
take whatever steps were necessary to preserve and promote Quebec 
as a distinct society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now examine the predictions and the potential dangers of 
how a distinct society clause might truly impact on the 
Constitution.  Indeed, the alarm bells that went unheeded with 
respect to the notwithstanding clause are the same ones ringing 
again over distinct society today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If, as governments in Quebec have demanded, the Canadian 
Constitution and charter of rights must be interpreted in a 
fashion that recognizes Quebec as a distinct society, what 
happens in a situation where individual rights, such as freedom 
of expression, conflict with this collective right based on 
culture and language? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually the question is rhetorical because we all know the 
answer.  It is just that there are those who are loathe to admit 
it, or refuse to accept it, or do not want the rest of the 
country to really understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using the situation surrounding the supreme court's 
consideration of Quebec's bill 178, a distinct society clause 
would have allowed the supreme court to come back and say bill 
178 was constitutional.  The highest court in the land would have 
been able to say this. “The law must be considered in light of a 
clause which states that the Constitution shall be interpreted in 
a manner consistent with the recognition that Quebec constitutes 
a distinct society”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is right.  No messy or unpalatable use of a notwithstanding 
clause.  No federal government interference because the federal 
government would say that it cannot do a thing, the supreme court 
has ruled and that decision must be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sounds familiar.  It is what every traditional politician 
likes to do when there is a controversy.  Toss it to the court if 
possible.  At least then voters will not be able to blame 
government for the consequences of its inactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order that all MPs will be given a say in this matter, I ask 
for the unanimous consent of members present to make this motion 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Does the member for 
Nanaimo—Cowichan have unanimous consent to have this motion made

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to respond on behalf of the government to the motion tabled by 
the hon. member for Nanaimo—Cowichan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion highlights the differing viewpoints between the 
government and the hon. member with respect to national unity. 
As was clearly indicated in the Speech from the Throne, the 
government has made this issue its top priority for its current 
mandate. We want to proceed with national reconciliation.  We 
believe the Calgary declaration is an important step in that 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nine premiers would not support the spirit of the hon. 
member's motion either.  Even though the results of the 
consultations they will be holding with their respective 
populations are not yet in, it already appears that the majority 
of Canadians support the major principles of the Calgary 
declaration. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part of the motion the member is asking us to 
consider concerns equality among provinces and Canadians in 
general.  I would reassure my colleague that equality is a 
principle shared by all Canadians and supported fully by the our 
government.  The first two clauses of the Calgary declaration are 
devoted to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of equality is at the heart of our identity.  It 
is a bulwark of our culture and our identity as Canadians.  It is 
the very essence of our democratic system.  The Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms clearly recognizes it in section 15, which 
guarantees equality of Canadians before the law. 
In this regard, clause 1 of the Calgary declaration provides that 
all Canadians are equal and that their rights are protected by law. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also in agreement with respect to the equality status of 
the provinces.  There are not two or three types of status for 
provinces.  In the Canadian federation, provinces have equal 
status.  All provinces can exercise the same powers.  I would 
remind my colleague from Nanaimo—Cowichan of what clause 2 of 
the Calgary declaration has to say on the matter. “ All 
provinces, while diverse in their characteristics, have equal 
status”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless some provinces may show more of a desire than 
others to exercise some of these powers.  In fact, over the 
years, some provinces have used certain powers while others have 
chosen not to do so.  For example, all provinces have the power 
to administer the collection of individual income tax, but only 
Quebec does so and has the necessary personnel and 
infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1965 all provinces had the right to opt out of certain 
national established programs and receive appropriate 
compensation, including tax points. 
Only Quebec chose to do so, which is why the federal tax rate is 
lower in Quebec than in the other provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only Quebec has exercised its constitutional right to set up its 
own pension plan.  The other provinces are covered by the Canada 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those powers that Quebec has exercised have always been 
available to the other provinces.  That the Government of Quebec 
has exercised them while others have chosen not to does not 
confer special status on the province.  That is why clause 6 of 
the Calgary declaration stipulates that if any future 
constitutional amendment confers powers on one province, those 
powers would have to be available to all provinces. Thus equality 
does not mean uniformity, nor does equality of treatment mean 
uniformity of treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider an example that concerns the province of the 
hon. member for Nanaimo—Cowichan.  When the government works 
with the Government of British Columbia to support Pacific salmon 
fishers, that does not give the province an additional right in 
comparison with other provinces.  Rather, it means that only 
British Columbia has a Pacific salmon fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same flexible approach also applies to tax breaks for 
Alberta for oil sands development, and yet these two examples do 
not make our fellow citizens in Alberta or British Columbia 
Canadians plus. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither case involves special privileges, but rather different 
contexts.  Governments must recognize that all provinces and all 
citizens are equal, but must also respond to a variety of needs and 
circumstances.  The flexibility of the Canadian federation is thus 
expressed, by accommodating differences without compromising the 
principle of equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would even add that each province can occupy all of its 
space within the federation in its full specificity and Canada is 
the richer for it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is another example.  Under that program the federal 
government makes payments to some provinces but not to others. 
That does not mean that inequalities are being created among the 
provinces.  Rather it means that all citizens have access to 
comparable services, no matter what region they live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essential difference between our party's view and my 
colleague's motion is that for him equality seems to mean 
uniformity, whereas we believe that these two concepts do not 
necessarily mean the same thing.  To impose uniformity of 
treatment in a country such as ours is to deny one of its 
greatest treasures, its diversity.  That will never be the policy 
of the Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague maintains that recognizing the specificity of a 
province in the Constitution would run counter to the principle 
of equality of provinces and citizens.  As I have already stated, 
we all agree with the principle of equality among citizens and 
provinces.  The government, however, rejects the one size fits 
all approach.  That is why we support recognizing the unique 
character of Quebec as proposed in the declaration of the nine 
premiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration defines the unique character of Quebec 
society in terms of its French speaking majority, its culture and 
its tradition of civil law.  That definition reminds us that 
Quebec is different from the other provinces in many ways, one 
characteristic being that it contains within its territory the 
only French speaking majority on the North American continent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind my colleague that although the expression 
“unique character” has only recently entered the political 
vocabulary, all of our constitutional laws have contained 
implicit recognition of the distinct character of Quebec's 
identity from the Quebec Act of 1774 to the Constitution Act of 
1982, including the Constitutional Act of 1791 and the 
Constitution Act of 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the Constitution Act of 1867 recognized Quebec's special 
legal system and even then contained provisions regarding 
bilingualism and the appointment of supreme court justices.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add that the constitutional recognition of the unique 
character of Quebec would merely formalize an existing practice 
in the courts, an opinion that is shared by the former chief 
justice of the supreme court, the Right Hon. Brian Dickson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unique character of Quebec society is an obvious observation 
which is taken into account in current practice.  So how would 
recognizing it jeopardize the equality of citizens and provinces? 
Simply put, in no way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration is not a constitutional amendment.  It 
is a statement of principles.  However if recognition of the 
unique character of Quebec society were to be entrenched in the 
Constitution, that recognition would be framed as an interpretive 
clause like the current section 27 of the charter of rights which 
recognizes the multicultural character of Canada's heritage. 
Fifteen years after the charter was adopted, can any Canadian say 
that his or her rights have been threatened by that clause? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to honouring the universal principle of equality, 
such recognition will serve the unity of the country well.  As I 
have already said, our government made national unity its top 
priority in this term of office.  And whatever helps the cause will 
receive our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we support the Calgary declaration.  We recognize 
that it is a positive step by proposing a framework for discussions 
that reflect Canadian realities and values. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to finish with a quote that Canadians believe, as 
Alberta's premier Ralph Klein has said, in a Canada where all 
provinces have equal status, but a Canada that allows Quebec to 
protect those things that make it such a unique part of our 
national character, a tolerant and diverse nation where we are 
all equal as Canadians no matter where we live but where the word 
equality is not used as a blanket to smother diversity. I believe 
that is what Canadians believe.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is unfortunate to see such misunderstanding of Quebec and a 
constant, and thinly veiled, attack on the Quebec people by English 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A reading of motion M-26, which we have before us at this 
time, leads us to that conclusion.  All Quebeckers reading it and 
listening to the debate would reach the same conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely important subject for us in Quebec and I 
would need far more than ten minutes to explain our point of view 
concerning it.  I will, however, make an attempt to explain it to 
you, and to convince the hon. members of this Parliament, solely on 
historical grounds, briefly of course. Solely on historical 
grounds, 
I trust that they will understand that provincial equality, as seen 
by the hon. Reform member, and even by the government members, does 
not in any way correspond to the historical demands of the Quebec 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of history, I believe we cannot help but conclude 
that the creation of Canada was based on a historic 
misunderstanding.  In 1867, when Lower Canada and Upper Canada 
decided to unite, it was common knowledge that francophones were a 
minority everywhere in North America with the exception of Lower 
Canada.  The people of Lower Canada had agreed to a federal system 
knowing that this would at least give them the power and democratic 
control of a member state within the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Upper Canada, what it wanted was a very strong Canada, 
a unitary regime. 
The signing did take place, however.  The Fathers of Confederation 
did sign an agreement, believing one thing, but the facts prove 
that they reached a devious agreement to get around the system they 
had used to sell Lower Canada on signing.  Since 1867, therefore, 
quietly but inexorably, areas under Quebec's jurisdiction have been 
nibbled away at, along with those of the other provinces.  Quebec, 
however, is most vocal in its demands. The area of jurisdiction 
found under section 92 of the Canadian Constitution is being 
nibbled away at. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Little by little, in an indirect by nevertheless real way, through 
Supreme Court judgments—and the list is long—the federal 
government is taking powers away from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent example, hot off the press so to speak, is Bill C-14 
on water management. If there is one area that comes under Quebec 
jurisdiction this is it. If there is one thing that is dear to the 
hearts of Quebeckers it is water. The federal government in its wisdom 
figured it should interfere in that area in the name of peace, order and 
good government or using the rule of federal precedence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the Constitution is concerned, the Quiet Revolution 
stirred Quebec to go from passively defending vested powers to actively 
claiming new powers. 
This is nothing new. Since the 1960s, successive Quebec premiers have 
constantly been asking that Quebec be given more powers. Why? Because 
they found it necessary for the political, social, economic and cultural 
development of Quebec society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, capitalizing on the failure of the 1980 referendum, a 
Prime Minister named Pierre Elliott Trudeau, together with nine English 
speaking provinces, repatriated the Constitution and imposed it on 
Quebec. It should be noted that the Constitution of 1982 was never 
ratified by Quebec. It was never approved by any of the Quebec premiers. 
Since 1982, we have had premiers in Quebec who were federalists and even 
Liberals. As a big brother, or small brother perhaps, of the Liberal 
government across the way, Robert Bourassa himself refused to sign this 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982, for the first time since 1867, the Constitution was 
amended without Quebec's consent. That was the end of an old dream of 
Quebeckers, who had viewed the federation as a pact between two founding 
nations, which could therefore only be changed with their mutual 
consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Motion M-26 shows is that the concept of distinct society has 
lost a lot of ground in a very short time. A previous speaker mentioned 
the Meech Lake and Charlottetown agreements and the Calgary declaration. 
Closer scrutiny invariably reveals that every time there is an agreement 
in English Canada, Quebec ends up not with more but with fewer powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Meech Lake Accord, the Bourassa government, a federalist 
government I might add, set out the five conditions to be met before 
Quebec could approve the Constitution Act of 1982. 
What were the five conditions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, recognizing Quebec as a distinct society, which would be 
meaningful and would be used by the courts as an interpretation formula 
to grant more powers when considering Quebec's traditional demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, guaranteeing a more prominent role regarding immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, allowing Quebec to participate in the appointment of supreme 
court justices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, limiting the federal government's spending power. It is 
through this power that, increasingly, the federal government has been 
taking over powers that belong to Quebec, powers that are recognized as 
ours under section 92 of the Constitution. With its spending power, 
Ottawa is putting money in areas that are not under federal 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, recognizing Quebec's veto on the reform of federal 
institutions and the creation of new provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were the five conditions seen as a minimum by a federalist 
Quebec premier, Robert Bourassa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what happened to the Meech Lake accord. English Canada felt 
Quebec was getting way too much. Following this episode and some 
arm-twisting, the Charlottetown accord was struck. What happened then to the 
notion of distinct society, which was the minimum for Quebec to join the 
Canadian confederation?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They tried to dilute it even further, with a sort of Canada 
clause in which everyone was equal, in which the principle of 
equality of all the provinces appeared for the first time in an 
accord concluded with English Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What became of the Charlottetown accord?  It was defeated. It 
was defeated in the west because it gave too much power to Quebec, 
and it was defeated in Quebec because it gave too little power to 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was the Calgary accord.  The focus shifted to 
unique character.  Distinct society was no longer of interest.  And 
here we saw a premier who was at least honest, the premier of 
Ontario, who said that unique character was meaningless because 
everything in Canada was unique, from Pacific salmon to the tar 
sands of Alberta. 
It was all unique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, as if that were not enough, points 2 to 6 of the 
Calgary declaration set out clearly the equality of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never will a premier of Quebec, whether it be Maurice 
Duplessis, Lesage, Johnson, Sauvé, Bertrand, Barrette, Bourassa, 
Parizeau, the last Johnson, Daniel, or the present incumbent, 
Lucien Bouchard, allow Quebec to be put on an equal footing with 
all the other provinces because we are one of the two founding 
peoples.  This historic fact must be recognized.  There must be 
recognition of the fact that Quebec forms a people.  And in this 
regard they must know their history, they must look at the historic 
demands of Quebec and reach the conclusion that a motion such as 
the one before us asking the House to recognize that all the 
provinces are equal and that none can be recognized as distinct 
under the Constitution of Canada is unthinkable.  No, no and no.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
congratulate the citizens of my region for having chosen to send me to 
represent them here in the Canadian Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a proud region that has always asserted its 
nationalism. It is a region where nationalism has also developed in a 
rather sustained manner because we have always had to fight to be 
recognized by both the major levels of government, the one in Quebec and 
the one in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On every issue, whether it be large infrastructures, social matters 
or regional development plans, I can tell you that great effort is 
always necessary to be recognized and to be able to have a fair share of 
the benefits to which we are entitled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the resolution by my colleague from the Reform Party, I know 
that it is an issue where it is quite easy to slip into inflated 
rhetoric. 
I will try to avoid this, knowing that you are a member of that party, 
although I think that you are capable of showing understanding and 
objectivity in an issue that is of interest in fact to the whole country 
and that can at some point involve the security of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the Reform Party, I must admit that the perception I 
had from the exterior when that party was first created was that it was 
perfect in all areas, from social issues to fiscal matters. Gradually, 
however, I realized that this is not exactly the case. 
When moving a party leader into a house costs the population $115,000, 
I must say that since these figures were published in the public 
accounts, in my region and through all my colleagues, I can assure you 
that the party has lost a lot of credibility in its consideration of 
both fiscal matters and constitutional matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also remember its campaign, especially during the last two weeks 
when conciliatory advances were made to us after we had been excluded as 
Quebeckers during two full weeks, after the door had been shut 
completely on us as partners who are acceptable, who can make a rather 
comprehensive contribution to the future of our country.

return to its pristine state of old.  They are realizing that as 
they wear out it is hard to put forward proposals for national 
reconciliation.  This seems blatantly obvious to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a normal family, an ordinary family.  Clearly we 
are all equal, but we are not all identical.  What is true for a 
family is true for a country like ours.  Certain collective rights 
must be defended. 
Our language, culture and legal system are collectively different 
from those of the rest of Canada.  It is in the interest of 
Canadians to do everything possible to promote the protection and 
development of this unique, distinct culture and of this people, 
which should be allowed to continue as co-owner of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking for privileges.  We are co-owners of this 
country.  We will do everything to remain so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to my colleague from the government.  The 
problem in this case is that grandstanding is so easy that 
irresponsible politicians in this country have succeeded in 
spoiling the social climate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you are a reasonable man.  Do you remember the 
Meech Lake accord in 1990?  Our government was in power and Mr. 
Mulroney was the Prime Minister. 
God knows he cannot be blamed for working toward reconciliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, 90% of Canadians were in favour of the accord. 
What was the result of interventions by certain former Liberal 
prime ministers and premiers, Clyde Wells and two or three others? 
A deterioration in our social climate, and a party like the Reform 
accentuates that negativity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has led to the degeneration of our social climate in this 
country is the irresponsibility of certain politicians and certain 
political parties; instead of working constructively, working in 
the best interest of all Canadians and the best interest of all 
Quebecers, they have preferred to stoop to partisan politics.  I 
believe this is the situation in which we find ourselves at the 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is such a bad situation that, should a committee be struck, I am 
not sure politicians should sit on it. Like everyone else in this House, 
I talk to ordinary people who must work every day to earn a living. I 
talk to cab drivers. I talk to my barber. I think these people, who are 
people like us outside the House of Commons, would very quickly find a 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What divides and separates us is very minor. A solution could be 
found very quickly. Unfortunately, when politicians decide to deal with 
this issue, they do so for partisan motives and I am convinced this is 
the problem in the constitutional debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, I talked to people from the education community. They 
told me “Mr. Harvey, will they ever leave us alone? 
Will some people take their responsibilities and find a reasonable 
solution in a country where everyone deserves a chance to have his or 
her place in the sun”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 30 years, considerable effort and money has been 
spent on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I am convinced—and you and I have 
discussed this on a few occasions—that we should not try to take 
advantage of a situation and not always think in terms of regional 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask Reformers to adopt a more comprehensive view of things. It is 
not true that their plan would succeed garner support from the 20 
million people in eastern Canada, if it does not recognize the 
collective rights demanded by all Quebeckers and by the vast majority of 
Canadians. This issue deserves to be settled.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our fellow citizens are asking politicians across the country to 
cool down and deal with real problems by using the right words. The 
worst enemies of the kind of partnership everyone wants are the 
extremists. The people in my riding in Quebec and elsewhere come to us 
with real issues, economic issues, social issues; they talk about roads. 
They want their politicians to improve their quality of live in a real, 
concrete way, without arguing endlessly about minor details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true that, as I heard someone say earlier, Quebeckers 
believe all Canadians are against them. It is not true that Manitoba 
farmers wake up at night thinking about their counterparts in 
Lac-Saint-Jean because they hate them so much. I do not believe that. 
This is a highly emotional debate fuelled by irresponsible 
politicians with regional interests.  This is the great challenge 
facing Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, if a committee were formed to help us, as Canadians, 
get back on track, I wonder whether members of Parliament would be 
the best candidates.  I would rather see it composed of ordinary 
folks, people familiar with the real needs of Canadians.  They 
would find a quick solution to this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been my pleasure, on this Friday afternoon, to make my 
humble contribution to this debate about an issue of concern to the 
whole country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today to private members Motion No. 26.  It is 
important to recognize that the province of Quebec occupies a 
unique place in Canada and that all Canadians should reach out, 
whether they be Quebeckers or other Canadians, to preserve our 
wonderful country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we line up all the reasons for keeping our country united, 
we can manage without difficulty to celebrate and recognize 
Quebec, the only majority French speaking society in North 
America, as a fundamental characteristic in Canada.  We can 
manage to say as did the Manitoba constitutional task force in 
1991: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to reach out formally to the people of Quebec and 
recognize in the Constitution their special identity which has 
contributed so significantly to the building of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk Constitution, why not?  All democracies make constitutional 
changes from time to time.  Usually they do so by proceeding one 
step at a time, one issue at a time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that Canada deserves to survive and can be 
improved even without constitutional change.  It is just as 
obvious that Quebec has everything to gain by staying in a united 
Canada, whether or not the Constitution is amended.  Federal 
Liberals have reiterated that truth unceasingly in Quebec and 
right across Canada.  At the same time a better affirmed 
recognition of Quebec in our Constitution would be a good thing 
in and of itself, a remarkable expression of Canadian values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do a little what if experiment together.  What if the 
people of Saskatchewan were in the situation that Quebeckers are 
in today?  What if they lived in the only anglophone province 
surrounded by nine francophone provinces in Canada and French was 
the language of the United States, the international language of 
economics, finance, science, the Internet, movies, the latest pop 
music, and the language of immigrants from Asia or elsewhere? Why 
then would they not ask their fellow citizens in the other 
provinces to recognize this special situation they have found 
themselves in?  We might not call it distinct society but then 
again we just might. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This desire to affirm cultural and regional identities is seen 
around the world.  At the end of this century, as populations mix 
together, as identities become uncertain and as the number of 
languages is decreasing rather than increasing for the first time 
in the history of humanity, people are affirming their language, 
their culture and their identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of Quebeckers feel Canadian and want to stay 
Canadian. 
They are as proud to be Quebeckers as British Columbians are 
proud of their province and Nova Scotians are proud of theirs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to come from Ontario. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to find a way to express the obvious link between 
constitutional recognition of Quebec and the great Canadian value 
of respect for diversity.  We could easily harmonize that 
recognition with our ideal of the equality of citizens which the 
Canadian charter legally entrenches.  We can harmonize it easily 
with the equality of status of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equality of status must not be confused with uniform treatment. 
As members of the House can easily understand an example, parents 
love their children equally and give them the same attention, but 
they treat each child according to his or individual needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the ability to combine equality and diversity that has so 
contributed to the country's success and reputation in the world. 
It is precisely in that perspective that we should recognize the 
place of our only majority francophone province within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing, we would for all practical purposes merely be 
formalizing a principle already admitted by our courts, a 
principle that leads them to take account of the context of each 
province in order to make just decisions, including the specific 
context of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the eminent Saskatchewanian, former Supreme Court Chief 
Justice Brian Dickson, who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a practical matter entrenching formal recognition of Quebec's 
distinctive character in the Constitution would not involve a 
significant departure from the existing practice of our courts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot actually amend our Constitution to express the 
character of Canada and the unique place of Quebec so long as a 
secessionist government is in office in Quebec, but we can seek 
the way to express what we all believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the premiers of the nine provinces and the territorial 
leaders next meet, I hope they will continue down that road 
started in St. Andrews and continued in Calgary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we are ready to engage in a positive way to secure the 
future of Canada.  Yes, our Canada will include Quebec for 
ourselves and for future generations, an authentic Quebec that is 
part of Canada, that is part of all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has demonstrated 
time and again, if it is explained that we can reconcile the 
diversity of Canada including Quebec's uniqueness with the 
principles of equality of citizens and the equal status of 
provinces, support for recognizing Quebec is even higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the popular support for the principles of the 
Calgary declaration.  An Angus Reid poll shows that 73% of 
Canadians, including no less than 70% of British Columbians, 
think the premiers national unity initiative is a positive step 
in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new Environics poll shows that around 70% of Canadians, 
including interestingly enough 68% of British Columbians and 68% 
of Quebeckers, support recognizing the unique character of Quebec 
in the Constitution as long as any advantage this may give to 
Quebec is made available to the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because Canadians judge that the principle of equality and 
diversity is good in and of itself they support the Calgary 
declaration.  It is in this spirit that I urge citizens to 
participate in the consultation process that the provincial 
premiers have launched to discuss the Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an initiative that will help keep Canada together so 
that as Quebeckers, as British Columbians and as Ontarian 
residents we can all continue to share in this marvellous 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I have demonstrated that the recognition of the 
specificity of Quebec does not imply a special status for that 
province and that it is in the interest of all Canadians that 
this show of good will be realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, I remind all hon. members that Canada is currently 
undergoing an intense period of social and political change.  We 
have not become a tolerant country by accident.  Our country has 
an enviable reputation in that regard because since the beginning 
of our history anglophones and francophones have been called on 
to journey together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That spirit of openness has allowed Canadians to welcome to our 
country new citizens from all corners of the international 
community, including my family.  Our diversity is a strength and 
a defining characteristic of our country. 
We all know that Canada is a remarkable human success.  We all 
must work hard each and every day to keep it united.  Every one 
of us can play a role in that regard.

minutes remaining for Private Members' Business and it has been 
the convention of the House that the member moving the motion be 
given that five minutes to wrap up.  If the hon. member would 
like to have the floor, it is the hon. member's privilege. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin—Middlesex—London, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is with honour that I speak for the first time in the 
36th Parliament.  As with my first speech in the 35th Parliament, 
I want to take this opportunity, in my second maiden speech, to 
thank the constituents of Elgin—Middlesex—London for electing 
me in June of 1997.  It was a great honour to be re-elected. 
Being elected the first time was a tremendous honour, but to have 
it reaffirmed is certainly one of the greatest moments in my 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn to the issue at hand, Quebec and its uniqueness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The starting point for me in understanding this issue was when I 
visited French-speaking communities in Quebec and talked to the 
French-speaking people of Quebec.  They have a much different 
take on this than we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People need to understand that at a very fundamental level they 
feel threatened by living in what they see as an anglophone 
Canada, an anglophone North America and, in may respects, with 
the age of Internet, mass communications and satellites, what may 
turn into an anglophone world.  What they want is some 
recognition in the rest of the country of their Frenchness.  They 
want some understanding that they can have a minimum of 
protection in the Constitution.  In certain respects it is an 
emotional thing, but they feel that their culture, their heritage 
and particularly their language are under great threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I explained this to people in St. Thomas.  When we see a Pizza 
Hut open up or a Blockbuster video on the main street of St. 
Thomas it is not a cultural issue.  When my children play on the 
Internet, that is not a cultural issue. If I go to an American 
movie, again, it is not a cultural issue.  If I am bombarded with 
<I>Much Music</I> on television when my kids are watching it, it 
is not a big issue for me as an English-speaking person. 
However, those types of things in a French-speaking community may 
be taken far differently.  They may be taken as just another sign 
of the dominance of English in our culture today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is at that level that they feel they need some protection. 
They want it to be recognized by the rest of the country.  They want 
some acknowledgement.  The greatest acknowledgement they can have 
is a simple line in the Constitution which states that they are 
unique and that they can enact laws to protect that uniqueness, 
within the parameters of the charter of rights and freedoms which 
ensures that all Canadians are equal.  I think it is quite 
reasonable that it be within the parameters of the notion that 
all provinces are equal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go to a French community today we may find no one who 
speaks English or very few who speak English.  They actually 
believe that 30, 40 or 50 years down the road their children and 
their grandchildren, because of all these outside pressures, will 
be speaking English.  When we start to understand the issue at 
that emotional level, I think we can understand what they are 
after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are after recognition, which the Calgary declaration does 
an adequate job of providing.  It recognizes Quebec as being 
unique.  We can debate whether we should use the word distinct, 
unique or some other word.  For me, it is really about semantics. 
It really does not matter.  The main point is that the majority 
of Quebeckers are French speaking and they want to protect their 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once they get the recognition, they also want to have a veto 
over changes to the Constitution.  That will basically give them 
the two anchors of any constitutional change.  They need 
recognition and they also need a regional veto.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we open our minds to this we can see the possibility as can 
people in my own community of Elgin.  One person compared it to 
ethnic clubs. He said that he could care less when the German 
people get together and they go to the German club, the Saxsonia 
Hall in Aylmer and speak German for example.  He could care less 
about a Hungarian club that might be in Simcoe or some other 
place, or a Croatian club just outside St. Thomas. It matters not 
to him that the people in Quebec want to speak French.  He says 
that is a perfectly legitimate thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I explained to him that it will not affect his right for 
anything, that it will not make him any less equal, that it is 
really about people protecting their language and their culture. 
At its most fundamental level this is respect for the ways of 
their parents and grandparents, for the traditions that have been 
passed down. It is respect for the traditions they have grown up 
with and a desire to see those traditions passed on to their 
children and their grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can all understand that.  We are proud of our heritage.  We 
are proud of what our ancestors did regardless of our ethnic 
backgrounds.  In Quebec they feel particularly threatened and 
they want to see it protected.  I think we should support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time for Private 
Members' Business is at its end.  I would seek the unanimous 
consent of the House to allow the mover of the motion, the hon. 
member for Nanaimo—Cowichan, two minutes to wrap up.  Is there 
unanimous consent for the hon. member for Nanaimo—Cowichan to 
have two minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to see that my motion has produced such a good debate. 
I hope through it all we have learned much about each other's 
opinions, our differences and our similarities.  Surely that is 
what part of this was all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say especially to my hon. colleagues from the Bloc 
that they should not ever see this as an attack on Quebec.  It 
has always been my desire to see the country stay united with a 
strong Quebec with its unique culture as part of a strong Canada 
where people are seen as equal and differences are tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the hon. member should realize that many other Canadians 
see the use of a phrase like distinct society as the way for a 
particular majority in any province to have its way over a 
minority.  I would not tolerate that kind of situation in my own 
province of British Columbia let alone in the province of Quebec 
or in any other province of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equality certainly does not mean uniformity.  No one in his 
right mind would think that.  We in this country are a very 
diverse people.  If we are going to get along in this nation we 
must not use phrases which for many people are seen as giving 
anyone or any group special status over anybody else.  After all 
we have Canadians of aboriginal background.  We have Canadians of 
Ukrainian background, Canadians of Italian background and I could 
go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A nation cannot survive as a bunch of separate and distinct 
societies.  It will never weave the kind of fabric that is needed 
to keep the blanket of the country together.  Sooner or later it 
will unravel and there will be no country at all.  Je suis 
Canadien.  I was born a Canadian, I will die a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time provided 
for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired and the order is dropped from the Order Paper.  It being 
1.54 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday, November 17, 
1997 at 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Orders 28(2) and 24(1).
