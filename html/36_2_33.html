</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, Lib.)</B> 
moved for leave to introduce Bill C-390, an act to provide for 
the recognition of the Canadien horse as the national horse of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to reintroduce the national 
horse of Canada act to provide for the recognition of the 
Canadien horse as the national horse of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadien horse came to Canada in 1665 from the stables of 
Louis XIV.  The use of the French language “Canadien” is in 
respect of the breed's early ancestors in France and the fact 
that the horse was indispensable to settlers in New France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over 350 years this little iron horse has worked with 
Canadians, tilling our soil, carrying our soldiers through battle 
and providing the foundation stock for today's diverse equine 
industry. 
These sturdy little horses adapted to Canada's rigorous 
conditions, evolving into a breed that is noted for its strength, 
endurance and determination.  Clearly the Canadien horse shares 
the qualities we all value, making it an excellent choice as the 
national animal.

<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> In the act to give effect to the Nisga'a 
final agreement, Bill C-9, there are many motions in amendment 
standing on the Notice Paper for the report stage of Bill C-9. 
The motions will be grouped for debate as follows.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Group No. 4 will be the rest of the motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now hear a point of order from the House leader of the 
opposition party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker 
I rise on a point of order with regard to an amendment which I 
submitted to Journals and which did not appear on the 
order paper yesterday, nor did it appear on the order paper 
today.  I assume because of that you considered it out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on this particular amendment in some 
detail.  I realize it was a task for the clerks involved in all 
of the amendments that we had submitted.  We were in touch with 
the Clerk's office frequently.  I think perhaps it is just a 
misunderstanding as to why this particular amendment has not 
shown up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one amendment attempted to attach the Nisga'a final 
agreement to the bill as a schedule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would refer you, Mr. Speaker, to Beauchesne's sixth edition, 
citation 690 which talks about new schedules in the context of 
how they are considered.  The sequence in which a bill is 
considered is new schedules after other clauses and schedules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citations 702, 703 and 704 state that schedules are treated in 
the same manner as clauses; in other words in terms of 
acceptability and form.  Erskine May states the same thing on 
pages 497 and 498. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, there is no prohibition listed anywhere in any 
procedural text against the inclusion of a new schedule in a 
bill.  The important factor to be concerned with is relevancy. 
Certainly the Nisga'a final agreement is relevant since it is 
mentioned in just about every clause of Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1956 there was a Speaker's ruling discussing this very point. 
The Speaker said on page 568 of the Journals of that year: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's main objection is this.  It is his contention 
that, because this bill refers to an agreement and the terms of 
the agreement not being a part of the bill and not being printed 
in extenso in the bill, the control of the House over the 
expenditures which may be involved therein is being denied. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker suggested on that same page that he cannot be 
expected to study every bill in an effort to find out whether or 
not something has been omitted.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Honourable members have taken care of that by insisting in their 
procedure that after second reading all bills be referred or 
committed either to one of their standing committees or to the 
Committee of the Whole. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He suggested that proper amendments may be moved and new 
schedules may be inserted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that case the complaint was that the bill did not contain the 
agreement.  The Speaker suggested that it could be included as an 
amendment in the form of a schedule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Bill C-9, which we are talking about today, the 
agreement is also omitted from the bill.  I think it should be 
part of the bill so I am attempting to include it as the Speaker 
suggested could and should be done in 1956 and as Beauchesne's 
and Erskine May support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not the only one concerned that the agreement was not 
attached, Mr. Speaker.  Professor Stephen Scott of McGill 
University raised this in committee.  Professor Scott, as we 
know, is a very knowledgeable individual on these matters. He 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned at what seems inadequate provision in the 
agreement and in Bill C-9 to ensure the continuing integrity and 
preservation of legislative and administrative archives in the 
Nisga'a government and indeed, the lack of obligatory provisions 
for publication of legislative and executive acts. In Bill C-9 
itself, the Parliament of Canada has set the worst possible 
example since the final agreement and related instruments, though 
they are to be separately published, are not annexed to the bill 
itself.  In practical terms the final agreement and other 
instruments will often be unavailable to users of Canadian 
statutes in Canada and abroad, even though by section 4 the 
agreement is given force of law, and by section 5, binds third 
parties and can be relied on by them.  This is a travesty of the 
rule of law and a total disgrace.  I feel so strongly about this 
as to think that no responsible that no responsible member of 
either House could vote for Bill C-9, at least until it is 
amended to annex the final agreement to the bill and, I think, 
the related agreements too. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That says it all of what the concern of the official opposition 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you and the members of the House are wondering 
why I want to attach the Nisga'a final agreement to a bill that 
gives effect to the Nisga'a final agreement, I think Professor 
Stephen Scott articulated the need very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was thinking about raising the fact that the bill did not 
contain the agreement at second reading but since Speaker's 
rulings, Beauchesne's and Erskine May suggest that such an 
omission could be rectified by inserting it later as a schedule, 
I do not want to waste the time of the House by making that 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that today a new precedent will be set wiping out 
any opportunity to attach a new schedule to a bill in the future. 
There does not appear to be a sound reasoning to disallow it. 
Procedural authorities and constitutional experts support 
including Nisga'a final agreement as the schedule to Bill C-9, an 
act to give effect to the Nisga'a final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to any minor, and I say minor, technical deficiency 
which may have existed with the amendment we submitted, the 
Speaker and/or Journals could have made the necessary 
corrections.  This is done all the time. It has been done since 
we have been in the House of Commons and even recently.  It would 
be improper for the Speaker to choose to make minor corrections 
in some cases and not in others, or to choose to do it for some 
members and not for others.  This particular amendment was 
brought to the attention of the clerk and it was made clear that 
I wanted to have the Nisga'a agreement attached to Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is alone in the House in opposition to this 
bill.  We are faced with the tyranny of the majority when it 
chooses to close off debate.  We do not need another obstacle to 
our opposition.  We do not need another form of closure with 
respect to our amendments and the consideration of our 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do I think it is procedurally correct to attach the 
Nisga'a final agreement to Bill C-9, but I believe it is our duty 
in the House to attach it.

did get quite a few amendments to this particular bill and we are 
doing our best to deal with all of them in a procedural way.

on report stage of this bill.  Does the Speaker have a timeframe 
of when he may be back because it may affect which groups that we 
are going to be speaking on today and so on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to pressure the Speaker too much, but could he 
give us some idea of when he would report back so we could know 
which amendments we would be speaking on, and adjust our speakers 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Well, I can say this with certainty.  It 
will certainly be before we come to the votes. I want to give 
myself room.  The hon. member has given me quite a bit to have to 
research from the perspective of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get back to the House as soon as I have considered the 
matter and made a decision, but, yes, it will, of course, be 
before the vote.

I would ask that my hon. colleague, who has led this issue for

because he was interrupted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Agreed and so 
ordered.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again I rise to speak to the 
report stage of Bill C-9.  I want to inform all members of the 
House and members of the public who may be watching this at home 
that I was part of the standing committee that recently travelled 
to British Columbia for a five day dog and pony show at which 
time we heard from a selected group of witnesses that were 
concocted primarily by the Liberals.  British Columbians were 
denied and shut out of the process.  They were unable to appear 
and provide their deeply held views on the Nisga'a treaty.  That 
has been the problem with this treaty right from 1991 when the 
secrecy agreement between the three parties was signed that led 
into the process that brings us to this debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to that cynical, arrogant move on the part of the 
government and the other opposition parties in collusion with one 
another, the Reform Party held its own meeting in Vancouver last 
Friday to which we invited all members of the public and anybody 
who had been denied an opportunity to speak at the standing 
committee so they could speak to us.  We had a court reporter 
there.  We put on the record the comments, remarks and 
observations that were made.  My colleagues over the next hours 
and days in debate on the Nisga'a treaty will endeavour to read 
as much of that into the record as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to say that at the outset so there would be some 
context to the amendments proposed by the Reform Party in this 
group and in the groups to follow. The main reason the Reform 
Party has tabled these amendments is that we are looking for some 
change to the agreement.  We are primarily looking to decouple 
the self-government provisions in the agreement from 
constitutional protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we are saying that we do not think this 
parliament should be so arrogant and so self assured that it 
would know for all time what is good for the Nisga'a people, that 
it would entrench a third order of government and provide it 
constitutional protection under section 35 so that it can never 
be changed and will be there for all time. For years we have said 
that is a major flaw in this agreement and that needs to be 
changed.  We are saying not only for the benefit of a united 
Canada, a Canada that works together and stays together, but we 
are also saying for the benefit of Nisga'a people themselves that 
is not the right way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, we heard that from an untold number of British 
Columbians over the last few weeks.  We heard it at the standing 
committee.  Even the Liberal standing committee dog and pony show 
heard that from a number of witnesses.  As my colleague from 
Fraser Valley pointed out, professor Stephen Scott from McGill 
University, a widely recognized expert on law and constitutional 
matters in this country has said the same thing, as has Gordon 
Gibson, as has Mel Smith, as has Tom Flanagan, and the list goes 
on and on. These are names that are recognizable by many 
Canadians as being relatively expert in their fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague pointed out and as is the thrust of one 
amendment we have asked the Speaker to consider, we say that the 
treaty must be appended to the legislation.  That did not come 
from the Reform Party.  That came from the witnesses.  The whole 
point of having a standing committee, the whole point of inviting 
expert witnesses to appear, because certainly we in this place 
are not experts, is to consider the advice that they provide us 
and then to incorporate that advice into the legislation we are 
dealing with.  Here we have a pre-eminent legal scholar, 
professor of law at McGill University, who tells us in no 
uncertain terms that not only is it a mistake for parliament not 
to append the treaty to the legislation but that no member in the 
House should vote for Bill C-9 until and unless that is done. My 
colleague so eloquently quoted the professor there is no need for 
me to do that again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line of what we are saying is that from the Reform 
Party's point of view, while we disagree with the treaty in many 
aspects, the most serious and fundamental flaws include the fact 
that the self-government provisions receive constitutional 
protection. 
That is the subject of at least two lawsuits right now in British 
Columbia.  It is the subject of most of the concern that is 
coming out of British Columbia.  That should be removed from the 
agreement and an addition to the legislation should be included 
which would say that the self-government provisions as delineated 
in chapter 11 of the agreement would not constitute an aboriginal 
or treaty right within the meaning of section 35 of the Canadian 
constitution.  It would be that simple.  We are saying that the 
treaty should be appended to the legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told by a pre-eminent legal professor in Ontario that 
was the right thing for parliament to do.  Regardless of whether 
or not we support the treaty in principle, that is the only right 
way to proceed from a procedural point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the Reform Party wants the removal of the commercial 
right to harvest fish from constitutional protection. We know the 
government wants to leave it in there.  We know the Nisga'a want 
to leave it in there.  We do not agree with it.  We think it is 
wrongheaded.  We think in the end it will not be of benefit to 
Nisga'a people.  It will be contentious.  It will be divisive in 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that at least the constitutional protection should 
be removed from that part of the treaty.  We should not create in 
effect a constitutionally protected business in the country. 
Nobody else in Canada has the right to a constitutionally 
protected business and it should not be created in this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, it is irresponsible for the government to proceed with 
ratification.  The Reform Party could never in any way endorse or 
support any move to allow the bill to proceed until and unless 
the government sits down with the Gitksan and the Gitanyow people 
in an honourable way and comes to an agreement that is 
satisfactory to them, an accommodation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is so serious to these people that when they 
testified in front of the standing committee they said that they 
considered this treaty an act of aggression, not only by the 
Nisga'a but by this government and by the Government of British 
Columbia.  It is irresponsible.  It is inconsiderate.  It is a 
huge error in judgment on the part of government to proceed with 
ratification until an accommodation is reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Gitksan and Gitanyow leadership testified in front of 
the standing committee they gave us reasonable options.  They did 
not say they wanted to have their land claim resolved first. They 
did not say that this treaty could not proceed.  On the contrary, 
they said to go ahead and proceed with the treaty but to put some 
amendments in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They gave us proposals for amendments that the government did 
not even consider when the legislation was debated at committee 
after the end of the testimony from all witnesses.  The 
government did not ever consider them.  I want the Gitksan and 
Gitanyow people who are watching at home, as I know they are, to 
know for the record that at committee the government did not even 
debate for one minute the amendments submitted by the Gitksan and 
Gitanyow chiefs when they were in Smithers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that not only is that a mistake, not only is that 
a huge error, but it is reprehensible and we cannot proceed in 
parliament until that is addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the four major points that the Reform Party wants to 
advance in the course of debate over the next hours and days on 
the amendments that we submitted.  I appreciate that we have 
submitted quite a number of amendments, but I suggest that if the 
government and the other opposition parties were willing to 
consider those four changes, the Reform Party would likely be a 
lot more accommodating to deal with than we will be if there is 
no hope or sign of any amendment or any change whatsoever.  From 
the Nisga'a leadership point of view there should not be any 
undue alarm or concern with the four main points I have outlined 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time is up.  I appreciate the opportunity to lead 
off the debate and to advise the House of the main thrust and 
intention of the Reform Party's position on debate during report 
stage of Bill C-9.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to listening to other members of the House, 
particularly my colleagues, as they read into the record some of 
the testimony we heard in British Columbia, independent of what 
the standing committee did not hear because it denied witnesses 
and British Columbians the opportunity to come forward and be 
heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Today we are debating Bill C-9, the Nisga'a agreement, 
which will have huge implications on how Canada deals with native 
people in the future, and there is not one minister of the crown 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Wetaskiwin knows full well that we do not to refer to the absence 
or the presence of members in the House either collectively or 
individually.  If the member wishes to call quorum he may do so, 
but the Speaker sees a quorum. 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to talk about two questions today with regard to the 
Nisga'a agreement.  First, what is an opposition party and what 
are its responsibilities?  Second, what is a democracy?  What is 
a democracy all about when we are facing issues such as this one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a problem or a concern of any kind about government 
legislation hits the House of Commons, there is a responsibility 
and onus on members in opposition to bring it to the attention of 
the public without concern for name calling or putting people 
down for what they think they should be challenging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have a detailed knowledge of the agreement.  They 
know what they are talking about.  They live the implications of 
these matters all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We raised in the House financial concerns about future 
commitments in perpetuity for our young people.  There is a 
commitment of dollars by the government on one land claim, not on 
the 40, 50, 60 or 100 that will be coming down the road.  This 
one land claim involves hundreds of millions of dollars in cash 
payout that in today's dollars will amount to approximately $32 
million in perpetuity on which young people, their children and 
their children's children will be taxed.  That is a concern to 
me.  I have the right to come here and express concern about the 
commitment the government is making, and so do my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have lived with the problem of the Musqueam reserve in 
British Columbia.  We have seen people who live on property being 
charged lease payments which went from $300 to $400 a year to 
$26,000 a year.  That is a concern.  The Nisga'a agreement has 
implications on other things we are doing in the country.  We 
have concerns about overlapping land claims on behalf of other 
aboriginal groups that have expressed those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to my question on what is an opposition party. 
Why is it that only my colleagues in the Reform Party ask these 
questions?  I have heard racial innuendo, bigoted comments and 
that sort of thing from other parties which should not even be 
articulated.  An opposition party is in the House to question 
where things or going, why overlapping land claims are not being 
listened to, or why there are future commitments of millions and 
millions of tax dollars 
Those were the questions we had. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the other opposition parties in the House?  Why are 
they not speaking out?  What do Canadians want as an opposition 
in the country?  Do they want members who are afraid to speak out 
because they might be slandered with some kind of comment, or 
members like my colleagues who will stand and say they have some 
concerns which they want addressed.  This is what one would 
expect from an opposition party.  I find it strange that the 
other three parties find absolutely nothing wrong with the 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is in a democracy?  When my colleagues and I came to the 
House we thought we would change things faster than we have.  We 
have been forcing change on the people on the other side.  When 
members first come to the House of Commons they think there 
actually is a real democracy in the country.  However when they 
look at the effects of a majority government they begin to 
question that point, as have my colleagues and I.  It is a joke 
to say that a majority government is a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say what happens in a majority government.  When we 
raised the Nisga'a issue we did not buckle down to the people 
across the way.  We said that we wanted to debate it.  After four 
and a half hours of allowed debate by the only party opposed the 
Liberals called time allocation to cease debate.  Is that what a 
democracy is, four and a half hours of debate on one of the most 
important pieces of legislation brought before in the House since 
1993? That is shameful.  What is wrong with discussing this 
issue?  It is disgusting that it is not being discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British Columbia government, as unfavourable as that 
government is these days, allowed debate to go on and on so 
people could listen to it and understand it.  For weeks and weeks 
that government talked about the Nisga'a agreement.  It tried to 
get all the issues out.  When it comes to big bold Ottawa, after 
four and a half hours of debate government members told us to get 
the issue out of here.  That is not a democracy.  That is not 
what this is about.  They cannot just do what they want in the 
House of Commons because they have a majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After debate the bill went to committee where it was rammed 
through.  Government members said that they did not want to 
travel anywhere and asked why on earth people in British Columbia 
would want to hear about it.  This is the biggest issue in 
British Columbia for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we have to do?  We told members of the democratic 
government across the way that they were not going to travel on 
any committee, that we would debate every committee that wants to 
travel, and that we would hold it all up if they did not want to 
go to British Columbia.  Then they said that they would go to 
British Columbia, but they were unhappy about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said that we wanted them to go to communities affected 
immensely by the agreement.  They did not want to go there.  They 
did not want to go to Smithers.  They do not like it there.  Is 
that a democracy?  They did not want to go to Kamloops because 
they are unhappy in Kamloops.  They decided to go to Prince 
George.  The people in Prince George are concerned too.  We 
forced them to go to five places.  This is democracy in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said they had to hear from witnesses who appear before the 
committee.  They tabled a list of 62 or 64 names, all in favour 
of the Nisga'a agreement.  My colleague from Skeena and I had to 
fight just to get people who were opposed to be heard. They were 
a small minority.  When they got to Prince George members of this 
democratic government hauled in four or five witnesses who were 
not even from Prince George but were in favour of it.  They say 
that is a democracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We put a vote to the House and asked at least to be given a 
referendum in British Columbia, one of the basic foundations of 
democratic principles.  They voted it down and were supported by 
three other opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the fact that this may happen in Ontario, Nova 
Scotia, Newfoundland or Saskatchewan?  What will people say then? 
The precedence has been set in the House of Commons.  We do not 
hold referendums here.  They send people who are in favour of 
these things.  It is not a democracy if the government acts like 
this.  The attitude has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to ask for the unanimous consent of the House to hold 
a referendum in British Columbia.  I will do that.  Why not do 
that if this is a democracy?  Give us what we are asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of my colleagues are from British Columbia.  They 
represent the greatest part of that province, the third largest 
province in the country.  Give them what they are asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to 
allow a referendum to be held in British Columbia to deal with 
the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Langley—Abbotsford has asked for the unanimous consent of the

allowed to yell no from a standing position behind the curtain? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Yes.  The 
established protocol is that the Speaker, upon recognizing a 
member, may recognize that member from any position, provided the 
member is in view, including the galleries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, now we can see the results 
of democracy in this country.  They come slithering through the 
doors when it comes time to talk about a referendum.  It is not 
democracy.  It just will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are the opposition.  We sit here as the official opposition. 
Where is the democracy in the Liberal Party which has a majority 
government?  There is no proper democracy.  It does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like the record to show that there is not one member in 
the House from British Columbia other than my colleagues in the 
Reform— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As I mentioned 
earlier today, it is not appropriate to refer to the absence or 
presence of members specifically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order 
to suggest to the hon. member opposite that I stood to say I was 
withholding unanimous consent.  Unfortunately the member was not 
able to see me because I was blocked from his view by the clerk. 
He saw this gentleman.  That is fine.  I stood and said that I 
disagreed— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Thank you.  Given 
the fact that we go from one side to the other, I did not see the 
member on the other side on his feet and I should have.  When we 
resume debate we will hear the member for Oxford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for Oxford has a 
son who lives in my riding.  He is depriving his son of a 
referendum on the Nisga'a deal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my son is 
very supportive of some of the initiatives of the member for 
North Vancouver.  He has written letters to him.  I am quite 
aware of that.  I also have a brother in Vancouver.  I have known 
him for 68 years.  He and I are at odds on many of these 
questions, the Musqueam leases being one and the Nisga'a 
agreement perhaps being another, although I have not discussed 
that with him fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motions today are interesting.  Most of them are frivolous; 
however, they do say that the bill will be changed to say “an 
act to implement” instead of “an act to give effect to”.  I am 
not sure which is the more parliamentary term.  I guess it does 
not matter very much since they both mean precisely the same 
thing in English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first arrived here six years ago I did not know much 
about the Nisga'a or their land claims in the Nass Valley of 
British Columbia.  I came to the House as the member representing 
Oxford County with a strong interest in the environment.  I 
quickly had an opportunity to explore those interests as a member 
of the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of that committee I had an opportunity to visit many 
of the northern regions of the country, places like Cambridge 
Bay, Rankin Inlet, Iqaluit, Resolute, Yellowknife and Whitehorse 
in Yukon.  I spent some time in Vancouver and other parts of 
British Columbia, Kamloops, Okanagan, Shuswap and Vancouver 
Island, because, as the hon. member said, my oldest son and his 
family, my two grandsons, live there and I have a brother who 
lives there.  I was able to learn a great deal about the 
incredible attachment of our native people to the land.  Many of 
the northern environmental problems are also aboriginal problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone who cares about the environment, this was an 
attachment I was almost jealous of because I realized that no 
matter how much I learned, studied, travelled or used my training 
in the sciences I could never have the same spiritual connection 
to the land as native groups have across this great country of 
ours.  I could, though, learn more about our first nations, work 
with them and for them to ensure their voices were heard.  This 
would allow me to connect a little more deeply and a little more 
spiritually with our native people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I asked my party whip to move me to the Standing 
Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, a 
committee on which I continue to sit as the vice-chair.  It is a 
committee I enjoy.  I relish the opportunity to learn more about 
those who settled, survived and lived in this beautiful, rugged, 
and at times forbidding land before European settlers arrived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past year I have learned a great deal about the Nisga'a 
agreement.  I have studied it.  I have talked to the people who 
negotiated it and those personally affected by its provisions.  I 
have come to the conclusion that the agreement deserves to 
receive the approval of parliament and of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Phil 
Fontaine, told our committee members just a week ago: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the best attempts of reactionary forces, both in 
British Columbia, certain political parties and elsewhere, to 
describe the terms of the Treaty in inappropriate and 
misrepresentative terms, the truth is that its contents are fair, 
just and reasonable, not only because each and every part of the 
Treaty is defensible but because the very process of its 
negotiation was transparent, civil and comprehensive in a model 
of modern governance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty negotiations predate the British Columbia 
Treaty Commission process, which only began operation in 1993.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government began negotiations with the Nisga'a in 
1976.  These negotiations were bilateral and progress on land 
related issues could not be achieved until 1990 when the 
provincial government formally joined the other two parties at 
the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1990 onward the negotiators conducted extensive 
consultations with the public and third parties.  Advisory 
committees included the Kitimat-Skeena Regional Advisory 
Committee, made up of a broad range of community, local 
government, wildlife, fisheries, business, resource sector, and 
labour interests; the Nisga'a Fisheries Committee, made up of 
province-wide and local commercial fishing interests, processors, 
unions and Terrace sport fishing interests; the Nisga'a Forestry 
Advisory Committee, made up of the area's forestry companies and 
the Council of Forest Industries; the Nass Valley Residents 
Association, made up of the existing private property owners and 
residents of the Nass Valley, who told us personally that they 
were delighted with the Nisga'a agreement and supported it 
wholeheartedly; the Skeena Treaty Advisory Committee, made up of 
local government representatives from municipal governments and 
the two regional districts, Skeena-Queen Charlotte and 
Kitimat-Stikine; the Treaty Negotiation Advisory Committee and 
its sectoral committees, established in 1993 as a 
federal-provincial, ministerially appointed committee of 31 
organizations which has sectoral committees for government, 
fisheries, lands, forest, wildlife and compensation; and the 
Certainty Working Group, which was established to review and 
discuss approaches to certainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the official opposition rails day after day that 
consultations among the people of B.C. and the Nass Valley were 
inadequate.  I ask them now, which group was under-represented? 
Which voice was refused a hearing since 1990 with one of these 
groups?  There have been more than 450 meetings before and since 
the agreement in principle was signed in March 1996.  That is a 
meeting about every two days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between November 14 and November 19 I had the opportunity to go 
to British Columbia with the Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs and Northern Development, which held hearings on the 
Nisga'a agreement.  While there we met with representatives of 
both sides of the debate.  We also had to deal with a roomful of 
protesters who were asked by Reform members to disrupt the 
meetings.  It was a difficult process, but I came away from those 
meetings even more convinced that adopting the Nisga'a treaty in 
this parliament is the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members disagree with me, and that is their right. 
However, I ask them whether the Reform member of parliament for 
Skeena, which riding includes Nisga'a lands, has effectively 
represented the views of his constituents, the Nisga'a.  Perhaps 
we should take the time to ask him how many times he visited and 
met with the Nisga'a tribal council, and how many times he held 
town hall meetings with the Nisga'a people.  When we are finished 
asking him these important questions we may want to ask ourselves 
if this is effective representation.  In my mind it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many of us have ignored over 5,000 people in our 
constituencies?  It would be political suicide for most of us to 
do so, let alone shirking our duty as members of parliament for 
all of our constituents, whether they voted for us or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to what the chief of the Nisga'a tribal council, Dr. 
Joseph Gosnell, told me and many others present at a breakfast 
meeting at the National Press Club, the member for Skeena met 
with the tribal council only once since his election in 1993, and 
I think it was in 1994.  He could tell us that.  That is one very 
short visit in six years.  The visit was 30 minutes in length and 
he did not stay for lunch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in favour of the Nisga'a treaty.  I believe it is the right 
thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day after day we hear members of the official opposition talk 
about how our native people want to be treated like other 
Canadians, how we are practising race based politics by making 
agreements with them.  My answer is this.  As a nation we must 
adhere to the principles for which we stand.  It is fine to say 
that we must all be treated equally, but what if one portion of 
our society had their land taken, either by force or guile, had 
their children taken and placed in residential schools, had 
treaties signed and then forgotten?  What of these people whom we 
have ghettoized to the point where their unemployment rate, 
suicide rate, drug abuse rate and infant mortality rate are far 
above the national average?  Are we to say “Sorry.  We will 
treat you just like any other Canadian now.  There will be no 
assistance and you can enjoy the same rights and privileges as 
everyone else”? 
Or do we stand up, admit our mistakes, apologize for them and 
seek to assist our first nations in developing their communities, 
their infrastructure, their spirituality, their culture and their 
land to the point where they can become full partners in the 
Canadian dream?  This is what Nisga'a does.  I am proud of this 
agreement and I will wholeheartedly defend it in the House of 
Commons or anywhere else in the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as a member 
of parliament and a member of the aboriginal affairs committee, I 
also travelled with the committee to B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it helped parliament when the hon. critic from 
the Reform described the trip as a dog and pony show.  I did not 
treat it as a dog and pony show and had in fact advocated early 
on last spring that it was important that the committee travel to 
B.C. because the treaty was so important in the area.  Having 
come through a long negotiation and treaty process in the Yukon 
for self-government, I felt it was critical that we do go and 
hear from people in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, as a member of parliament, there were so many witnesses 
that I did not get on the list whom I advocated for and Reform 
members voted against them.  It was a process to determine who we 
would put on the list.  I think as a committee we did our best to 
hear from everyone.  But to say that people were deliberately 
left off because they opposed the treaty is completely wrong. 
There were witnesses that I had proposed who were left off the 
list because there just was not room.  It was a two way process. 
There were witnesses on both sides who did not get to be heard at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was sitting here listening to the member for North Vancouver 
on a point of order talk about how the Reform Party is facing the 
tyranny of the majority and also speaking about what democracy 
is.  We have decided on a democratic process in the country that 
we may not all agree with.  I would prefer proportional 
representation myself, as a member of parliament, but we do not 
have that.  We have a majority government.  We have three other 
parties who support the treaty.  At this point Reform is alone in 
opposing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been other times when the New Democratic Party has 
been alone in opposing government legislation.  That is the 
democracy we face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comment made by the member for North Vancouver saying that 
Reform faces the tyranny of the majority is exactly what he is 
proposing for the Nisga'a people, that they should face the 
tyranny of a majority.  These people, the first nations of the 
country, have faced the tyranny of the majority far more and in 
greater depth over this last century than we will ever imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very long and in depth paper on the history of 
discriminatory laws against first nations people.  The 
discriminatory laws, as they are set out, infringed on their 
basic human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if everyone here realizes, but there was a time on 
this continent when Indians were slaves.  They were called 
Pawnee.  It was perfectly all right under the British Empire for 
them to be slaves because they were Indian.  They have been 
denied the vote.  They have been denied property rights.  They 
were denied the right to homestead.  In fact, in B.C. there was a 
great scandal when an Indian tried to apply for land to homestead 
and was denied it. They have been restricted from the right to 
sell agricultural products.  They have been restricted from the 
right to make a living.  They have been restricted from a right 
to even write their own will.  In fact if one was a woman one 
would face even worse conditions than anyone else.  If a woman 
had a husband who died, she could not even inherit his property. 
If someone determined that one was a woman of poor moral 
character then she did not get anything at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the Nisga'a treaty because the Nisga'a people through 
incredible adversity have negotiated what they see as fit for 
them as a people. They have the support of their people to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Not all of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Probably not all of them, but the 
majority of their people have voted that this agreement will give 
them a chance to determine their lives, their future and their 
government.  There is room in the country for Nisga'a people to 
be Nisga'a and still be Canadians. There is no reason to fear the 
freedom of the Nisga'a people to determine what will suit them in 
their lives. 
I stand here to say I oppose the amendments made by the Reform 
Party because all it wants to do is slow down the process and 
deny these people the right to govern themselves.  If they make 
mistakes, they will make them on their own merit and they will be 
responsible for their own mistakes.  It will not be us who have 
nothing to be proud of when it comes to first nations people and 
telling them what is good or what is bad for them.

at the report stage of Bill C-9.  Most of what the previous

there is anybody in the House— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member.  He is such a 
good speaker and he was going to say such a good thing about the 
Nisga'a treaty, but I do not see any Liberals except for two who 
are listening to the debate.  I would like to call quorum.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that 
intervention in regard to having a quorum in the House.  After 
all, the government is supposed to listen, even though we know 
better.  It has not happened in the House before.  I do not 
expect it to happen now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker spoke basically on the Indian Act. 
I want to remind everybody who may be listening that the Indian 
Act, as we know it, has been strictly enforced by the Liberal 
government and by the previous Conservative government.  The 
problem lies directly at their feet and at nobody else's.  In 
regard to the Nisga'a agreement, nowhere in the agreement do I 
see that this will rectify the wrongs that have been done under 
the Indian Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the previous government speaker talk about his travel to 
Vancouver and other parts of British Columbia.  I live in British 
Columbia.  I worked out of the New Aiyansh area in the Nass.  I 
talked to a number of people there.  I also had the opportunity 
and pleasure of having lunch with the Nisga'a chief and council 
and have met with them a number of times.  We have politely 
agreed to disagree on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of concerns.  I would also like everybody out 
there to understand that the hon. member for Skeena also has to 
represent many people in his riding.  There is great concern in 
regard to the native populace, the Gitksan and the Gitanyow, 
about this so-called agreement.  Their concern is that they are 
not being heard.  They have claimed that parts of their land are 
being taken away.  I can see nothing but ongoing confusion and 
ongoing law cases.  As a matter of fact, I have come to the 
conclusion that the only certainty of livelihood in regard to the 
Nisga'a agreement will be the livelihood of a good living for the 
lawyers.  I have absolutely no doubt that it will be an ongoing 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard that this was the most studied and most heard 
piece of legislation in B.C. history.  Let me give members an 
example of how the B.C. government worked with this.  Very 
quietly it said is was going to hold consultations.  There was 
absolutely no advertisement and no agenda.  Nothing was put 
forward to the people of British Columbia so they would know who 
to get hold of or where to go for the hearings.  When I found out 
about this I took the opportunity to advertise it in the local 
media in our constituency.  They had no idea that this would be 
taking place.  Through that advertisement, they were able to turn 
out for the hearings.  Even the Government of British Columbia 
said the Salmon Arm turnout was the biggest it had in regard to 
the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following up on that, we did a number of questionnaires and 
polls in the constituency of Okanagan—Shuswap on the Nisga'a 
agreement.  Here are some of the results.  I will read the 
questions so the people can understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question one: “Do you believe the public has had an adequate 
opportunity to provide input into the Nisga'a treaty?”; 1,010 
no, 106 yes and do not know 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question two: “Do you believe that the people of British 
Columbia should have the right to vote on the principles of the 
Nisga'a treaty in a provincial referendum?”; 1,142 yes, they 
should have that right; only 92 voted no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question three: “How do you want your federal member of 
parliament to vote on this treaty in the House of Commons?”; 
1,134 to vote against it; 91 in support; 8 to support if changes 
are made; 5 do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a rough idea of what it is like in British Columbia in 
regard to the Nisga'a treaty and the ongoing debate.  The people 
of British Columbia are very concerned with the lack of 
consultation with them and the unconstitutional move of not being 
allowed to vote on the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go further in this debate, I want to go on record as 
saying that if this attitude of the government keeps up and if it 
thinks it has trouble now with the separatist talk and separatist 
movement in Quebec, it had better be well aware of the feelings 
in British Columbia right now, which are along those same lines. 
This is what I hear in British Columbia and it really concerns 
me. 
They are forcing the people of British Columbia to sit back and 
say that Ottawa really does not care what happens beyond those 
mountains, let alone west of Winnipeg.  The people of British 
Columbia have a legitimate reason to have these concerns. They 
feel that if they cannot get legislation from the government that 
is beneficial for British Columbia, then why do they need this 
part of Canada to represent them.  I have to question that 
myself.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a number of letters from my constituents with regard to 
the Nisga'a agreement.  These are from people who were not 
allowed to be heard in the travelling dog and pony show of the 
Liberal standing committee on this matter.  The Liberals said 
they debated, but they chose who would be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and I think everybody should have great concern over who was 
chosen.  When the Liberals refused to listen to an ex-premier of 
British Columbia who sat in on the negotiations of the Nisga'a 
agreement when he was premier, when the Government of Canada 
refuses to allow that gentleman to sit in on these hearings and 
have a say, I think everyone in Canada should be concerned, not 
just us on this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from other members about how good the Nisga'a 
agreement will be.  I have had the opportunity to speak to many 
Nisga'a who are not in favour of the agreement, particularly the 
women.  They have grave concerns.  I do not understand the NDP in 
the House not meeting with these people and listening to their 
concerns.  They have real concerns about what could happen to 
them if the treaty goes through this way, if these land claims 
are to be furthered this way.  They have grave concerns about 
what is going on here.  I really wish they had the opportunity 
and time to talk to some of these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also talked to members of the aboriginal community who 
have actually been threatened if they showed up at these 
hearings.  If they say anything, threats are made against them 
and their children.  I have not heard that mentioned in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people ask me if I have concerns with regard to the Nisga'a 
agreement, I tell them that I have many and my constituents have 
many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter from Mr. Hal Finlay.  He says that the white 
paper that was presented by Prime Minister Trudeau and the then 
minister of Indian affairs, now the Prime Minister, in the early 
1960s was on the right track.  We have gone off that track.  He 
has grave concerns about where we are going here with regard to 
the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I just want to stress to the House that the path 
the government is following on this is alienating the people of 
British Columbia.  It should remember that and remember that I 
said it here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today and speak again to this very important 
issue, probably the most important piece of legislation that has 
come before the House maybe even in this century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues on this side of the House and in this 
party have talked today about the fact that as the official 
opposition we are the only party in the House that are standing 
against this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes people ask us why we are doing that.  They want to 
know why we would stand against it when no one stands with us on 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that there are times in one's life when one must 
take what might be considered an unpopular stand, one that 
perhaps may not win votes across the country and one that may 
engender hatred toward us, racial slurs, threats of violence and 
all kinds of things. 
They want to know why, in the face of all that, a party would 
take such an unpopular stand.  We do it because we believe it is 
out of principle, the principle of fairness, the principle of 
equality and the principle justice.  The former Premier of B.C. 
said that this agreement was a template for the many other 
agreements that are going to come along.  If we do not take this 
stand now, I suggest things will not get better but will get a 
whole lot worse.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been my fervent wish that all British Columbians, indeed 
all Canadians, would have an opportunity to democratically state 
their opinion on the Nisga'a agreement.  To date, only the 
Nisga'a people themselves have been afforded this opportunity. 
Even there it is not complete agreement by any means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has tried to tell Canadians that the Nisga'a 
agreement is far too important and complicated for the citizens 
of B.C. to have a democratic vote.  A lot of people would call 
this simply arrogance.  The government prefers to keep its 
blinders on rather than listen to what the people of B.C., the 
people directly affected by this treaty, are saying to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to challenge, particularly the Liberal members from 
British Columbia, to listen to their constituents.  I believe 
their constituents would like to say and are saying a lot of 
things but these members are not listening to them or hearing 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of B.C. recognized long ago something that this 
Liberal government still ignores and fails to understand.  The 
citizens of B.C. understand that the Nisga'a agreement will not

system.  They see the very real damage that this agreement will 
cause in British Columbia and, by extension, all across Canada.

referendum when they elected MPs sitting in the House.  Perhaps 
he would then convince the government House leader to make it a 
free vote and allow the members to truly vote on behalf of their 
constituents, particularly the Liberal members from B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the only example of the government's undemocratic 
ways.  This treaty is not just about bringing equality to our 
native peoples.  It is also about democracy and the misuse of it 
in the country.  Let us consider how many times the House has had 
closure and time allocation invoked by the government.  By my 
count, it is close to 60 times since the Liberal government came 
to power.  It will soon eclipse Brian Mulroney's record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also allowed the Prime Minister to have incredible 
power.  The shift in power to the PMO from the House of Commons 
traces its roots back to the nemesis of western Canada, Pierre 
Trudeau.  The current Prime Minister has continued to expand upon 
the flawed foundation that Trudeau built up from fuddle duddle, 
the one finger salute, the dreaded national energy program and 
now the Nisga'a agreement.  Western Canadians fully understand 
what the Liberals think about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naively, many people assumed that the Standing Committee on 
Aboriginal Affairs' recent hearings would actually listen to the 
people of B.C.  According to the member for 
Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, he stated “We are only out in B.C. 
because of a tactic by the Reform Party”.  The Reform Party is 
proud that it forced the Liberal Party to actually go out to B.C. 
What is shameful is that the Liberal members cannot think for 
themselves and take the time to listen to the concerns of the 
people of B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my constituents followed the committee process.  He 
submitted his name to the clerk and asked to make a presentation. 
Everyone knows what the answer to that was.  Even though he has 
worked for many years with native people in his capacity as an 
RCMP officer and could offer his own insights from a grassroots 
level, he was denied an opportunity to present his views or ask 
any questions of the committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am 63 years of age and have been associated with native Indian 
people most of my adult life both here in B.C. and also in 
Saskatchewan.  I have a great many close friends who are native 
Indians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Reservation way of life has never worked and I see 
nothing in your current treaty negotiations which would change 
it.  Native people have never owned any real property on 
Reservations, they have no hope of even owning the homes they 
live in.  How can you expect anyone to have any sense of pride 
under these circumstances?  Native people have always been at the 
mercy of their elected Chiefs and Council.  If they vocally 
disagree with what is taking place politically on a reserve; they 
suffer the consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least in the past they could appeal to an outside agency in 
the provincial or federal governments.  Under these agreements 
they will be at the mercy of a dictatorship. They will be forced 
off reserves when they find the political climate intolerable. 
They will be forced out of their homes rather than live under 
conditions which no other Canadian citizen would tolerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is an ill-conceived creation of the federal Liberal and 
provincial NDP governments.  From all that I can gather from 
discussing these agreements with my native friends, your 
governments have made no effort to reach out to the grassroots 
natives who must live with this decision.  The only people you 
have consistently consulted with are the persons who you deem to 
be leaders of the communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not use the excuse that they could submit their concerns 
direct to the Department of Indian Affairs.  It is common 
knowledge that any adverse communication ends back in the hands 
of those being criticized.  You have failed to communicate with 
these people directly and have lost their respect in any process 
which you are currently undertaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your decision to move ahead with this treaty process will have 
grave consequences in other areas.  I see adverse reaction to 
these special status Canadians already and it will continue to 
get worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens of B.C. are questioning the process which you have 
rammed through without proper public discussion.  I foresee a 
serious problem with racism, a problem that you and the B.C. NDP 
have created.  You have made a very bad decision and 
unfortunately my children and grandchildren are forced to live 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have taken the time to attend all public meetings (there were 
only two of them) which were available to me regarding treaty 
negotiations.  The first was held in Mill Bay quite a number of 
years ago.  At that time, I listened to the various presentations 
by both governments and native leaders and I was not impressed. 
There were too many uncertainties.  What was shocking was the 
refusal of this committee of any public input.  We as an audience 
were told that we could not give a submission and were only 
permitted to ask one question of the panel.  I was completely 
outraged by this so-called information meeting.  I did take the 
opportunity to ask my one allowed question and received a very 
ambiguous answer followed with the comment that I could discuss 
my question privately after the adjournment of the meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second occasion was a debate that attracted a large audience 
and one could see the serious concerns that were not being 
addressed by the panellists.  The audience was not impressed by 
what they heard and became very vocal.  The NDP representative 
did not seem too clear in his answers to such questions as cost 
to the taxpayers and the description of the type of government 
that would be controlling the reserves.  He was vague on native 
Indian property rights.  Instead of clarification he created even 
more questions to be asked for which he had no answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have seriously underestimated the consequences of your 
ill-conceived action and I feel certain that there will be 
considerable unrest in B.C. as the general population start to 
understand more fully the mess your governments have created for 
us.  I just hope that you have a plan in place to deal with these 
problems which I believe you have created. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of B.C. have been demanding a fair say on this 
matter.  We need to return true debate back to the House. Let us 
begin now.  I would ask that the government immediately take 
steps to bring forward a binding referendum on the Nisga'a 
agreement to the province of B.C.  Let us try to bring democracy 
back to Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the previous member for mentioning the fact that 
the committee travelled to British Columbia and had all party 
representation.  It had some fine input from other members in 
other parties, in particular, the member for South Shore, even 
though he was verbally attacked by the members of the Reform 
Party who showed up to disrupt the meetings and cause dissension. 
There was a member of the Reform Party standing in the parking 
lot in Victoria with a bullhorn telling people to disrupt the 
meetings and do whatever they could to make the Liberals look 
bad.  What they did was make themselves look bad.  They showed 
their true faces.  A lot of times they are frustrated with the 
facts.  The fact is that we travelled to British Columbia.  I 
have been there about 13 times now.  It is a great province.  My 
son even celebrated his first birthday there, despite all the 
heckling of the Luddites.  The fact is that the people of British 
Columbia that I talked to, and I talked to people who oppose, do 
we take the Fraser Institute versus the dilatory— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the hon. member refer to I think members of the Reform 
Party and indeed members of British Columbia as being Luddites. 
I would like to have the member retract it.  The reason why those 
people were complaining is because they were not allowed to 
speak.  Their democratic rights were being trampled upon by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  No word is of itself 
unparliamentary.  It is the form, the context and the tone.  I 
would not rule the form, the context and the tone of the word 
Luddite in this instance to be unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again, a very wise 
ruling and one that recognizes the dilatory motions of the Reform 
Party to try to scuttle this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to British Columbia, as I said.  We had some bad weather. 
We could not land in the airports where we were supposed to land. 
We had to travel by bus, but what that did was prove that one 
bad weather day in British Columbia is better than five good days 
in Ottawa. I love going to British Columbia.  I am more than 
happy to relay to the House what actually happened, not what the 
Reform Party is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote from some of the people that appeared before the 
committee.  Let me quote Mr. Bill Young, whose wife Norma and 
himself, and their company have registered fee simple to 160 
acres of land in the beautiful Nass Valley.  His take on the 
agreement is, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two, the access to our property is guaranteed by the laws of 
British Columbia and the provincial highways authority. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, does that put out an argument. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, concern regarding taxation is defined in the “Taxation” 
chapter, paragraph 1, page 217, which says our taxes will be 
levied and paid to the provincial government of British Columbia. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that this third party negotiation and some kind of a 
nation that is going to appear out of the blue is just a bunch of 
hokey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote from the presentation to the House of Commons 
committee by the mayor, Jack Talstra of the city of tariffs, 
right in the beautiful Nass Valley, the start of this area.  He 
says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as local governments want treaty settlements to be certain and 
final, meaning that the final outcome of treaty negotiations will 
be a completion of the process of addressing outstanding first 
nations claims, and that in relation to the question of the 
aboriginal right and title, the treaties will bring finality and 
certainty to the greatest extent possible, recognizing that 
self-government for aboriginals is a dynamic, evolving form of 
government, as it is for local governments. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, along with other presentations we heard, only strengthened 
our resolve that what this treaty does is take us out of the 
Indian Act and into a treaty process where fee simple rights are 
going to be granted and people are treated equally. 
I do not think there is anything wrong with being treated 
equally, but let me go to Professor Foster Griezic who made a 
presentation in beautiful Prince George.  He said and I quote:

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not my words.  These are the words of the people who 
have appeared before us.  The people who are against it, the 
Reform Party, in particular, question Nisga'a ownership of land, 
forgetting that when this occurred in 1887 a Nisga'a elder asked, 
and he is quoted: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who gave the land to the Queen.  This has always been and always 
will be Nisga'a land. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One Chief named David MacKay asked how the government could say 
“We will give you so much land” when the land is already ours. 
The Nisga'a own the land.  We are not giving them back something. 
We are recognizing their rights as human beings to have fee 
simple property and to act as a local government. 
Coming out of municipal government where you deal with the rights 
of individuals and people who, God help them, are able to 
actually own their own land, I do not see anything wrong with 
that.  Would this not be terrible to actually let people own 
their own land and be able to build a house on a piece of 
property and own the land that is underneath it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former real estate agent, I find it passing strange that 
the Reform Party would be against that.  Is it against fee 
simple? Is it against people being treated equally?  Is it 
against everything?  It voted against everything to do with 
native Canadians in the House and now it is going to tell us it 
is going to make everybody equal and everything will be 
wonderful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk to the presentation given in Terrace, B.C. by 
another band who said: “Our traditional territories cover 
approximately 13,000 square miles of the northwest portion of 
British Columbia, including the areas of Terrace and Prince 
Rupert.  This nation compromises approximately 10,000 members. 
They think in here that we are neighbours with the Nisga'a and we 
have a common border between the Skeena and the Nass watershed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They stood in 1966 with the Nisga'a to enter into a very 
historical and traditional ceremony.  They stand with them.  That 
is contrary to what we have been hearing here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again they talk about the Nisga'a treaty bringing many 
benefits to northern B.C.  It will enable the Nisga'a to work 
with other jurisdictions to improve the quality of life for all 
northern British Columbians.  Their direct assistance with 
education, health, economic and general community development 
issues will be positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that negotiations between third parties have taken place 
for a period of years.  An agreement has been reached, the 
Nisga'a have ratified it and British Columbia has ratified it. 
Now it is the responsibility of Canada to accept and finalize the 
agreement reached in good faith between the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go to the comments of Chief Phil Fontaine, he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a disagreement among natives, if there is a 
disagreement among aboriginals, let the chief of the Six Nations 
go and negotiate with the people that are involved. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not the Canadian government, not the Reform party, definitely, 
and certainly, to a process that they themselves can best work 
out through their treaty negotiation that has carried on for 
thousands of years.  They have a way of life that may be a little 
different than what the Reform Party wants, but they have a way 
of life that was established long before we as white people came 
to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not take my word for it, go to the B.C. Federation of Labour, 
a membership made up of more than 40 affiliated unions 
representing over 700 locals.  It speaks on behalf of 450,000 
working people in British Columbia.  The federation is the single 
largest organization representing workers' interests in the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  What do the B.C. Liberals say? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly:</B>  I will come to that.  I am being 
heckled here about the B.C. Liberal/Reform Party headed by Gordon 
Campbell, the B.C. Liberal/Reform member who swims from a very 
shallow gene pool when it comes to trying to get votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill Vander Zalm, the hero, the big reform guy out there in B.C. 
endorsed this.  Now, flip flop, flip flop; it is worse than 
Stornoway. It is just another big flip flop by the Reform Party 
and Bill Vander Zalm.  Get real.  Bill Vander Zalm, man, that is 
sad.  What people will not do in a leadership for votes.  Where 
are they?  They are running around to every camera. 
I will read this quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is especially important now for the labour movement to discuss 
the Nisga'a Agreement everywhere we can since David Black, who

settlement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether you are giving me the V-sign

here, so this will be my wrap-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 when the B.C. treaty process was launched, treaty 
negotiations have been wide open, the most open and accessible 
process of its kind that the treaty commission is aware of.  That 
is from British Columbia.  That is what British Columbians think. 
They do not think of the three Rs of parliament that the Reform 
Party brought— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Resuming debate, the 
hon. member for South Shore. 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to stand in the House today to speak at the report stage 
of Bill C-9.  There has been a lot of work done in committee and 
a lot of debate in the House.  There has been a lot of 
information put forth and certainly a lot of misinformation put 
forth.  It is very difficult, but it is an interesting challenge 
to discuss this treaty with most of the members of parliament in 
this place and in other places where the committee has been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point that needs to be made and made consistently over and 
over again is that this is a very important piece of legislation, 
that it will be one of the major pieces of legislation to dictate 
and formulate policy in the treaty process in this country as we 
continue down the road of negotiation and treaty making. Although 
this is not a template, there are certainly many areas in this 
treaty that one would wish to be a template for other treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for the public and Canadian citizens at large to 
understand those areas that the Reform Party has spoken to on 
many occasions and that other members of the House have spoken 
to.  One of those areas is whether the Constitution of Canada 
will prevail, and it certainly does prevail.  Another area is 
whether the charter of rights and freedoms will prevail, and it 
certainly does prevail.  And on and on it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could continue to debate single and numerous issues but I 
have listed a few.  I was able to stand in the House on several 
occasions and debate this treaty.  There were a few times after I 
had looked back over what I had said that I noticed I had 
actually missed a couple of points.  It is important that we get 
all the points out there so everybody can understand them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I will speak to the areas of the agreement where Nisga'a 
laws will prevail to the extent of inconsistencies with federal 
and provincial laws.  I have heard a lot of chest pounding and a 
lot of discussion and debate about the fact that there are 
14—some days it is 14, some days it is 17—areas where Nisga'a 
law will prevail. Let us take a look at those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no areas of exclusive jurisdiction for Nisga'a 
government.  Instead Nisga'a laws are required to meet the 
minimum standards of federal and provincial laws except in the 
following areas.  The Nisga'a government will be able to 
establish laws on Nisga'a lands concerning administration, 
management and operation of Nisga'a government.  I do not think 
the world is going to come to an end on that one.  I do not think 
the earth will crack open and people will be tumbling down this 
great chasm never to be seen again.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They control Nisga'a citizenship now.  On the preservation, 
promotion and development of Nisga'a culture and language I do 
not think there is a hidden agenda.  I do not think there is 
anything in it so far that I have read to members of the House 
that will significantly change the country of Canada that we all 
live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the use and management of Nisga'a lands, who should be in 
charge of Nisga'a lands but the Nisga'a themselves in the same 
way that anyone who owns fee simple property has responsibility 
and ownership of that fee simple property?   On planning and 
development of Nisga'a lands including operation of a land 
registry and expropriation, the same laws are due to any 
municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement refers to possession and management of assets 
other than real property, provision of health services, 
authorization and licensing of aboriginal healers, and child and 
family services on Nisga'a lands.  I have made the point several 
times but I think it deserves to be made again that it is fairly 
clearly stated in the Nisga'a final agreement that the Nisga'a 
laws regarding children and families cannot be less than the 
provincial laws that are already in place.  They can be greater 
than.  They can be more beneficial and more protective of 
families and children but they cannot be less beneficial or less 
protective of families and children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On adoption of Nisga'a children, pre-school to grade 12 
education on Nisga'a lands of Nisga'a citizens, post-secondary 
education on Nisga'a lands, devolution of the cultural property 
of Nisga'a citizens who die intestate, federal or provincial laws 
will prevail.  Other areas included are public order, peace and 
safety, regulation of traffic and transportation on Nisga'a 
roads, design, construction, repair, demolition of buildings and 
structure, solemnization of marriages within British Columbia, 
provision of social services, health services, prohibitions and 
conditions for sale, possession and consumption of intoxicants on 
Nisga'a lands, and emergency preparedness and emergency measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except for adoption, social services and solemnization of 
marriages, the Nisga'a government will only be able to exercise 
its power on Nisga'a lands.  For the three areas I mentioned 
there is an obvious need for laws to apply outside Nisga'a lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of fallacies have also been mentioned with regard to 
the Nisga'a final agreement.  I have spoken about them at length 
in earlier debate and I have mentioned some of them already 
today.  The application of the Canadian constitution and the 
charter of rights and freedoms are areas that need to be 
discussed and explained in a rational and straightforward manner 
with extensive and substantive debate.  The issues should be 
raised, listed in priority, listed in order, discussed and 
explained, and then we should move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, there will be no taxation without representation, 
which I have heard time and time and time again in the House.  I 
think the record would show that every Reform member of 
parliament who spoke to this issue stated somewhere in his or her 
speech that there would be taxation without representation.  That 
is patently untrue.  There is no provision for that.  It will not 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxation chapter states that the Nisga'a Lisims government 
may make laws in respect of direct taxation of Nisga'a citizens 
on Nisga'a lands.  If a non-Nisga'a person purchases a parcel of 
Nisga'a land, that person will pay taxes to the provincial 
government rather than to the Nisga'a Lisims government.  It is 
true that non-Nisga'a people will not be able to vote in 
elections for the Nisga'a Lisims government, but in areas where 
their interests are affected non-Nisga'a people will be able to 
have input and participate on boards.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that there are hundreds of thousands of 
citizens, permanent residents and landed citizens who pay 
municipal, provincial and federal taxes and are not given the 
right to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very small minority, the 90 plus non-Nisga'a residents who 
live on Nisga'a land will not be taxed by the Nisga'a government. 
They do not have the right to vote for that government although 
there are provisions that could possibly change in the future. 
They will not be taxed by that government.  I heard a member on 
the other side saying that perhaps that is not correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there is a fair amount of work required to get through 
the Nisga'a final agreement.  There is a lot of reading but it is 
not that complicated.  It is very straightforward.  I would 
recommend that before those members stand in the House to vote 
against the agreement they should read it.  That is one 
recommendation I would like to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Nisga'a final agreement diminishes the rights of 
non-Nisga people is patently untrue.  On the contrary, they will 
have far greater input than currently allowed under the old 
Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the best points about the treaty, one of the issues that 
makes it work, is that the Nisga'a will no longer be covered by 
the Indian Act.  They will come out from under that archaic and 
perhaps racist piece of legislation.  They will have their own 
laws, laws similar to those of any other municipality, with some 
quasi-provincial applications and some quasi-federal 
applications.  They will become, if I can use the term, full and 
equal citizens before the law and full participants in the 
Canadian economy.  They will receive the benefits that accrue 
from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also had the opportunity to travel in British Columbia. 
Regardless of what some members in the House have said, I was not 
dragged kicking and screaming to B.C.  I voted to go to B.C.  I 
was happy to go to B.C. and I would certainly go back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing to be ashamed of in this piece of legislation. 
There is a lot to be explained.  It is the job of the government 
to provide that explanation and part of the explanation is 
travelling to B.C. and speaking to all those who want to appear 
before the committee.  Unfortunately everyone who wanted to 
appear before the committee was not able to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate having had the opportunity once again to speak to 
this important subject.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
begin by stating that the amendments proposed this morning 
strike me as useless, to say the least.  They are not in the 
least intended to improve the bill, only to delay it being 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of amendments proposed by Reformers suggests to me 
that their sole objective is to slow down the process leading to 
the passage of Bill C-9.  My colleagues and myself cannot endorse 
such action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the Nisga'a agreement overall.  Now that the 
committee deliberations are over and the bill has been 
thoroughly examined, we do not want to see it held up. 
It was important for a number of elements raised by the Nisga'a 
agreement to be discussed.  But second reading, coupled with the 
committee meetings that were held in British Columbia, leads us 
to the conclusion that we have been able to examine the bill 
properly and that amendments are not appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hardly need to reiterate that the Nisga'a final agreement was 
duly endorsed by the three parties that negotiated it.  The 
Nisga'a nation gave majority approval to it in a referendum on 
November 19, 1998.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of British Columbia signed and approved it on 
April 22, 1999 with the passage of Bill 51.  As for the federal 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, she 
ratified it this past May 4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that is left is the passage of Bill C-9 for them to finally 
have the necessary tools to develop as a nation.  The Nisga'a 
are most anxious to see this happen, and they deserve it.  They 
have been at the negotiating table for nearly 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the arrival of the first Europeans in the Nass Valley, the 
Nisga'a nation has attempted to negotiate on numerous occasions 
and to sign a treaty relating to their land claims. 
In the mid 1880s, aboriginal leaders started making 
representations to the authorities.  However, their efforts met 
with no success for several decades, because the leaders at the 
time refused to recognize the aboriginal titles to the land they 
were claiming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following written and verbal claims, official meetings and court 
proceedings, especially in the Calder case in 1973, they managed 
to establish the likelihood of ancestral claims to these lands 
and the need to negotiate to establish their ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1976, the federal government began negotiations with the 
Nisga'a tribal council.  In 1990, British Columbia joined the 
negotiations.  In February 1996, the three parties reached an 
agreement, which was finalized in August 1998 with the signature 
of the final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement therefore puts an end to over a century of 
claims.  It puts an end to many years of claims by this nation 
regarding its ancestral rights over land in the Nass Valley.  It 
means a settlement of the land rights of the Nisga'a and a 
lessening of the economic uncertainty over the ownership and the 
use of the lands and resources in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, Bill C-9 is the last stone needed to give effect to the 
tripartite agreement among the Nisga'a, the Government of 
British Columbia and the Government of Canada.  We want to 
reiterate once again the Bloc Quebecois' support for the 
agreement and its pleasure at participating in this historical 
moment for the Nisga'a. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The type of amendments proposed by the Reform members do not 
improve the bill in any way. 
Right from the outset, Reformers said they would do everything 
in their power to delay implementation of the agreement.  With 
the amendments they are now moving, that is exactly what they 
are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the nature of the bill to give effect to the Nisga'a final 
agreement, we feel it is parliament's role to debate, approve or 
reject the bill, not to amend the proposed agreement.  I repeat, 
it has been duly approved by the three parties that negotiated 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, under the provisions of clauses 36, 37 and 38 of 
Chapter 2, the agreement may not be amended without the consent 
of the Nisga'a—the Nisga'a of British Columbia, obviously—and of 
the federal government.  Amending the bill would, in our view, 
be a show of paternalism that we want no part of.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Bloc Quebecois will not be commenting on each of 
the amendments moved by Reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would simply remind the House that the Bloc Quebecois 
supported the main recommendations of the Erasmus-Dussault 
commission, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, which 
proposed an approach to the concept of self-government based on 
recognizing aboriginal governments as having jurisdiction over 
how their people were governed and their well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the entire report was predicated on recognizing 
aboriginal peoples as autonomous nations occupying a unique 
position in Canada. 
The Nisga'a final agreement fully reflects the spirit of the 
conclusions and recommendations of the Erasmus Dussault report, 
and therefore constitutes a positive step toward a healthier 
redefinition of relations between governments and the aboriginal 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of the Nisga'a, or 61% of the eligible voters, 
voted in favour of this agreement, and we acknowledge their will 
in this.  The agreement represents a compromise approved by the 
people. It is the result of close to 25 years of negotiations. 
It clearly reflects the will of a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a one-size-fits-all model.  The first nations are very 
different one from the other, and there is no single way of 
negotiating that could meet the needs of all aboriginal peoples. 
It took many years to reach this agreement, and it would be 
unrealistic to think that all such agreements will follow a 
similar path. 
There may, however, be some similarity in the paths followed by 
other nations and, in our opinion, this constitutes a very 
positive step toward improved relations between aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the Reform Party's opposition is based on an 
erroneous concept of Canada's political history.  No matter what 
they cost, they want all citizens to be treated on what they 
consider an equal footing, but they are on the wrong track.  By 
so doing, they are completely closing their eyes to the 
particular characteristics of aboriginal issues.  Equality does 
not equate with justice, and justice is what must be defended 
when culture, language and traditions are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognition of the right to self-government is recognition of the 
right of aboriginal people to possess the tools required to 
develop as a nation. 
The Reform wants to give them nothing more than the powers of a 
municipality, while retaining federal control over all of their 
decisions.  How could the Nisga'a accept having decisions 
affecting their daily lives and their culture entirely the 
responsibility of Ottawa? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform is refusing to understand the realities of aboriginal 
peoples and their culture distinctiveness.  They want to see a 
uniform vision of Canada at any price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by stating that the Bloc Quebecois supports Bill 
C-9, and opposes the amendments presented by the Reform Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the constituents of Surrey Central, British 
Columbia to speak at report stage of Bill C-9, the legislation 
which will implement the Nisga'a agreement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the people of Surrey, British Columbia and Canada who are 
listening, and for the sake of the record, I point out that the 
previous Liberal speaker, the member for 
Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, in response to a committee hearing 
in B.C., pointed out that if it was not for the Reform Party of 
Canada the committee would not have held hearings in B.C.  This 
is the same member who said that the committee hearings in B.C. 
were a dog and pony show.  That shows the arrogance of Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are considering hundreds of amendments which my colleagues 
and I in the official opposition have introduced in our effort to 
change the bill.  We are standing on behalf of aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal Canadians who know that this treaty, the treaty 
process and the bill are seriously flawed, and who want to avoid 
the many problems that will result if the Liberals have their way 
and pass the bill in its present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must add, as I did in my speech on the bill at second reading, 
because I want the record to clearly show, that the Reform Party 
is the only party in the House opposed to the bill.  Reformers 
are the only members talking about the problems that will be 
created.  We are the only members standing for Canadians and the 
Nisga'a people who have been forced to accept this treaty 
because, after decades of effort, this is all they will get. They 
are having to satisfy themselves with what is in this treaty, and 
the Liberals are in a conspiracy with other parties in the House 
to force the treaty on the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the B.C. provincial Liberal Party which opposed the bill, 
while the soon to be ousted NDP government in B.C. rammed it 
through the B.C. legislature.  The process the bill has gone 
through is a democratic travesty.  Democracy is not only marking 
an <I>x</I> on a ballot every four years; democracy is the 
continuous representation of the people, with continuous input 
from Canadians on all the decision making which affects them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals across Canada are confused about the bill.  They 
are in conflict over the bill.  The Reform Party is the only 
party in the House that has a vision for the future.  That is why 
we are the only members with the guts to raise the concerns being 
whispered by so many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one wants to offend the Nisga'a people or criticize their 
treaty.  When we talk about the Nisga'a treaty we are not talking 
against the Nisga'a people.  As a matter of fact, it is a tragedy 
that no other party in the House is acknowledging that the 
history of the government's treatment of the Nisga'a people is 
shameful.  No other party in the House is admitting that this 
treaty is a very poor attempt to make up for the way the Nisga'a 
people have been treated and what they have lost over the course 
of decades.  Most importantly, the Nisga'a will face a tough 
future as a result of this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are continuing to deny the Nisga'a an equal 
partnership in Canada and full citizenship in our great country. 
This treaty will maintain their segregation.  It tries to buy 
them off with millions of dollars in cash.  There are many 
problems with the treaty which my colleagues will address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have put forward and seconded amendments on behalf of the 
people of Surrey Central, the official opposition and those 
people in B.C. and Canada who feel strongly that the Liberals are 
making a big mistake with Bill C-9.  They are concerned with the 
coming into force of Bill C-9, knowing that the Liberals and 
other parties in the House will not likely permit amendments to 
be made to the bill in this concerted dictatorship that is being 
passed off as debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have provided hundreds of opportunities for the government to 
rethink its position and delay the passage of the bill.  We 
proposed the delay of the clauses of the bill which deal with the 
Nisga'a final agreement itself, the moneys to be paid out of the 
federal government's consolidated revenue fund and the taxation 
regime that will be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the intention of these amendments to allow time for the 
Government of Canada to wake up to what the lawyers, 
constitutional experts, historians and many other learned people 
are saying about the problems with Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also hope that by forcing a time delay in the coming into 
force of the bill the Nisga'a people, by their own means or by 
any other means, can manage a better deal.  I do not mean more 
cash, more land or resource rights based on race, but based on 
need.  I refer to a better deal that provides a good blueprint 
for future negotiations with aboriginals that satisfies all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our sole interest in this issue is to establish a new and better 
future for the Nisga'a people in their relationships with each 
other and other Canadians.  We understand that this agreement is 
all the Nisga'a people could hope to achieve.  After years of 
negotiation, most Nisga'a leaders feel they have no alternative 
to this agreement and the principles on which it is based.  We 
understand that.  For them it is this or nothing.  I am sad that 
they are forced to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than addressing the problems of our natives, our 
governments pretended that the problems did not exist and they 
hoped they would go away.  Now, rather than addressing the 
problems appropriately, the government is going to make a serious 
blunder, a serious mistake.  Two wrongs can never make a right. 
What we get is a double wrong.  That is what we are doing in 
Canada through the courtesy of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The magnitude of the consequences of the Nisga'a treaty may be 
so great that it will have the potential to spark a big fire of 
violence and threaten the peace, harmony and prosperity of our 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement contradicts one of the key founding principles of 
the Reform Party, namely that we believe in the true equality of 
Canadian citizens, with equal rights and responsibilities for 
all.  We want equality for all Canadians.  We want a new start 
for aboriginal people in Canada.  We want them to be full and 
equal participants in Canadian society, with the same rights and 
protections that every Canadian enjoys.  We want aboriginal women 
to be full and equal partners on and off Indian reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement does not meet these requirements. 
The treaty is not a perfect document because it is based on 
compromise and race, rather than on consultation and need.  The 
flawed treaty process is driven by history.  There is a need to 
undo the mistakes of past Liberal and Tory governments, but 
historians have not been included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that treaties, like diamonds, are 
forever.  That is why it is folly for negotiators to assume 
omniscience and produce voluminous treaties that attempt to cover 
every eventuality.  What if the public attitude on these issues 
changes over time?  Treaties should be based on need, not race. 
That is why the Nisga'a deal should be subject to the broadest 
and most careful public scrutiny.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, to not let British Columbians in on the deal, 
essentially negotiated in secret only after the initial ceremony 
and then told by those in authority that no change will be 
considered, is the height of Liberal arrogance.  This is simply 
unacceptable. Every opportunity should be given to all Canadians 
to have their input.  We are asking for a referendum on this 
treaty, which is so important to all Canadians, to maintain 
peace, harmony and prosperity in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
listening to the interventions by members from the Liberal Party 
the PC Party and the Bloc this morning, they talked about this 
agreement bringing certainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listening to evidence from a Queen's counsel in Vancouver at one 
of the meetings on Friday, he said that the only certainty it 
would bring was certainty for the lawyers because he could make a 
living for the rest of his days off this treaty either by 
challenging it because it was wrong or defending it because he 
thought it was right.  He said that either side would produce 
certainty of income for the lawyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the members here, who are not from B.C. and, frankly, do 
not have the faintest idea of what they are talking about, said 
that it has been in negotiations for 25 years, as if that 
justifies signing it.  Sure, it has been 25 years in negotiations 
but that does not automatically make it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that it was supported by the politically correct 
Liberals and the politically correct provincial NDP in B.C., 
neither having more than 39% of the popular vote, is enough to 
show that it was negotiated by the elite not by the grassroots, 
neither by the grassroots non-natives or the grassroots natives 
themselves.  It was negotiated by elites using formulas that have 
never worked and have no hope of working in the future either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I stood in the House on November 1 to speak on this bill, I 
specifically asked the minister to name a single Indian reserve 
anywhere in the country governed by a treaty where the standard 
of living is equal to or higher than off reserve.  That minister 
stood and completely avoided the question.  The reason is that he 
cannot answer it because there is not a single Indian reserve 
that has a higher standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can use the example of the Samson Cree reserve, probably the 
wealthiest reserve in the entire country in terms of income: $100 
million a year.  Yet 85% of the members live in poverty and I 
believe 85% of them are on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only time will tell who is correct about the Nisga'a treaty, but 
I do not see any way that the Nisga'a Tribal Council can pull off 
something that no other tribal council has been able to pull off, 
and that is a success in a treaty.  All of the evidence is 
stacked solidly against it, and that 10 years from now we will 
have the same levels of poverty and the same repression of the 
women on reserve.  These were exactly the same problems before 
the treaty existed.  There is absolutely no justification to have 
it passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not a single Liberal member from British Columbia has had the 
the gumption to stand in the House and say what needs to be said. 
They know what needs to be said.  Every one of them has heard 
the message from British Columbians that this is such an 
important deal for British Columbia that it should be subjected 
to a referendum of the people, not just the Nisga'a but the 
non-natives as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Noel Wright, a columnist in the Vancouver area said last 
weekend in his column: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the model for all future treaties with B.C. natives, it stands 
to result eventually in a province pockmarked with 50 or more 
tiny, apartheid-type independent “nations” wielding powers in 
some 14 areas that would supersede those of the provincial and 
federal governments. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the theme of many of the letters that I get from my 
constituents.  They do not see the treaty as bringing Canadians 
together.  It is separating Canadians based on race.  It is 
creating these apartheid-type or segregated-type communities that 
we will pay a heavy price for promoting in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also heard some of the members over there criticizing 
Reformers.  They make implications about our motives.  I will put 
a few things on the record here that may not be known by the 
people opposite, and I will give them the benefit of the doubt.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the leader of the party worked for many years as a 
consultant for native bands helping them to set up native 
businesses and deal with the government. The member for 
Nanaimo—Cowichan has adopted native children into his family. 
The member for Vancouver Island North is married to a Métis.  The 
member for Edmonton North lived and worked on a reserve for many 
years teaching native children.  The member for Yorkton—Melville 
also worked and lived on a native reserve.  The member for Wild 
Rose introduced a private member's bill in the House to cause an 
ombudsman to be established to help native Indians with the 
problems they have with getting help from Indian affairs to 
investigate corruption in the bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I do not have any direct connection with native bands, in 
my riding more than 200 members of the Squamish band have 
approached me by writing, coming directly to my office, via 
petition and via telephone with their concerns about Bill C-49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For anybody on the other side to say that we do not understand 
the issue, that we do not have connections with natives and do 
not understand where the problems lie in things like the treaty 
or Bill C-9, is poppycock.  We probably understand it a lot 
better than the politically correct who sit on the other side of 
the House and refuse to see that for every treaty that has ever 
been passed in the country evidence shows that they do not work. 
They create poverty.  They continue with the process of 
repression because they are styled in a socialist manner. They 
set up a socialist style of community with collective rights that 
are rife with corruption.  It does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just been corrected.  I apologize to the member for 
Vancouver Island North.  His wife is a status Indian not a Métis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberal government introduced enabling legislation for 
the Nisga'a treaty to parliament on October 21, the minister made 
it clear that there would be no committee hearings, there would 
be no travel to the provinces, there would be no amendments to 
the bill and the time for debate would be severely curtailed. 
What sort of democracy does that represent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not help us, who are elected to represent the concerns 
of our constituents, to know that the outcome of every vote is 
predetermined, that we do not have a hope of making a single 
amendment no matter how many flaws we point out in the bill.  It 
contains 252 pages.  How can there possibly not be one single 
mistake in the 252 page bill?  It is impossible.  It is 
bullet-headed.  It is arrogant for the government to assume that 
it is perfect in every respect.  As I mentioned earlier, it is 
nothing more than certainty of income for the lawyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general himself has said that the longer the treaty, 
the more likely there will be legal challenges.  At the moment we 
already have more than $9 billion worth of legal challenges under 
way to existing treaties. The Nisga'a treaty, which is not even 
law yet, is under challenge from five different groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party of British Columbia, the bedfellows of the 
federal Liberals, is challenging the treaty as unconstitutional. 
The Gitanyow first nation, as a number of other members on this 
side have mentioned, consider it an act of aggression.  They are 
challenging it in court.  The fisheries survival coalition and a 
group of Nisga'a people are taking this treaty to court.  Where 
is the certainty?  The agreement has not even gone through the 
House and there are five legal challenges against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can members on the other side of the House have the nerve to 
stand and tell us that there is certainty?  How do they have the 
nerve to tell us that it is a good agreement because it took 25 
years, when every other treaty that has ever been negotiated in 
the country has been a failure?  They have no logic to defend 
their position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my previous speech on November 1, I did bring up the issue of 
the treaty producing apartheid-like or segregated-type of 
communities.  One of the Liberal members noticed my comment and 
brought it up in a committee hearing to the chiefs of the Nisga'a 
band.  The answer from the chiefs was that they did not consider 
the deal to be apartheid-like because those affected freely voted 
for the system of government themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is apartheid not apartheid just because people voted for it?  It 
is a totally ludicrous position to take.  If we are separating 
people based on race, that is separation based on race whether we 
vote for it or not. 
This is creating segregated communities in British Columbia, not 
only non-native from native but there will be one native band 
segregated from another native band segregated from another 
native band.  They will all have their own bylaws and rules.

90% of all the Indian bands in the entire country.  Nobody 
outside of British Columbia understands the impact of this treaty 
on British Columbia.  The people of British Columbia should have 
been involved in the preparation of the treaty.  The people of 
British Columbia should have had the right to vote on the basic 
components of that treaty making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way that the treaty would have had the support of the 
people of British Columbia is if they had genuine input into the 
basics for that treaty.  Then, if necessary, the government could 
have negotiated a treaty that had public support and, if 
necessary, use the notwithstanding clause to silence the lawyers 
because it would have had the support of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands at the moment, we have a lot of big problems on our 
plate.  When this thing gets rammed through the House next week, 
the law courts will open for business and we will see years and 
years of expensive legal challenges.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is quite an interesting debate today.  I did want to respond 
to a couple of the comments that I have heard from the Liberal 
Party in particular regarding the Nisga'a final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing that comes to mind is that one of the members 
said that it was just the Reform Party that opposes the Nisga'a 
deal.  That is not true at all.  If we look at the vote that the 
Nisga'a people had, there was not an absolute consensus on the 
Nisga'a final agreement even with the them. Neither was there a 
consensus or even a majority of people in the province of B.C. 
who thought that the Nisga'a final agreement would bring 
certainty.  The official opposition in the province of B.C., the 
B.C. Liberal Party, also strenuously objects to the Nisga'a final 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To enhance that argument, I point out that I have presented 
literally thousands of names of people in my riding of 
Okanagan—Coquihalla who are opposed to the Nisga'a final 
agreement.  Through the office of petitions in the House of 
Commons, some of those are still being processed.  There are many 
more people who are still rising up and saying that there are 
major problems with the Nisga'a final agreement and they want to 
be heard.  That is why the Reform Party of Canada is bringing 
forward a number of amendments to this very important piece of 
legislation that is being put through the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be very instructive to the government that the 
majority of B.C. representatives in the Reform Party of Canada 
are opposing this.  We would not be opposing it if we were not 
hearing from our constituents in our ridings that they have 
problems with this agreement.  For the government, of which most 
of its members are from Ontario or other provinces, to argue that 
the Nisga'a final agreement is being accepted by the people of 
B.C., is just a ridiculous statement if we look at the democratic 
process that we live under.  We are here to represent the 
province of B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an interesting story to tell the House.  Some seven years 
ago, my first trip to Ottawa before I was elected, I got on the 
phone to make the flight arrangements.  I remember distinctly 
talking to the customer service representative of the airlines. 
She asked me where I was calling from and I told her that I was 
in the Okanagan Valley.  She asked me where I wanted to go and I 
said that I was going to Ottawa.  After looking on her computer 
screen she said that I could not get there from where I was. 
Although she made that comment tongue-in-cheek, and it was kind 
of humourous at the time and still is, that is the way a lot of 
British Columbians feel.  Ottawa is so far away and so disjointed 
from the way we feel in the province of British Columbia that we 
simply cannot get through to the people here, in particular the 
Liberal federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another example of how the Liberals deal with these types 
of situations.  We have had a considerable amount of unfortunate 
incidents in my riding between non-native and native groups.  It 
has affected our economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most recent ones was when the Minister of Transport 
sent a Liberal senator to make a big announcement at the 
Penticton airport.  The announcement was that the federal 
government would put $650,000 into repaving the runway at that 
airport.  That in itself is not bad and the work needs to be 
done, but the fact is that for years now I have been telling the 
government that there is a serious problem which has caused 
division in the riding between the native and non-native groups, 
that is a specific land claim against the Penticton airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I almost felt sorry for that Liberal senator.  He should have 
known, after years and years of attempting to get this message 
through to the Government of Canada, that they have to deal first 
with the root problem we are facing in Penticton, which is the 
land claim settlement and the issues with the native band 
regarding ownership of the land.  They blew into town, dropped 
$650,000, blew out of town as quickly as possible, and left the 
problem with the local people who have no authority to deal with 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has that caused?  It has caused a number of things.  It 
caused more disruption at the Penticton airport.  The band and 
the locatee families have stopped the paving company from 
fulfilling its work.  It has caused all kinds of problems but 
this is typical of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the Nisga'a agreement it is the same.  They came 
to the province of British Columbia and said that this would 
solve all their problems and left town.  They will push it 
through the House of Commons very quickly, and who will be left 
with the economic problems at the end of the day?  First it will 
be the Nisga'a people and then the people of British Columbia. 
That is unsatisfactory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from members in the House today that the agreement 
will not affect anyone else.  In the research I have done I 
discovered a briefing note from the NDP ministry of agriculture 
to the minister of agriculture which confirmed that the former 
premiers of British Columbia continually see the Nisga'a final 
agreement as a template for treaty negotiations in B.C.  I say 
former because they keep changing premiers as the NDP has trouble 
keeping someone in place there.  Then it went on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Impacts on current agricultural uses of crown resources will 
result if the Nisga'a land selection and settlement model is 
repeated. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The briefing note then detailed what the impacts would be by 
stating that we could expect to see significant localized 
disruptions to individual ranchers within close proximity to 
first nations land.  As an example it pointed out that 1,000 
farms in the south Okanagan held crown tenures within 10 
kilometres of existing Indian reserves.  The same land holds 69% 
of the British Columbia agricultural land reserve.  All this land 
will become the subject of land claims if the Nisga'a agreement 
is used as a template, which even the former premiers of British 
Columbia admit.  The briefing note went on to state: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that the total land quotum to be transferred to First Nations 
would be in the range of 5% of the total land base, an area 
larger than the total Agricultural Land Reserve.  This amount of 
land would likely consume the majority of Crown Agricultural Land 
Reserve, approximately 2.5 million hectares. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the dramatic impact of the Nisga'a final agreement in a 
riding that is so far away from the Nass Valley, the House must 
consider those problems.  We must be very cautious.  We must be 
very sure that we have processes in place to make sure that other 
economic industries, whether it is ranching, orcharding or 
natural resources such as mining and forestry, are not disrupted 
by this type of land settlement.  Those areas are of great 
interest to the province of B.C.  To say that this agreement 
brings certainty is far from the truth. 
The briefing note I have presented today is just one of the 
examples we have.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of talk in the House about private 
property.  I stress that the Nisga'a agreement gives collective 
rights.  The Reform Party would like to see it be individual 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think there will be some problems down the road.  What do we 
do when collective rights come in conflict with individual 
rights?  That is the big question.  As the Liberal government 
does time and time again with legislation, it will not spell it 
out clearly.  It will leave it to the courts, which means more 
more economic uncertainty in the province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I want to see certainty.  We want to see 
finality to the whole issue of native land claims.  Unless we 
have that we will have years and years and probably decades of 
more uncertainty in the province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the riding of Okanagan—Coquihalla and the people 
of B.C., I urge the government to look at our amendments very 
carefully and accept the express desires of the people of B.C.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member for North Vancouver asked me to correct a 
statement he made in the heat of debate in which he mentioned 
that British Columbia had over 90% of the bands in Canada.  The 
number is actually about 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a politician I thank the Liberal government for being so 
stupid, clumsy and arrogant in how it is imposing this agreement 
since it is creating animosity toward the governing Liberals that 
will not scrub away.  I am more concerned about what will happen 
to my family, my community, my province and the nation. The 
Nisga'a disagreement is the most important and the worst social 
and economic legislation and constitutional amendment in my 
lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been talking about the Nisga'a agreement since 1995.  I 
am intimately familiar with the agreement.  Much to the contrary 
of what some of its proponents have been saying, we have read the 
agreement.  We have studied it.  We are familiar with it.  I wish 
they were as familiar with it.  They are glossing over the real 
facts.  I have done more than read it.  I have analyzed it.  My 
analysis is available at my website, www.duncanmp.com. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with a heavy heart that I speak to this agreement once 
again, knowing that the government is committed to what will be 
seen down the road as a monumental social and economic blunder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to live audiences more than 25 times and sent out 
half a million householders across the province.  British 
Columbians are well informed compared with people in other 
provinces, jurisdictions and territories in terms of the Nisga'a 
agreement.  They are better informed than many members of 
parliament.  I only had to witness some of the comments this 
morning to appreciate how true that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday, November 26, I spent the afternoon in Vancouver at 
the official opposition sponsored hearings.  I will briefly talk 
about three presentations that were made because they illuminate 
with some clarity what is going on.   Mike deJong and Geoffrey 
Plant, provincial MLAs from the B.C. Liberal Party, the official 
opposition; Jeff Rustand, the lawyer representing Mr. Lloyd 
Brinson, a small landowner in the Nass Valley of British Columbia 
who is surrounded by Nisga'a lands; and Miss Kerry-Lynne Findlay, 
Q.C., a lawyer and Musqueam leaseholder, appeared as witnesses.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly both B.C. official opposition Liberals and Mr. 
Lloyd Brinson have launched lawsuits in attempts to bring 
accountability and common sense to this federal and provincial 
negotiated agreement which has excluded the public interest and 
flies in the face democracy, equality and constitutional 
principles.  For starters, I will quote Kerry-Lynne Findlay: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a Musqueam leaseholder.  I live there with my husband and 
four children.  I am a mortgage holder.  I am also a lawyer and I 
seem to have found myself in the role of kind of general counsel 
and spokesperson for the Musqueam leaseholders.  I have advocated 
on their behalf in many areas.  Taxation without representation, 
Bill C-9, particularly the expropriation portions of that bill, 
and the treaty process in general.  One of the comments I am 
always given, one of the answers I am always given by the federal 
government is that the Musqueam situation has no bearing on Bill 
C-9, which is separate legislation.  It has no bearing on the 
Nisga'a Treaty, which is a separate matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has no bearing on 
the treaty process in general, which is a separate matter.  I 
have a fundamental disagreement with that concept because I 
believe it is part of an overall approach of divide and conquer, 
which is very much alive and well in Canada in 1999.  All of 
these legislative initiatives, the treaty process, what is 
happening through the transfer of taxation powers to aboriginals 
under the Indian Act, this is all about the transfer of power and 
authority and the setting up of new governance institutions and 
new governing systems.  Of course the stakes are very high... 
There are many aspects of the treaty that concern Musqueam 
leaseholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They include, if I can just highlight, the 
treatment of non-aboriginals on aboriginal lands; the fact that 
the treaty is one step away from giving taxing authority to the 
Nisga'a and, in our experience, could very well mean taxation 
without representation and all of what that entails because of 
the lack of vote that non-aboriginals have in Indian government; 
the lack of a timetable for this Nisga'a self-sufficiency; the 
open-ended financial commitment that all taxpayers are being 
asked to enter into and, of course, the constitutional level 
changes we are dealing with...all of this process reminds me very 
much of the discussions around the Meech and Charlottetown 
accord.  At that time I was the National Chair of the 
constitutional law section of the Canadian Bar Association.  I 
was very involved in those discussions and the process that 
evolved at that time.  What happened there, of course, is not 
news to most people here, is there was the Canadian elite, those 
who headed up the large businesses, large monopolies of the 
country, big business and big government, got behind both of 
those and said that's the way this country should look, that is 
what we want. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Findlay continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that, in part, as a Liberal, and I want to say that today 
because I think it's important.  I have been a Liberal Party 
member nationally and provincially since I was a teenager.  I 
worked for that party.  I've actively campaigned for that party 
in elections.  I have acted as a legal adviser to people who are 
now members of parliament.  I am fundamentally ashamed of that 
party and its lack of vision...I use the word “ashamed” because 
it is the true feeling I have and I think many of us will have 
right now because of the way the government has shown its 
indifference and arrogance on this issue.  It is a fundamental 
issue for the Canadian fabric and it is important to both 
non-aboriginals and aboriginals that it be handled well and 
clearly and that the guidelines be precise. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had testimony from Geoffrey Plant and Mike deJong of the 
B.C. Liberal opposition.  I will quote briefly from what they had 
to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have commenced a court action.  We have concerns about what is 
in this treaty, we have concerns about the self-government 
provisions, we have concerns about a treaty that would purport to 
limit your ability to vote for a government that has 
responsibility over you and limit that right to vote on the basis 
of your ethnicity.  We think that's wrong.  We think a fishery, a 
commercial fishery, based on an allocation that is tied to 
ethnicity is wrong, and we think there are alternatives...We're 
asking the court to declare that the Nisga'a final agreement is 
unconstitutional.  There are three basic pillars of the argument. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They went through them and concluded by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we're right on any of those points, then what has happened is 
that the governments have tried to negotiate a document which is 
outside their constitutional authority to do so. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we had testimony from another very interesting witness, 
and these are only three of many,  Mr. Rustand, representing 
Lloyd Brinson, a small landowner in the Nass Valley.  I will 
quote a bit from his speech because I am running out of time.  He 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Brinson owns a small patch of land up in the Nass Valley. The 
land that he owns is going to be if this treaty is implemented 
surrounded by what is known as the Nisga'a Lands. Now, what this 
means is that although Lloyd's land will remain technically part 
of the B.C. Land Title system and part of B.C. and subject to the 
laws of Victoria and Canada, all the lands about him will be 
subject to the laws and the administration of the Nisga'a 
government.  To give you a microcosmic view of what this means 
for Lloyd and others who will be in his position, this means that 
everything related to his livelihood and his daily living will be 
under the purview of a government that is established for the 
purpose of administering to the needs of a racially defined 
group, on a communal basis, without an outsider. The issues that 
will come up for Mr. Brinson are such things as water...wood-lot 
rights, he requires wood for his heating...simple things like 
garbage disposal, business activities, commercial transactions, 
zoning, access to health, education, maybe not so much for Mr. 
Brinson, payment of local taxes....Because Mr. Brinson lacks the 
bloodlines to qualify as a Nisga'a citizen, the treaty takes a 
giant step backward to something which, if this happened in any 
other community in Canada today, would be considered an 
abomination. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rafe Mair said recently in a public meeting which I attended, 
“Never assume that the people in charge know what they are 
doing”.  That is what is happening with this Nisga'a 
disagreement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I find it rather interesting that only members of the 
Reform Party seem to feel that this tremendously important 
legislation which is before us is worthy of debate.  I do not 
know why we are not hearing, for example, from the British 
Columbia representatives in the Liberal Party.  Perhaps they are 
a bit afraid to show their faces around here.  I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This appears to have turned out to be “dump on B.C. week”.  We 
have a government which is using its heavy-handed powers to 
impose its will upon a province which freely entered into 
Confederation in 1871.  I asked a fellow from B.C. the other day 
if he could tell me for sure if it entered Confederation in 1871 
or 1872.  He said “I am not quite sure, but I will sure remember 
the day we leave”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what really concerns me.  Over here we have the 
so-called party of national unity, which expends a great deal of 
hot air telling us how it wants to keep Canada together, yet it 
has mounted a full frontal attack against one of our major 
provinces.  Why, I do not know, but I find it extremely 
disconcerting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals purported to want to consult after the fact 
with residents of B.C., after they had already tabled their 
legislation for the treaty in the House, they went through a 
little dog and pony show, or some smoke and mirrors.  They were 
going to consult with the people of British Columbia and they 
were going to have hearings out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already heard in the House today how that went.  Only a 
very select group of people were allowed to appear before that 
committee.  When the government could not find suitable 
pro-treaty people to appear before the committee in some of the 
smaller cities, it flew them in from Vancouver and Victoria to 
appear before the committee because it had to stack it.  That is 
not my definition of democracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, or perhaps it will not be fortunate because I do 
not know what good it will do when we live with an elected 
dictatorship, but nevertheless I will say fortunately, the Reform 
Party representatives from B.C. were able to hold their own 
hearings and they invited interested parties on both sides of the 
issue to address the treaty.  They received many submissions.  I 
just pulled a bunch of them off the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote from some of the eloquent testimony that was 
given at those hearings.  I emphasize the word eloquent because 
these people were speaking from the heart.  They were fighting 
for their lives, basically.  If I ever hear the degree of 
eloquence in the House that came out in these hearings, 
particularly from over yonder, I will be a very pleased man 
indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote briefly from some of the submissions that were 
made.  Clearly there are some 60 pages of fine print.  I wish I 
could read it all, but I am sure the Speaker would not permit 
that.  The Speaker is nodding his agreement.  Therefore, I will 
quote a few little highlights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is part of the submission of Mr. Doug Massey.  Doug Massey 
is a fisherman.  His father immigrated to Canada from Ireland. 
He got into the fishing business.  His son came in and took up 
the business behind him. These are some of the comments which Mr. 
Massey made: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this land and resource known as British Columbia has 
been provided in trust to all inhabitants, past and present, to 
be used as a source of life and to be protected for the 
continuance of life.  No one segment of the human race should be 
recognized as having claim merely by being here longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ireland...to fish or hunt for wildlife or wild fowl was 
illegal, for every stream and forest was owned by land barons and 
anyone caught was a trespasser and a criminal.  You can 
understand why, upon arrival in British Columbia, my father 
considered this to be a land of freedom, plenty and untold 
beauty.  Are we heading in the direction of the Irish where we 
are not going to be able to even enter into our own forest to 
hunt and fish? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could answer Mr. Massey.  The answer is yes, because the 
Nisga'a treaty is widely acknowledged by people on both sides of 
the debate to be a template.  More than 100% of the rural land of 
British Columbia is covered by land claims—overlapping land 
claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Nisga'a becomes the pattern, as it must for future land 
claims agreements, we will end up with a situation where the 
average citizen of British Columbia will be excluded from 
entering what is now the public domain in the same respect that 
people in my part of Canada are now excluded from entering Indian 
reserves.  The difference is that in B.C. most of the land will 
end up with reserve status if people follow the course they have

</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard somebody in the House this morning state that there are 
no dangers in the Nisga'a treaty for native women, that their 
rights will be truly respected; don't worry, be happy.  I would 
also like to quote Ms. Wendy Lundberg, a status Indian from the 
Squamish Nation.  She delivered a very long dissertation.  She 
lives off reserve.  She is unable, therefore, to claim access to 
many of the benefits, such as mortgage and rent-free housing, 
freedom from taxes and other benefits which reserve members 
enjoy. 
This is what she had to say about reserve governments and what 
she foresees for the Nisga'a government:

</I></B></P><P align=left>In an attempt to build a better relationship between native and 
non-native Canadians a federal action plan called Gathering 
Strength was introduced by the former Minister of Indian 
Affairs....To grassroots native people, particularly native women 
and band members outside the governing elite, Gathering Strength 
appropriately describes another tool used by male dominated 
councils to maintain their control over federal funding, programs 
and governance.  Gathering Strength is exactly what our so-called 
native leaders have been doing to the detriment of their own 
people who remain oppressed under their leadership.  While young 
native warriors are out on the front lines hunting, fishing and 
logging, native leaders armed with cell phones, lap tops and the 
Internet sit comfortably on padded, ergonomically correct swivel 
chairs, orchestrating their assertions from behind massive 
mahogany desks.  They are secure in the knowledge of supportive 
fellow leaders with whom they have set up mutually beneficial 
advisory boards, joint ventures and partnerships.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the Indian Act was put into place is because natives 
were considered to be stupid and irresponsible and the Indian Act 
allowed the government to control them.  This is the same logic 
used by the chiefs today to control their own people.  I assert 
that self-reliance and self-government must go hand in hand with 
responsibility, accountability and transparency.  Native leaders 
say they must exercise what they believe is their inherent right 
to hunt, fish or log.  They say they must do this in order to 
educate, house and feed their people, even though native programs 
are funded $3.6 billion annually by the federal government. 
Where does this money go to?  This is a question that continually 
perplexes me. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do not think Ms. Lundberg is very perplexed, but she 
was being polite when she made her submission.  This particular 
question has been raised many times in the House by members of 
this party.  I think it is something that has to be taken into 
consideration when we talk about a treaty which will be 
constitutionally cast in stone if it is approved by the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is with mixed emotions that I rise today to speak to 
Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my perspective, it is a shame that the bill in its current 
form has come to the House without the adoption of solutions that 
my colleagues in the Reform Party have put forth, and in 
particular the member for Skeena, who in my view has done an 
excellent job on this particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to take a different tack.  I am going to look at what 
the government, aboriginal people and Reform would agree on with 
respect to this issue.  If we looked at the heart of what we do 
not agree on, at the end of the day I think we would find that we 
agree on a great deal.  However, we disagree on the way to pursue 
it.  In fact, we would counter that what the government is trying 
to do in achieving this goal will do the exact opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the emancipation of aboriginal people.  In the 
words of an aboriginal gentleman who wrote an editorial 
countering mine in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> about a week ago, 
“We agree on the integration, not assimilation of aboriginal 
people.  We also strongly believe and support the ability and the 
right of aboriginal people, as guaranteed under our constitution, 
to engage in their traditional activities for traditional 
purposes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with all of that.  We also agree wholeheartedly in 
reversing the appalling socioeconomic conditions that aboriginal 
people find themselves them in:  a suicide rate four to five 
times that of the non-aboriginal population; a diabetes rate that 
is three to four times higher than that of the non-aboriginal 
population; a high mortality rate; a shorter lifespan; a high 
infant mortality rate; and, in effect, socioeconomic conditions 
that rival those found in third world countries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say from personal experience, having flown into reserves 
where the unemployment rate is 80%, there is a very high rate of 
fetal alcohol syndrome, people living with many in a house that 
does not have proper ventilation, where elderly people are 
sleeping in the middle of the living room on soiled mattresses. 
When I do house calls to these homes, it breaks my heart to see 
that and to watch the children with infections on their faces 
that I have not seen since being in a developing nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at what is going on here.  The government 
wants to pursue a treaty negotiation.  If it was good, let us 
take a look at what treaty negotiations have done.  We need not 
look any further than what has taken place east of the Rockies 
where treaties have been signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If treaty negotiations were effective then we would find the 
people east of the Rockies who have had treaties negotiated with 
conditions that are a lot better.  But their situation in many 
cases is as appalling as the conditions in British Columbia where 
treaties have not been signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaties in and of themselves and the way that they have been 
negotiated rather than integrating, not assimilating aboriginal 
people have actually been a boot on the neck of aboriginal 
people, causing their separation.  This is the crux of the 
argument that my colleagues and I are proffering to the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Yukon, an aboriginal lady herself, spoke 
eloquently and mentioned the important point we agree on, that 
aboriginal people want to be treated the same as everyone else. 
If that was the case, then all we would need to do is remove the 
barriers that governments in past years have instituted in law to 
separate aboriginal people from non-aboriginal people.  If we 
remove those laws, instead of hindering aboriginal people with 
such things as the racist Indian Act, those restrictions on 
aboriginal people will be removed. It would still leave them with 
socioeconomic conditions that are appalling.  It would still 
leave them far behind the eight ball, but instead of investing 
moneys into a bureaucracy, exemplified by the department of 
Indian affairs, and putting money into the sink hole, we could 
make sure that those moneys are used on the hard edge of helping 
aboriginal people help themselves. We could give them the tools, 
give them the ability to provide for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings to mind another problem that we have with this whole 
process.  Members on the other side say “This is going to 
empower aboriginal people”.  Every member in the House knows 
that the powers do not go to individual aboriginal people.  It 
goes to a collective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not doing this out of spite, but there is a fundamental 
lesson.  Regardless of racial background an individual human 
being cannot be empowered if the power is not given to them, but 
is given to a collective.  The Nisga'a treaty in Bill C-9 is an 
extension of what the government and previous governments have 
been doing for decades.  They have been empowering the aboriginal 
people on top at the expense of the individual aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person living in Kanesatake, Kahnawake, Yukon or downtown 
Vancouver off reserve, how can that individual aboriginal person 
ever be able to have self-respect and pride if they are unable to 
provide for themselves, unable to provide for their families, 
unable to contribute to their society?   How are they and their 
society going to get the pride and self-respect that they so 
richly deserve?  They cannot.  No one can.  People cannot get 
pride and self-respect unless they take it.  They cannot get 
pride and self-respect unless they have the power to be able to 
provide for themselves.  They cannot do that by living in an 
institutionalized welfare state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In point of fact that is what the government has been doing for 
years.  This is the system that we have for aboriginal people 
today.  We have an institutionalized welfare state.  It has 
rotted them.  What a profound tragedy that this has happened, not 
for all but for most.  For those bands that have been successful, 
their leadership has acted in a very responsible way to share 
with and involve their people. 
Unfortunately, that is not the case in too many situations.  In 
fact, of the 660 bands that exist in the country today, roughly, 
150 of those or more had to be investigated by the department 
because of misappropriation of funds.  There are bands into which 
millions of dollars are poured, yet the people live in abject 
poverty.  Why?  The department will turn its back on that.

constitution.  We want to see them integrated, not assimilated 
members of Canadian society.  We want to see the changes in those 
socioeconomic conditions and we want to see the money that is 
poured into the situation go to help the people, not to create a 
bureaucracy.

Rather than creating a system where people who live in Nunavut 
can live according to their traditional ways congruent with their 
traditional activities, we are creating a society of pencil 
pushers.  We are creating a society of bureaucrats.  That is no 
more congruent to the history of a person living in Nunavut than 
it is for us to be hunting polar bears.  It does not work that 
way.  In the creation of Nunavut we are actually committing 
cultural genocide in slow motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to take a careful look at what is going on 
up there.  It is rotting the heart and soul of a proud people. 
That is unfathomable and unforgivable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to work with grassroots aboriginal people to make sure 
the limited resources that exist today go to the people who need 
them so they will have the tools to be employed, the health care 
they deserve, the educational opportunity, the employment 
opportunity, the housing opportunity and they will take charge, 
as individual men and women, of their destiny as an integrated, 
not assimilated, part of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not being spiteful by pursuing the course that we have. 
We are not being spiteful by standing alone in the House against 
the Nisga'a treaty.  We do it because we care.  We do it because 
we want to see, as all members of parliament do, the situation 
change.  If we ask members from all political parties behind the 
scenes they will admit that we are creating a Gordian knot.  We 
are tying ourselves up in a situation from which we will not be 
able to extricate ourselves and it will be a system that will 
affect all of us in an egregious fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the government will listen to my colleagues' 
constructive suggestions that we have put forth so that all of us 
can work with all aboriginal people to ensure that they are 
empowered and have the same rights, responsibilities and hope for 
the future as non-aboriginals have.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The year is 2025.  A young woman has arrived in Vancouver with 
her small children to seek her fortune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The azure of the sky and ocean, the green of the forested 
mountains filled her with exhilaration and hope.  Not for long. 
Vancouver, bounded by Musqueam, Sto:lo, Squamish and other 
national territories, though vital at its core as a city-state, 
inhabited by an international population, was crumbling at its 
extremities where aboriginal government had the purchased land 
and incorporated it into the national territories ceded by recent 
treaties, thereby removing them from provincial and municipal tax 
base.  Tenants faced with sky rocketing rents, no longer able to 
vote for local government, and no longer fully protected by the 
Canadian constitution, were bailing out.  As a result, rents both 
on Indian lands and in the city centre were among the highest in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite heavy subsidies provided by the federal 
government, since the signing over of over 5 treaties, aboriginal 
leadership claimed they could not finance the infrastructure for 
the rapidly expanding land base.  Animosity toward treaty 
aboriginals was so high they no longer were safe to walk the 
streets of Vancouver unprotected.  She decided to head up north. 
There were teaching positions advertised in the Nisga'a national 
territory, a vast area at the time of ratification of the treaty, 
about four-fifths of the size of Vancouver Island.  With the 
recent expansion and incorporation of surrounding lands, the 
territory had now grown to 125 per cent of the size of Vancouver 
Island.  It had taken two days passing through interminable 
aboriginal territorial check points to get there.  Twice she had 
been checked by aboriginal militia for contraband, fish, 
wildlife, meats or plants prohibited from being transported from 
one tribal territory to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twice she'd been fined for 
being in possession of goods without a bill of sale from an 
establishment in that territory.  Twice she'd had to buy permits 
for legal access on to lands away from the highway.  The 
countryside was littered with abandoned houses, those of white 
settlers, peoples whose families had been there for nearly a 
hundred years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They'd suddenly found themselves, as a result of 
treaties, or through the expansion of aboriginal lands, either on 
or surrounded by aboriginal homeland territory.  Ironically, those 
disenfranchised citizens of a diminishing Canadian nation 
regarded themselves as native Canadians born and bred over many 
generations.  Now they were dispossessed and bitter living in 
city enclaves like Prince George and Prince Rupert.  As she went 
farther north, the encounters at borders got more tense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young men of the various aboriginal militia dressed in camouflage 
fatigues sat on armoured all-terrain vehicles nervously fondling 
their assault weapons.  There had been clashes among Gitanyow and 
Nisga'a militia and others, and the Gitanyow were specially 
bitter about the original Nisga'a Treaty ratified back in the turn 
of the century.  They claim that they had been cheated out of 
much of their traditional territory.  They cursed the politicians 
of the time, both white and aboriginal.  She arrived in New 
Aiyansh, the major Nisga'a centre.  To her surprise, it looked 
much like an Indian reserve of old, but bigger.  Unprepossessing 
tract houses, most fewer than two years old, were scattered to the 
horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until she came to a very posh suburb of large, palatial 
houses more reminiscent of southern California than northern 
British Columbia, patrolled by uniformed security and guard dogs. 
It was where the chiefs and the executive council lived.  The 
charming young man from the Nisga'a University explained to her 
that these standards of living were necessary to attract capable 
people into politics and administration.  Since the resources 
were held in common, you couldn't borrow against individual land 
or resources to build a business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She got the job and as she 
lived there, she discovered that individual Nisga'a trying to get 
ahead would move any finances they acquired off-shore buying 
condos in Hawaii, et cetera, to avoid them being reabsorbed by 
the nation when there was a change in the administration and a 
rival family got into power.  She fell in love, got married and 
ended up living with the young Nisga'a man for four years.  He 
spoke longingly of united native nations that would opt out of 
B.C. entirely, but several forces colluded and produced a crisis. 
Canada racked by the financial demands of treaties renegotiated 
across the country, reduced subsidies drastically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a 
nation having expanded quickly, was over-extended and things grew 
worse as border clashes increased with the discovery of oil and 
gas in the disputed territories.  Resources, especially precious, 
as the nation paid no royalties to the Canadian or B.C. 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her partner was voted out of office and went into a downward 
spiral personally.  Eventually he asked her to leave and she 
moved with her children into an empty house.  Her lawyer informed 
her that under Nisga'a law she had no right to any support or 
compensation.  She received notice she was being terminated in 
her teaching position.  Non-Nisga'a did not qualify for tenure. 
The Nisga'a administration building was blown up soon after.  A 
group of disaffected, displaced, residents calling themselves 
Canadians Against Racism claimed responsibility.  As a result, 
all whites on Nisga'a land were told their movements would be 
severely restricted.  Given the sudden instability, the Nisga'a 
deal with the Japanese oil developers fell through.  She took her 
children and headed north and east, perhaps to Ontario or 
Nunavut, where she'd heard that a non-aboriginal still had 
rights.

segregation, settlement without disenfranchisement.  Canadians 
must act on the courage of their convictions if they believe that

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to close with two points of my own because I 
mentioned the Gitanyow being concerned about a conflict with 
land.  When the all party committee held its meeting in Smithers 
members of the Bloc Quebecois stated to the Gitanyow that they 
were interested in supporting an amendment to the treaty which 
would take the disputed lands out of the treaty at this time and 
hold them apart.  I have yet to see that amendment come forth 
from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has told us that the people of B.C. will have a 
vote.  We have called for a referendum.  Government members state 
that the residents of British Columbia will have a vote through 
B.C. members of parliament.  B.C. members of parliament, 
represented largely by the Reform Party, in consultation with 
their constituents are voting against this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will honour its own words and allow B.C. 
MPs to represent their constituents, recognize that it is a B.C. 
treaty and withdraw this legislation.  At the very minimum the 
government should give them a vote.  If it will not allow their 
MPs to direct the government then those people should be allowed 
to vote themselves.  It is a troubling word to the party on the 
other side but that is democracy.

that were the case.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Native leaders say that the federal government has a fiduciary 
responsibility to protect their interests and their rights, but 
in a treaty of collectivity, how are the rights of the individual 
going to be protected?  As a native woman, as a status member of 
the Squamish Indian Band, I can tell you that individual rights 
will not be protected.  I know, because as recently as June 1999, 
my individual rights were not protected by the federal government 
that allowed Squamish Band Council to falsely represent me and 
enter into an agreement under Bill C-49, the First Nations Land 
Management Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was legislated even without a treaty on to the path of 
self-government, whether or not I wanted to be there.  My rights 
and freedoms are supposed to be protected under the charter, but 
native women in Canada know even without the ratification of any 
treaty, that the charter does not apply to them.  In fact, after 
the passing of Bill C-49, the Native Women's Association of 
Canada had to resort to the filing of a lawsuit to bring forward 
the total failure of the federal government to provide any 
protection for native women's property rights.  These rights 
which are protected for non-native women in Canada include the 
rights to an equal division of property on marriage breakdown, 
inheritance and expropriation on reserve lands.  The rights of 
all aboriginal peoples, including aboriginal women, are supposed 
to be protected by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the rights and freedoms of all Canadians, native and non-native, 
are supposed to be guaranteed equally to male and female persons 
under section 28 of the charter.  Already, though, we have seen 
that this is just not the case.  The individual rights of my 
mother, Nona Lockhart, a native woman born on reserve, have not 
been protected.  In 1947 she was stripped of her native status 
and Squamish Band membership because she married a non-native 
man.  This discriminating rule of the Indian Act did not apply to 
native men, who could marry whomever they pleased without 
punishment or loss of their identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When her father died, my 
mother could not even live in the house where she was raised or 
inherit his two properties on reserve lands, despite the 
existence of an Indian Affairs approved will.  My mother was 
theoretically reinstated pursuant to Bill C-31 in 1988, but 
Squamish Band Council has not returned her property to her, 
thereby denying my mother her rightful inheritance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While thousands of native women in Canada suffer similar injustices at 
the discretion of their own band councils, the federal government 
ignores its fiduciary responsibility to them.  My mother is a 
Canadian citizen, she should be protected by section 28 of the 
charter, which guarantees rights and freedoms equally to men and 
women and by section 15 which says that every individual is equal 
before and under the law without discrimination based on race, 
ethnic origin or sex.  And although my mother's story is 
documented in my testimony before the standing Senate committee 
on aboriginal peoples in a hearing in May 1999, the federal 
government still has not exercised its fiduciary responsibility 
to her and litigation is not an accessible option to native 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In debates on Bill C-49, some female members of 
parliament, non-native women, whose rights are enshrined in the 
charter said that each native band would determine these issues 
in their communities, based on unique native cultures.  History 
will show that in 1999, the Canadian government allowed the 
perpetuation of discrimination, alienation and injustice of 
native women under the guise of cultural freedom, unique rights 
and unique cultural identity.  Clearly, treaties and 
self-government issues have personal significance to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And in preparation for debate with my own band, I have studied Nisga'a 
treaty documents, the most comprehensive being the agreements 
between Canada, British Columbia and the Nisga'a Nation. 
Although the Nisga'a constitution makes reference to the charter, 
it is the wording of the proviso: “Bearing in mind the free and 
democratic nature of Nisga'a government” under section 6(2), 
which is the most disconcerting to me.  The Nisga'a treaty is not 
just about a northern territory of British Columbia, it's about 
the future of Canada as a whole, and how peoples and communities, 
native and non-native will co-exist.  While the chiefs will argue 
that all treaties will be different and unique to each native 
band, ultimately it will be the same leaders who will have the 
resources to protect their interests and take their cases to the 
courts seeking interpretation of the precedent setting words in 
the Nisga'a Treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Native women, powerless, penniless and 
unable to access the courts for their individual rights will be 
at home, if they have a home, anxiously awaiting the court's 
decision. And I'd just like to add a couple of footnotes to that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>And my second footnote, I would like to say that my mother, Nona 
Lockhart, lives in Richmond, B.C. and is a constituent of the 
Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific.  I would like to comment on 
something I saw on CPAC last week.  It involved Question Period 
on November 22, 1999, and the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development was commenting on the protest against the 
Nisga'a treaty in Vancouver last Friday.  He said, and I quote 
from <I>Hansard</I>:  “Mr. Speaker, I just got back from visiting 
British Columbia on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  One of the 
things I noted was that Reformers tried their hardest.  I have 
never seen them work so hard.  In a huge metropolitan city like 
Vancouver they managed to get a whole 200 people out to say they 
were opposed to the Nisga'a deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in the labour 
movement I could do that with one phone call and I would get 500 
people out”.  Well, I would like to suggest to the minister of 
Indian affairs that the reason there were so few native women out 
in Vancouver last Friday demonstrating their opposition to the 
treaty is because they did not know about the hearings taking 
place and they have probably not had the benefit of reading the 
treaty documents, and even if they did know about the hearings, 
they...could not afford even the bus fare to get there. The 
Native Women's Association of Canada receives nowhere near the 
amount of funding that the Assembly of First Nations does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And lastly, I would also like to table to the committee and these 
proceedings a copy of a letter dated November 1, 1999, that I 
received from the Secretary of State for the Status of Women, in 
which she acknowledges the legislative gap of native women's 
property rights, and in which she supports the government's 
position and belief that native women's rights will be addressed 
by First Nations communities.  In other words, her 
acknowledgement that her rights as a non-native Canadian woman 
are protected and guaranteed under the charter, while I, my aunt 
and other native women have to fight for our rights.  And I would 
just like to table that document to this hearing please.  Thank 
you— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then in a footnote she said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that the ministers and the government are totally 
ignoring the issues.  They are not listening to the grassroots 
people and they are not exercising their fiduciary responsibility 
to us.  They only speak and deal with the chiefs and councils, 
and I have documented in black and white...many of the problems 
and issues that we face.  I am not making problems come out of 
the air.  These are evidentiary matters documented and presented 
to the government and still they ignore the native women and the 
grassroots members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to join in this debate.   Primarily this 
morning and this afternoon speakers from our side have been from 
British Columbia, and rightly so.  The Nisga'a agreement is first 
and foremost of concern to British Columbians but that is not 
exclusive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some two years ago the former minister of Indian affairs landed 
in my riding and reopened one of the traditional treaties, Treaty 
No. 8, for renegotiation and what is termed modernization of the 
treaty. The Nisga'a agreement gives us a glimpse of what the 
government's concept of a modern day treaty will be and 
entrenches that concept in the constitution of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that my constituents and those in other parts of Canada 
should pay attention and have a vested interest because the whole 
movement to entrench self-government in modern day treaties will 
at some point in time affect them just as it is now affecting 
British Columbia.  On that basis I am pleased to raise my 
concerns on the Nisga'a deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a Supreme Court of Canada decision in the Lord Elgin Hotel 
case the court says that the constitution of Canada does not 
belong to parliament.  Nor does it belong to the provincial 
legislatures.  It belongs to the people of Canada.  What we are 
talking about here is modifying the constitution without due 
consideration by all involved members. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is primarily a constitutional change by the government 
without due consideration for the others involved, namely the 
Nisga'a people, British Columbians and Canadians.  I do not 
believe that this piece of legislation acts in the best interests 
of any of the involved parties.  Although it claims to present 
the Nisga'a with greater freedoms, it will in fact entrench 
greater controls on their society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will act as a template for up to 50 other treaty 
negotiations within British Columbia.  As I said, after British 
Columbia it may very well be the template for modernizing the 
traditional treaties that have existing for 100 years in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ignore the needs of the Nisga'a could result in numerous 
other treaties that drastically diminish the rights of other 
bands across the country.  For the sake of the Nisga'a and for 
other bands who entering into negotiations, this cannot happen. 
It behoves us to get this first treaty right so that it deals 
fairly with everybody involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently within the Nisga'a final agreement, the rights of the 
Nisga'a people granted under the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms may be substantially diminished.  I would refer the 
House to the fact that the treaty grants supreme legislative 
authority in at least 14 areas, so parliament or the provincial 
legislature cannot ever override Nisga'a law in these areas. 
Quite frankly, that makes me nervous and should make others in 
this country nervous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, section 3 of the treaty expressly states that the 
entire agreement, including the self-government powers that I 
just mentioned, are to be defined as aboriginal and treaty rights 
within the meaning of section 35 of the constitution.  As our 
critic pointed out this morning, that is one of the major 
concerns we have with this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 25 of the constitution requires courts to give higher 
weighting to these section 35 aboriginal rights, which are of 
course collective rights over their charter rights.  What this 
means in simple terms is that the collective rights of the 
Nisga'a government, including its vast legislative powers, can 
most definitely be used to overpower the individual charter 
rights of rank and file Nisga'a members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ideally, such a situation would never be of concern, and we want 
to believe that the individual rights of Nisga'a people will 
never be in jeopardy or compromised, but is it really wise to 
pass legislation that is based on the mere assumption of fair 
treatment.  History would say otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the government absolutely guarantee that at no time in the 
future will the individual rights of members of the Nisga'a band 
come into conflict with the collective rights of the Nisga'a 
government.  I do not believe that such a promise can possibly be 
made and, because of this, section 3 of Bill C-9 must not go 
forward in its present form. The rights of present and future 
Nisga'a are far too important to disregard them on a wish and a 
prayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this treaty is enacted, effectively a third level of 
government will be formed that is created exclusively along 
ethnic lines.  It seems to me that this is another dangerous 
precedent that this legislation will set.  The Nisga'a government 
will hold absolute control in 14 areas and share jurisdiction in 
16 fields.  Because these powers will be entrenched in a treaty, 
it will amount to a third order of government in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members from other parties in the House have claimed that the 
Nisga'a government would be municipal in nature and that it 
conforms to the constitution.  In at least 14 specific areas of 
the treaty, the treaty reads “in the event of an inconsistency 
or conflict between a Nisga'a law under this paragraph and a 
federal or provincial law, the Nisga'a law prevails to the extent 
of the inconsistency or conflict.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this ruling applies to areas such as health services, 
chapter 11, paragraph 84, page 174 of the agreement; child and 
family services, chapter 11, paragraph 89, page 174; and 
adoption, chapter 11, paragraph 96, page 175, the ramifications 
are staggering.  It is obvious that under these arrangements the 
federal and provincial governments are proposing to permanently 
cede legislative authority.  No municipal government in this 
country has the powers that even approach the levels of the 
Nisga'a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a third order of government also raises 
constitutional questions, for what this treaty proposes is to 
amend the constitution without due process or regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 91 and 92 of our constitution thoroughly divides 
legislative powers in Canada between the federal and provincial 
governments. 
Without amending the constitution, the federal government and 
B.C. do not have the right to cede legislative authority to the 
Nisga'a government.  In order to amend the constitution, a 
referendum would automatically occur in British Columbia which, 
as we have heard, has not happened and will not likely happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned at the beginning of my comments that our 
constitution does not belong to parliament or the law makers.  It 
belongs to the people of Canada.  Only with the consent of 
Canadians can legislative authority be changed or ceded. However, 
the government is completely ignoring the constitution in its 
rush to approve this treaty.  In doing so, it is doing a great 
disservice to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until this point in my comments, I have focused primarily on how 
Bill C-9 is an irresponsible piece of legislation due to how it 
will impact on the Nisga'a people.  However, Canada is an 
interconnected nation and what affects one group of people 
inevitably and strongly impacts on us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that in its present state, the Nisga'a treaty 
will grant the Nisga'a band collective ownership of 1,992 square 
kilometres of land in the Nass Valley.  An additional 10,000 
square kilometre area is designated as the Nisga'a wildlife 
management area, and access by forestry and mining concerns to 
this area may be seriously restricted or cut off.  The Nisga'a 
will also be granted a priority commercial fishing allocation on 
the Nass River.  If future negotiations take the same path as the 
Nisga'a treaty, it could result in 50 or more governments in 
British Columbia.  This is an area that would also transfer 
certainly with concerns to my part of Canada, the northern part 
of Alberta, and how such an agreement would impact on the 
provincial ownership and management of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent weeks, months and years efforts have been made by the 
aboriginal groups in my area to gain exactly this same kind of 
control over what they term as traditional territory and will 
have huge impacts on natural resource management and development 
in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This lack of consistency that we see in this particular section 
in how the province is governed will have ramifications for 
economic development not only in British Columbia but also in 
Alberta and other provinces in Canada. Long term development of 
natural resources may be impeded, causing long range impacts that 
will affect all British Columbians and Canadians from coast to 
coast in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians as a whole also face serious impacts should this 
treaty go through as it presently exists.  The federal government 
has estimated the total cost of the Nisga'a deal at around $490 
million. This includes $312 million in cash costs and $178 
million in land and other costs.  In addition, the Nisga'a 
government will receive $32.1 million annually in perpetuity 
under the deal. These are federal figures but, as we have seen 
time and time again in the House, the real figures are generally 
much higher.  Many experts estimate that the cost will be much 
higher and possibly well over $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have several more points to make but I will have other 
opportunities in other groupings of amendments and I will 
continue my comments at that point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to comment pretty well exclusively on what other people have said 
about the Nisga'a treaty.  Some people have said “The only 
people who are opposed to this treaty are people in the Reform 
Party”.  I want to make it abundantly clear that that is not so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to two major documents.  The first one has to do 
with the transcript of the record of the presentations that were 
made to the committee in Vancouver last Friday.  I also want to 
refer to one of the senior columnists with the <I>National 
Post</I> and then refer further again to one of the transcripts 
from the committee in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by referring to the comments that were made by Mr. 
Plant who accompanied Mr. deJong, the MLA from the British 
Columbia legislature.  He reviewed very briefly the three 
arguments that were presented in the court case that the 
opposition in British Columbia has given to the courts. 
Here are the three arguments to why the Nisga'a final agreement 
is unconstitutional.  First, that it is not open to the federal 
and provincial governments within the existing constitution of 
Canada to create a new freestanding third order of government. 
The question is:  Does the government even have the authority to 
do that? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1355"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT46"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT46"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1355

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, that it is not open to the federal and provincial 
governments by negotiation with the Nisga'a or in any other way 
short of a constitutional amendment to confer upon a new order of 
government paramount legislative power.  This is what the Nisga'a 
treaty does in at least 14 areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, that the Nisga'a final agreement violates the charter 
because it denies non-Nisga'a the right to vote for a government 
which will have the power to make decisions that affect their 
lives.  As the House knows, the charter guarantees every citizen 
of Canada the right to vote.  That is being denied to the people 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the three arguments that have been presented to the 
court that is currently examining this particular treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to an article in <I>The National Post</I> dated 
November 20.  It was written by Diane Francis.  The headline 
reads “Land claims will be the next big crisis: Political 
correctness is costing Canadians a bundle.” The article 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country's next crisis will be about aboriginal claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already, aboriginals have taken the law into their hands and 
seized private property belonging to others involved in the 
fishing and forestry sectors. These actions should be met with 
the full force of the law, in my opinion, and have nothing to do 
with promises by the British Crown decades ago that aboriginals 
could fish the waters and hunt in the forests they traditionally 
used only for their own consumption.  Anything more than 
subsistence rights may be upheld by some courts but these 
decisions should be immediately struck down with new legislation 
limiting aboriginal claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we ain't seen nothin' yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A precedent-setting treaty in British Columbia negotiated by the 
feds and province behind closed doors is about to become law. The 
NDP in B.C. has approved it already and the Liberals want to ram 
it through by Christmas. The treaty gives the Nisga'a band some 
2,000 square kilometres of land, $253 million in cash and 
self-government powers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And that is just the beginning. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a handout of $101,200 in tax dollars to every one of the 
2,500 members of the band and title to a land mass just slightly 
smaller than the country of Luxembourg.

there is a big difference between the constitution of a

what influences contribute to the formation of our identity as 
individuals and as Canadians.

all the provinces have raised college and university tuition fees 
in recent years.  Some provinces have greatly increased those

have now become so high that they are a serious barrier to

alleviate this, for example, the millennium scholarships and 
improvements to the Canada student loans program.  But I believe 
that much more must be done.  We cannot stand by while provinces

good education.  We need to harness every ounce of talent in 
Canada and our children deserve every opportunity.

disabilities must rank very high on everybody's priority list. 
However, he sets policy on the disability tax credit, which is 
so narrowly defined that persons with schizophrenia do not 
qualify, even though 1 in 100 Canadian families have a member 
with schizophrenia.

desperately need financial support to deal with the crushing 
costs which stem from their disabilities find it easier to get 
through the eye of a needle than to get help from the government. 
If the minister is truly committed to assisting disabled people 
to become fully functional citizens, he must broaden his rules 
around the disability tax credits and the medical and the infirm 
dependent tax credits so that they will provide real refundable 
benefits for all disabled Canadians.

according to Mary in Halifax the government is forcing her small

she has not been paid for yet.  Who is the creditor?  None other 
than the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is standard Revenue Canada policy set by the finance

taxes on income she has not yet received? 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, under most income tax regimes one pays tax on an 
instalment basis which anticipates income that comes in.  This is 
pretty standard practice in all tax jurisdictions in the country 
and throughout most of the western world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister completely misunderstands so I will say it again.  This 
is money that Mary has not yet received.  They are receivables. 
Very interestingly a lot of the money that she is owed is owed by 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is again for the minister.  The situation is that 
Mary has a small business and is being forced to pay GST on 
income she has not yet received.  This is standard practice by 
the federal government.  Mary is in a tax crunch right now.  Will 
the minister quit this unfair practice of taxing Canadians for 
income they have not yet received? 
<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, quite obviously I do not have the details of this case. 
As I have explained to the hon. member, the fact is that 
businesses pay tax on the instalment basis.  I am very interested 
in Mary's case and would be delighted to look into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also interested in Doreen and all the other people whom the 
hon. member raised last week.  The real issue they would like to 
know is why Reform members are standing in the House and talking 
about cutting taxes when their own party program said they would 
not have cut taxes until January of next year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wish the minister would get control of himself and take the issue 
seriously.  It is a serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one business in hundreds of thousands.  It is not just 
an isolated case.  All businesses in Canada are in the same boat. 
They are forced to pay taxes on income they have not yet 
received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister does not have to wait for a letter from me.  He 
simply has to consult with his own officials.  He knows very well 
this is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is straightforward.  Does the minister think it is 
fair that Canadians should have to pay taxes on income they have 
not yet received? 
<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

instalment basis, but I would be delighted to look into that 
issue along with the Minister of National Revenue.

them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is sitting next to the biggest industrial country in the

at what our policies have done since we have taken office, there 
have been 1.7 million new jobs created in the country, 700,000

high on our list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has certainly done that.  It has

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FOOD INSPECTION AGENCY

<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
dairy manufacturer, Parmalat, was to be inspected by Canada's 
food safety watchdog after 800 children got sick with salmonella 
poisoning last year.  But the watchdog was told to sit on it 
after Parmalat complained to its local MP.  Guess who?  The 
agriculture minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ian Ferguson, president of Parmalat, also wrote to the health 
minister over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Canadian Food Inspection Agency subject to political 
interference by the agriculture minister? 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Rural 
Development)(Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern 
Ontario), Lib.):</B>  Quite the contrary, Mr. Speaker.  The food 
inspection agency is not being influenced by the minister.  It 
carried out its inspection in the way that it should and the case 
was handled appropriately. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
believe the hon. member should consult the auditor general on 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not good enough to tell Canadians “Your food is safe as 
long as it wasn't produced in the agriculture minister's 
riding”.  Canadians should have complete confidence in the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency's ability to test the food 
supply.  They cannot when ministers are able to block 
inspections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why were 800 sick children not enough to convince this 
agriculture minister to let the inspectors do their job? 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Rural 
Development)(Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern 
Ontario), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the reality is that the 
inspections were carried out and the process did take place.  If 
the member would read the full auditor general's report, the 
auditor general said clearly that the food inspection agency had 
a very different recollection of the events that occurred, and 
the auditor general put that right in the report.

is for the Minister of Finance, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The six big Canadian banks have now announced profits of some $9 
billion for the last year, up 30% over last year, an all time 
record.  At the same time, they are now planning to eliminate 
some 20,000 jobs and close hundreds of branches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Finance screw up his courage and use the 
authority that he has to protect these jobs and empower 
communities to block the closure of branches in their own areas? 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is exactly 
what we have proposed and the legislation will be coming forth 
very soon.  We have proposed, as the member very well knows, that 
for any closure of a branch it will require four months notice. 
Where that branch is the only one left in a community, it will 
require six months notice. This is so the community can have time 
to react and alternative banking relationships can be 
established. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Notice is 
not exactly power, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These same CEOs, who are eliminating some 20,000, are boosting 
their own incomes through exorbitant stock options.  In fact, the 
top 24 CEOs, because of these options, will be making in excess 
of $250 million next year, in excess of the income of 12,000 bank 
tellers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister look at the effect of these obscene stock 
options on the ability CEOs to balance their own personal 
interest with the interest of the community from which they have 
drawn an income in the first place? 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the 
minister's response to the task force on the future of Canada's 
financial services sector, there is a provision that banks will 
have to account on an annual basis for the services that they 
provide and the relations that they have had with their various 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also opened up, in a very big way, the financial 
services sector to new entrants.  We have decreased the amount of 
money that has to be paid for a bank to set up in Canada.  We 
have allowed the foreign banks to come into Canada through 
branches to create greater competition.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is inflexibility in the act that does not take into

less women qualify for EI.  This has had an negative impact on 
their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister initiate a full scale review of this

Act and a related act; the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act; the 
Budget Implementation Act, 1997; the Budget Implementation Act, 
1998; the Budget Implementation Act, 1999; the Canada Pension

the progressive, forward looking approach of Canada's beloved 
finance department.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NISGA'A FINAL AGREEMENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK272">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-9, an act to give 
effect to the Nisga'a Final Agreement, as reported (without 
amendment) from the committee; and of Motions Nos. 1 to 30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  When I interrupted the hon. member for 
Kelowna just before Statements by Members, he had six minutes 
left.  The hon. member for Kelowna now has the floor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
continue with my presentation, in particular with the reference 
to the Diane Francis column of November 20 in the <I>National 
Post</I> on the Nisga'a treaty: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does this constitute a hideous giveaway based on 
unproven claims that their ancestors roamed around the area, but 
there are overlapping claims by neighbouring bands that also 
claim their ancestors roamed around there too.  Some are 
threatening violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Counter-claims are hardly surprising given the flimsy 
“evidence” behind the exercise... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My ancestors roamed around the United States for a couple of 
centuries and Europe for millennia but that doesn't give me any 
claim to a piece of Dublin or Chicago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have now is a questionable collective memory of 
entitlement, and governments that fail to meet their 
responsibilities to the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, the Nisga'a treaty is the beginning of turning much 
of Canada into a series of “balkan” principalities often run by 
feudal chieftains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, the Nisga'a claim is one of 30 being cobbled together 
in British Columbia— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other authorities would say more like 50: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—even though treaties were never signed between the British and 
locals as in other parts of Canada.  Many other land claims are 
justifiable because deals were inked with the Crown. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this type of ad hoc treatism is dangerous because it also 
abrogates the basic values of this society.  Its only result will 
be to create privileged franchises for self-defined ethnic groups 
with questionable provenance, who already get excessive and 
unjustifiable special entitlements out of the public purse such 
as tax-free status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a ignores the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a ignores democratic rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a disdains transparency of process. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is speaking of the treaty: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, political correctness has set in on this one. The 
Canadian establishment has ganged up against the public just as 
it did behind the attempt by Ottawa to railroad Canadians into 
voting for the Meech and Charlottetown accords.  The only ally 
the public has federally is the Reform party, which is clearly 
aligned with the public interest on this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike those sweeping accords, Canadians will not get a chance to 
vote on the matter in a referendum, nor will British Columbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is because the rest of the federal parties—Liberals, 
Tories, NDP and Bloc Quebecois—are in favour of the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most worrisome is the support for this treaty by the Bloc 
Quebecois.  It means the Liberal government is being led into an 
ambush by Quebec secessionists who support passage of the Nisga'a 
deal because it circumvents the Constitution and gives an ethnic 
group self-government and vast lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ram through the Nisga'a treaty in Parliament may be to unravel 
the Supreme Court of Canada initiative undertaken by the federal 
government in the case of Quebec secession. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a serious allegation that Ms. Francis states here.  She 
goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court ruled that any referendum on self-government by 
Quebecers would have to be passed by a clear majority responding 
to a clear question and involving all parties pertinent to the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a is not being offered up to the public for its approval 
and therefore all parties pertinent to the issue are not being 
involved, except indirectly through the Liberals in Ottawa and 
the NDP in Victoria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Plenty of constitutional experts maintain, as does the Reform 
Party and the B.C. Liberal Party, that the people of British 
Columbia have a right to vote on this matter in a referendum. 
Some 78% of the people of British Columbia oppose Nisga'a. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a doubt, most Canadians oppose any special deals for 
anyone.  Privileges already exist and should be dispensed 
universally on the basis of need, and not on race—

</I></B></P><P align=left>That almost brings to a conclusion her statement except that she 
ends with this sentence: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, we have the Liberals and NDP heaping more unnecessary 
burdens on to taxpayers in order to unfairly reward a few vocal, 
politically correct and taxpayer supported ethnic organizations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much for what Ms. Francis had to say about the Nisga'a 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue to reference Squamish women and their concern 
about the provisions of the Nisga'a treaty.  I have the verbatim 
report of what was heard by the committee on Friday of last week. 
A Ms. Baker said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am Maisie Baker from the Squamish Nation, and I'm one that 
don't just sit back and let everybody else do the work for me, I 
got to get up and do my own fighting.  I fight my chief and 
council every day, and when they see me coming, they say, oh, no, 
is that Maisie coming after who, and I said well, if you're on my 
way, look out.  But I'd like to say that the Squamish nation is 
so corrupt, it's unbelievable.  The money that comes from the 
government gets stuck in our band office and it stays there.  We 
never see it, and I am very angry at my Squamish Nation's 
so-called chiefs and councillors for putting me into this Bill 
C-49.  Not only our chiefs and council, but I'm angry at the 
government for putting me in this position, because it doesn't 
give us any rights at all.  We can't fight them, we have no 
money, we have nothing but I'm really angry at government for not 
listening to the grassroots, when we are the most important 
people. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise again 
today on one of those occasions when I wish I could say I am 
pleased to rise in this debate.  However I have to be blushingly 
cautious in that statement because I am not really very happy to 
be standing here under these circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have observed over the years how different people fall out of 
sorts with each other.  We call them human relationships.  I have 
noticed people fall apart even in their marriages.  A couple of 
things lead up to that, according to the reading I have done, but 
one of them is that there is an indifference to the other 
partner.  The partner starts thinking “I just don't matter.  I 
just don't care”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada these days we are once again consumed with the 
question of national unity.  I would simply put forward the 
notion that national unity, the unity of our citizens, is not 
being served by Bill C-9 at all.  That is because of the 
indifference the government is showing toward people who are so 
greatly affected by the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but observe that even right now not a single 
member of the government is paying attention to what I am saying. 
Not one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  I am. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Oh, there is one back there.  He happens to 
be reading his book but he says he is listening to me.  There is 
another one back there who is actually listening.  I cannot 
mention his name.  That is great.  There are two of them.  That 
is wonderful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of 301 members of parliament, the Reform Party is trying to 
put forward some debate.  We are trying to persuade some empty 
seats to come to a different point of view.  What a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say a bit about the process that is involved.  We have a 
very strange anomaly with respect to the democratic process. It 
is a matter of record that the majority of seats in western 
Canada, the majority of seats in British Columbia, are held by 
Reform Party members. 
We in the Reform Party have undertaken a very creative initiative 
in politics in Canada by representing in the House of Commons the 
wishes of the people who elected us.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A majority of members of parliament from British Columbia are 
Reformers who are listening not just to the chiefs but to the 
grassroots people.  They are getting the message both from 
grassroots natives and from grassroots non-natives that there are 
serious flaws in this process and in what is being jammed down 
their throats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The democratic system is failing because of the way democracy 
does not work in Canada.  Most Liberals on the other side of the 
House, most of whom are represented by green foreheads again 
today, do not live in British Columbia.  They will rise on 
command and vote the way they are told to jam the legislation 
through even though they do not represent, by any stretch of the 
imagination, the people who are most vitally affected by it.  I 
am speaking of the people of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also hasten to add that inasmuch as every deal like 
this one creates a precedence and a pattern for future 
agreements, it affects every Canadian.  However the Liberals are 
not listening to that.  They say they do not need to listen to 
that. They have a majority and can do whatever they want.  They 
just thumb their noses at us and do whatever they wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the New Democratic Party government in British 
Columbia held a majority of seats in that house, it obtained a 
lesser percentage of the votes in British Columbia than did the 
Liberal Party.  It is intriguing the Liberal Party of British 
Columbia, a party with the same name as the governing party here, 
came to the conclusion after studying the bill and consulting 
with the people involved that it was not a very good bill and 
should be amended, changed, fixed or defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Admittedly the New Democratic Party government gave it a lot 
more debate time in its house than we are getting here.  I guess 
we can give the NDP a back-handed compliment for at least 
permitting that.  However just permitting debate is meaningless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my party is saying that we ought to be able to debate 
this bill.  I am not content with that.  I am not content with 
just standing here and talking.  I would like to change the minds 
of the people on the other side.  What can I do to force them to 
actually listen to me?  I do not know what I can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we should change the rules of the House.  Maybe our 
salaries should be contingent on us actually physically being 
present in the House when debates are being held.  Maybe that 
should happen.  Maybe we should do something that forces members 
to participate in a debate like this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many speeches have we had from the disinterested green 
foreheads over there today?  I believe we had one or two.  I was 
at finance committee for a while so I may have missed one of 
those important speeches, but there is mostly indifference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember reading a long time ago that the opposite of love was 
not hate, that the opposite of love was indifference.  Members 
opposite are totally indifferent.  They do not care.  They do not 
raise their heads to speak.  They do not talk to the people in 
any meaningful way.  When the time comes for voting they will 
indifferently rise on command, collect their salaries and go 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not in a position to prognosticate and predict what will 
happen, but I would be very surprised if the number of Liberal 
members from B.C. in the next election was not cut by one-half, 
one-third or one-fourth.  I do not think that they will carry the 
support of the people because it is evident that they are not 
being represented here by those Liberal members.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have evidence that between 60% and 90% of people in different 
ridings are opposed to the agreement.  I will ask a simple, 
reasonable question.  If there is such opposition to it, why can 
government members not exercise a shade of humility and say that 
perhaps they are not perfect?  Just imagine if they would confess 
that and admit that perhaps they are not 100% perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with Bill C-9.  I know I cannot use props, but I 
was trying to guess how thick the books were. I just felt them 
and they are thick, the two books we are talking about today. 
Surely in there somewhere we could have made a few little 
amendments to satisfy the deeply held concerns of British 
Columbians and other Canadians in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is a government that says it is 100% right and 
there is no room for change.  It feels that it does not need to 
consider any amendments.  In fact the bill has come to the House 
without the possibility of amendment.  We are not doing our jobs 
as parliamentarians if we just simply rubber stamp a flawed 
document.  Also, the ramifications of this decision will be with 
us, our children and our children's children for generations. 
Therefore it is important that it is done correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember one of my bosses at the Northern Alberta Institute of 
Technology who had a parchment in his office. Every time I went 
to see him I would see that parchment which contained a very 
fitting statement:  “If you don't have time to do it right, when 
will you find time to do it again?”  That is a very good 
principle for how we do things.  We need to do it right.  In this 
instance it is doubly and triply important because the ability to 
change the agreement once it has been enacted is not very hopeful 
at all.  It will be virtually impossible to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are rushing into it.  We are not doing it well enough as 
parliamentarians.  I should be explicit.  The Liberals and other 
opposition parties that are standing with them in jamming the 
bill through are failing the Canadian people.  They are failing 
the people of British Columbia.  They are failing the natives, 
because even they are telling us that they have serious concerns 
about the legislation.  They are not well served.  They are not 
at all happy with what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I urge members opposite to use their own brains 
and their own conscience and do what is right and what is 
necessary in terms of the bill.  For once they should use the 
clout available to them.  They are so close to being able to put 
the government in a position of having to deal with it, why do 
they not do it?  Let them show some integrity and do it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as the member for Vancouver Kingsway, B.C., I am pleased to join 
in the debate.  The Nisga'a treaty offers the opportunity to 
begin the process of reinvigorating economic growth in the 
province of B.C. through an agreement that will provide certainty 
for the benefit of British Columbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to Bill C-9 proposed by members of the Reform 
Party are puzzling because they would defeat the certainty we 
worked so hard to achieve.  Those amendments would lead to 
uncertainty because they would make Bill C-9 inconsistent with 
the Nisga'a treaty. 
The amendments will lead to further uncertainty by making Bill 
C-9 inconsistent with key aspects of the provincial legislation 
which gives effect to the Nisga'a treaty.  The amendment proposed 
by the Reform Party would eliminate or impair the ability of 
third parties to benefit from terms of the Nisga'a treaty which 
were carefully negotiated for their benefit.  The Reform Party 
has called for consultation but does not seem to realize that its 
amendment would defeat the result of consultations held with 
third parties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party will have to explain why they are 
choosing to ignore the views of British Columbians who were 
consulted during the treaty negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty contains key certainty provisions which 
provide for the modification of Nisga'a aboriginal rights and 
title.  Reform Party suggestions that those provisions be deleted 
or changed would defeat those certainty provisions.  The members 
opposite must not realize or care about the impact of those 
proposed amendments which would leave the Nisga'a with the same 
aboriginal rights and title they may currently have under 
Canadian law.  Members of the Reform Party must not realize that 
the certainty approach was developed with extensive consultation 
in British Columbia and modifies Nisga'a rights.  This is the key 
part of the certainty approach.  The amendments proposed by the 
Reform Party would make the certainty provisions inconsistent 
with the treaty and with the language that third parties expect 
based on our consultations in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party have proposed amendments which could 
defeat the transfer of lands and lead to uncertainty of title. 
Members of the Reform Party do not seem to realize that third 
parties have made it clear many times that a key goal of treaty 
negotiations is to create certainty as to ownership of lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, members of the Reform Party have proposed amendments 
which are directly contrary to the advice our negotiators 
received during consultations.  We value the advice and 
assistance we received from knowledgeable third parties during 
negotiation of the Nisga'a treaty obviously much more than the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind members of the Reform Party how Bill C-9 and the 
Nisga'a treaty provide certainty.  Let us talk about full 
settlement.  The Nisga'a treaty is a full and final settlement of 
Nisga'a claims to aboriginal rights and title and through this 
agreement those rights will be known with certainty.  In future 
we will all be able to use the treaty for a precise description 
of Nisga'a rights.  All of us will be able to use the treaty 
because the treaty says that it can be relied on not just by 
government and the Nisga'a, but by other persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about future development.  The Nisga'a will be able 
to develop Nisga'a lands.  Businesses that are interested in 
economic development opportunities on Nisga'a lands will know 
from the treaty that the Nisga'a own those lands.  Outside 
Nisga'a lands, the province of B.C. will be able to develop lands 
and know precisely the scope of Nisga'a rights and the procedures 
to follow to develop lands.  Businesses that are interested in 
development opportunities outside Nisga'a lands will similarly 
benefit from knowing the province's authority to develop those 
lands.

this opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in other areas of B.C., without the Nisga'a treaty there 
would be considerable uncertainty in the Nass Valley as to the 
scope and location of aboriginal rights and title.  Section 35 of 
the Constitution Act, 1982 says “the existing aboriginal and 
treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby 
recognized and affirmed”.  Section 35 does not define the scope, 
content or location of any existing aboriginal rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of many first nations in B.C. like the Nisga'a, 
there is uncertainty as to where aboriginal title applies.  Apart 
from the uncertainty as to aboriginal title, there is also 
uncertainty as to where aboriginal rights to harvest resources 
such as fish and wildlife apply.  There is also uncertainty as to 
where an aboriginal right of self-government might apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from all of this uncertainty as to the location of 
aboriginal rights and title, there is uncertainty as to the scope 
of aboriginal rights for any particular group like the Nisga'a. 
In a particular location a first nation might claim aboriginal 
rights, such as the right to harvest wildlife, to gather 
medicinal plants, to carry out traditional religious practices or 
to carry out a variety of other activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of negotiation and litigation, it would be costly and 
time consuming to use the courts to examine each claim of an 
aboriginal right for each location in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Delgamuukw case the Supreme Court of Canada commented on 
the disadvantages of litigation and encouraged negotiation as the 
best way to resolve these issues.  Some members might remember 
that the Delgamuukw case took more than 10 years to go through 
the courts and in the end the supreme court ordered a new trial. 
There is still uncertainty as to the aboriginal rights of the 
Gitksan and the Wet'suwet'en who were involved in that case.  The 
Nisga'a treaty shows the advantages of negotiating those issues 
instead of going to court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty negotiations were not an attempt to define 
Nisga'a aboriginal rights, but instead to address uncertainty by 
exhaustively setting out and defining, with as much clarity and 
precision as possible, all the section 35 rights which the 
Nisga'a can exercise after the Nisga'a treaty is concluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past Canada has achieved certainty through an exchange of 
undefined aboriginal rights for defined treaty rights, using the 
language of cede, release and surrender.  Objections by first 
nations to this surrender technique have been a fundamental 
obstacle to completing modern treaties.  The Nisga'a treaty 
provides for a modified rights approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using the modified aboriginal rights approach, Nisga'a 
aboriginal rights, including title, continue to exist, although 
only as modified to have the attributes and geographic extent set 
out in the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach to certainty is primarily set out in the general 
provisions chapter, which contains its basic elements.  However, 
certainty is also achieved by the precise description of rights 
throughout the text of the Nisga'a treaty.

<P><A NAME="LINK276"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
do not know what the member thinks consultation means, but 
consultation does not mean taking the industrial parties which 
were involved in chasing the treaty negotiators out of the 
picture in the last two weeks of the negotiations so that the 
treaty could be completed without their input.  That is the kind 
of consultation Liberals believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other part of consultation they do not believe in is the 
committee process of the House.  We ended up last week, a week 
ago tomorrow, having to go to Vancouver to permit people who have 
qualified opinions on this topic to put their thoughts on the 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the government chose to exclude some very important 
people in British Columbia who had valid opinions from the 
committee process, I will put on the record some of the comments 
these people made at the hearing which we conducted last week.  I 
will be quoting two people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first person is Mr. deJong.  Mr. deJong is the aboriginal 
affairs critic for the Liberal Party in the province of British 
Columbia.  The second person whom I will be quoting is Mr. Geoff 
Plant, who is the attorney general critic for the Liberals in 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unusual that persons belonging to the party of that name 
in this place have so little in common with the Liberals of 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. deJong said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the first thing that needs to be said is it is 
unfortunate in my view that this hearing was necessary.  But it 
is, because of what has transpired, not just over the past couple 
of weeks, but what has transpired over the past couple of months, 
a process that has been designed from the outset, Mr. Chairman, 
to cut people off from these negotiations.  And you didn't need 
to look much further than the hearings that several of you were 
involved with, just last week, the federal standing committee 
that travelled to this province, largely because I think of the 
efforts of several of your caucus members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when you are a 
British Columbian and hear the kind of comments that we heard 
from certain members of that committee, representing the federal 
government, it was difficult not to get angry.  When members of 
the federal government are quoted as saying that this is a dog 
and pony show that will have no impact and is a waste of time and 
money, you really begin to wonder about whether or not people in 
Ottawa care about the views of British Columbians about a topic 
that is going to profoundly impact the way we live and are 
governed in this province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a process that, beginning 
back in the 1980s, has been designed to cut people off, to 
restrict their access, to restrict their input.  Previous 
governments, and I think you heard from a former premier earlier 
today, set in motion a process, a closed process.  That was 
designed, I think, from the outset to guarantee failure, and it 
has. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that this is the Liberal aboriginal affairs 
critic of the province of British Columbia speaking: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So here's what we would like to do today, Mr. Chairman.  We would 
like to comment on that process.  We would like to outline for 
you quickly what our main concerns with this document, this 
Nisga'a treaty is, and Mr. Plant will provide you with a brief 
summary of the court case that has been commenced by Gordon 
Campbell, Geoff Plant and myself in the Supreme Court of British 
Columbia questioning the constitutionality of the deal, and then 
we have some thoughts about how this process can be made better 
because, make no mistake about it, we do have to settle this 
issue.  We do have to settle these negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But you don't do 
it by employing the kinds of tactics that we have seen by the 
government of British Columbia and the government of Canada.  The 
invoking of closure, time allocation by both governments cutting 
off the ability of elected representatives, Mr. Chair, to 
scrutinize this all-important document, is the single most 
pathetic excuse for the democratic process I have seen in the 
time that I have been involved in elected life.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told, all of us as British Columbians, that we would have 
an opportunity to question, critique, profess support or 
non-support for each and every clause of this agreement.  The 
government of British Columbia, the NDP government, broke that 
promise. Mr. Chair, I was in Ottawa when the federal government 
prevented more than half of the members of parliament from this 
province from even speaking to this document, from even 
indicating what areas, what clauses, what principles, they 
believed this treaty should reflect and doesn't reflect. How can 
British Columbians have any confidence in any exercise that 
muzzles their elected officials, and it did just that, Mr. Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So when we get to discuss the substantive provisions of this 
agreement and we are met by a wall of silence from the two levels 
of government, you are compelled to ask yourselves this question, 
Mr. Chairman, what is it that the federal and provincial 
government is afraid of in allowing this debate to go forward? 
They either don't have the answers to the fundamental questions 
that people are asking, or they do and they don't want people to 
know what those answers are.  In either case, it is in my view a 
recipe for disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have commenced a court action.  We have concerns about what 
is in this treaty, we have concerns about the self-government 
provisions, we have concerns about a treaty that would purport to 
limit your ability to vote for a government that has a 
responsibility over you and limit that right to vote on the basis 
of your ethnicity.  We think that's wrong.  We think a fishery, a 
commercial fishery, based on an allocation that is tied to 
ethnicity is wrong, and we think there are alternatives. And we 
have, as you know, Mr. Chair, members of your panel, taken the 
matter to the Supreme Court, so if I can defer to my colleague, 
Mr. Plant, he will provide you with a summary of the basis for 
those submissions and that argument to the court. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then hear from Mr. Plant who is the Liberal attorney general 
critic in the province of British Columbia. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you very much, and thank you for the opportunity, Mr. 
Chairman, to speak to you and the other members this morning. The 
lawsuit is an action commenced in the Supreme Court of British 
Columbia.  It's commenced in the name of three members of the 
official opposition, who are Mr. Campbell, Mr. deJong and 
myself, as representatives of the official opposition.  The 
lawsuit is what lawyers will call a declaratory action.  We're 
asking the court to declare that the Nisga'a final agreement is 
unconstitutional.  There are three basic pillars of the argument. 
The first is an argument that is not open to the federal and 
provincial governments within the existing constitution of Canada 
to create a new freestanding third order of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 
second argument is that it is not open to the federal and 
provincial governments by negotiation with the Nisga'a or in any 
other way, short of constitutional amendment, to confer upon a 
new order of government paramount legislative power.  And as I'm 
sure you are aware, the Nisga'a final agreement does expressly 
purport to confer upon Nisga'a government legislative power in 14 
separate areas of lawmaking that is paramount to federal and 
provincial legislative power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third argument is that the Nisga'a final agreement violates 
the charter because it denies non-Nisga'a the right to vote for a 
government which will have the power to make decisions that 
affect their lives and as you know, the charter guarantees 
everyone, every citizen of Canada, the right to vote.  Those are 
the three arguments that are the basis of the lawsuit.  We are 
asking the court to rule, as I said, that the treaty, the Nisga'a 
final agreement, is unconstitutional on each of those grounds. So 
the question is what is the significance of that.  If we're right 
on any of those points, then what has happened is that the 
governments have tried to negotiate a document which is outside 
their constitutional authority to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect, they will 
have tried to amend the constitution of Canada by the back door, 
and in British Columbia, and I think it's important that people 
in other parts of Canada understand this:  we have in British 
Columbia a made in B.C. process for ensuring that if you want to 
amend the Constitution of Canada—

the surface, is bring to the table, to this debate, to

people in responsible positions, people who are the aboriginal 
affairs critic and people who are the critics for the attorney 
general of the province of B.C., the B.C. Liberal members who 
form the opposition in British Columbia.  They were excluded from 
representing themselves and getting their points of view on to

for this Liberal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
here we go again with such a far-reaching bill before the House. 
It is probably the most important bill perhaps in this century, 
certainly during my time here in the House of Commons, and there are 
hardly any members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I thought it was the custom of the House not to refer to the fact 
that members are or are not here.  It seems to me there is a 
comfortable quorum here.  Is the hon. member objecting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Whether or not the quorum is 
comfortable, there does seem to be a quorum.  I know that the 
hon. member would not want to go beyond that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your 
understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are again with the governing Liberals, the NDP, the Bloc 
and the fifth party all supporting the bill and the Reform Party 
standing alone in opposition to this bill.  It reminds me 
somewhat of the Charlottetown accord when Reform stood alone.  We 
were the only national party in the country that stood alone 
against the Charlottetown accord.  Yes, we were on the side of 
Canadians from coast to coast, including many natives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the rest of the parties extolling the Nisga'a treaty, 
which is a template for many settlements to follow.  It is a 
tragedy that the Nisga'a treaty is cast from the same mould as 
most other treaties that have formed the reservation system in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reserve system must be a shining light, just an extolling 
example of how well the system works.  Let us have a short look 
at one of the wealthiest reserves and bands in the country, which 
is in my home province of Alberta at Hobbema. It is one of the 
four bands in my riding.  It is the Samson Band.  It has lived 
under a treaty for over 100.  I believe it was Treaty No. 7 that 
that created this particular reserve system. 
We should look at this to understand a modern reserve to see 
whether a reserve system is a good example to follow, to 
perpetuate.  This should be a model reserve, a shining example.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a recent study of the Samson band which really 
shatters any notion that the reserve system is a shining light. 
We should examine whether the reserve system has worked in the 
past, whether it is currently working and whether it has the 
potential to work in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Samson band receives millions of taxpayers' dollars in 
addition to the millions from their oil and gas revenues. In 
1996, the Samson band had an income of about $100 million for 
just over 5,000 people.  However, most of the members live in 
wretched poverty in one of the wealthiest bands in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk a little about their leaders.  They jet off to 
Paris, London and Geneva.  They hold council meetings in Las 
Vegas with all expenses paid while 80% of the members of the band 
are on welfare and 85% are unemployed.  This was in 1996, just a 
few years ago.  The majority live in shacks, many without windows 
and many without any form of heat whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did it come about that we are perpetuating the reserve 
system in the Nisga'a treaty, because we are forming another 
reserve in British Columbia, or at least verifying the reserve 
system through a treaty?  I will comment on the framework of how 
this bill has come about and on how other legislation comes about 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the country's most alarming attributes is the expanding 
gulf between the views of the Ottawa establishment, the 
bureaucracy and some politicians, in other words the Ottawa court 
party, and the views of the average taxpaying Canadian who lives 
out there in the general populace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gulf is discernible in many areas of government, from the 
state of government wasteful spending to the state of the huge 
debt that Canadians are facing.  Nowhere is this huge expansive 
gulf more evident than on the whole issue of native affairs. 
Hence, we get Bill C-9, the provisions of which are entirely 
divergent, completely out of sync and out of step with the views 
of the average Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If average Canadians were familiar with the provisions in Bill 
C-9, they would think that these provisions came straight out of 
coo-coo land.  Let us look at some of the most basic provisions 
in Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty calls for a a big injection of cash of almost half a 
million dollars to be handed over directly to the Nisga'a in the 
Nass Valley.  It does not stop there.  There is an annual 
payment, which goes on for years and years, that could well bring 
the total cash injection by Canadian taxpayers to around $1 
billion.  That is a huge cash injection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is the land mass.  What about the land mass, the 
kind of reserve that is being set up?  It is approximately 2,000 
square kilometres.  To put that a little more in tune with the 
way people can understand it, that is almost a half a million 
acres. That is the size of the reserve.  In addition to that there are 
10,000 square kilometres that are given over for the Nisga'a to 
control:  the resources, forestry, timber, fisheries, whatever 
resources there are.  That is given to the Nisga'a to control.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those 10,000 square kilometres are two and a half million acres. 
Put it together it is three million acres, a big percentage of 
B.C.'s land mass that is turned over in just one settlement, one 
treaty.  There are between 50 or 60 more that are to be settled 
in the province of British Columbia alone. As is well known, the 
claims call for over 100% of the total land mass of British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read into the record comments of submissions made to 
our own Reform Party hearing in Vancouver last Friday.  This is 
from a former premier of British Columbia.  In his submission he 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That natives have been discriminated against is self-evident. 
Entrenchment of the reserves, which have kept natives apart from 
the rest of us has clearly been a disaster. The reason many have 
had to live in third world conditions in the midst of a land of 
prosperity is that they have been demoralized by a welfare state 
which has denied them the same opportunities as everyone else, 
and by essentially making many of them prisoners to remote, 
isolated reserves with little economic opportunity and even fewer 
business opportunities.  Native people have been forced to live 
in poverty, whether they want to or not.  The Nisga'a Treaty will 
entrench the situation even more deeply than it is now.  It will 
Balkanize our province into groups of people based on the colour 
of their skin. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my time is up, Mr. Speaker, but I want to ask one question 
of the government opposite.  If any member can show me one 
reserve in this country that has at least the average living 
conditions of a non-native community, I would like to see it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, many 
times have I walked arm in arm with my colleagues, even last 
night on some of the amendments to Bill C-2, the elections act, 
which I think is an onerous bill.  Many times have I warmed the 
cockles of my heart by their fire, but this is not one of those 
times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see by my watch and by the clock on the wall that it is time 
for a change and change we shall have.  I should go so far as to 
say I think we should damn this agreement.  More than that, I 
think we should damn those who do not damn this agreement.  More 
than that, I think we should damn those who do not sit up at 
night not damning those who do not damn this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had but one reason why Nisga'a was a failure that would be 
a mighty one indeed.  If I had two, then certainly people would 
say there was a case to be made.  If I had three, the government 
would seriously have to reconsider its intentions.  If I had 
four, the government members should put their tail in between 
their legs and run from this place with the agreement in their 
hands, never to bring it forward again.  But I have more than 
five.  I have far more than five reasons why Nisga'a is a 
failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One, Nisga'a does not recognize private property rights. The 
whole idea of wealth, of progress, of ownership is negated in the 
Nisga'a agreement. 
It does not recognize, it does not respect the idea of private 
property rights, something people have fought for over thousands 
of years, to maintain, to gain the idea of private property 
rights.  Nisga'a abrogates, undercuts and instead puts forward 
collective group rights, rather than the rights of individuals, 
rather than the rights of individuals to own property.  Shame. 
That is the first point.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Point two, the Nisga'a final agreement permanently entrenches 
the same essential elements as the reserve system of the modern 
day.  The reserve system of the current day has numerous 
problems.  Part of the problems that it has is that rather than 
trying to address the aspirations of individuals toward creating 
better lives for themselves and their families, instead it hives 
people together on reserves and gives them collective ownership 
of land, negates their ability to do something with it of their 
own creative abilities individually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, every time that the natives have come to the government 
asking for some sort of redress to these problems, instead the 
crown, the federal government, has doled out money instead, 
rather than solving the fundamental problems.  Every time there 
has been a knock on the door, the cash infusions have come out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of helping the situation, it has helped to undermine the 
sense of self-reliance that individuals within that community 
could develop. That is point number two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Point three is the idea of taxation without representation. 
Revolutions and civil wars have been fought over these very 
ideas.  Whether we go back to the idea of Magna Carta and King 
John, whether we go back to the idea of the American 
revolutionary war, the idea of taxation without representation is 
what representative democracy and indeed this very institution 
that we stand in today is about.  It is the cornerstone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent taxpayers.  I come here on their behalf to argue 
their concerns and to try to keep government within its rightful 
boundaries which, I would like to add, currently is not within 
those boundaries and has trampled upon the good intentions of the 
people who have helped to set it up and is taking far more out of 
their wallets and out of the blood and sweat and tears of their 
labour than it should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea that the Nisga'a agreement will not be a truly 
representative government but instead be taxation without 
representation is a shame.  I know that as people have fought 
over centuries and over a millennium to go ahead and achieve a 
form of taxation with representation, so indeed the seeds that 
Nisga'a sows are bad seeds.  The fruit that it will reap is that 
of despair.  It will eventually lead to natives themselves rising 
up in terms of these very issues.  That is the third reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth reason is that we already have too much government in 
the country.  We have two levels of government that are 
recognized in the British North America Act as of 1982 in the 
patriation.  Some may question how it was done.  Nonetheless 
there were two levels of government that were laid out in the 
constitution act.  The provinces created a third:  municipal 
government in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now the creation of what amounts to a third, if we look 
at the constitution act or if we look at the totality, a fourth, 
level of government in the country.  That in itself is a problem 
but it ties into another.  That was my fourth problem with 
Nisga'a. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fifth problem with Nisga'a is that this issue has been put to 
the people.  It was called Charlottetown and it failed.  At the 
time all the parties in this place got their ducks in a row and 
put Charlottetown to the people and said “It is good.  Vote for 
it”. 
They outspent their opposition 13 to 1 in order to propagandize 
their aims, but at the end of the day they were not victorious. 
They lost, and rightly so, because the constitution should and 
does belong to the people.  They rightfully said that they did 
not want to see these types of provisions in law and entrenched 
for time to come.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government done?  It has gone against the very 
explicitly expressed will of the people.  It has gone against 
what people across the country said they did not want to see 
constitutionalized and put into law.  The government is going 
ahead and doing it instead through a step by step piecemeal 
process through the back door.  That is what this is about, a 
government overriding the will of the people who have already 
expressed it on a constitutional referendum.  That is the fifth 
reason why I have problems with the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth reason why I have problems with the Nisga'a treaty is 
because it hinders future economic development.  It helps to 
deter and it hinders future economic development in British 
Columbia.  There are mining companies and forestry companies. 
Indeed, when we look around the House we see murals depicting 
miners and foresters in the committee rooms.  They are some of 
the foundations upon which the country was built, the main 
industries that helped give Canada its start.  Those very 
companies and industries are pulling up shop in the province of 
British Columbia because of the uncertainty over land claim 
agreements such as this.  Rather than go ahead and help to access 
the resources of the country and to help build it, they are 
taking their skill, equipment and ingenuity to other countries in 
South America and other places around the world.  I know some of 
these companies even in my own backyard that have reservations 
with regard to what is going on with these developing issues. 
They are leaving Canada, and so go the jobs. Shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Point number seven is that not only will it deter economic 
development but there are huge costs that are directly implicit 
with the agreement.  The massive payouts, millions of dollars 
just for this individual claim, never mind the hundreds of 
others, are simply unaffordable.  The Nisga'a treaty is an 
unaffordable and untenable situation.  If the government sets it 
up as a precedent for future land claims, woe the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Point number eight is that the Nisga'a treaty helps to build 
barriers.  I only have but a minute of time, yet there are so 
many problems with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Point number nine is that the government knows it is a flawed 
bill.  It would not, and will not, give consent to put this bill 
to the people of British Columbia because it knows it will fail. 
The government knows that as it put this question in 
Charlottetown and it failed, if it put this question in the 
province of British Columbia the people would once again turn it 
down.  Shame on the government when it knows that what it does is 
wrong, the people would not support it and it would not carry the 
will of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Point number ten is the idea of an inherent right to 
self-government.  I believe in self-determination, however, think 
not of a municipal level of government but instead something that 
would help to set up hundreds of separate nation states.  Lord 
Durham wrote of Canada that it was two nations warring within the 
bosom of a single state.  Imagine a country that was hundreds of 
nations warring within the bosom of a single state.  I put to the 
House that such a nation would have a very difficult time 
surviving indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are just ten reasons and I could go on, but I leave it at 
that.  I put to the government, if it knows the Nisga'a treaty 
will not pass the test of the people, and it knows it already 
failed the test of the people, leave it be and pull the bill from 
the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, essentially my remarks today will be on the fisheries 
component of the Nisga'a treaty.  Fisheries issues have been of 
some concern to Canadians from coast to coast in the last little 
while, and for good reason.  On the east coast with the Marshall 
decision the supreme court has acknowledged or put in place a 
process similar to what is government policy on the west coast 
with separate native commercial fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The substance of my address today will be to point out, by 
quoting from documents I received under access to information, 
that back in 1987 the Department of Fisheries and Oceans was 
arguing against the policy the government has put into place in 
the Nisga'a treaty with a separate native commercial fishery. The 
department was effectively arguing against the same policy the 
Supreme Court of Canada imposed on the east coast with the 
Marshall decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first document I would like to bring to the attention of the 
House is a March 6, 1987 letter sent by Mr. Laurie Gordon, who at 
the time was assistant district supervisor in district 8 in 
Prince Rupert, to Mr. Paul Sprout, who was assistant area manager 
in the north coast division of Canada's Pacific coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I refer to the letter, the point I must make is that back 
in the mid-eighties the treaty negotiators had proposed a 
fisheries component for the Nisga'a treaty that was under 
negotiation at that time.  It was similar to the treaty we ended 
up with just a couple of years ago.  It is the treaty we are 
arguing before the House.  This proposal was made by the treaty 
negotiators at that time and the department was effectively 
speaking out against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the reasons the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans was opposed to the Nisga'a treaty back in 1987.  It said 
that if it proceeded there would be no area 3 fishery for 
non-Nisga'a in poor areas and only moderate fisheries in good 
years.  The letter goes on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned that this will be an incentive to have fish 
caught in the Nisga'a fishery recorded as having been caught in 
the all citizen's fishery. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was concern about the transfer of fish from a separate 
native commercial fishery to the all-Canadian commercial fishery. 
In talking specifically about sockeye it stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some years of low returns there would be no all citizens 
fishery for sockeye...Depending on migration routes and timing we 
would therefore likely have to adjust our fisheries, particularly 
Area 4 and the outside of Area 3, to allow more sockeye into 3Z. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the zone the Nisga'a would be fishing in.  It continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In most years the first few weeks fishing, mid-June to mid-July, 
would have to be Nisga'a only.  There would thus likely mean no 
commercial net fisheries in the north coast prior to the second 
week of July. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the impact the treaty will have on the commercial 
fishery in the future if it is passed by the House.  That is what 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans was saying in 1987.  In 
all likelihood that is what the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans concluded in the secret report in which it talked about 
replicating the Nisga'a treaty coastwide.  With regard to pink 
salmon Mr. Gordon's letter continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no quantitative method of determining Nass pink strength 
in season and therefore it would be very difficult to accurately 
adjust the allocation in season.  The Nass run will be masked by 
large numbers of Alaskan and area 4 pinks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even post season we cannot estimate total Nass pink runs without 
making dubious assumptions about the portion of catch which was 
of LCA, land claim area, origin. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a huge problem making estimates or guestimates of the 
fish returning to the Nass River, even post season. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to coho it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very little about stock strength of Nass coho, and have 
absolutely no way of determining it in or post season. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coho are in serious decline and could probably be considered an 
endangered species in some areas of the north coast. It is 
interesting when Mr. Gordon talked about Chinook salmon. Let me 
read his letter and be very clear about it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All sport fishing for chinooks including catch and release would 
be stopped. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the view of Laurie Gordon back in 1987, that is if we 
went through with the treaty now before us.  If that is the case 
there will be many lodge owners on the north coast of British 
Columbia who will be very upset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other letter I want to quote from is from Pat Chamut, 
director general of the Pacific region back in 1987.  He is now 
an assistant deputy minister.  His letter was to A. 
Lefebvre-Anglin, assistant deputy minister, Pacific and 
freshwater fisheries.  The date of the letter is March 16, 1987. 
Essentially Mr. Chamut repeated the concerns expressed in the 
previous letter.  He wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The formulas to determine species mix are unmanageable...In order 
to ensure the sockeye fishery proposed, in most years the first 
few weeks of fishing, mid-June to mid-July, would have to be 
Nisga'a only. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to write: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would likely mean no commercial net fisheries in the north 
coast prior to the second week of July. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred to the difficulty with properly managing fish if we 
proceeded with the treaty.  It is horrendous that the man who is 
now assistant deputy minister of fisheries and promoting this 
treaty would have changed his tune since 1987.  As I said earlier 
we are talking about essentially the same agreement being in 
place as the one that was discussed in 1987.  Mr. Chamut's letter 
started off by stating: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following comments are in response to the Chief Federal 
Negotiator's letters of February 13 and March 5, which 
respectfully outline the Nisga'a proposal on species mix and the 
Chief Negotiator's intentions with regard to a new federal offer 
in this area. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It specifically concerns the treaty and bodes ill for the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next letter was from Marion Lefebvre, chief claims 
negotiator, native affairs division.  It was to Mr. Fred Walchli, 
chief interim negotiator, Nisga'a claim, comprehensive claims. In 
that letter she made the following case: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The formulas to determine species mix are unmanageable...In order 
to ensure the sockeye fishery proposed, in most years the first 
few weeks of fishing, mid-June to mid-July, would have to be 
Nisga'a only.  This would likely mean no commercial net fisheries 
in the north coast prior to the second week of July. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot emphasize that enough.  If the treaty goes through 
there will be no commercial net fisheries on the north coast 
prior to the second week of July.  That is the time of the most 
effective fishing on the north coast.  It is those first couple 
of weeks in July that make it all pay.  That is when the fish are 
caught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 25, 1987 a letter from Michelle James, acting chief, 
fisheries negotiator, was addressed to Mr. Fred Walchli.  Ms. 
James assured him that the department's advice on this matter was 
that he should not pursue the notion of using area 2Z catch as 
the basis for determining the Nisga'a fishery.  She wrote that 
this was most important and that it would be impossible to 
replicate the treaty coastwide.  That was the intention of the 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence is there in the access to information documents, 
that if the treaty goes ahead there will be no commercial fishing 
on the north coast prior to the middle of July, which will put 
serious restrictions, if not eliminate, the sport fishing for 
chinook on the north coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are facts that were stated by the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans back in 1987 when the proposal before the government 
was similar to the current fisheries component of the Nisga'a 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It was different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  It is not different.  That is a tragedy 
and it will have serious implications for a fishery that is 
already suffering from mismanagement by the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK280"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me pleasure today to speak to this very important issue.  I 
want to start by emphasizing one word in Group No. 1, as well as 
in the entire group of amendments that will be presented over the 
next few hours and day, that the government does not seem to 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Auditor general reports have constantly called for more 
accountability, particularly from the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development but especially accountability 
for the billions of dollars that are sent to the reserves to try 
to help these people.  Why does that word not exist in the 
government's vocabulary?  It does not exist in the vocabularies 
of most dictators who say “Do as I say and shut up”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the opposition parties is the NDP.  It does not know the 
meaning of the word accountability.  Its members simply insist 
that we throw more money at this problem, but we do not hear that 
word in their vocabularies.  It is the same with the Conservative 
Party, another opposition party that is supposed to help us in 
making sure good legislation goes out of this building.  Liberal, 
Tory, same old story.  There is nothing new there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc members have one thing on the agenda.  They want to leave 
the country so their importance involving this legislation is 
meaningless.  They only have one thing on their minds.  They want 
to form a country of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime my colleagues formed a committee and went to 
visit some people in the Vancouver area, including my colleague 
from Okanagan—Shuswap who was on the committee.  We listened to 
such things as what I will read right now.  An elderly lady 
appeared before the committee and said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my people struggling day to day, picking up bottles, lining 
up in cigarette line-ups to make $15 to feed their kids for the 
rest of the month and here our councillors are sitting pretty in 
a nice office.  They spend $28,000 on their coffee room and it is 
just for the chiefs and council while our kids go to school 
hungry.  I said they wonder why they are getting angry.  I said I 
can't take it any longer, I am so fed up with them.  We tried to 
do a non-confidence on them Sunday but we got overpowered with 
their people.  We have no accountability for what they do for the 
people and I said I hope somebody out there will help us to get 
where we need to get in order to have an audit done for our 
people and find out where is all the money going.  What is 
happening?  Why are we having in this country so many individuals 
crying out to this government for help and what they are crying 
for is not more money.  They are crying for accountability.  You 
are sending money to our chiefs and council and we are living in 
squalor. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a difference between members of my party and the 
Liberals.  I asked every reserve I visited if they had ever seen 
a member of parliament in their homes or on their reserves other 
than in the council chambers or the chief's home.  The answer was 
“You are the first, sir”.  My wife went with me on many of 
these ventures.  We were told we were the first political MP to 
ever visit their homes on reserves, which could be a broken down 
bus with no wheels, no windows, no heat and no water. 
We went to other homes where there was no furniture.  They sit on 
stumps.  They are very hospitable with what little they have. 
They are great people to get to know.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example of this story that my colleague heard is only one of 
thousands that are being expressed across this country to a group 
of people who finally came together and said they want to be a 
coalition.  They are asking the government for accountability and 
help.  What does the government say?  “Go to your chiefs and 
council”. The chiefs and council are the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They run to Indian affairs and are are told:  “Wait a minute, 
this is an internal problem.  You people go to your chiefs and 
council”.  But they are the problem.  Nobody is listening to the 
cry of the grassroots people on the reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had hopes that we would have people in this building who would 
have a little compassion for the way conditions are on the 
reserves so that we could come together and have two or three 
people from each party form a task force to go out and see these 
horrible conditions, come back here and collectively recommend 
some things we could do that would at least make these lives a 
little more compatible with some sort of a standard of living, 
instead of the third world conditions that the United Nations 
says exist in the land of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold, we are having Bill C-9.  These grassroots people 
from this coalition are calling me and expressing their concerns. 
The government in this treaty is going to give these people 
nearly $1 billion as part of the deal.  Where is this $1 billion 
going?  It is going into the hands of a very few.  Therefore, the 
very rich will continue to become very rich and the very poor 
will be no better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are being given power that they have never 
experienced before in their lives, more greedy power where they 
will be able to control things in their area beyond belief, 
beyond what they do now.  We have members sitting opposite who 
claim to be compassionate, caring about individuals who are 
living in these conditions.  However, they are doing absolutely 
nothing except making sure that it happens without building into 
any agreement that one word, accountability.  Where is it?  Why 
is it being allowed to happen?  Why is the government allowing 
that kind of thing to begin to happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Auditor general reports year after year say do something about 
the accountability factor, particularly on the reserves, 
particularly with the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development.  He is simply ignored.  I just looked at the most 
recent report which says the same thing, that there are still too 
many great difficulties in the lives of ordinary people on the 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We brought these grassroots people together in a place in the 
middle of Winnipeg in a place called Birds Hill.  These are 
grassroots people who cannot afford a big convention hall.  They 
could not go to a place where the Liberal Party would support a 
big convention of native leaders, where it would cost thousands 
of dollars to rent a hall with fine food and fair drink.  They 
were in Birds Hill trying to pitch tents, if they had one, 
finding a shrub bush, if they could find one.  They were lying 
all over the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was there for three days with them waiting for some of the 
invited Liberals who live very close to Birds Hill park to show 
up and show a little compassion to these people who were crying 
out for help.  Not one of them showed up and did not care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, boy, they are wonderful.  They are creating this marvellous 
deal in British Columbia without the consent of the people, 
without the care of the grassroots natives throughout British 
Columbia. 
Oh yes, they held a referendum in the Nisga'a area.  I believe it 
was somewhere around 65% to 35%.  It does not matter.  They 
ignored the call and the cry of the people who were against it 
because they wanted one thing to happen.  They liked the idea of 
moving in this direction.  They were thrilled about it.  They 
said to me, “Are you sure the billion dollars or whatever is 
paid in is going to be shared?  Am I going to be able to own 
property?  Is there any accountability?”  The answer is no 
because accountability does not come from dictators.  That is 
what this government is and it ought to hang its head in shame. 
One day it will answer for that.

imagine you and I are across a railway track with me on one side 
and you on the other side.  We know there is a train coming down 
the track and we know there is a bridge out ahead.  I think you 
and I would find a way to solve the problem to see if we could 
get the bridge fixed or the trestle back in place so that the 
train coming down the track would be able to continue on.  I do 
not think we would stop to argue, complain or even debate about 
who is on the train or how fast it is coming and those kind of 
things.  We would do our job and we would try to save the 
approaching train from being wrecked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of Indian affairs asked two questions earlier in 
this place.  He asked what the Reform Party would do about 
Nisga'a and what about the details within the treaty.  We have 
talked a lot about the details within the treaty and about the 
concerns we have with it.  The bigger principle involved is 
stepping back and taking a look at the principle in agreement and 
the problems with it.  Just as you and I would not argue about 
the individuals and the details about the train and we would try 
to fix the bridge, we would like to focus our attention on the 
bigger picture of what is wrong with this agreement.  I will 
answer the two questions put by the minister of Indian affairs in

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has demonstrated by its actions that it 
cares very little for the people of British Columbia.  The 
Liberals have demonstrated their lack of care in their approach 
to Bill C-9.  They limited debate to four and a half hours for 
members of the opposition at second reading.  They voted against 
giving all British Columbians the right to vote for or against 
this treaty by way of a referendum and they have given notice of 
closure once again on this bill.  Actions speak louder than words 
and the Liberal government has spoken loud and clear about how it 
views Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at our role as legislators.  It is our duty 
to scrutinize and examine legislation that will have a profound 
effect on people's lives.  That is our job.  That is the job of 
the government and that is the job of the opposition, to 
scrutinize legislation and make sure it meets the test not just 
for this time but for future days as well, and this bill falls 
short of that test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is more committed to getting speedy 
passage of this bill through the House than it is to actually 
doing its job of examining the fundamental principles of this 
bill and how it will affect British Columbians and Canadians in 
the future. Its actions demonstrate that it is more concerned 
about photo opportunities than it is about the hard work of 
objectively examining the legislation or about how this treaty 
will impact British Columbians and all Canadians.  It is a shame 
that seems to be what the actions of the government are 
indicating quite clearly to British Columbians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government truly cared about making sure this legislation 
was examined and scrutinized, it would dedicate the time to do 
so. It has not done that.  It has closed off debate at different 
stages.  It does not want a full airing and hearing of this 
treaty.  It has a huge effect on British Columbians and will for 
future generations.  That is why the members of the opposition 
are speaking loudly on this and trying to get the government to 
pay attention to it.  It is not simply another piece of 
legislation that we deal with in one afternoon in this place and 
treat it like many others that may come up.  It is not simply a 
piece of legislation that we can just look at and not pay 
attention to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have concerns that that is exactly what the government and 
members from other parties are doing.  They are sleeping at the 
wheel.  This is a piece of legislation that is going to have a 
profound impact in British Columbia and across the country for 
now and for future generations.  If we do not do due diligence in 
this place while we have the opportunity, the government will be 
recorded as the one that failed to do its job.  The members of 
the opposition will not include themselves in that category.  We 
will point out, piece by piece, our concerns with this 
legislation because it is flawed and needs to be dealt with more 
thoroughly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation fails to give British Columbians the right to 
vote through a referendum on the Nisga'a treaty.  That is 
something the Reform Party would do.  The Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development asked that question earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation does not include a constitutional exclusion of 
this treaty in the areas of self-government and fishing.  In 
other words, if this treaty is passed it will be protected by 
section 35 of the constitution.   Forever entrenching this treaty 
by protection of the constitution, it will not be able to be 
changed.  We have serious difficulties with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty and the government do not acknowledge the overlapping 
claim of these Nisga'a lands by other aboriginal groups such as 
the Gitksan and the Gitanyow.  Those are basic fundamental flaws 
with this piece of legislation that the government is continuing 
to ignore.  That is why we must urge the government to stop this 
approach of ramming this piece of legislation through so that it 
can have some kind of photo opportunity or be able to say that it 
was the group that brought this great legislation through.  For 
future generations, what the test of time will tell is that this 
is the group that did not do its job.  It is the group that 
failed when it had an opportunity to examine this legislation and 
put a good framework in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be other treaties coming.  If that group there is not 
committed to making the changes necessary, then this group will 
do everything within our power to form government, to go to that 
side, to put some common sense and balance back into this place 
and into legal processes in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see through its actions that the government does not seem 
concerned about this.  In fact, it is treating this as another 
piece of housekeeping legislation.  That is all I can say because 
of the actions that go along with the words it is attaching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have questions for the government.  I have questions as to 
where are the members from British Columbia on this issue?  What 
are they saying?  What do they think about this legislation?  Are 
they standing in support of it?  Are they going to stand in their 
places in the House and defend this agreement?  Are they going to 
ignore the will of British Columbians, the people who elected 
them?  There is silence from the Liberal members from British 
Columbia coming back from the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  The silent seven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  The silent seven as my colleague

</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition to this bill has been put forward by many different 
people.  I think the government would like to compartmentalize 
the opposition as being just the Reform Party so it can ignore 
us.  Well, it is not just the Reform Party that opposes this 
agreement. 
There are many different voices that oppose this agreement, 
including the Liberal Party of British Columbia.  The leader of 
the official opposition in British Columbia, the B.C. Liberal 
leader, opposes this treaty.  In fact, he said some things that 
are pretty harsh about the group over there.  He said “Nothing 
will do more to erode public trust and confidence in this most 
important endeavour than to sidestep and short-circuit public 
debate.  A government under my leadership will not accept this 
Nisga'a treaty as a template for future settlements”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
throughout the day we have quoted a number of people from British 
Columbia who appeared at the hearings last Friday.  They did not 
have the opportunity to appear before the standing committee 
because, as we are all aware, it was stacked unfavourably.  There 
was no neutrality.  The witnesses who wished to appear who were 
against the Nisga'a deal did not get much of a hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote Mr. Harry Bell-Irving, who is a director 
of the Citizen's Voice.  I have taken a few of his thoughts, 
because I do not have the time to go through them all, but there 
are some excellent points that I would like to put on the record. 
He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada was represented by the Department of 
Indian and Northern Affairs, which stood in a position of trust 
with respect to the Nisga'a, and accordingly, was in a position 
of conflict with respect to all other Canadians.  In support of 
this statement, it is interesting to note that the Canadians who 
take this position most strongly are aboriginal Canadians living 
in the Nisga'a area, who claim that significant rights belonging 
to them have been given to the Nisga'a and are protesting. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These aboriginal Canadians are not Nisga'a and they are having 
their lands taken away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bell-Irving continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These protesting aboriginals have already launched court 
proceedings to try and regain their rights.  I submit that the 
people of Canada have had no true representation at the federal 
level....With one important exception, mainly amendments 
introduced dealing with questions as to the certainty of future 
benefits, the final agreement passed in the British Columbia 
legislature contained no significant amendment to the agreement 
in principle tabled in 1996. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically it was the original document.  Does that sound 
familiar?  It is the same story. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP also resorted to a form of closure and rammed the bill 
through the legislature with great haste and in contempt of 
democratic process.  The NDP never consulted the people at large 
as to the parameters of the agreement, and have refused to let 
the people of British Columbia have the opportunity to vote on a 
referendum to approve or disapprove the agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals last week did exactly the same thing in the House. 
We put forward a motion that the Liberal federal government hold 
a referendum in British Columbia, and it refused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I contend that if it were in Ontario or Quebec it would have 
been an entirely different story.  The government simply does not 
care about the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bell-Irving continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you are to ask me what is wrong with the Nisga'a agreement, my 
answer, unfortunately, would be to say a very great deal. 
It is badly drawn and ambiguous in many places.  There are many 
sub-agreements yet to be finalized.  The Nisga'a agreement will 
create a right to fish based on race.  It grants the right to the 
Nisga'a to make laws which in certain circumstances will be 
superior to the laws of Canada and British Columbia. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT81"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT81"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1650
<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat that because it is important.  It grants the right 
to the Nisga'a to make laws which in certain circumstances will 
be superior to the laws of Canada and British Columbia.  Is that 
what Canadians want in a modern treaty? 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides for Nisga'a citizenship and that only Nisga'a 
citizens can vote for the Nisga'a government.  Think of it; a 
state within Canada with a separate citizenship in which Canadian 
citizens cannot vote.  Are there to be 60 or more such states 
within British Columbia?  What a disaster for British Columbia, 
what a disaster for Canada.  The federal and provincial 
governments have said many misleading things in support of the 
agreement.  One of them is that it will create certainty, 
implying that we should not nitpick about small details and get 
on with it.  I submit that the only certainty the Nisga'a 
agreement will create is that for years to come there will be 
uncertainty because various aspects of the agreement will be 
before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already a number of court actions have been 
commenced....The most serious flaw in the Nisga'a agreement is 
with respect to the self-government rights granted to the 
Nisga'a.  These rights have been deceitfully described by the 
federal and British Columbia governments as being similar to 
local or municipal rights.  Yet in 14 different instances, the 
self-government rights provide and I quote:  “In the event of an 
inconsistency or conflict between the Nisga'a law and a federal 
or provincial law, the Nisga'a law will prevail to the extent of 
the inconsistency or conflict”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, is this what we want?  I thought we were looking for one 
law and one country.  This adds another layer of government which 
in my mind and from what I am hearing from the people in my 
riding is not wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implications to me are very frightening....No business, 
profession or trade can carry on except under Nisga'a law.  As is 
the case in a number of places in the act, there is the pap that 
accreditation must be in accordance with the law of the rest of 
the country, or the law of British Columbia, but that really 
isn't of significance, (because) the self-government rights are 
contained in land claims treaty, they will be constitutionalized 
and can only be amended according to the constitutional process, 
and it is my understanding that they cannot be amended without 
the consent of the Nisga'a. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is a closed door.  Why would the government set 
these powers in constitutional concrete without first having a 
trial period to see if they are working out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been other treaties before the House.  For example, 
the Yukon treaty was before the House in the last parliament and 
it was not constitutionalized.  It was a separate bill.  I have 
to ask why the government is taking this route when the Yukon 
bill of a few years ago, which was a separate bill, was not 
constitutionalized.  Why would it constitutionalize rights in 
this treaty?  It makes me wonder.  I have to ask what is the 
agenda of the government.  Where is it going? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bell-Irving continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recommend that the Nisga'a agreement be amended so as to remove 
self-government rights from the agreement, placing them in a 
separate agreement, which may be amended from time to time— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is very sound advice.  We have done that before in 
the House.  I spent a year going through the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act.  The old bill stated that it would 
return to the House every five years.  What is wrong with that? 
That is good legislation.  Where is the government going? 
Exactly in the opposite direction.  It is constitutionalizing 
this.  It is closing the door.  It will be there forever.  We 
will not be able to amend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point of great concern are the resources, forestry and 
fisheries.  For example, it was stated by Skeena Cellulose Inc. 
in the Nisga'a area that should the treaty go forward Skeena 
Cellulose would sue for $75 million in lost timber resources. 
Guess what?  The province bought Skeena Cellulose.  That gets rid 
of that issue, I suppose, but I am not sure it was a wise use of 
tax dollars.  The fishery is of more concern because the fishery 
is tied to race.  Remember, this is the first of 60 such 
agreements. 
In my view, if we carry this forward to 60 agreements there will 
not be a commercial fishery in Canada.  There will not be any 
fish left to divide.  There will be a native commercial fishery, 
but what about the non-native commercial fishery?  We only have 
so much of the pie to cut up.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the Marshall decision which concerned the fishery on 
the east coast.  I am a member of the fisheries committee which 
was holding hearings last week on the east coast.  The Marshall 
decision, which was clarified by the supreme court, is finally 
getting through the fog and coming to the middle ground.  What is 
finally coming through with the number of cases that have been 
before the supreme court is that if we err too far on one side 
treaty rights will be violated.  However, if we err too far on 
the other side and affect the rights of the people already in the 
fishery, that will not work either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who are already in fisheries, forestry and other 
areas who are being pushed out because of these treaties will go 
to the supreme court, and so they should.  We will have years and 
years of litigation because of this treaty.  Again, why?  Why 
could we not start with an open process?  There was clearly no 
open process in British Columbia.  It was all closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have a process that all or most people agree with, 
have a referendum at the end of it, and then we would have what 
people want.  We are not going in that direction at all.  We are 
going in exactly the opposite direction, creating another layer 
of government that we do not need.  At the end of the day we want 
laws and rights that apply to each and every one of us, 
regardless of where we come from. 
<P><A NAME="LINK283"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
the member of parliament for Edmonton East I am pleased to 
participate in the debate at report stage of Bill C-9, an act to 
give effect to the Nisga'a final agreement.  My objective is to 
place on the permanent <I>Hansard</I> record my concern that the 
implementation of this agreement amounts to indirectly effecting 
a permanent constitutional amendment, and I believe that is 
wrong.  I also wish to use this opportunity to raise concerns 
about any course of action in the House that would bind future 
generations of legislators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since no decision or action in the House should ever be 
considered to be infallible and since our history has shown us 
time and again that courses of action must change as 
circumstances change, we should not set a template with the 
Nisga'a agreement that cannot later be reshaped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is generally accepted that the Nisga'a agreement may well 
serve as a model for future agreements with other aboriginal 
groups, particularly in British Columbia.  Should we as 
legislators not be concerned that the implementation of this 
agreement may enshrine in stone a model that would be better 
subject to later reconsideration and refinement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore believe that the bill under discussion should have 
the following qualification:  that this agreement is not intended 
to be and is not in fact, in substance or in form a 
constitutional amendment and that, accordingly, the agreement may 
be subject to later reconsideration, revision or amendment by 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the controversies and court clarifications surrounding the 
Marshall case, it becomes clear that even justices of the Supreme 
Court of Canada are fallible.  Governments and government 
policies are similarly fallible.  One of the important benefits 
of any democracy is that governments can be changed, which 
provides a check against errors being perpetrated.  A new 
government may assess the policies of its predecessor and declare 
them to be wrong, redundant or badly thought out.  The courage 
and self-confidence of a government in significantly altering or 
abandoning an entrenched course of action is very important to 
Canada's future welfare, in aboriginal matters or otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, no government should act in a way such as to 
permanently bind its successors, unless specifically intending to 
do so by way of constitutional amendment.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In aboriginal treaty matters, this becomes particularly 
important given that much of the evidence that formed the basis 
of current decision making and treaty interpretation is far from 
being indisputable.  Historical renderings of oral traditions are 
full of nuance, significant differences in interpretation and not 
easily verified independently.  These evidentiary weaknesses 
become quite evident in the Marshall case.  Any discussion based 
on oral tradition must, by its very nature, be considered to be 
interpretative rather than grounded on objective fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remembrance Day has recently passed.  At this time and in years 
prior, people were reminded of past prejudices toward aboriginal 
veterans that give to current grievances.  After the second world 
war, aboriginal veterans had to choose between renouncing their 
aboriginal status and receiving post-war benefits available to 
all veterans.  Understandably, most were reluctant to give up 
their birthright.  They believed then and believe now that it was 
unjust to discriminate in post-war veterans benefits based on 
race.  I agree with them and have consistently advocated their 
position in my capacity as Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition critic 
for veterans affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 25, 1998 my colleague from North Vancouver 
introduced a motion that added clarity to my position with 
respect to aboriginal veterans.  In the context of the current 
debate, it is very important to remind the House that differences 
of opinion concerning the Nisga'a agreement do not impede the 
recognition of general injustices that must be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might question how this veteran inequality came about. 
Simply, it is due to a government trying to balance, many would 
say juggle, the special rights of some with equal rights of all 
and then deciding to favour the few, in this case at the cost of 
aboriginal war veterans rights.  Seeing how the federal 
government absolutely fumbled the play toward handling war 
veterans rights, it boggles the mind to think how the government 
will ever decide on the rights of equality for all Canadians. 
Looking at the Nisga'a agreement, there is an entrenchment of 
refusal to permit all Canadians on Nisga'a lands to have the same 
voting rights.  What sort of equality is this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois on my left are salivating over the 
implications of the ever more special status of government by and 
for the people of Nisga'a.  It is salivating at the opportunity 
to see these rights enshrined and then interpreted for its own 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a government so devoid of solutions that it could not 
resolve the aboriginal war veterans' concerns in 55 years, what 
chance do we have that it will not interpret the Nisga'a 
agreement as constitutionally carved in stone, thus becoming 
precedent setting for separatist purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Advocating a just cause on behalf of the aboriginal community 
should not blind a parliamentarian to the fact that all such 
claims are not equally just.  A major consequence of the Nisga'a 
agreement will be the creation of a self-governing community 
based on race, notwithstanding the fact that non-aboriginals and 
non-Nisga'a aboriginals have lived and worked in this area of 
British Columbia for many years.  The nature of the franchise of 
the non-Nisga'a to democratically influence the future of the 
area is far from certain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to remember that the majority of the 
positions favouring aboriginal self-government do not involve 
economic self-sufficiency as a precondition to such 
self-government.  The Nisga'a agreement is no different and, in 
this respect, quite comparable to the creation of Nunavut: 
self-government which is not preceded by economical 
self-sufficiency; and self-government funded by settlement 
payments, which does little to eliminate dependency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the 1992 rejection of the Charlottetown accord by the 
Canadian people, the notion of any distinct society was soundly 
rejected.  We should remember that the distinct aboriginal 
society component of the Charlottetown accord was similarly 
rejected. 
While non-aboriginal Canadians appear prepared to acknowledge 
that degrees of redress are required to correct past injustices, 
few are prepared to advocate the creation of third world 
republics.  Few are prepared to advocate the balkanization of 
Canada through the implementation of hundreds of similar 
agreements.  Few are prepared to support the dedication of 
taxpayer revenues to fund such balkanization or the 
self-government falsehoods associated with continuing 
dependencies.  Dependency on public funds, however caused, comes 
with an obligation to use one's best efforts to end such 
dependency.  A perpetual victim attitude is far from being 
currently defensible as a means to justify such dependency.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me refer once again to my current involvement with the 
grievances of aboriginal veterans.  They are not victims; they 
cannot be.  They are defenders of Canada, all of whom volunteered 
to defend Canada. They have been subject to an injustice for over 
half a century.  Their current state in life, for better or for 
worse, is not blamed on this injustice.  Perhaps this is because, 
based on their military background, aboriginal veterans 
appreciate that individual strength and initiative is necessary 
to overcome any adversity.  In the heat of battle, putting on the 
victim cloak and blaming others simply increases the likelihood 
of the battle being lost.  The focus must be the larger 
collective good and one's individual contribution to that good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this debate, I hope that the focus will similarly be on the 
larger collective good, particularly in the longer term, and how 
our actions here may contribute to that collective good.

am pleased to rise this afternoon and add my voice to the long 
list of voices that have expressed concern over the Nisga'a 
treaty when it comes to our particular party, and particularly to 
those voices out in the province of British Columbia.  Being from 
the adjacent province, my riding of Calgary Northeast, I also 
recognize the concerns expressed by my colleagues, especially 
those from British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There cannot be a good, valid or an arguable reason for passing 
the Nisga'a treaty without further debate on these much needed

doing, the Liberal government is again resorting to an arrogant 
tactic that has marked its tenure and power and which has 
characterized so many Liberal governments of the past that have 
tried to ramrod dangerous and divisive social change through 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government so afraid to debate this issue?  Why is 
the government so nervous about discussing the particulars of 
this treaty?  Why does the government label all opponents of this 
treaty in the cowardly manner that it does?  Why does the 
government constantly seek to invoke closure, an undemocratic, 
cowardly and desperate act that attempts to smother free speech 
in the House?  In its actions, the government is no different 
than the NDP government in B.C. which has also ramrodded the 
Nisga'a treaty through the provincial legislature against huge 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is most disturbing about the attitude of both governments 
is the dismissal of that opposition and the dismissal of the 
democratic consultation and open debate process.  Despite deep 
and disturbing concerns about this treaty, critics are ignored 
and uncertainty is chided.  The fact of the matter is that these 
concerns have to be addressed.  This uncertainty must be 
acknowledged.  This is a controversial treaty that threatens to 
change the shape of the Canadian nation.  It will cost taxpayers 
billions of dollars.  It will rework the justice system and 
entrench a cast system in our society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day more Canadians are realizing that this treaty will be 
a catalyst for racial intolerance and not a cure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are getting angry that they were not consulted about 
this deal and were not told all the facts.  Now they want to be 
consulted.  They want the facts now.  They will get the facts 
sooner or later.  We will not let this legislation pass without 
opposition.  We will not sit back and watch the government ignore 
the will of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is a fatally flawed treaty that is bad for 
natives and non-natives.  The Prime Minister was effusive in his 
praise of this treaty today, but 30 years ago he recognized the 
need to integrate natives into Canadian society when, as the 
Indian affairs minister, he advocated that policy.  I suppose he 
still had a sense of individual rights in those days and of all 
Canadians being equal under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is a giant step backward into a world where 
status and power is defined by one's race and position and where 
national unity is divided into fiefdoms of privilege.  With the 
passage of the Nisga'a treaty, we are embracing a regressive 
social system that could easily have been designed in the middle 
ages.  To begin with, all the residents on Nisga'a land will not 
have the right to vote for their local governments under the 
Nisga'a treaty.  Only the Nisga'a peoples will be allowed to 
vote.  Non-Nisga'a residents are excluded on the basis of race. 
This is not only immoral but unconstitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could any Canadian agree to a treaty with this kind of a 
provision?  There is one reason why the B.C. Liberal Party 
opposed the Nisga'a treaty, and in a B.C. Liberal Party guide to 
the Nisga'a treaty, this objection and others were outlined for 
B.C. voters to see.  It is a pity that the federal Liberals were 
not affected by the same degree of common sense that seems to 
prevail at the provincial level.  It was heartening to hear the 
B.C. Liberal leader, Gordon Campbell, condemn this act, condemn 
the closure that was attempted to be foisted upon this parliament 
and condemn the process that was pushed upon the people in 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this creation of a two race system that we in the Reform 
Party find most disgusting in the Nisga'a treaty.  Can we think 
for a moment about what we are saying in this document?  Can we 
consider for a moment what the consequences of this treaty will 
be?  Where has the passion for democracy, for individual freedom 
and for equality under the law gone in this country and in this 
parliament?  Is a race based society justifiable if those judged 
to possess special status just happen to be non-white? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries have attempted to define their rights and 
freedoms on the basis of race.  We have condemned their 
philosophy.  This House has condemned their philosophy.  We have 
opposed their tyranny and have died fighting in the belief that 
all people are created equal, as my colleague from Edmonton 
pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can members imagine the reaction if we denied rights and 
freedoms to a specific race in the rest of Canada?  Yet we are 
prepared to grant one race status over another because it 
involves native land claims.  This represents a perilous 
disconnection of thought and judgment, and one that we ought to 
oppose at every opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty has been identified as the balkanization of 
Canada.  We need only to look to the Balkans to see how tragic 
this transformation can be.  Today, over 4,000 Canadian military 
personnel are in the Balkans struggling to maintain a peace after 
years of brutal civil war.  The region has divided into nation 
states based on religion and ethnicity and subdivided again into 
warring factions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian lesson has been that there is strength in unity and 
integration.  We cannot have two political systems, two styles of 
government and two justice systems.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the awesome potential for a national tragedy that makes 
the acceptance of the Nisga'a treaty so fraught with 
difficulties, for truly this agreement has been hailed as a 
template for other native land claims across B.C., and indeed 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to deliberate on this form of self-government, one based 
on race and consider it positive for Canada?  Is that what we 
have to deliberate upon?  And, at what cost?  The Nisga'a treaty 
will cost somewhere in the neighbourhood of $490 million 
according to the B.C. government, the treaty's most earnest 
supporter.  It could well be more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this treaty, which is a template for all other land claims 
agreements, is applied to other negotiations the cost will be 
much more, perhaps in the tens of billions of dollars, and the 
cost will keep climbing.  The government in passing this 
legislation is serving a writ of sentence to upcoming generations 
in the country, a sentence of taxation to pay for inequality for 
non-Indians and special status for Indians under Canadian law. It 
is also establishing a tragic political legacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made an art out of its catering to special 
interest groups.  It cannot even think in terms of individual 
Canadians who hold inalienable rights.  It thinks only in terms 
of competing groups and of pitting these groups against each 
other for the sake of political expediency.  The country will pay 
dearly for this slavish devotion to special interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have not dealt very well with this crisis.  Instead 
they have planted the seeds for an even greater crisis with the 
Nisga'a treaty.  Overnight they have significantly raised the 
spectre of racial unrest in the country and they do not even seem 
to care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They care so little that they have avoided any sort of 
comprehensive debate as to how the Nisga'a treaty will affect the 
future and impact upon all our lives. 
<P><A NAME="LINK285"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wished I did not have to speak on a topic like this today because 
it would really never have come this far if we had had true 
democratic debate across the country.  If there had been a 
referendum in B.C. I dare say that this would not be in this 
place today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With some regret I speak on Bill C-9, the Nisga'a final 
agreement act.  I share with my colleagues on this side of the 
House, the official opposition party, some of the concerns with 
this implementation legislation that would be brought to the 
province of British Columbia.  I do not believe it will be good 
for the native people in that province, nor the non-native people 
there and across the rest of the country, especially if it is the 
template pattern for what occurs in my own province, my backyard 
and throughout the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate some of my concerns with some that have been 
expressed by my colleagues, about the implications this treaty 
would have for how the Canadian constitution functions. The 
position of the Reform Party, and I read it for the record, 
states that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—any form of Indian self-government will be a delegated form— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, like unto a municipal form of government. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and all lands within the borders of Canada will remain part of 
Canada.  The laws of Canada (and the Provinces and Territories) 
including the Canadian Constitution and the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms will apply to Indian governments.  Any laws enacted by 
Indian governments must conform with the laws of Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In chapters 2 and 11 of the treaty, the provisions for 
self-government undermine this common sense understanding of how 
Indian governments must operate in conformity with Canadian laws. 
In the treaty, Nisga'a governance powers are considered an 
aboriginal treaty right within the meaning of section 35 of the 
Canadian constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entrenching of Nisga'a powers in a treaty will in effect create 
a third order of government in Canada.  In concrete terms the 
treaty grants the Nisga'a government paramount power in 14 
different areas and shared jurisdiction in another 16 fields. 
That is a constitutional change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is irresponsible on the part of the Liberal government to 
bring about such a fundamental change to our country, to the 
constitutional structure of Canada and to do it in such an 
undemocratic manner as it has been.  It is incredible when one 
thinks of it that a de facto constitutional change would be made 
without input.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too much of that agreement was hammered out in secrecy behind 
closed doors.  Even certain members of the government of the 
province of British Columbia were unable to receive information 
with respect to the details of it.  It was hidden from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When all was done, a fait accompli, it was brought to the 
government by the NDP in British Columbia and it was rammed 
through.  Closure was invoked there as well.  It was invoked 
halfway through the debate in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the federal level the official opposition represents 24 of 
the 34 seats in the province of British Columbia, the largest 
number of course.  Again we see democracy being trampled on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill before us becomes law there is a clause in the 
agreement that will cripple the official opposition federally and 
provincially.  That clause will ensure that no party to this 
agreement may challenge it once it is ratified.  It is a very 
important clause because it will completely hobble the government 
in waiting once it becomes the government.  Simply, many of those 
issues have not been addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major problems is that at least in a modern world 
power resides here with native government in a collective sense 
and not with native individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also saddened to see the way this Nisga'a treaty conforms 
to the Liberal pattern of showing only respect, if one can even 
call it that, only to aboriginal band leadership and not showing 
the same respect for the ordinary person on the street, the 
grassroots, the ordinary band member in those communities.  The 
treaty bypasses the individual and instead concentrates the 
economic and political power in the hands of the Nisga'a 
government, a collective sense.  Individual Nisga'a people have 
no reason to be excited about this treaty and they are not.  They 
do not have property rights in this treaty.  Nor are their 
individual freedoms protected in the way that other Canadians 
have their freedoms protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unclear whether all the rights in the charter will even 
apply to the Nisga'a people.  Under the terms of section 25 of 
the charter the courts must defer to collective aboriginal rights 
if they are deemed to conflict with charter rights.  This places 
collective rights over individual rights and that means 
aboriginal government rights over the rights of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also it was brought to our attention out there when hearing 
individuals that there are conflicting claims on the same land 
from other bands.  The federal government must reach agreement 
with surrounding bands, including the Gitksan and the Gitanyow. 
We have overlapping claims against land proposed to be conveyed 
now under this Nisga'a treaty.  Such agreement must be an 
accommodation satisfactory to the Gitksan and the Gitanyow 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Briefing notes from the B.C. minister of agriculture show what 
state of anarchy it could create in terms of the whole of 
agriculture in the province of British Columbia.  If it is used 
as a template for future land claims, it will cause significant 
disruptions to individuals ranchers, orchardists and farmers 
throughout the Okanagan.  Over 1,000 farms in the Okanagan 
Valley, represented by my colleagues here, will be greatly 
affected by this.  Not only does it threaten the commercial 
interests of those ranchers, orchardists and farmers, but it 
threatens the whole B.C. agricultural land reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP briefing note went on to say that the majority of a 
crown agricultural land reserve would likely be consumed by land 
claims for a total of approximately 2.5 million hectares.  Using 
Nisga'a as a template, and God forbid, it will not only create 
economic uncertainty in certain parts adjoining there, but 
throughout the rest of the province as well.  They know this. The 
Liberals, the NDP and the Tories know this, but they insist that 
their extreme measures are best.  They know what is best for 
British Columbians and have not even given them a referendum to 
indicate it themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Nisga'a treaty were to be a template, and we believe 
there is every possibility that it will be and in fact it is 
already becoming that for some, it is the first of 50 or more 
treaties in British Columbia.  There is no clear way to know 
exactly how much these treaties will cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One 1999 study by R.M. Richardson and Associates estimates that 
the total cost of these treaties could be as high as $40 billion. 
That is a pretty powerful big sum of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the Nisga'a treaty is already serving as a precedent 
in other treaty negotiations in B.C. where other people are not 
being consulted about these very sweeping changes by way of 
referendum.  In fact B.C. law does require that a referendum be 
held to approve constitutional changes.  There are lawsuits 
presently pending before the courts on this issue.  With the 
creation of 50 or more governments in B.C., economic development 
in much of the province will be severely restricted, hamstrung. 
It will be economic anarchy.  Long term economic development will 
take a pretty heavy hit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty has also served as a model for the Inuit 
agreement in principle, negotiated in Labrador and some of the 
provisions in that agreement, which covers more than a quarter of 
Labrador, mirror unfortunately those found in the Nisga'a 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that it will be a model for treaties yet to be 
negotiated as a result of the ruling by the Supreme Court in the 
Delgamuukw case in 1997, existing treaties in the rest of Canada 
may also be reopened to renewed negotiations.  They will be 
opening probably the Treaty 8 in Alberta.  I understand that has 
already begun.  The Nisga'a treaty will certainly be an important 
model for other bands, reopening negotiations since their own 
settlements of a century ago are very modest by comparison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to state some of the Reform Party's policy for the record 
again.  It has perhaps been heard but needs to be said again. The 
Nisga'a final agreement strongly contradicts one of the key 
founding principles of the Reform Party, namely that we believe 
in true equality of Canadian citizens with equal rights and 
responsibilities for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another Reform Party policy found in the blue book states that 
the Reform Party's ultimate goal in aboriginal matters is that 
all aboriginal people be full and equal participants in Canadian 
citizenship, indistinguishable in law and treatment from other 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Householders and 10 percenters have been sent to 534,000 
households in British Columbia.  Thus far, about 10,000 have been 
returned, which is a very good response rate.  Of the results 
tabulated 89% of the respondents do not believe that the public 
has had adequate opportunity to provide input into the Nisga'a 
treaty; 92% believe the people of B.C. should have the right to 
vote on the principles of the treaty; 91.5% want their member of 
parliament to vote against the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go through Liberal members' ridings which indicate a 
very high percentage, upper 80% and 90%, who want their member to 
vote against the treaty.  Poll information tends to support the 
fact that a majority of British Columbians oppose the Nisga'a 
treaty.  Surveys done by our own members corroborate that.  All 
around we are very clear on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to indicate some of the important principles 
as far as Reform is concerned here.  We believe that the Indian 
Act discriminates against aboriginal people.  It sets them apart 
from other Canadians.  We recommend the Indian Act be abolished, 
that a new relationship between aboriginals and governments be 
established so that we encourage less dependency on the federal 
government and more control by aboriginals over their own 
affairs, but under a municipal level, a delegated level of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform calls for open negotiations, public, unlike the secret 
negotiations that happened with respect to the Nisga'a treaty. 
With regard to self-government, as I said, it needs to be a 
delegated level of government.  It needs to be democratic, 
accountable and subject to the laws of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to self-reliance Reform believes that the 
improvement in the standard of living of aboriginal people can be 
achieved by removing the barriers to full and equal participation 
in Canada's economic life.  Too many impediments over the years 
have been imposed on the creativity and the diligence of native 
people.  They should have the option of receiving government 
benefits directly.  They should have access to the auditor 
general to make sure that local governments are accountable for 
management of their finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we will rue the day that we allowed this bill to go 
through.  Of course, we as the opposition have done everything we 
could to stall this bill so that we would get a better deal for 
native people, for Indian people, across the country of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-209, an act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibited sexual 
acts), be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise tonight to seek 
the support of the House for my private member's bill, Bill 
C-209, which will raise the age of consent from 14 to 16 years. 
As there has been much talk of late about issues of consent and 
sexual predators and their attack on our young, I believe this is 
a timely presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-209 would therefore amend those sections of the Criminal 
Code dealing with prohibited sexual acts committed with children 
who are under the age of 14 years or in the presence of other 
children under the age of 14 years.  In effect, the bill would 
allow for criminal charges to be brought against any adult who 
engages in sexual relations with a person younger than the age of 
16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first introduced this bill in the House in 1996 in the wake of 
reports that a 14 year old Edmonton girl was having sex with her 
father's AIDS infected lover; a repugnant offence.  As repugnant 
as the situation was, the police were powerless to charge the 
man.  The question, of course, that would come to mind would be 
why.  The law determines the age of consent to be 14 years. 
Unfortunately, as a result of this sexual encounter, it was a 
life sentence for the young lady.  Nothing came out of it as far 
as protection for her or anybody else of her age found in a 
similar circumstance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years later, I believe there are even more reasons to 
introduce this bill and to change the criminal code.  Ever since 
the B.C. Supreme Court struck down laws prohibiting child 
pornography, we have heard arguments that if children can engage 
in sex, why should they not appear in pornographic pictures. This 
sort of twisted reasoning, one that points logic on its head and 
seeks to avoid any moral accountability, is exactly why we need 
to amend the criminal code in this area and in many others when 
it comes to sex acts against children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in an age where perverts proudly display their deviant 
behaviour as a badge of honour. Societal constraint no longer 
seems to serve as a means of preserving moral order.  Sexual 
predators need to be controlled by specific constraints that are 
codified in law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think of a couple of situations that arose in this 
province alone that required substantial police investigation 
over many months and substantial court action accumulating 
evidence and building a case to convict numerous predators who 
had preyed on numerous young people, most under the age of 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a telling affair when we look at those charged and who 
they represent.  They were people in authority. 
They were street people who were part of a gang or a loosely 
organized group with one common purpose, to pick on our young 
children.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument used, in many of those cases, by those who 
performed such acts against young people, was that they had done 
many of those kids a favour by taking them off the street and 
giving them a comfortable place to stay.  Is that an argument?  I 
do not believe it is an argument.  It is rationalization beyond 
even reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some criticism over the timing of this bill.  One 
hon. member insisted that although this bill is sound, that it 
would be inappropriate for the Reform Party to introduce it at 
this time given the events of the last few weeks which involved a 
former justice critic of the official opposition.  I do not wish 
to confuse the specifics of this bill with those of a legal case, 
but the issue has been raised and I believe it must be faced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest that this party has lost its moral right to defend 
those social issues that it holds dear because of the actions of 
one of its members is an argument without reason.  It is an 
attack upon the man and not the idea.  The hon. member who 
mentioned this so-called contradiction is aware of that.  There 
is human frailty in every party caucus but it does not destroy 
the principles for which that party stands.  We as a party have 
condemned such actions in the past and we will condemn such 
actions in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now is the time to pass this legislation.  We need to do it now 
so children will be allowed to be children and not forced into 
early sexual activity by some with other desires.  We need to 
protect our children from sexual predators who are using Canadian 
law as a shield, using coercion to gain consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate part with a predator is that he is probably one 
of the most manipulative of all criminals.  Over time, he will 
place himself in a position where he will have access to 
youngsters. I have seen it and, as a former police officer, I 
have investigated such complaints.  It is very tragic to see 
where the tentacles of this type of criminal activity have 
reached.  It is in our churches, our governments, our schools, 
our society, on our streets and on the blocks where we live.  It 
is very pervasive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code does not criminalize sexual activity with or 
between persons 14 years old or over unless it takes place in a 
relationship of trust or authority over the young person.  This 
is another stipulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is shocking that in Canada the voting age is 18.  In 
provinces such as British Columbia, the legal drinking age is 19 
and the legal age for obtaining a learner's permit for driving is 
16, yet the age of sexual consent remains at 14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am well aware that many other groups, lobbyists and concerned 
individuals are also pushing to see the legislation changed. 
Some would like to see it as high as 18, and I really have no 
objection to that.  There is good sound reason for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the rationales expressed by the Calgary Local Council of 
Women was that this subject had become prominent in the last 
year.  Dr. Paul Cameron of the Family Research Institute of 
Colorado Springs, Colorado said that research has found that 
there is a clear relationship between intergenerational sexual 
activity and promiscuity in later life, both homosexual and 
heterosexual.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, they have found that pernicious sex tends to produce 
promiscuity.  They found that the promiscuous tend to make poor 
marriage partners and poor marriage partners make poor parents. 
They say that this is a fact with medical, social and political 
implications.  I think this has some good, sound, scientific 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not the same society that we were in 1882 when the 
criminal code was created and the age of consent was established 
as 14.  Child pornography or child prostitution was little known 
a century ago and most people would never have imagined the 
possibility of such things occurring.  Today, in the wake of the 
sexual revolution, we face a barrage of sexual marketing, much of 
it concerning children.  The proliferation of the Internet, while 
increasing society's potential for education, growth and 
improvement, has also radically heightened the production and 
distribution of obscenity, filth and vice.  Hence, children are 
more at risk now, in this multimedia society, then they ever have 
been before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As legislators, I believe we have a moral obligation to protect 
the young and vulnerable in our society. We can start by making 
it more difficult for sexual predators to prey upon our 
children's innocence by raising the age of consent and, with that 
law well-established, using the law to its fullest if need be and 
enforcing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as legislators have a moral obligation, yet some in the 
government would have us abdicate that moral responsibility to 
the courts.  They would sit idly by while unelected judges make 
the moral decisions for us, as these detached individuals make 
decisions that will affect the lives of Canadians everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to choose the direction of the course of law and not 
have the direction charted for us.  We need to set the moral 
agenda and not have that agenda set for us.  We need to take back 
our responsibility for the moral climate in the country and stop 
insisting that we are powerless to affect the edicts of the 
supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would reiterate that our children are our most precious 
resource. They are also one of the most vulnerable groups in our 
society. They are likely to be manipulated or coerced into a 
sexual relationship with an adult for any number of reasons, a 
relationship that may, on the periphery, appear consensual.  What 
a child anticipates to be loving and caring is ultimately nothing 
less than exploitation if used in that fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may argue that 14-year-olds are not ignorant about sex. 
This may be true, as it is hard to be ignorant about sex in a 
society that is quite clearly deluged with the subject.  However, 
we must ask ourselves if at that age children have the experience 
and the maturity to make decisions about their own sexuality 
regardless of whether they consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Setting an age under which individuals can legally consent is 
not necessarily an arbitrary one.  However, someone has to decide 
and better that we, as elected parliamentarians, through our 
constituents who are our mums, our dads and our grandparents, 
ultimately have the say.  We should have the final say, not the 
courts.  It should be decided here in the House and not by an 
unelected body such as the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate my bill is not a votable one because I think 
it should be a time for accountability. 
The government side is raising the spectre of this issue after 
Reform has delivered for a number of years some strong messages 
in reference to the particular issue of sexual consent and 
predators of youngsters.

society rather than a reactive posture that allows others to

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-209, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibited sexual acts), be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK298"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am please to rise to speak to Bill C-209, an act to amend the 
criminal code, prohibited sexual acts, introduced by the hon. 
member for Calgary Northeast.  The Minister of Justice cannot 
support Bill C-209 at this time for three very compelling 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, on November 29, 1999, the Department of Justice released 
a consultation document entitled “Child Victims in the Criminal 
Justice System”.  The document examines possible changes to the 
criminal code and the Canada Evidence Act to improve protection 
for children from extreme harm by adults.  The paper examines 
some of the most pressing issues and sets out options for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, areas being considered include the creation 
of further specific offences that may be committed against 
children, sentencing to protect children from those who might 
reoffend, and facilitating of children's testimony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The release of the document is actually another step toward a 
broader and needed public consultation with all Canadians.  The 
justice department is concerned with the breadth of possible 
implications of any change to the criminal code on young persons. 
It considers legislation of this nature to be premature.  By 
undertaking very full consultations the department is taking 
these concerns to all Canadians interested in the welfare of 
young children.  This process already began through early 
consultations with provincial and territorial officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the department convened a conference on working 
together to protect children in late September of this year, a 
two day conference which I attended.  The conference brought 
together provincial and territorial stakeholders, as well as 
professionals, non-governmental organizations and others working 
with children, in order to examine the issues of prevention and 
protection of children from harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the conference the minister announced the release of the 
consultation paper, “Child Victims in the Criminal Justice 
System”.  Responses are being sought from all Canadians 
concerned with the welfare of children.  The paper also seeks the 
opinions of government officials, interested organizations, 
individuals and professionals dealing with children.  Extra 
copies are available upon request at the Department of Justice 
Canadian Internet site or by calling the Department of Justice. 
Interested Canadians may also obtain a copy by writing to child 
victim consultation, family, children and youth section, 
Department of Justice, Ottawa.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians who take an interest in the well-being of children are 
encouraged to take part in the consultation. The Department of 
Justice is also asking public servants, stakeholders, private 
individuals and professionals working with children to 
participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A copy of the consultation paper can be obtained by visiting the 
Internet site of the Department of Justice, or by writing to the 
Minister of Justice. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-209 proposes to amend several sections of the criminal 
code where the general minimum age of consent is part of the 
definition of sexual offences involving a child victim.  The 
current age of consent to most forms of sexual activity is 14. 
There is an exception for consensual sexual activity between 
young people close in age and under 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-209 proposes to increase the general age of consent to 
sexual activity from 14 to 16.  The age of the complainant in the 
existing exception would also be raised to 16.  The proposed bill 
would also substitute under 16 for under 14 in connection with 
the powers of the court to make prohibition orders against 
offenders who are convicted, or who are discharged on conditions 
in a probation order, of certain sexual offences against a person 
under 14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-209 raises valid concerns about the current protection 
provided to young people.  For example, it has been argued that 
the present general age of consent, which is 14, is too low to 
provide effective protection from sexual exploitation by adults. 
The relatively low age may allow pimps, for example, to seduce 
young girls with the intention of luring them into prostitution 
without fear of prosecution.  However the hon. member for Calgary 
Northeast seems to think that all that is involved in addressing 
the complex issue of age of consent is simply to change the age. 
That is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protecting our children goes beyond a simple and arbitrary 
increase of the age of consent to sexual activity.  It means 
addressing the broader issue of the safety and well-being of our 
children.  Our objective is to develop and maintain effective 
comprehensive measures to protect children from serious injury 
and death at the hands of adults.  The achievement of this 
objective rests with an essential collaborative effort of the 
provinces, the territories and the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the provision of services to children who are in need of 
protection is the responsibility of the provinces and 
territories, the assurance that appropriate offences and 
penalties are available for serious harm done to children is the 
responsibility of the Government of Canada.  By targeting extreme 
forms of harm through the criminal code, the Government of Canada 
would provide strong support for provincial and territorial 
initiatives to protect children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill does not address the criminal code consequences 
of raising the general age at which sexual activity with young 
people would be criminalized.  Bill C-209 proposes an amendment 
that is inconsistent with other relevant sections of the criminal 
code.  For example, even though the complainant's age would be 
raised to 16 there is no consequential change to the age of the 
accused in the exception that prevents criminalizing consensual 
sexual activity between young people close in age and under 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that a teenager over 16 who has consensual sex 
with a person under 16 but who is close in age would be engaging 
in criminal conduct.  At the same time a younger teenager would 
be able to consent to sexual activity with a person close in age. 
This outcome would appear to be not only discriminatory but also 
contrary to common sense.  Consequently Bill C-209 would not 
address the issue but rather would create confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the bill does not address the broader implications that 
arise from an amendment to the general age of consent.  Since 
legislative changes do not take place in a vacuum, we must be 
aware that a change in the age of consent may have an impact on 
other legislation.  For example, such changes may impact on the 
age 14 for providing assistance to child witnesses and for 
competency to testify in the criminal code and the Canada 
Evidence Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is whether an amendment to the age of consent to 
sexual activity would require amendments to other age related 
provisions of the criminal code.  Furthermore, any arbitrary 
changes in the criminal code would be inconsistent with the 
government's commitment to consult with the provinces and 
territories before introducing amendments intended to support 
their efforts to protect children from abuse, neglect and 
exploitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the justice minister is meeting with her provincial and 
territorial counterparts today and tomorrow on 
federal-provincial-territorial issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the need to review the issue of age of consent is 
a real concern.  Children deserve to live in a safe society and 
to be protected from any forms of serious harm caused by adults.

opportunity to express their views on this issue.  We also 
believe that the age of consent should be dealt within the 
broader context of other age related issues in the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Department of Justice issued its consultation 
paper and looks forward to learning from Canadians on this topic 
with sound and reasoned action to follow.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-209 which is 
before the House.  It is unfortunate in many ways that we have to 
face very troubling and very shameful issues which come forward, 
but if we do not I am afraid the effect of not acting and not 
becoming proactive and involved is negligence on our part and 
will result in further harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin my remarks by congratulating the member for Calgary 
Northeast for bringing the matter before the House.  Bill C-209 
at second reading stage is a very positive attempt by the member 
to bring forward the matter.  As I said at the outset it is 
shameful that we are discussing despicable behaviour which deals 
with children and their loss of innocence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many outside the inner workings of our justice system, 
many outside this place, perhaps only those who have felt the 
sting of sexual intrusion, who can appreciate how serious an 
issue it truly is.  There is a need for us to deal with it and 
not turn a blind eye, not be caught up in the rhetoric and the 
paternalistic and sometimes platitudinal approach often taken to 
serious issues of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly sexual predators exist.  They exist in every community. We 
know this from high profile cases such as the Mount Cashel 
incident in the seventies in Newfoundland and more recently in 
Toronto at Maple Leaf Gardens.  Instances of child abuse are 
presented to us through the media in a barrage, which sometimes 
leads me to fear that a degree of insensitivity or 
desensitization occurs in today's society.  It is laudable that 
we should be bringing these matters before the House of Commons, 
the people's place, for discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians hear daily accounts of the damage being done to other 
human beings, almost to the point where we are becoming 
thick-skinned.  Abuse of positions of trust are particularly 
disturbing when the person in charge is the perpetrator and the 
person they should have been relying upon for protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill in many ways is an attempt to expand the envelope of 
protection, to broaden the range for which the sections of the 
criminal code as they currently apply would protect individuals 
in the age group of 14 to 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent legislation that we have seen before the House is also 
laudable in its attempts to notify individuals, particularly 
those in positions of trust who are entrusted to protect 
children.  I am talking about parents and groups such as Scouts, 
police and child protection agencies.  I am referring to Bill C-7 
which will be back before the House of Commons in fairly short 
order.  It would call upon the solicitor general's department to 
make public information about pardoned sex offenders who remain 
in the RCMP database and can be released upon request to these 
types of interested parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government took office much of the problem with social 
services is that they have been cut and underfunded. As the 
parliamentary secretary said in his remarks, it is not enough to 
say that we can simply pass legislation which will fix these 
social problems, these social sores which exist in the area of 
sexual predators.  It is the government's responsibility to put 
proper funding into these areas. 
We have seen this most recently with other legislation, like the 
new youth criminal justice act which will replace the Young 
Offenders Act.  It is fine for the government to say it is going 
to front end efforts for rehabilitation or efforts to identify 
youth at risk, yet it is not putting proper funding into these 
areas.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may argue that the criminal code already protects children, 
that general provisions of the criminal code list the fundamental 
purposes and principles of sentencing and that sections 718 and 
718.1 are definitely there for the protection of children.  I 
would suggest that this bill furthers the envelope.  I do not 
think that anyone should be apologetic for making efforts in this 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of disclosure, making information known to those 
who need the information, we should have a national registry for 
sex offenders similar to that of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament, we need to focus clearly on the need 
to protect society from sexual predators.  Sexual assault is not 
an issue of sex, it is an issue of power and control, oppression 
and dominance over children.  It is a very weak and gutless act 
which is hard for many individuals to even imagine.  It is very 
true that when it comes to the disclosure of information to 
protect those in our society who are most vulnerable, we have to 
do everything we can.  We must be vigilant in every way to ensure 
the safety of children and to protect them when they are in this 
most vulnerable state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very high rate of recidivism when it comes to sexual 
offenders.  This is extremely troubling, knowing that there is 
the potential for parents to leave children in the trust of an 
individual who may have a past that is unknown to the parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law was put in place to prohibit access to children and is 
very much there to say that children in a certain age group are 
at a certain maturity level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the parliamentary secretary has suggested, I do 
not think that is confusing at all.  With maturity comes 
responsibility.  We are more than aware that in some instances a 
12 year old may be more streetwise than a 16 year old.  There is 
discretion built into the criminal code that allows a judge, a 
prosecutor or a lawyer to make that judgment call on the facts 
before them.  This particular change would simply expand the 
envelope and give the greater discretion that may be required as 
the circumstances might dictate.  There are different 
circumstances that obviously need to be envisioned, and this 
legislative change would allow that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is certainly a consensus that the intent of this bill is 
aimed strictly at not confusion, but putting in place a system 
that would allow a 16 year old who is not of a mature state to be 
under a greater protective umbrella under the criminal code.  The 
change envisions that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sections that are affected could be changed by the justice 
committee.  If this bill were allowed to proceed through the 
House in the manner which is dictated by procedure, it would be 
brought to committee.  There could be corresponding changes made 
to other sections of the code of which the hon. member from the 
government side spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Shefford has been very vocal on issues 
involving the protection of children and our party has been 
consistent in its demands of the government to protect children 
in matters that involve sexual predators.  There is no question 
that we need to do more to ensure that individual cases, like the 
one we saw recently in Toronto involving 11 year Allison Parrot, 
who was raped and killed by Francis Carl Roy, do not happen. 
These types of cases are a shock to the sensibilities of every 
Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not take any issue whatsoever with what the hon. member is 
trying to do with this legislation.  We need to dwell on this, to 
think more and to face the cold hard truth about what is 
happening in some Canadian communities.  Sadly, we have seen time 
and time again these types of cases come before us. Frankly, I am 
disappointed with the government's response. Studies are simply 
not enough.  We can do studies time and time again and gather 
information.  Unfortunately, there is a phrase used in this place 
too often, which comes from the Department of Justice and is 
mouthed by the justice minister, that it will come in a timely 
fashion.  As time goes on more children are vulnerable and more 
children can be harmed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals who are released into the community and are 
permitted to return to the place where they perpetrated these 
acts are a threat.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally introduced Bill C-242, a bill to amend the code 
with respect to the dispositions that judges may give, and it 
speaks specifically of a dwelling house, which is where many of 
these prohibited sexual acts occur.  The impetus for the bill was 
a young woman in the province of Nova Scotia by the name of Donna 
Goler who suffered unimaginable abuse at the hands of family 
members in a dwelling house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to support the efforts of the hon. member.  I 
suggest that his efforts in this regard are very sincere and well 
intended.  This particular piece of legislation, as indicated, 
would expand the umbrella.  It would provide further protection 
to the agencies that need it and it would provide further 
protection to the children who are most vulnerable.  I look 
forward to seeing this matter proceed through the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have read Bill C-209 with a great deal of care.  I looked at it 
from the point of view of the times we are living in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will understand that a bill must be looked at in 
relation to current practices, where our society is at, what is 
tolerated and what is not.  Bills are not initiated solely out 
of personal convictions, although having such convictions helps. 
Their purpose is not self-gratification. They are made to be 
implemented and properly implemented in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked myself whether, generally speaking, society had changed 
its opinion on the approach to be used with young people aged 14 
or 16.  It depends on what legislation we are looking at. The 
existing legislation sets the age at 14 years, while the one 
proposed by the hon. member sets it at 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think society has evolved from where it was five, ten or 
fifteen years ago.  The changes proposed are not in the 
direction of a change in society. On the contrary, they are a 
backward step, a regression in what is tolerated, and I wonder 
about the justification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly not desirable for young people aged 14 or 15 to 
engage in sexual acts or to be in the presence of such acts. 
But when the legislator drafted these clauses, I imagine he was 
listening carefully to what the public wanted. 
The legislator paid careful attention to what the people in the 
various ridings were prepared to tolerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot see how we could say today “What was true 10 or 15 
years ago is no longer true, and the Criminal Code must be 
amended to increase the age from 14 to 16”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find most surprising is that this is a bill to change 
age on the grounds that an adolescent 14 years of age cannot 
validly give consent, and the age must be increased to 16, and 
that it is a member of the Reform Party speaking, when in the 
debate on young offenders these same people said the age should 
be lowered to 14 or 15 because they are responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong with these two sorts of thinking. 
Either they are responsible or they are not.  A person cannot be 
responsible for a delinquent act and not be responsible for an 
act of a sexual nature.  A person is responsible in all matters, 
not just when it suits the Reform member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two children, a 7-year old and a 10-year old.  I know 
very well that today's children are much more mature than those 
of 30 years ago when I was their age.  My children have much more 
mature discussions.  They are much more aware of what is going 
on than were children of the same age 10 or 15 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not excuse people wanting to have sexual relations with 
someone aged 15. I cannot excuse it, but I think there are 
children 15 years of age who are sufficiently mature to give 
their consent.

consent of his or her partner.  This is precisely what Bill 
C-209 introduced by the member would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I have the attention of Reformers.  This does not surprise 
me.  Quebec and western Canada are worlds apart legally.  I

be able to support such a bill once they know what it is all 
about.  For those reasons, I cannot support this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I speak to this honourable bill brought 
forward by my hon. colleague from Calgary Northeast.  I want to 
thank the Conservative Party for having the common sense to 
support good solid legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an absolute, deplorable shame that the Liberal member, 
whom I do not blame because he got a canned speech that was 
developed in Annie Fanny's department, or whatever we want to 
call it, along with all its glossy— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Wild Rose knows 
that he cannot refer to a member of the House by other than the 
member's title.  I am not sure whom he meant, but I can guess.  I 
think he is stepping over the line a little.  I think he meant 
the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  You could be right, Mr. Speaker.  I 
am not sure where the canned speech came from, but I know where 
the glossy print came from.  That came from the office of the 
Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we have managed to get out of this minister for a 
number of years, glossy print, more print, more studies, more of 
this and more of that.  Then we get to hear some real common 
sense speeches, such as “By golly, when I was 15 I had a lot of 
sense.  I could make good decisions about whether I should have 
sex or not.  Things are different now and we live in a different 
age”.  I find this whole thing disgusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, put down your paper.  I am going to tell you a 
story and I am sure you will like it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once upon a time there was a fellow who was a principal of a 
school.  Early one morning in 1990 the principal got a call from 
a parent, saying “My 15 year old daughter did not come home all 
weekend.  We are worried sick.  We would like to know where she 
is.  We have asked the police to do something.  They won't do 
anything.  They have no power to do anything because there is no 
evidence that there was any wrongdoing.  They say that she has 
probably just run away from home and will return later.  Not to 
worry, not to fret”.  There was no action they could take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parents were quite concerned.  Friday night had gone by. 
Saturday night had gone by.  Sunday night had gone by and the 15 
year old girl had not come home.  They phoned the principal to 
ask if he would check the school to see if she had shown up for 
school.  The principal checked and she had not shown up for 
school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal was a very intelligent man and in his wisdom he 
called together all of the classmates of this 15 year old girl 
and asked if any of them knew where she might be.  The children 
said no, they did not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal felt that they knew more than they were telling 
him and he said “Look, folks, her parents are worried sick. 
There is nothing we can do except try to find this girl.  If you 
have any idea where she is, please let me know so we can inform 
the parents and at least they will know she is safe and not 
hurt”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They broke down and told the principal that she was in a 
condominium down the road and if he went there he would find the 
15 year old girl. 
There were three fellows aged 22, 24 and 28 sharing this 
condominium.  The principal asked the police to go to the 
condominium to remove the girl.  He said that he was sure she was 
there.  The police said that they could not because she was 15 
and she had the authority to go there.  The principal said that 
her parents wanted her home because they were worried about her. 
Nevertheless the police said that they could not do it because 
they did not have the authority.  The principal said that he 
would go over and do it.  The officer told him that he had better 
not do that unless the officer went along with him because there 
could be trouble.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The officer jumped in the car with the principal and they drove 
over to number 12.  The principal knocked on the door.  One of 
the fellows came to the door and the principal asked if the said 
girl was present.  The answer was no.  The principal in his usual 
forwardness said: “I'll just have a look and I'd suggest you 
don't bother stopping me”. That is what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He shoved his way through the door and walked in, as it was 
described, in the midst of beer, whiskey, booze all over the 
place and the smell of good old pot, the happy wacky tabaccy that 
everybody says is so wonderful nowadays.  In this deplorable 
situation he wandered around and he could not find her until he 
went into the basement.  He found the girl lying in a bed in an 
almost passed out, nearly sleeping state.  In the principal's 
efforts to wake her, she awoke and recognized him evidently.  He 
told her that she had exactly three minutes to get up and get her 
clothes on, that she was coming with him.  In her shocked state, 
that the principal would dare do this kind of a thing, she asked 
the principal to leave the room and said that she would be up in 
a very short time.  He went back upstairs and waited by the door 
for her to come out of the basement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While he was standing there the other two fellows insisted that 
he should leave because he had no permission to be there.  The 
principal said that he was staying until the girl would come with 
him.  He suggested strongly that they not try to interfere with 
this until it was done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She came up, he grabbed her by the arm, led her out the door, 
put her in the back seat of his car and with he and the officer in 
the front they drove off.  He proceeded to take her home because 
she was in no state to go to school.  She did not want to go 
home.  She screamed and yelled at the principal not to take her 
home.  The principal told her to be quiet and said that was where 
she was going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her parents greeted the car at the entrance and were overjoyed 
that the girl was at least safe.  They asked her to come in and 
she told her parents there was no way she was coming into that 
place, that she did not have to come in.  The father grabbed the 
girl and said “Yes, you're coming in here.  You're going to 
come into this house”.  Then the fight was on and there was 
yelling and screaming.  The principal wished the parents good 
luck and told them when they got the girl straightened up to 
please bring her back to school, that he would have a talk with 
her along with some counselling and she could get some help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the principal drove away from the school, the officer who 
had been keeping notes informed the principal that there could be 
11 charges laid in this incident.  Ten of them would be against 
the principal and the other would be against the parent.  The 
principal asked, “What about these loco yokels who had a young 
girl in their place and were feeding her booze?  Isn't there 
anything like contributing any more?  Doesn't that happen?  Is 
that supposed to be okay?”  The police officer told the 
principal, believe it or not, that under the charter of rights and 
freedoms all of these things are possible because it has been 
declared in some court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal became outraged.  He said that one day, if he could 
do it, he would go to the House of Commons, become a member and 
try to put an end to those kinds of situations.  Why are they 
happening?  Mr. Speaker, you are looking at that principal today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a personal experience that I went through.  The members 
can laugh.  The member from the Bloc can laugh because he thinks 
it is funny that three 20 some year old people molested this 15 
year old girl and it is all okay because she gave her consent. 
Only brainless people would laugh.  Let us make that perfectly 
clear.  Only a gutless government would allow these kinds of 
things to continue in our society for years and years without 
trying to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have grandchildren growing up.  I do not want my grandchildren 
to grow up in a society with such flowery attitudes that 
everything is okay.  Give some authority back to the parents. 
Give some authority back to the schools.  Let these kids be well 
looked after and make it perfectly clear that their lives are in 
the hands of their parents and give the parents the authority to 
do it.  Stop this silly idea that the wonderful charter of rights 
can allow it to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a message for the member for Mississauga West.  This is 
for him.  You are right, sir.  I have asked for amendments to the 
charter, to do something with a charter that allows this kind of 
thing to go on and on until it is worse and worse, where we have 
11 and 12 year old kids being picked up on the streets because of 
prostitution.  It has to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government has any gumption, if those members over there 
have any good sense in their brains at all, they will accept what 
I am about to propose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask for unanimous consent immediately—and the member can 
laugh his heart out and I will make sure he has a real good 
laugh—because I ask for unanimous consent, if anyone has the 
courage, that we make this bill votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that the 
bill be votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK302"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is tragic that we did not get unanimous consent to make this bill 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we will make a note of the fact that the government 
specifically would not agree to a simple suggestion to make this 
bill that would protect 14 year olds and those under 16 a votable 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I only have a few minutes to speak because I want to 
leave time for the mover of the motion to be able to conclude. 
It strikes me as amazing that in a day and age when we are so 
aware of the health risks that are associated with sexual 
activity, it is like Russian roulette.  We had here on the Hill a 
few days ago a big display on the impact of AIDS and sexual 
diseases and how they are killing millions of people in Africa 
and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We insist that our youth take driver education before they can 
drive a car.  We do not let them vote until they are 18.  Yet we 
will let them play Russian roulette with older men that would 
entice a 14 or 15 year old girl into sexual activity.  It is 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a bill on the floor.  It is a horrendous gauntlet 
that a private member's bill has to run to even get to the floor. 
I applaud the hon. member for Calgary Northeast for bringing it 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just had an impassioned speech about a life that was being 
destroyed and was saved by a principal who was courageous enough 
to get the girl out of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make the change.  Let us at least vote on it.  The 
government says no.  That is unbelievable.  That is what we are 
faced with here in the House.  That is why this party is here. 
We have been so frustrated with that kind of garbage that people 
left their normal work life and said, “Let's go down there and 
see what we can do about it”, as my hon. colleague just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government members have reconsidered.  Perhaps it is 
time to think about it again. 
Let us try it again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would first like to thank the members of this House who support 
this bill, that have a concern for the future of many young 
people, who made it very clear that they have strong desires to 
see some changes in the law which would enable the protection of 
our children, or our youngsters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the member for Wild Rose for having the 
courage to stand up and actually make it an important issue, 
supporting the parents in his area where he was the principal of 
a school and who brought a youngster—I do not know the outcome 
of that particular story—into the fold of their home where there 
was protection and not in the home of some sexual predator that 
wanted to prey on her because of her age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the member for Calgary Centre who has 
had concerns about our youngsters in this country for a long 
time, which is one of the reasons he sits in parliament.  I 
remember the day he was elected.  He was elected because he had 
these concerns about how our laws were impacting on the family 
and family issues, and children are part of the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank those members and the member from Nova Scotia 
for supporting this endeavour, Bill C-209. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, on the government side a lot of red herrings were 
thrown out saying that it is going to be difficult to pass this 
kind of legislation because so many other things will impact on 
it in such a way that it is going to be more negative than it is 
positive.  That is a defeatist attitude from the very beginning. 
It is unfortunate the parliamentary secretary had to make such 
comments because those are in fact red herrings.  All one has to 
do is ask any parent in this country whether they would want some 
good sound legislation to protect their children and they would 
say yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who else should you consult other than the parents or 
grandparents of those children?  I do not know of anybody else. 
Social services?  The Elizabeth Fry Society?  Who?  No, it has to 
come back to the family, to the parents.  They are the most 
concerned.  They give the reasons why their children should be 
protected and it is up to us as legislators to make sure that 
does happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For three years I have fought for the bill and for those it 
would affect most, the police.  It would have a direct affect on 
how the police handle situations.  They need more authority as 
the member for Wild Rose clearly pointed out.  They need the 
authority to walk into a place and take children out who are 
being sexually abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ran across the same thing when I was a police officer.  As a 
police officer I stuck my neck out way beyond probably where it 
should have been to do the very same thing that the member for 
Wild Rose spoke of because all of a sudden the charter, a 
wonderful charter, protects those who are being abusers.  It 
should it be the other way around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, there would be an impact on the courts.  I think the 
courts should be able to decree that we will place that child 
back in the home.  That is where he or she belongs and it should 
be enforced.  The unfortunate part of it is the opposite is 
actually happening.  Nobody wants to get involved.  Nobody wants 
to stick their neck out to protect somebody that is innocent.  It 
is very unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe our laws on sexual consent must be strengthened so 
that the police no longer are powerless to take action against 
those who exploit our children for their own sexual 
gratification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the sake of these children, I appeal to the members of the 
House to really give the bill another look.  It will come up 
again and when it does I ask members to give it their full 
consent so that ultimately we can protect the young and 
vulnerable in our society from the predators in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time for the consideration of 
Private Members' Business has now expired and the order is 
dropped from the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
