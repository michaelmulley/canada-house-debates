<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved 
that Bill C-2, an act to establish the Canada Pension Plan 
Investment Board and to amend the Canada Pension Plan and the Old 
Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today it is my privilege to 
begin debate on Bill C-2, legislation that will secure the Canada 
pension plan for Canadians now and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will enact the joint federal-provincial 
agreement reached last February.  It reflects a consensus for 
change and a shared commitment to ensure that the CPP is there, 
that it is sustainable and affordable for today's working 
Canadians and for our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As joint stewards of the Canada pension plan, the federal 
government and the provinces are squarely facing up to our 
collective responsibilities to deal now with an issue facing us 
down the road when the baby boom generation starts to retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his February 1995 report, the chief actuary clearly showed 
that without modifications to the Canada pension plan, the CPP 
fund would be exhausted by 2015 and that contribution rates would 
have to soar to over 14 percent to cover the rapid growth in cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In public consultations held in every province and territory 
across this country last year, Canadians told their governments 
they want to be able to count on their CPP pensions.  They told 
us they want the CPP fixed now and they want it fixed right. 
They did not want it privatized and they certainly did not want 
it scrapped.  They told us to do this in a way that does not pass 
on an insupportable cost burden to younger generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A full report on the consultations was made public last year and 
Canadians were clear.  They told their governments to preserve 
the CPP by strengthening its financing, by improving its 
investment practices and by moderating the growing costs of 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes reflect just that.  This legislation demonstrates 
that we are acting decisively to fulfil our commitment to secure 
this pillar of Canada's retirement income system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we done to strengthen the plan's financing?  When CPP 
was introduced in 1966 it was financed essentially on a pay as 
you go basis. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1105
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, the prospects of rapid growth and real wages and 
labour force participation promised that the CPP could be 
sustained and remain affordable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With low interest rates there was little value to be gained from 
building up large reserve funds.  The pay as you go system made 
sense given these circumstances.  Since then, the slowdown in 
wage and workforce growth and higher real interest rates have 
completely changed the circumstances in which the CPP must be 
financed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pay as you go financing is no longer fair and no longer 
appropriate.  Building up a larger fund, or what has been recently 
called and referred to as fuller funding, and earning a higher 
rate of return through investment in the market are now necessary 
to help pay for the rapidly growing costs that will occur once 
the baby boomers begin to retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, we have made a fundamental change in the financing 
of the Canada pension plan.  The CPP will move from pay as you go 
financing with a small contingency reserve to fuller funding to 
build a substantially larger reserve fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fund will grow in value from about two years of benefits 
currently to about four to five years of benefits.  To do this 
beginning this year we will start accelerating the pace of 
contribution rate increases beyond what is currently legislated 
so that people begin to cover the cost of their own benefits and 
stop passing increasing shortfalls on to the next generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPP contribution rates will increase in steps over the next six 
years until 2003, from the current legislated rate of 5.85 
percent to 9.9 percent of contributory earnings, and then will 
remain there steady. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This 9.9 percent rate is projected to be sufficient to sustain 
the CPP with no further rate increases.  It will pay for an 
individual's own benefits plus the unfunded liability.  It is the 
fairest way to honour our commitments.  The costs of pensions 
will be spread evenly and fairly across generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the combined contribution rate for employees will 
increase from 5.85 percent of covered earnings to 6 percent.  The 
increase for a worker at the average range will total no more 
than $24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all read the papers and watched the news so let me take 
this opportunity to address some of these erroneous headlines and 
some erroneous statements by some hon. members, some that I heard 
a few moments ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They claim that this is the biggest tax grab in history and that 
CPP rates will jump by 73 percent.  We hear it here and I would 
ask that the hon. members would come very soon to provide the 
accurate information Canadians are asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a tax grab.  Contributions to the Canada pension 
plan are a component of Canadians savings toward pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is difficult for members of the opposition to 
understand that.  They go into a separate fund, not government 
revenues, and because of recent changes the Canadian people have 
suggested will now be invested like other pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get the facts straight.  Contributions will rise 73 
percent over the next six years to 9.9 percent but they will not 
rise to the 14.2 percent that the chief actuary indicated would 
be necessary if we did not fix the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This 9.9 percent rate is also substantially lower than the 
Reform Party proposal to replace the CPP by a system of mandatory 
RRSPs. Under the Reform proposal, the next generation or two of 
Canadians would have to pay twice, once for their own pensions 
and again for pensions of those who are already retired.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, 9.9 percent is a real cost and no one denies it. By paying 
that cost now we will save ourselves and our children from 
larger, more expensive hikes in the future.  By moving now, 
premiums will not have to exceed 9.9 percent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the existing legislation CPP contribution rates are 
already slated to go beyond 9.9 percent.  They are scheduled to 
reach 10.1 percent in 2016. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief actuary has shown that if we do not move fast the CPP 
will be bankrupt in 2015 and the rates will have to soar to 14.2 
percent by 2030.  That is a 240 percent increase.  Only if we act 
responsibly now can we avoid bankruptcy and truly intolerable CPP 
rates later; a 73 percent increase now when a number of 
generations are sharing the burden or a 240 percent increase for 
our children's generation.  I submit that we have made the right 
choice.  Let us start paying our way.  We owe it to our children 
and we owe it to our grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that the problems we are facing with our 
pension system are not unique to Canada.  Many OECD countries are 
also making changes so that their pension systems are more 
sustainable.  Some international organizations have recommended 
moving toward the increased funding of public plans and that is 
exactly what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this new fuller funding approach the CPP fund will grow 
substantially over the next two decades.  A new investment policy 
therefore was necessary to improve the way CPP funds are invested 
and to secure the best possible return for plan members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up until now CPP contributions not needed to pay for benefits 
have been loaned mainly to the provinces at the federal 
government's interest rate on long term bonds.  In this 
legislation, CPP funds will now be invested in a diversified 
portfolio of securities, prudently and at arm's length from 
government. This means that CPP funds could be invested in 
stocks, in bonds, including provincial bonds, and also in 
mortgages.  Instead of being loaned in their entirety to the 
provinces, we are now in a position with the passing of this 
legislation to take our investment philosophy of the CPP and make 
it more market oriented.  It is consistent with investment 
policies in most public and private pension plans in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on prudent assumptions the CPP can secure an average long 
run return of almost 4 percent a year above the rate of 
inflation.  That compares with only 2.5 per cent assumed under the 
current policy by the chief actuary. These higher returns will be 
an important plus since members on this side of the House and on 
the other side clearly acknowledge that every dollar that is not 
earned in investment requires a contribution from Canadians.  The 
higher returns will be an important plus since we know that 
working Canadians want to ensure that they contribute to a plan 
that provides an effective and efficient rate of return and is 
sustainable in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the cross-Canada consultations Canadians told us they 
wanted the Canada pension plan to run like a private pension 
plan.  Accordingly, the fund will be managed independently from 
government by a 12 member investment board.  This investment 
board is accountable to Canadians and their governments through 
regular reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board will be subject to investment rules similar to other 
public and private funds in Canada.  Therefore the transparency 
for Canada pension plan of the future is that same transparency 
that is in private plans throughout the rest of Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign property limit for pension funds will strictly apply 
to the Canada pension plan, but there are some transitional 
issues that need to be addressed.  To ensure the fund's smooth 
entry into the market, all of the board's domestic equity 
investments will be selected passively, mirroring broad market 
indices.  This passive approach will be re-evaluated at the next 
Canada pension plan review scheduled to begin in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on—I am sure the members of the opposition will agree 
with this—whenever provincial governments borrow from the Canada 
pension plan they will pay the same rate of interest as they do 
on their market borrowings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a transitional measure reflecting historical arrangements, 
provinces will have the option of rolling over their existing CPP 
borrowings at maturity, and at market rates, for another 20-year 
term.  For the first three years provinces will also have access 
to 50 percent of the new CPP funds that the board chooses to 
invest in bonds.  But after this initial period new Canada 
pension plan funds offered to provinces at market rates will be 
in line with the proportion of provincial bonds held by pension 
funds in general.  This will ensure that the funds invested in 
provincial securities is consistent with market practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to moderate rising CPP costs we have tightened the 
administration of benefits and changed the way some benefits are 
calculated.  First, let me tell you what remains the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone currently receiving Canada pension plan benefits, be it 
retirement pensions, disability benefits, or survivor benefits, 
can rest assured that they will not see these benefits affected 
in any way.  All benefits, now and in the future, will remain 
fully indexed to inflation. The ages of early retirement, normal 
retirement, or late retirement all remain unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has changed?  Let me describe them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective January 1, 1998 retirement pensions will be based on 
the average of the year's maximum pensionable earnings in the 
last five years prior to starting the pension.  In the past they 
were based on a three-year average.  The amount of the pension 
will continue to be dependent on how much and for how long a 
person contributes to the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administration of disability benefits will be further 
improved.  The appeal process will be streamlined and the 
legislation will be applied more consistently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administration of disability benefits and the changes I have 
just proposed address concerns that have been raised about the 
rapidly escalating costs of the disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be eligible for disability benefits workers must show a 
greater attachment to the labour force.  They must have made CPP 
contributions in four of the last six years prior to becoming 
disabled.  At present a person needs to make as little as two CPP 
contributions during the course of the three years prior to 
applying and qualifying for disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the consultation there was discussion—and Canadians have 
provided guidance to the government—that disability benefits 
should be removed from the Canada pension plan.  That is not what 
Canadians have told their governments over the consultation 
period.  They have said the government must keep disability as a 
part of the Canada pension plan, but they did call for 
consistency across the board in the administration of disability 
benefits and that in fact is what this legislation is proposing.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When disability benefits are converted into retirement pensions 
at age 65 in the future, they will be based on the year's maximum 
pensionable earnings at the time of disablement with subsequent 
price indexing rather than on the YMPE at age 65.  This measure 
is consistent with how other CPP benefits are calculated and will 
apply only to people not yet age 65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules for combining the survivor and disability benefits and 
the survivor and retirement benefits will be largely the same as 
those in existence before 1987.  Changes will limit the extent to 
which these benefits can be added together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the CPP consultations and review there were 
discussions about eliminating the death benefit. The death 
benefit will continue to be equal to six months of retirement 
benefits, but up to a maximum of $2,500 rather than the current 
$3,580. The option to eliminate the death benefit was rejected by 
the federal and provincial governments. There are those who would 
purport to eliminate that benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened to Canadians, we ensured fairness and balance in the 
review of the Canada pension plan and the legislation that is 
being put forward.  I submit that the changes I have outlined 
propose moderate and balanced changes. We have minimized the 
impact of these changes on vulnerable Canadians. There is no one 
group that has been singled out or forced to shoulder an undue 
burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the national consultations on the CPP, Canadians told 
their governments to go easy on changes to the benefits.  There 
are those who would gut the benefits. That is not what Canadians 
have told us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reduced the contribution rate to 9.9 percent from 14.2 
percent.  There are those in the House who would argue that 9.9 
percent is too high. They are arguing in a vacuum.  The chief 
actuary who has the responsibility of reviewing the Canada 
pension plan has clearly stated that we need to act now to ensure 
that the plan remains sustainable and affordable for future 
generations.  We could sit back and do nothing and watch the 
premiums escalate as per the legislative timetable until we get 
to a point where we would experience a 240 percent increase. 
That is not tolerable.  That is certainly not what the government 
is prepared to do for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will ensure that the Canada pension plan is there for future 
generations, that it is there at an affordable premium and that 
the benefits are guaranteed for those future generations. The 
result is that some 75 percent of the reduction has been made on 
the financing side and only 25 percent is on the benefit side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite positive the members in this House are very aware 
that consultation on the Canada pension plan has been ongoing for 
well over a year.  Canadians have had input.  They have given 
guidance to the government on this legislation. They have said 
very clearly to fix the Canada pension plan, ensure that it is 
sustainable and ensure that you do not gut the benefits at all 
costs.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been done?  We have reflected on what Canadians have 
said. We have put forward legislation which breaks down like 
this:  75 percent is on the financing side and 25 percent is on 
the benefit side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also acting to improve the stewardship of the Canada 
pension plan and to enhance public accountability.  Once again 
Canadians have been consulted and Canadians have spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members across the way always talk about the transparency and 
the accountability that is required in legislation. I look 
forward to the interventions of the official opposition and other 
parties.  I hope they will point to the fact that this 
legislation had input from Canadians.  This legislation speaks to 
public accountability and transparency.  It is what Canadians 
have asked for and it is what Canadians are getting. Let me make 
it perfectly clear that members of the government are determined 
that the Canada pension plan will not be put at risk again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes in the legislation have been put forward so that 
Canadians do not have to suffer the uncertainty which has been 
purported by opposition members.  Canadians will not have to ask 
the question “Will the Canada pension plan be there for me?” 
The Canada pension plan will be there for members of the House, 
for young people, for young workers, for my children, for my 
children's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes reflect what Canadians have asked for.  We have not 
made those changes for the sake of making changes.  We have made 
them to sustain the plan to ensure it will be there for future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the accountability and transparency which will 
be part of the new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will start to receive regular statements on the 
pensions they are earning.  We intend to provide annual 
statements to all contributors as soon as it is feasible. 
Canadians will receive an annual statement which will show how 
the Canada pension plan is progressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal-provincial reviews will take place every three years, 
instead of every five.  In fact, 1999 will be the beginning of 
the next set of consultations and review.  The point of this 
change is to ensure that the Canada pension plan will be closely 
scrutinized.  Canadians will have an opportunity to continue to 
monitor what is going on with their Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan investment board will provide quarterly 
financial statements and annual reports on the performance of the 
fund.  I am sure that when the members of the official opposition 
speak they will point to this change and note that it is 
reflective of what Canadians have said and that it is a positive 
change.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say this slowly.  It is what Canadians have said.  The 
CPP investment board will provide quarterly financial statements. 
It will hold public meetings at least every two years in each 
participating province:  transparency and accountability. 
Members of the opposition, members of Parliament and Canadians at 
large will have opportunity to speak at those public meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Annual reports will provide a more complete information package 
and will explain how administrative problems are being addressed. 
As with all plans, public and private plans, there are always 
administrative challenges.  The annual report will list the 
challenge and state how the challenge is being dealt with:  again 
transparency and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians told us quite frankly to treat them like members of 
the pension plan.  There is no denying that in the past Canadians 
have not been part of the changes to the Canada pension plan the 
way they will be in the future.  We are doing exactly that.  We 
are treating Canadians like members of the pension plan.  The 
stewardship of the plan will be improved and public 
accountability will be strengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt Bill C-2 provides a strong and balanced 
package of changes that will restore the sustainability of the 
Canada pension plan and make it fairer and more affordable for 
future generations of Canadians.  It will make it more 
affordable, sustainable and fairer not just for workers when they 
retire but equally for working Canadians and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without diminishing what we have achieved with the legislation I 
would like to point out some other ideas the federal and 
provincial governments will look at to ensure the structure of 
the Canada pension plan keeps up with changing times.  It will 
evolve the way our society evolves.  These particular issues were 
either beyond the scope of the latest CPP statutory review, or 
they may have been raised too late or after consultations were 
complete.  It is our intention to examine these issues over the 
course of the next two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the issues?  It is important to get them on record so 
that Canadians know the consultation with respect to the CPP is 
just beginning and will be ongoing.  As issues come forward and 
develop the consultation and the input of Canadians will be 
reflected in future legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some issues are reviewing survivor benefits to make sure they 
reflect changing realities in the needs of today's families and 
considering the mandatory splitting of pension credits between 
spouses during marriage.  This is very interesting.  It looks at 
the work to retirement transition including the possibility of 
providing partial CPP pensions to Canadians wanting to make a 
gradual transition to retirement.  These issues are coming from 
Canadians, issues they want dealt with in the Canadian pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to examine the way in which people are 
receiving retirement income and employment insurance benefits. I 
am sure members of the official opposition will appreciate, given 
the fact that most of them are from the beautiful province of 
British Columbia, the review of the British Columbia proposal, 
which was actually made after the CPP consultations were 
complete.  The proposal is to extend CPP coverage up the income 
scale by raising the limit on pensionable earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize and hope for concurrence from the official 
opposition that any change to the Canada pension plan that needs 
to be considered will only be considered so that an increase in 
the steady rate of 9.9 percent will not be required.

will repeat this very slowly.  They will be fully funded.  It is 
what Canadians asked for and it is what we will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last February in the House of Commons the Minister of Finance 
tabled the first draft of the CPP legislation.  In response to 
the comments received, further refinements were made to the 
legislation and revised draft legislation was released in July 
for further comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures proposed in the bill today will become law once the 
legislation is passed by parliament and supporting orders in 
council are received from the provinces that are party to last 
February's agreement.  This will permit the changes to take 
effect on January 1, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important milestone for Canadians.  The changes to the 
plan will allow every Canadian to feel confident about the Canada 
pension plan once again.  I continue to repeat that because it is 
important for Canadians in the galleries, for Canadians watching 
on TV and for Canadians in our constituencies.  I encourage 
members of the House to communicate the message that the Canada 
pension plan is here and will be here when Canadians need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me assure hon. members the changes contained in Bill C-2 
tackle the problems facing the Canada pension plan.  In order to 
accomplish this, federal and provincial governments consulted 
extensively with Canadians from coast to coast to coast.  It is 
legislation that reflects what Canadians said during the 
consultations and it is legislation that will ensure the 
continuity of the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to add that the federal government is 
currently engaged in broad based dialogue with a number of groups 
on other aspects of Canada's retirement income system.  Not only 
are we listening to Canadians but we are also acting to ensure 
that our policy reflects their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the broad based dialogue, as I have been out 
talking with constituents in my riding and with Canadians right 
across the country the one message that continues to come back as 
a result of their experience with the broad based consultation on 
the Canada pension plan is that they want a broad based dialogue 
on the pillars of the retirement income system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They no longer want to see government reacting.  They want to 
see government engaging Canadians with respect to the retirement 
income system. They want to see governments reflecting in their 
legislation what Canadians are saying through a consultation 
process.  The first example is the Canada pension plan changes in 
Bill C-2 which is at second reading and will go to the Standing 
Committee on Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Securing Canada's retirement income system is a priority.  It is 
a priority for Canadians.  It is a priority for all members of 
the House.  It is a priority for members of the official 
opposition, members of other opposition parties and members of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our approach was different.  It was one where we consulted 
Canadians.  We are taking a very balanced approach to ensure we 
are not just gutting the benefits for the sake of trying to 
achieve some objective out there that is sometimes reflected in 
the House.  It is a priority of the government.

retirement income system remains at the top of the government's 
agenda.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to participate in the debate on Bill 
C-2, an act to establish the Canada pension plan investment board 
and to amend the Canada pension plan, the Old Age Security Act 
and other related acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by commending the parliamentary secretary on his speech 
and the finance department on the enormous amount of background 
information it provided to members on this subject.  It is a 
complex one and we appreciate the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased to hear the parliamentary secretary attach 
great value to public consultations, certainly something that we 
on this side of the House value.  To see a shift from pay as you 
go to a more fully funded plan is better late than never. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the parliamentary secretary raise a number of straw men 
that he proceeded to knock down, which is not that difficult to 
do.  He talked about people who wanted to gut the benefits to the 
plan.  We heard no one advocate gutting the benefits of the 
Canada pension plan or other pillars of the Canadian pension 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I suggest this setting up of straw men is simply a way 
of disguising or trying to mask some of the more real defects of 
the bill.  Those are the defects I would like to get into. Indeed 
it is the duty of the official opposition to point out these 
defects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out a fundamental defect in the bill which 
characterizes most of the legislation brought by the government 
to the House, that is the absence of an appropriate preamble and 
a declaration of the intent of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The absence of a declaration of intent, precisely what is the 
intent of parliament in passing such a bill if it does so, 
concerns me for two reasons.  The first is a legal reason.  Every 
time parliament passes any statute which does not within itself 
make crystal clear the intent of parliament, we surrender power 
from the legislation arm to the judicial arm.  This is something 
we ought not to do as a matter of principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason for stating our intent is much more profound 
and down to earth.  The bureaucrats who designed the bill, and 
perhaps the minister and parliamentary secretary themselves, will 
say that its principal intent is to establish and fund the Canada 
pension plan investment board.  However that is only the narrow, 
technical, bureaucratic intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real intent is or ought to be to care for Canadians in their 
retirement years, to provide adequate income for seniors as well 
as income for disabled persons.  The ultimate intent of the bill 
therefore is not fiscal or technical.  The ultimate intent is 
social and humane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind other hon. members, as we get into the technical 
details of investment boards fiduciary responsibilities, rates of 
return, contribution rates and pensionable earnings, to keep 
upper most in their minds the people for whom CPP is intended. To 
help me do this I have written on my pad—and I urge other 
members to do it—a few names of people whose lives will be 
profoundly affected by how the pension system is organized and to 
keep them in front of us as we debate the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of people, for example, among my own relatives and 
certainly in my own riding which has a higher percentage of 
seniors than any other riding in Calgary for whom CPP and the old 
age security is their principal source of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the bill I am reminded that we are dealing with 
the principal source of income of people who are no longer in a 
position to add to their income.  All of us know of middle aged 
and elderly women who invested most of their lives in raising 
children in the home and who entered the so-called official 
workplace, as if the home were not a workplace, late in life or 
not at all and therefore qualify for little or no CPP benefits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the government says it addresses their needs through the 
seniors benefit but we all know this is often too little too 
late.  We should keep the needs of these women uppermost as we 
consider pension reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us have young people in our family—I have five 
children—who are working if they are fortunate enough to find 
work.  Often they are working as hard as they possibly can. We 
know the skepticism with which young people view the Canada 
pension plan.  They do not believe the minister's assurance that 
the contribution rates will be kept below 10 percent.  They do 
not believe there will be a meaningful government pension for 
them at the end of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent book entitled <I>Youthquake</I> by an up and coming young 
Canadian, Ezra Levant, cites a survey that shows over 30 percent 
of Canadians under 39 years of age do not believe they will 
receive a Canada pension plan pension at all despite the 
assurances from the government and from politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition these young people do not consider $8,800 a year a 
meaningful pension when investment of the same contributions in 
an RRSP over the same period of time would give them a pension of 
$24,000 a year. They fear that the reform of the CPP is just 
another huge intergenerational transfer of wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest we write down on our pads the names of some of those 
young people and keep their concerns in mind when we analyse and 
review this bill. Let each of us also write down the names of 
several disabled persons in our families and constituencies who 
are absolutely dependent in many cases on the disability income 
provisions of CPP.  Let us keep those people in mind as we debate 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have made my point that the ultimate intent of the 
bill before us though regrettably not stated is to care for 
people and to provide income to allow people to care for 
themselves.  The technical parts of the bill, essential as they 
are, are simply a means to that end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to another aspect of the bill, one of the most 
important ones and one of the ones completely neglected by the 
parliamentary secretary in his presentation.  I am surprised that 
the finance department let the parliamentary secretary get away 
with this omission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill is adopted and if we accept even half of the 
minister's glowing predictions of its effects, there is no 
question it will distribute substantial benefits to Canadians. 
Those benefits and the impact of this bill upon them are listed 
in the CPP legislation briefing book issued on September 25, 1997 
and I need not enumerate them here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the official opposition it is our duty to hold the government 
accountable for effects of its legislation which it may wish to 
ignore, or which it may wish the public to ignore because those 
effects are negative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly I find it astounding that a government which has said 
that its number one priority is jobs is putting forward a bill 
that affects the paycheques of most employees in this country and 
affects the payrolls of most employers in this country and has 
not offered a single substantive word on the real employment 
effects of the payroll tax hike required to fund the CPP 
investment board established by this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the government's view on this subject has changed since 
it was in opposition.  It has been repeated in the briefing book 
and was repeated by the parliamentary secretary this morning. I 
want to read it because it is amusing, that “CPP contributions 
are savings toward pensions.  They are not a tax. They do not go 
into the government's revenues to be spent”. The official 
opposition and most important most Canadians reject this view on 
three principal grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First it is completely inconsistent with the previously stated 
position of the Liberal Party itself. When the Tory government 
raised CPP premiums six times from 3.6 percent to 5 percent over 
the period 1987 to 1993, the Liberals then in opposition labelled 
these increases as tax hikes. It cannot be said that CPP premium 
increases are a tax increase when Tories do it but not when 
Liberals do it.  This is politically motivated nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second the government's position that CPP contributions are not 
payroll taxes is completely inconsistent with the views of the 
employers and employees who make the CPP contributions.  Unions, 
business organizations like the CFIB, in their discussions and 
representations to governments, finance committees and to members 
of the House, routinely refer to CPP contributions as payroll 
taxes.  If the people who are making these payments feel it is a 
tax, then it is a tax and should be regarded by this House as a 
tax, regardless of what government officials or its press 
officials now choose to call it.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third the government's view that the 77 percent hike in CPP premiums 
proposed to fund the CPP investment fund is not a tax is flatly 
contradicted by previously published reports of the government 
itself, including the finance department and its advisers. Let me 
just read into the record some statements by government officials 
talking about what the CPP premium contributions are: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joe Italiano of the economic analysis and forecasting division 
of the Department of Finance in a paper dated April 25, 1995: 
“Employer's contributions to CPP/QPP are part of compulsory 
payroll taxes.  The share of all such taxes in voluntary labour 
income, a term which can be interpreted as an effective payroll 
tax rate” and he goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 a study was done by Lin, Picot and Beach.  Beach is a 
professor of economics at Queen's University; Picot and Lin are 
with the business and labour market analysis division of 
Statistics Canada.  The study states: “Payroll taxes have four 
major components:  UI premiums; workers compensation premiums; 
the provincial health and post-secondary education tax; and 
CPP/QPP premiums”. Statistics Canada provides all the background 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another study by Department of Finance officials Lori 
Marchildon, Tim Sargent and Joe Ruggeri in March 1996 classified 
CPP premiums as payroll taxes and found that employer payroll 
taxes invariably lead to a rise in the employer's labour costs in 
the short run and a reduction in employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an article by Jack Mintz, chairman of the government's 
own technical committee on business taxation, Clifford Clark, 
visiting economist at the Department of Finance, and Mr. Chen of 
the University of Toronto, another economist.  They write that 
the federal unemployment insurance and Canada pension plan 
payroll taxes are applied on businesses and individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jonathan Kesselman, professor of Economics at the University of 
British Columbia, in the <I>Canadian Tax Journal</I> in 1996, a 
journal which is often quoted by the Minister of Finance in the 
House writes that “the distinguishing trait of all payroll taxes 
is that they apply to a base of labour earnings only”. Kesselman 
goes on to write that “Canada has perhaps the most diverse range 
of payroll taxes of any country. At the national level there are 
benefit linked contributions to social security in programs of 
unemployment insurance and the Canada pension plan”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, in the opinion of people who advise the 
Department of Finance, this is a tax hike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase in CPP premiums from 5.6 percent in 1996 to 9.9 
percent in the year 2003 is not only a tax hike, it is a tax hike 
of monumental proportions, the biggest single tax hike in 
Canada's history. The maximum employee contribution will rise 
from $893.20 in 1996 to $1,635 in the year 2003, an increase of 
$741.80 a year or 83 per cent.  A person who started working and 
contributing to CPP in 1996 at age 20 and continues to work until 
age 65 earning the average industrial wage which we assume to 
grow at 2 percent per year before inflation, will pay out 
$119,193 in CPP premiums over their lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover in its own documents the government admits that there 
can never be absolute guarantees that the 9.9 percent rate is the 
highest the rate will ever go.  Members will recall back in the 
1960s and 1970s when this plan was put together, Liberal 
politicians stood in front of public audiences and swore that the 
contribution rates would never go over 5 percent.  Of what value 
were those commitments?  They were not worth the powder to blow 
them up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP increase represents a tax hike, to put it in other 
terms, of $400 million in 1997, $900 million in 1998, $1.8 
billion in 1999, $5 billion in 2001, and as much as $10 billion 
by the year 2005, all in constant 1997 dollars.  The CPP premium 
increases are unquestionably a payroll tax hike.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all the bad news.  What is the principal negative 
effect of payroll tax increases?  They kill jobs.  This is not 
simply the view of the Reform Party.  This is not simply the view 
of business people and workers, although that should be 
sufficient for the government to take heed.  This is also the 
view of the Department of Finance and its advisers. Let me read 
into the record some of the evidence of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After discussing increases in CPP contribution rates, Joe 
Italiano whom I quoted a few moments ago wrote these words: 
“These increases have had and will continue to have a negative 
impact on the labour force.  By 1993”—he was writing just 
before that period—“the rise in contributions by employers and 
employees had reduced employment and the participation rate in 
the economy by nearly 26,000 jobs and .12 percentage points 
respectively”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1996 Department of Finance study by Marchildon, Sargent and 
Ruggeri classified CPP premiums as payroll taxes and found that 
“employer payroll taxes invariably lead to a rise in employer's 
labour costs in the short run and a reduction in employment”. 
The authors go on to state that employers will bear from 50 
percent to as much as 100 percent of the tax, which implies a 
direct reduction in employment as a result of the payroll tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the Department of Finance paper entitled “Explaining 
the Jobless Recovery” by Cozier and Mang which was produced 
within the economic studies and policy analysis division. The 
authors found that the main cause of the jobless recovery has 
been excessively high wage growth.  They continued by saying that 
large increases in payroll taxes, like UI premiums, CPP and QPP 
contributed to escalating labour costs over this period. Cozier 
and Mang wrote that payroll tax increases would therefore have 
lowered cumulative employment growth over the recovery by just 
under one percentage point.  This represents just over 100,000 
jobs that would have been created if payroll taxes had not been 
increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to bore the House but let me quote one more 
Department of Finance economist.  F. Weldon from the economic 
studies and policy analysis division of the department wrote this 
in “The Rising Burden of Payroll Taxes in Canada” in 1993: 
“The long run effect of a one percentage point increase in the 
effective rate of payroll taxes is estimated to be a decline of 
nearly 1 percent in employment”.  A 1 percent decline in 
employment represents 140,000 jobs. Weldon wrote “These payroll 
tax increases can have a sizeable and permanent negative impact 
on the level of employment in the Canadian economy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how much evidence the Department of Finance needs 
from its own officials to establish the connection that payroll 
taxes kill jobs and they kill them by the thousands.  If this 
finance department official has found that a one percentage point 
increase in payroll taxes reduces employment by 1 percent which 
in current terms is about 140,000 jobs, how many jobs will be 
killed when total premiums are increased 4.1 percentage points? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance has access to econometric models of 
the Canadian economy that enable it to predict the employment 
effects of bills like this one and payroll tax increases.  We 
insist that the finance department conduct those computer runs if 
it has not done so and that the minister table those results in 
the House so that members will know how many jobs are being 
killed by the payroll tax hike required to finance the provisions 
of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn to another fundamental question raised by the bill before 
us, one I do not believe the government has answered correctly. 
It has to do with the subject of ultimate accountability.  I do 
not know where the parliamentary secretary gets the nerve to 
think he could get away with this.  Perhaps he could get away 
with it in this House but certainly not in front of any financial 
audience or any audience of pensioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He lists off the things that are supposed to prove the 
accountability of the Canada pension plan investment board.  What 
does he list?  They are going to make regular reports. They are 
going to issue quarterly financial statements.  They are going to 
issue annual statements. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are simple things that are taken for granted by anyone who 
is part of a private pension plan.  A pension plan cannot be 
operated without meeting these minimal requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary is trying to make a silk purse out 
of a sow's ear if he thinks these things illustrate some profound 
level of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Bill C-2 do?  It establishes a corporation to be known 
as the CPP investment board.  The shares of the corporation are 
to be issued to the Minister of Finance, to be held on behalf of 
the crown by the Minister of Finance.  The corporation is to be 
managed by a board of 12 directors to be appointed by the federal 
government on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, who 
in turn is to be advised on these appointments by a committee of 
representatives to be designated by provincial finance ministers, 
whose primary interest in this whole scheme is not pensions but 
access to the capital to be managed by the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the characteristics and qualifications of these 
directors, the bill only specifies that they be representatives 
of various regions of Canada and have proven financial ability or 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a crown corporation, the shares of which are held by the 
government, run by directors appointed by the federal government 
and acceptable to provincial governments, which will be managing 
up to $130 billion of investment capital within 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question which needs to be asked, which was not answered by 
the parliamentary secretary, is to whom does the money invested 
and managed by this corporation really belong. It does not belong 
to the governments, although in the past they acted like it did. 
The federal government was lending the funds in the CPP back to 
the provinces at less than market rates.  That is one of the 
reasons the fund is in trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money to be managed by the corporation established by the 
bill belongs to the workers and future pensioners of Canada who 
are putting up the money.  If it belongs to the working people of 
Canada, who will also be the recipients of the CPP when they 
retire, we want to know what provision the minister intends to 
make to ensure that employee interest, employer interest and 
seniors interest are adequately represented on the board. How is 
the corporation to be accountable?  By what mechanisms? What 
criteria are taken into account in the appointment of its 
directors? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is their money.  The bill should make it clear, which it does 
not, that the funds to be received and managed by the corporation 
are to be held and managed in trust for the workers and 
pensioners of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last point concerns an alternative framework for pension 
reform. We have numerous points to make with respect to the 
defects of the bill.  We also have a number of proposals to make 
for improving the retirement income prospects of Canadians beyond 
reliance on the CPP.  These proposals also come from extensive 
consultation, long before the government even recognized that 
this was an issue.  We trust that the government will be open to 
these ideas, as it says it is open to ideas, particularly if they 
bear the stamp of extensive public consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these points will be made by my colleagues, in 
particular the hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill.  However, 
allow me to conclude by providing a framework for pension reform 
which is broader, deeper and more future oriented than what we 
find in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government refers in its briefing notes, as did the 
parliamentary secretary this morning, to the three pillar 
retirement income system which it seeks to preserve and enhance. 
The three pillars which the government sees are the Canada 
pension plan, the old age security and guaranteed income 
supplement, which will be replaced by the seniors benefit, and 
the registered retirement savings plan provision for tax assisted 
private savings.  The government claims to be strengthening these 
three pillars by this and upcoming legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What many Canadians see is the following. First, they see an 
erosion, not a strengthening, of the OAS/GIS senior benefit 
system by government tax policies that claw back an increasing 
proportion of seniors income. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT14"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT14"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1205

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate, the seniors benefit will go into effect on 
January 1, 2001.  Current pensioners could have $2,000 per year 
less in after tax income due to the elimination of the age and 
retirement income credits.  Pension experts at William Mercer 
Ltd. estimate that the seniors benefit will raise the average tax 
bill of a retiree by $3,000 to $7,000 a year and increase their 
tax rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government proposes with respect to the seniors benefit 
is not a strengthening of that pillar.  It is a chipping away at 
the bottom by tax increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the public sees an erosion of the RRSP system by recent 
changes in government tax policy that restrict rather than expand 
the RRSP system.  In the 1995 budget it reduced the RRSP limits. 
It reduced the RRSP over contribution allowances.  It phased out 
retirement allowance rollovers and, incidentally, collected about 
$160 million from seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1996 budget it froze the RRSP contribution levels.  It 
eliminated the seven year limit on carrying forward unused RRSP 
room.  It reduced the age limit for maturing RPPs, RRSPs and 
BPSPs.  It eliminated the deductions of RRSP and RRIF 
admidistration fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not strengthening the RRSP pillar of retirement income. 
This is chipping away at the bottom, again by the insatiable 
appetite for tax revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, the public sees the government attempting to shore up the 
Canada pension plan, not by pension reform that better 
distributes the burden of retirement income across these three 
pillars but by the simple expedient of a massive increase in CPP 
premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Reform would like to propose to the House is the following. 
I submit this is a better, broader and a more far sighted 
framework for pension reform than anything we heard this morning. 
What we propose, first of all, is to add a fourth pillar to the 
retirement income system and a better distribution of the burden 
of retirement income across those four pillars.  The fourth 
pillar we propose is broad based tax relief such as proposed in 
our 1997 federal election fresh start platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through a combination of personal income tax relief measures, 
increases in personal and spousal exemptions, changes to the 
child care tax benefits, reductions in EI premiums, surtaxes and 
capital gains taxes, we can take about 1.3 million Canadians off 
the federal tax rolls altogether, including 300,000 seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very simple idea that we can help people's retirement 
income by simply leaving more money in their pockets when they 
retire.  We propose tax relief, in particular tax relief for low 
income seniors, as the fourth pillar of retirement income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We further propose the achievement of a better balance for the 
provision of retirement income between the Canada pension plan, 
RRSPs and the seniors benefit by means of the following pension 
and tax reforms.  There are five of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, a fairer targeting of the proposed seniors benefit to 
those most in need, with more generous RRSP provisions for middle 
and higher income pensioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a guarantee to existing seniors with respect to CPP that 
every Canadian currently age 60 or above receives all the 
benefits to which he or she is entitled under the Canada pension 
plan.  Surely the government cannot disagree with that, as it is 
moving in the same direction as what it proposed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, an improved survivor benefit.  Currently the CPP provides 
only a small pension for surviving spouses of CPP contributors. 
The maximum pension entitlement of a surviving spouse is 60 
percent of the pension entitlement of the deceased spouse.  The 
maximum monthly payment in 1996 was $436.25.  To lessen poverty 
among surviving spouses, particularly elderly widows, 100 percent 
of the funds in the deceased individual's RRSP should be 
transferable to a surviving spouse tax free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the government claims to be looking at international 
experience with respect to moving toward more funded pension 
plans. Let it look at some of the more far reaching international 
experience and start looking at super RRSPs.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform proposes shifting younger and middle aged workers on to 
an expanded RRSP program with compulsory contributions like CPP 
which will provide higher benefits at lower cost than the Canada 
pension plan while maintaining intergenerational fairness.  These 
super RRSPs would be mandatory.  Individual RRSPs would be funded 
by means of employee and employer payroll deductions.  Super 
RRSPs would supplement rather than replace the existing system of 
optional RRSPs.  The savings in each Canadian super RRSP would be 
individually invested, managed by government approved financial 
institutions and would be the property of that Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an idea that is being explored elsewhere.  Why the 
government is blind to it we cannot understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, transition mechanisms are required to ensure that working 
age Canadians receive pension benefits at par with those promised 
by the CPP.  This can be done by a combination of existing CPP 
entitlements and new super RRSP benefits, the exact mechanisms to 
be determined by actuarial professionals and consultations with 
stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members opposite and the Department of Finance misses 
everything we have said today, get this one point. It is our 
intention that the combination of these four pillars, a reformed 
Canada pension plan, a targeted seniors benefit, an expanded RRSP 
system and tax relief, will deliver more retirement income for 
Canadians per dollar invested than the three pillar system 
proposed by the government, of which this bill is a part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If our real concern is to care for Canadians in their 
retirement, or more correctly to provide the income to permit 
more Canadians to care for themselves in their retirement, I urge 
hon. members to consider these alternatives to the government's 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, I urge non. members to support the following 
reasoned amendment: I move: 
<A NAME="LINK7">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That all the words after the word “that” be deleted and the 
following substituted therefor: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-2, an act to 
establish the Canada pension plan investment board and to amend 
the Canada pension plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts since the principle of the 
bill, while attempting to address the failures of the Canada 
pension plan, is particularly unfair to young Canadians and fails 
to recognize the employment impacts of the CPP premium increases. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair is satisfied that the amendment 
by the hon. Leader of the Opposition is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, for my clarification, could 
the Speaker advise the House whether a motion which says “to 
decline” or a motion not to do something is in order.  That 
would be the vote, would it not? I ask the Chair to clarify 
whether this is a negative motion and technically if it is in 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair has ruled that the amendment is 
in order.  It appears to be a reasoned amendment. It is giving 
reasons why the House would not proceed with the Bill. 
Accordingly, the Chair is satisfied that the amendment is in 
order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we are 
debating here this morning is the reform of the Canada Pension Plan. On 
September 25, the Minister of Finance tabled Bill C-2 dealing with the 
Canada Pension Plan reform, among other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reform has three main components. First, fuller funding. As 
you know, this is the amount that must remain available to meet 
commitments to those who are entitled to benefits. At present, there is 
enough money in the fund for two years. The minister's proposal is to 
increase this period to five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also proposed the establishment of the Canada Pension 
Plan Investment Board to increase the plan's rate of return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the minister proposed stricter eligibility criteria, 
particularly in the case of disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must point out right now that, on the whole, the Bloc Quebecois 
agrees with the general principles of this reform. However, we have a 
number of concerns that I will address shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking back, we will remember that a draft bill was presented in 
February 1997. This bill was followed by a revised bill, which was 
presented last July. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the changes put forward by the federal government have 
been well received by at least two thirds of the provinces representing 
two thirds of the Canadian population. 
All in all, eight provinces, including Quebec, have endorsed the 
proposed changes. To date, only British Columbia and Saskatchewan have 
not given their approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, these changes, this new set of measures will not take 
effect, first, until Parliament passes the legislation, and second, 
until the necessary orders are approved by two thirds of the provinces 
representing two thirds of the Canadian population. We understand that 
the government plans for the new measures to be in place by January 
1998, if everything goes well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you a brief overview of the current status of the 
Canada Pension Plan. 
As we know, it was absolutely necessary to review some aspects of the 
plan, since it had become unsustainable. At the rate things were going, 
there would have been no money left in the fund by the year 2015, at 
which time contribution rates to the Canada Pension Plan would have had 
to be raised from 6 percent to 14 percent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to be noted that Quebec, which has had its own plan for a few 
decades, would also have had to increase its rate from 6 percent to 13 percent. 
Indeed, the Quebec Pension Plan is also under review for the same 
reasons, even though it is in better financial shape than the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the reform we are talking about today in this House 
concern Quebeckers only in an indirect way. However, the Quebec and 
Canadian governments have always harmonized the main elements of the two 
plans, primarily because of a common desire to accommodate those who 
have contributed to both plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, some 1.73 million people have contributed to both 
plans during their career. By harmonizing their contribution rates, the 
two governments are also acting responsibly from an economic point of 
view. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT17"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT17"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1220

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment and explain, for the benefit of those 
Quebeckers who are listening to us, what is going on in Quebec and show 
how it relates to what we are discussing here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that the Quebec Pension Plan would fulfil its role, which 
is to pay benefits, the Quebec government tabled Bill 149 dealing with 
the Quebec Pension Plan and amending various legislative provisions. The 
bill went through second reading in June and should pass third reading 
soon after the National Assembly reconvenes for a new session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the CPP reform concerns Canadians more than 
Quebeckers. 
In fact, less than half of 1 percent of residents of Quebec receive CPP 
benefits.  Last August, the number was 12,882 people.  Those Quebeckers 
receiving CPP benefits are individuals residing in Quebec who have 
worked all their lives in another province and who, accordingly, have 
contributed only to the CPP.  An example would be a resident of Hull who 
had worked all his or her life here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example would be members of the Canadian Armed Forces and 
of the RCMP who live in Quebec but must still contribute to the CPP. 
To the extent that these people have contributed only to the CPP, they 
receive CPP benefits, even though they live in Quebec.  Finally, there 
are those people receiving CPP benefits who then move to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious, therefore, that the CPP must be able to meet its 
obligations to the Canadian public.  I would take this opportunity to 
point out, however, that more than a new bill is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A plan, once in place, relies on the tools at its disposal, and 
nowadays the tools take the form of computers and, more broadly 
speaking, computer systems. 
It is known that the CPP falls short in certain areas that have been 
criticized by the Auditor General and that we hope will soon be 
corrected, because it is a very large drain on the system not to be able 
to operate at peak efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that the plan itself seems to be having 
trouble changing over to more efficient computer systems:  $350 billion 
has already been spent on this and there is still a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that the Auditor General found a certain 
lack of rigour in the administration of the disability plan. 
The fact is that at the present time, the Canada Pension Plan does not 
do regular evaluations to ensure that people receiving disability 
benefits are still entitled to them, so that costs have spiralled 
dramatically in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to consider another aspect of the bill put before us 
by the minister. This legislation would establish the Canada Pension 
Plan Investment Board. As you may have noticed, and I suppose everybody 
in this House has, it was largely inspired by the Caisse de dépôt et 
placement du Québec. However, unlike the Caisse, the federal board will 
have no economic mandate, only a mandate to obtain the best possible 
rate of return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to expand somewhat on this difference, because it 
intrigues and almost worries me. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT18"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT18"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that in Quebec the Caisse has been an unqualified success 
as an economic development tool for Quebeckers. To a certain extent, I 
can only congratulate the Minister of Finance for taking his inspiration 
from a tried and true Quebec formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we all agree that sometimes it is nice to see others trying 
to emulate our own success, but I also understand why the Minister of 
Finance did not want to go beyond a simple mandate of getting the best 
possible rate of return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, across this country, there are regions that sometimes 
feel neglected when they do not get the same investments or attention 
given other regions. I think the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board 
could be in trouble if some of its investments went to certain regions 
rather than others. The problem would become a political football in no 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, Quebec does not have to worry because it has set up 
its own system for contributing effectively toward its economic 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a few words about the government's reform 
objectives. Briefly, the government wants to make the system viable, 
affordable and equitable. First of all, the system's viability must be 
ensured for future generations. 
In fact, the objective is to guarantee that seniors and future 
generations will continue to enjoy their retirement benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also strike a balance between contributing generations 
by quickly establishing a stable long term contribution rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, levels of contribution must parallel the growth of 
the economy, because we certainly need that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those watching in Quebec, I would like to 
make a few cursory comparisons between the proposed reform of the 
Canada Pension Plan and that of the Quebec Pension Plan.  There are 
similarities and there are differences.  Let us look first at the 
similarities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contribution rates will rise rapidly.  They will rise over the 
next six years, peaking at 9.9 percent in 2003. 
They will then remain stable.  This is exactly what Quebec intends 
to do.  In both cases, plan viability is what counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is the new policy on Canada Pension Plan 
investments.  As I mentioned a few moments ago, certain features of 
the investment board were taken from the Caisse de dépôt et 
placement du Québec.  I repeat: Quebec is happy to have provided 
the example for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan is also periodically reviewed.  The federal-provincial examination 
will be conducted every three years rather 
than every five.  That is a good thing.  It will mean no loss of 
control over changes to the plan and permit adjustments should 
problems or unforeseen circumstances arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also note the basic exemption under which no 
premiums will be collected on the first $3,500 in earnings.  This 
will remain unchanged in both Canada and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting in 1998, the pensions of the newly retired will be 
calculated on the average of five years' rather than three years' 
maximum pensionable income.  This represents a slight reduction for 
new recipients, because the average over five years, generally 
speaking, will be slightly less than that calculated over three 
years. It must be said, however, that Quebec too is intending to do 
likewise for the same reasons of good management.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to be noted that neither current beneficiaries—that is 
those who are collecting a survivor's pension, a disability pension or 
combined benefits—nor those people aged 65 or more on December 31, 
1997, will be affected by the proposed changes. These changes will only 
come into effect on January 1, 1998. Benefits will not change for those 
who are currently collecting a pension and those who will start doing so 
before the end of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All CPP benefits will remain fully indexed, as will QPP benefits. 
Retirement age, which is normally 65 but can be earlier at 60 or later 
at 70, will remain unchanged under the Canada Pension Plan and the 
Quebec Pension Plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP fund, which currently has the equivalent of two years of 
contributions, will now have a reserve equivalent to five years of 
contributions. Quebec will make the same change to ensure the 
sustainability of its plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New rules of calculation will apply to combined benefits for those 
who are collecting both a disability and a survivor's pension, or 
retirement benefits and a survivor's pension. When these rules are 
tabled, a thorough review will have to be made to avoid any injustices. 
I can assure you that the Bloc Quebecois will pay close attention to 
this all important consideration for those affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not everything is the same between what is being proposed by the 
finance minister and what the Quebec government intends to do: there are 
differences too, which I will now discuss. First, let us take a look at 
the death benefit. What is a death benefit? It is a lump sum payment to 
help the close ones of a deceased contributor to pay for part of the 
funeral costs. The benefit is payable for any worker who contributed for 
at least one third of his or her contributory period, the minimum being 
three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the current system provides a death benefit equivalent 
to six times the monthly retirement benefit, up to a maximum of $3,540 
in 1996. The federal plan is currently identical to the QPP in that 
respect. The new program which Quebec intends to implement as of next 
year will provide for a standard amount of $2,500, regardless of the 
contributor. 
This amount will be indexed. In the system proposed by the Minister of 
Finance, under the Canada Pension Plan, the death benefit will be equal 
to six times the monthly retirement benefit, with the maximum being set 
at $2,500 a year instead of $3,540. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, there is a difference. First, the Quebec Pension 
Plan will be more generous than the Canada Pension Plan because the fact 
is that funeral benefits are the same for all workers, regardless of how 
long they have lived. The Quebec Pension Plan recognizes this reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second difference concerns disability benefits. The federal 
government is experiencing many difficulties in implementing its 
disability benefit. 
Last year, the auditor general sharply criticized the federal government 
for the uncalled for—and I would say exorbitant—increase in the 
cost of disability benefits, an increase caused mainly by regulations 
that are too lax and a follow-up, let us face it, that is non-existent. 
Indeed, as I like to say, when the auditor testified before the 
committee, he mentioned the Quebec Pension Plan as an example to follow.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, the federal disability benefit system is overspending. 
This is due to lax administration, whereby the federal government 
considers more people eligible for a longer period because there is no 
periodical reassessment of the need for these benefits to be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the proposed changes to the disability pension under the 
plan laid before this House by the finance minister, the federal 
government intends to repeal the federal directive providing for any 
person to be declared disabled if unable to perform his or her own job 
even if he or she could perform another job, thereby making the 
administration of the plan much stricter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another difference. Current federal requirements for 
disability benefits limit eligibility to those who have contributed to 
the plan for two of the past three years or for five of the past ten 
past years. 
The federal government, according to what the Minister of Finance 
proposes, intends to limit eligibility to those who have contributed for 
four out of the last six years, which should reduce eligibility 
considerably.  In Quebec, those who have contributed for two out of the 
last three years, or five out of the last ten years, or for half of the 
contribution period, are eligible for disability benefits.  This makes 
allowance for progressive diseases, which is very important. The 
Government of Quebec will therefore recognize, and quite rightly, a 
proportionately higher number of disabled people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another rather complicated difference.  It has to do with 
the way in which the Canada and Quebec pension plans are calculated. 
The difference is complex, as is the calculation. 
The Bloc Quebecois intends to keep an eye on this issue to ensure that 
every citizen is treated fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois is in agreement with the general 
objective of the reform, which is to preserve the viability of a public 
pension plan.  This reform will ensure that future generations will also 
have access to a public pension plan.  However, the Bloc Quebecois 
demands—I repeat, demands—that administration of the CPP be rapidly 
modernized in order to meet the harsh criticism recently formulated by 
the auditor general with respect to this plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will also ensure that the government's proposed 
reform does not depart from the principles of social justice so dear to 
all Canadians and all Quebeckers.

to say a few words on the bill before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are beginning a debate on our pension policies and where we 
should be going.  Bill C-2 is the first of two bills to come 
before the House.  Bill C-2 deals with the increase in premiums 
to the Canada pension plan and the reduction in benefits to the

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second bill that will come before the House very shortly 
will be on seniors benefits.  This bill will abolish the current 
old age security pension, the guaranteed income supplement, the 
tax credit for pensioners and the age benefit.  When the 
government abolishes that it will instead introduce a seniors 
benefit.  I believe that will be very controversial legislation 
which will create a lot of interest right across the country. 
Part of the major debate that will go on in part two will be 
public pensions versus private pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin today be giving a bit of the history of the 
Canada pension plan as we know it today.  It was passed into law 
in 1966.  Nine provinces are part of the Canada pension plan, 
while in Quebec has the Quebec pension plan which is very similar 
to the CPP.  It is the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan is a pay as you go plan.  It is a 
defined benefit plan and pays out around $17 billion per year in 
benefits to Canadians, including the pension benefits, survivors 
benefits and disability benefits.  The plan has reserves of about 
two years of funds which is around $40 billion. That $40 billion 
is, in large part, lent to the provinces at interest rates that 
are lower than they can achieve elsewhere for infrastructure, 
such as the building of schools, hospitals and universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan pays out a fully indexed pension to people 65 years and 
older.  It provides survivor benefits, death benefits and 
disability benefits to people who are unable to work.  It has 
also been a highly successful plan in meeting the objectives of 
1966.  If we look at seniors poverty in this country we will find 
that there are a lot fewer people living in poverty today than 
there were 30 years ago.  In 1960 some 33.6 percent of seniors 
were living below the poverty line.  In 1995 some 10.9 percent of 
seniors were living below the poverty line.  When one compares 
that to any other category of Canadians, that is a very 
significant accomplishment over the last 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have figures for poverty for the Canadian population 
in general or of child poverty or for other categories, but for 
seniors that has been a remarkable accomplishment over the last 
30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole philosophy behind the Canada pension plan is that it 
is a social program.  Its purpose is to divert a share of the 
national economic output toward retired people each and every 
year so people can retire with dignity.  At the inception of the 
plan in 1966 and even today there are many people who do not have 
adequate private pension plans through an RRSP that they build up 
for themselves.  Their sole means of income, outside of the old 
age security pension or the GIS is the Canada pension plan. 
Therefore, the main philosophy behind the CPP is to divert part 
of today's national economic output into a decent retirement fund 
for people when they retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very similar to diverting a share of our national income 
to fund medical care in Canada, to make sure that regardless of 
one's financial means, we have universal accessibility to decent 
health care.  It is similar to diverting a share of our national 
income toward education to ensure that we have an educated 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize this, it is diverting a share of our output toward 
the common good, to try to equalize the opportunities of 
condition in Canada, to try to have a more equal society where 
people do not have to worry about such fundamental needs as food, 
clothing, shelter and medical care.  That is basically the 
philosophy behind the plan.  That is why our party over the years 
has been a very strong supporter of the Canada pension plan, the 
Quebec pension plan and public pension plans in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now into a debate on private pension plans versus public 
pension plans.  We are very much in favour of public pension 
plans as is the NDP government in Saskatchewan and British 
Columbia, the trade union movement and progressive people right 
across the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side are the supporters of private pension plans. 
Here we find the old allies, the Fraser Institute, the C.D. Howe 
Institute, the Canadian Taxpayers Association and of course their 
mouthpiece in Parliament, the Reform Party.  These are people who 
would like to abolish altogether the Canada pension plan and 
replace it with sort of a super RRSP plan which would be a 
defined contribution plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ultimate end of this would be to widen the gap between the 
rich and the poor, much of which would be done through tax funded 
support. RRSPs as tax write-off are a tremendous tax expenditure 
for the government.  RRSPs cost Canadian taxpayers about $17 
billion in tax expenditures and the CPP benefits also cost about 
$17 billion. There is equilibrium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But under a totally private plan or the Reform Party private 
plan or the Fraser Institute plan the tax expenditures would 
escalate.  People who are wealthy could take the greatest 
advantage of this.  It would be sort of a Robin Hood in reverse 
where the poor are giving to the rich so that the rich can retire 
in comfort in condos in Florida and elsewhere around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 moves us partially toward a private plan.  It is really 
a transition toward a partially vested plan.  It also has in it 
the privatization of the administration of the plan. I want to 
look at a few details of that this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, one of the major concerns I have about the changes to the 
Canada pension plan is the whole issue of premiums. Premiums will 
increase 73 percent over the next six years. The combined 
employer-employee premiums will increase from today's 5.85 
percent of insurable earnings up to 9.9 percent, an increase of 
some 73 percent in six years.  The maximum contribution will go 
from $975 to about $1,635. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really concerned about the rapid escalation of the premiums 
for a number of reasons. First, the burden of refinancing of CPP 
will fall mainly on low income people and women, because a 
disproportionate number of women receive low incomes. It will 
fall mainly on people who are least able to afford it.  That is a 
very regressive way to try to salvage the Canadian pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the burden will fall on small business. An increase of 
73 percent for small business is a burden that many of them 
cannot afford.  It is a burden that will drive some of them 
underground in how they conduct their business and whom they 
hire.  That is a concern to us as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the major increase will be a particular burden for 
young people as much of what we are going to have in the CPP is 
going to be an intergenerational transfer of wealth or income 
from younger people to their parents or their grandparents.  That 
is something we have to take a serious look at when this bill 
goes before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other part about the premiums that worries me in terms of 
regressivity is that year's basic exemption which is now about 
$3,500 a year under this bill will stop being indexed.  As time 
goes on, without indexing the basic exemption, more and more of 
the burden will fall on low income people as the funding of CPP 
becomes less and less progressive.  Again, that deviates from the 
original principle of the Canada pension plan which has tried to 
provide a pension for people when they retire but to do so on 
premiums that are progressive and affordable by low income 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to another point.  It is the whole question of 
the affordability of the Canada pension plan.  If we listen to 
the Reform Party and its friends at the C.D. Howe Institute or 
the Fraser Institute, we would think that the CPP is going to be 
flat broke and that we cannot afford it, that it has to be 
abolished.  I say that is rubbish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the actuarial report that the government used in order to 
craft its changes shows that the CPP is affordable.  The 
actuarial report in 1995 that the government used was based on 
some pretty low common denominator indicators.  The figures used 
were based on a flat wage increase and a very high unemployment 
rate.  The government tried to project this in a linear way for 
30-odd years.  It has now come up with all the figures for 
changing the Canada pension plan. It was a very pessimistic 
snapshot of what our country will look like economically in 30 
years.  Despite that, the plan is still affordable.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not pay more than other OECD countries for our public 
pension plans.  In fact if old age security, the OAS and the CPP 
are combined, in 1995 about 5.3 percent of the national income 
went into those two plans.  This will rise to about 8 percent by 
the year 2030. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The World Bank said just recently that some 9.2 percent of the 
GDP of the OECD countries was spent on public pension plans. In 
30 or 35 years Canada will be spending about the same or even 
less than what many OECD countries are spending today.  I do not 
think there is any debate that Canadians cannot afford a public 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the rapid rise in premiums and how regressive the 
burden of these are going to be, we are also concerned about the 
reduction in benefits.  Under the new plan benefits will be 
decreased by around 10 percent.  People, particularly young 
people, will be paying more in premiums and then seeing a 
reduction in benefits. I am concerned about that and the 
political support a public pension plan will receive.  You can 
only go on so long increasing premiums and reducing benefits 
before the political will is not there any longer to support the 
idea of the Canada pension plan.  That should be of concern to us 
as parliamentarians as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disability pensions will become more difficult to obtain.  This 
is one of the better parts of CPP and it is one, I suppose, of 
the cases we get as members of Parliament most often.  We hear 
about the problems people have applying for CPP disability 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current legislation a person has to be working for at 
least four of the last six years to qualify for CPP disability. 
Under the changes in the bill, that person must work for two of 
the last three years or five of the last ten years before 
qualifying for CPP disability allowances.  It will be more 
difficult for some people who now qualify and will not qualify 
under changes to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is the whole question of survivors and death 
benefits.  The maximum today is $3,580 for someone collecting 
survivors' benefits.  It will now be reduced to some $2,500, 
again making it more difficult, particularly for women who are, 
more often than not, the recipient of those benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the concerns we have as this bill goes on to 
the committee stage.  Basically, the burden of the funding 
changes in CPP will fall most unfairly on low income people, on 
women.  It will hurt disabled people.  It will hurt getting young 
people to support the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At committee we have to come up with some amendments that will 
try to make this bill more progressive, that will lessen the 
burden for young people, lessen the burden for low income people 
and reinstate the death benefit and the disability benefit to 
where they are presently in the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment, very briefly, on the increase of the size of 
the reserve fund for CPP.  Currently the reserve fund would cover 
CPP payments for over two years, about $40 billion.  Under the 
bill, there is a plan to increase this to 3.8 years which would 
be about $126 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this new idea, which also includes an investment board 
appointed by the government from the private sector, we see the 
idea of a very serious transition in the philosophy of the CPP 
from a pay as you go plan to a partially vested plan. Under the 
partially vested plan, the provinces will no longer be able to 
borrow money at the same rate at which they borrow it now to 
invest in their infrastructure for schools, universities and 
hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a negative because the provinces, being able to borrow 
money at a lower rate, have built the country into a stronger 
place and have made investments for all of us across the board 
and helped strengthen the economy.  That will be gone.  That 
might not greatly affect provinces like British Columbia, Alberta 
or Ontario that have borrowing rates that are lower because their 
bond ratings are higher than the average.  It will really hurt 
the four Atlantic provinces because their borrowing rates are 
more expensive.  When that happens it will be more difficult for 
them to build schools and hospitals. It will create more inequity 
in the country once again.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a part of the bill that might not seem to be that 
important to the ordinary person on the street but it will really 
affect Newfoundland and the other Atlantic provinces and to a 
lesser degree places like Saskatchewan and Manitoba which from 
time to time do not have the same bond rating as an Alberta or 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point that concerns me is that in the Quebec pension 
plan under the Caisse de dépôt et placement there is a regulation 
that says it has to invest in the domestic economy, to try to 
improve the economy of the province of Quebec in order to give 
that province a break.  Again, in this bill there is no reference 
to trying to look at the economic priorities of the country and 
investing in the domestic economy in this new fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty percent of the fund must be invested in Canada but again 
there are no guidelines.  We should be looking at maximizing the 
creation of jobs or minimizing unemployment.  It does not talk 
about what kinds of investments should be made but leaves that to 
the private board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern is that the Minister of Finance publicly 
indicated the 80 percent rule where 80 percent of pension moneys 
must be invested in the country is likely to be increased.  My 
guess is that it will be increased in the next budget or the 
budget after that.  That will also be a concern.  What is being 
created here is a huge pension fund that will be $126 billion in 
six years and up to over $300 billion after nine or ten years. 
That will be a huge fund.  That money should be invested in the 
main in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing to be noted is that while the premiums are more 
difficult for people to pay and the payouts will be less, there 
will be some job creation in this new bill.  That will be 
basically for the banks, the stockbrokers and the bond dealers 
that will be investing this new fund of $126 billion.  The 
premiums are estimated by some to be around $500 million for that 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the concerns we have at second reading.  They 
are concerns we would like to explore at the committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really concerned about the line the Reform Party is taking 
on totally privatizing the Canada pension plan and turning it 
into a system of super RRSPs.  Reformers are talking about a 
mandatory plan— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  There would be a better return.  It would 
come closer to your MP pension plan.  Are you against that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  A Reform Party member is now starting to 
intervene by saying that it would be a better return.  It would 
certainly be a better return for wealthy people but what about 
the ordinary citizens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Everyone would pay into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  What about the ordinary citizens?  Now 
everybody may pay into this plan but a low income person might 
not pay very much.  I represent the inner city in Regina and 
people in the inner city in Regina cannot afford to put much into 
RRSPs.  If we had the Reform Party plan, which would be a private 
open ended plan subsidized by the taxpayer through RRSPs and tax 
breaks, we would see wealthy people earning an awful lot more 
money.  The gap between the rich and the poor would widen as we 
privatized the Canada pension plan.  That is exactly what would 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the whole philosophy of the Reform Party.  That is why 
in the House of Commons on Thursday Reform's official critic for 
revenue agreed that Conrad Black paid too much tax, that wealthy 
people in this country pay too much tax.  That is the whole 
philosophy of the Reform Party.  I oppose that and our party 
opposes that.  Thank goodness the majority of the Canadian people 
oppose going off in that direction.  It is the law of the jungle. 
That right wing extreme conservatism has done this country an 
awful lot of harm over the years and now the Reform Party wants 
to carry it even further by totally privatizing the Canada 
pension plan.  I say we have to fight against that and we have to 
make sure that the Reform Party gets nowhere near the levers of 
power in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is very much against government programs that 
help ordinary people, but it is certainly in favour of spending 
billions and billions of dollars to subsidize the wealthy. 
Reformers are calling for a super RRSP plan where billions of 
dollars will be spent to subsidize the rich as they fatten their 
bankbooks with a very healthy pension plan.  We have to fight 
against that.  That is one reason I am concerned that this plan 
is moving in that direction.

listened to the member's comments and I certainly appreciate the 
way he laid out the issues.  It is clear there are some important 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree wholeheartedly with his comments about the Reform 
proposals.  The opposition leader in his speech said that we have 
to make the survivor benefits fairer and that there should be a 
fairer distribution to middle and high income Canadians. It is 
absolutely outrageous that he should be fighting for high and 
middle income Canadians when we have people living in poverty. 
The Reform Party has no social conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the public consultation forums one of my constituents, 
Mr. Phil Connell, appeared before the panel.  He wanted to 
share his numbers with us.  He has been retired for seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his employment he contributed $18,607.  He computed the 
interest and found that his share was about $9,300.  In the seven 
years of receiving the Canada pension plan his total receipts to 
date are $54,287.  My constituent, a senior who is getting very 
generous benefits, $5 out for every $1 that he put in, said that 
this is scandalous and must be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Qu'Appelle laid out comments about each of 
the initiatives the government is proposing to deal with the need 
to get the cost of the CPP down.  He said we should have retained 
the disability benefits and the survivor benefits. He said we 
should not shift the burden of the price to the youth coming 
along in the future.  He suggested there should be absolutely no 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have it both ways.  Can the member please advise the 
House, if he is going to protect everything that is there 
already, how does he propose to save the Canada pension plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did make a brief comment in 
answer to that question earlier.  Perhaps the member missed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actuarial report on which the changes are based, in the 
opinion of some economists, which I happen to share, contains 
very pessimistic projections.  They are based on high 
unemployment rates and the very flat wage increases we have seen 
over the past few years.  They have taken these forward for 30 
years, in a linear way, and made projections which are very 
pessimistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the economy will be in better shape than that, as do 
many economists.  We do not have to have a decrease in disability 
benefits or in survivor benefits.  As a matter of fact, those are 
a very small part of the payout of the CPP right now.  The 
biggest payout is in the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe we should penalize disabled people.  We do not 
have to do that based on the present economy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member spoke about things he is concerned about in 
the plan.  He spoke about making it more progressive.  I am sure 
he is aware that any changes in the plan, as contained in the 
legislation or changes which will be made due to subsequent 
consideration, require the approval of the provinces. I would 
like to ask him how he intends to proceed on that with the NDP 
Government of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke as well about the relatively low retirement income of 
Canadian women and their much higher rate of poverty in 
retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may be aware that during the negotiations between the federal 
and provincial governments there was a proposal on the table from 
the Manitoba government, supported by our government, which would 
have seen mandatory credit splitting between spouses as CPP 
income is earned.  That would have gone a long way toward 
ensuring that future generations of retired women will not be 
penalized as they are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP Government of Saskatchewan chose not to support that 
proposal.  It is one provincial government which allows women to 
sign away their entitlement to CPP benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member agrees that those income credits earned 
during the working life belong equally to both partners in a 
marriage or common law union and what measures he is prepared to 
take to ensure that the NDP supports that and will do its best to 
persuade the NDP governments in B.C. and Saskatchewan that they 
should also support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon.

and there should be total equality.  I will do whatever I can to 
push that idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not privy to the negotiations that took place between the 
provinces and the federal government. The member will know that 
two thirds of the provinces representing two thirds of the 
population must agree to any changes along with the federal 
government. Saskatchewan and B.C. are the two provinces that do 
not agree, primarily because they see this as a regressive way of 
increasing the premiums.  I am not privy to all the details, of 
course, because I was not there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I certainly do not want to defend the Liberal Party on 
its proposals for reforming the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member from the NDP a question. He 
appears to believe that this plan can go on indefinitely without 
some sort of a restructuring of how to finance it.  He spoke 
about what is wrong with the government plan and that it is using 
pessimistic figures.  I am really quite surprised.  Usually when 
forecasting revenue and doing a business plan, one usually likes 
to use some very conservative numbers.  If conservative numbers are 
used, then it is usually safer ground if things happen to not be 
as bright as one would hope. be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good example is that when the plan was brought in in 1965, the 
government could see nothing but a bright future for the Canada 
pension plan.  In reality it should have been looking at it more 
pessimistically given the input it got from its own financial 
actuaries who said that under the Canada pension plan structure 
it was doomed to failure by the end of this century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member suggesting that we should continue with a 
blindfold on in the fervent hope that things will be so bright 
that we will be able to offer all kinds of benefits and 
provisions under the Canada pension plan and nobody is really 
going to have to pay for it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>   Mr. Speaker, of course not.  I never 
suggested that.  There has to be a restructuring of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My argument this morning is that the restructuring of the plan 
in terms of the increase in premiums is regressive, too much of a 
burden on low income people.  That is the main thrust of the 
argument I am making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the Reform Party would not understand that because 
it wants to abolish the Canada pension plan and replace it with 
a totally private plan that will benefit the wealthy people and 
say to hell with the ordinary people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where I differ from Reform Party members.  They are 
willing to take the write-offs for RRSP, increase the limits 
radically so that wealthy people can make a lot more money and 
let the poor wander around all by themselves. That is why I 
oppose it.  Under their plan the gap between the rich and the 
poor will widen, not narrow.  I want the gap between the rich and 
the poor narrowed. That is why we need public pension and social 
plans to help create an equality position.  But the Reform Party 
would not understand that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker,I listened to 
what our socialist friend has said.  I wonder, inasmuch as the 
plan is going to require a contribution increase of 73 percent 
but the benefits are not going to change, that they will stay 
somewhere in the area of $8,800 a year, if he would address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase is going to incur in terms of contribution but the 
benefits are not going to increase. We hear it is going to be 
indexed and that is a hopeful sign.  But when he talks about the 
rich and the poor, I wonder if he would care to share with the 
House, although he was eligible for the 3.5 years that he was not 
in the House to take his own MP pension, whether he did that. How 
would he compare that plan to the $8,800 which our seniors are 
getting now and will continue to get despite the 73 percent 
increase in the contributions that young and old, poor and 
wealthy are going to have to pay into this system?

friend from Crowfoot is I understand the new Reform members of 
Parliament are part of the pension plan as well.  They were 
campaigning that they would not be part of that plan. I think 
they are trying to use smoke and mirrors.

would never move into Stornoway.  Where does he live?  He is in

to politics in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very concerned about 
the issue of CPP reform, as are a number of Canadians.  If there 
is one thing I have learned over the last four years it is how 
Canadians are concerned about a few key issues which relate to 
their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is very much an area of concern for Canadians, 
especially as our population grows older. Education and training 
are important issues, but so are pensions and planning for our 
retirement.  They all have one specific thing in common, that the 
demographics of our country are changing very rapidly to the 
point where if we want to understand the full impact of this 
issue we also have to start by understanding and recognizing that 
in this country today, for every person who is of retirement age 
there are five people who are working.  In 20 years there will be 
only four people working for every person who retires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I look at the pages in front of me, I think of their 
retirement, which may seem like a few years away for them.  They 
should know, as they plan for their future, that there will be 
only three people working for every person retiring.  We will go 
from five to four to three in a short period of 40 years.  Given 
that dynamic, it requires extraordinary effort from governments 
in Canada to plan, to think ahead, to think these changes 
through, especially given the added elements in our economy.  We 
have a $600 billion debt and high taxation levels. This is a key 
question in our future and how we are going to deal with it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my experience, and I think I know the Canadian public very well, 
people feel this public pension system is very important, both as a 
policy and a program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the Government of Quebec has a different plan. The Quebec 
pension plan administers a similar plan, but the fact remains that both 
in Quebec and elsewhere, Canadians believe that this plan is very 
important for their future. 
People want governments to plan ahead so we will know exactly how to 
deal with these rapid demographic changes that will occur. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP over the last few years has been jeopardized by 
inadequate contribution levels and inefficient plan management. 
We have known that for some time.  People in the House will 
equally know that the plan is administered with provincial 
governments.  The federal government is not alone in deciding 
what direction we have to take.  This is very much a plan that 
requires a joint effort.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know, for instance, that the money in plan was lent to 
the provinces at rates the same as 20 year bonds.  This was way 
below the rates that could have been obtained in the marketplace. 
It certainly was not the kind of policy that would allow the plan 
to garnish surpluses; quite to the contrary.  It was certainly a 
lot less than a private sector plan earned.  No wonder Canadians 
were concerned and certainly worried about the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to look at how the plan affects middle class 
Canadians and how it will affect their working years.  Not only 
must we look at how it represents a take off their paycheque 
every week.  We also must look at how it would effect employment 
because it is very much a payroll tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect we need to compare the ideas that have been put 
forward, some of them during the election campaign on our side. I 
noticed that on the Liberal side we have what is typically the 
return of Liberalism.  The government that was not in favour of 
taxing people and cutting spending in the last four years is now 
in favour of taxing people and spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keeping with that new found philosophy as expressed in the 
Speech from the Throne, what is the Liberal government proposing 
to Canadians through this change?  It boils down to something 
quite simple and very straightforward.  It represents an $11 
billion tax bite out of our economy over the next six years.  Let 
me repeat that.  The number is so big that it is difficult for 
people actually listening today to get a sense of what it is. 
Some $11 billion will be taken out of the Canadian economy over 
the next six years by the Liberal government for the purpose of 
trying to change and sustain CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one of the biggest tax attacks we have witnessed in the 
history of the country.  It represents something that would have 
a dramatic effect on our economy if it were left as it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other political parties such as the Reform Party have also tried 
to cobble together some sort of a plan, but it is important to 
note from the perspective of Canadians that the Reform Party has 
not put any numbers forth.  It says “here is an idea” but there 
are no actual numbers.  We are walking into what would be 
fundamental changes to people's pensions, but there are no 
numbers to back up what exactly it would do or how it would 
operate.  However that is not a big problem for the Reform Party. 
It is just willing to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more disturbing in this vague concept of recognition 
bonds is that they would end up reneging on CPP.  They would just 
scrap it.  What happens to people who have paid into the system 
and who had planned according to these payments?  I guess the 
answer is tough luck.  They will get recognition bonds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will pay for this?  It is not clear who will pay for it 
except that the younger generation of Canadians, certainly 
according to the Reform plan, will pay a hefty price no matter 
what the scenario is. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the system is different in Quebec, the Quebec pension 
plan is managed differently, but to them all this is not terribly 
important. The Bloc Quebecois does not expect to be here to administer 
these changes, that is if it ever reaches its goal. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The party that I lead here—and in the election campaign we made 
it very clear—has set out three clear benchmarks in changes to 
CPP we would like to see happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is that CPP must be self-financing.  It is critically 
important that we understand the lessons over the last few years 
and that we make this plan self-financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second one is a very different from the one held on the 
government side.  We know the government has a different 
position.  It is ready to increase premiums to the tune of $11 
billion.  If it is to be made self-financing there must be tax 
cuts to offset the $11 billion bite in the economy.  That is the 
second benchmark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that if we are to go down this route there have to be 
reductions in employment insurance premiums paid on a weekly 
basis, which is a payroll tax.  There also have to be personal 
tax reductions so that the decision or move to make CPP 
self-financing will not damage our economy the way the Liberals 
are ready to tolerate in the plan they are presenting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is to complete the whole picture.  We have to allow 
the young Canadians who are with us today in the House of Commons 
to plan for their retirement and give them a fair break.  They 
are not asking for favours.  They are not asking for special 
treatment.  They are just asking for a fair break and an 
opportunity to plan.   We also have to make changes to RRSPs so 
that they can plan for themselves and make decisions for 
themselves and for their future.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are three key benchmarks that we as a political party 
certainly believe in as we assess the changes we bring forward 
for CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would we meet these objectives?  We think there has to be an 
increase in CPP contribution levels to rates that are adequate to 
ensure the long term viability of the plan.  We do not quarrel 
with that, not at all, but these increases in contributions as I 
mentioned before must be offset by substantial reductions in 
taxation for Canadians.  Otherwise we are turning in circles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would make provisions to finance the extra costs per year of 
senior benefits resulting from demographic changes.  I mention 
this because there are those who look at the books of Canada, at 
spending, and are surprised to find that even if we held the line 
on spending in all departments on an annual basis it would still 
increase to the tune of about—if I remember correctly and I am 
quoting from memory—$2 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those sitting in the galleries of the House of Commons today are 
asking themselves how that could happen, why it is happening. 
There is an answer that has to do with demographic changes in 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we hold spending the fact of the matter is that people 
are growing older.  They are eligible for certain programs.  The 
health care system take is higher because of a growing 
population.  We need to understand these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point today is quite simple.  Not only do we need to 
understand them.  We need to plan for them.  We need to think 
ahead.  I know that is a new idea on the government benches, but 
it is one that is critically important to the young Canadians who 
are with us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to reassure Canadians the funds will not be 
mismanaged as they were in the past.  We have to take a 
completely different approach.  I will be happy to speak to the 
issue of return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a separately managed Canada pension trust.  That is very 
much the route we should take.  In this respect we are doing what 
has already been done successfully in the province of Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major successes of the quiet revolution in Quebec has 
been the creation of the Caisse de dépôt et placement. Of course it is 
not perfect, as an institution. From time to time there have been 
attempts to manipulate the activities of the Caisse, but by and large, 
I would say the Caisse has been well rated on its performance. This is 
an institution that has been very successful in Quebec. It has been 
very, very successful and has managed the funds in its care with due 
diligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is a concept that is worth imitating. It may be a very new 
approach for some people, but when the federal government sees people 
with good ideas who get good results, it does well to borrow those 
ideas. In this case, we think that is what it should do. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension trust needs to be completely independent from 
the government of the day if it is to work.  Its trustees have to 
be appointed on a non-partisan basis, recruiting from experts in 
the financial, business and actuarial communities in consultation 
with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate of the Canada pension trust and its trustees would 
be to advise the government on how and where to invest the money, 
on contribution levels, and on how to select the best private 
sector managers acceptable in industry to administer the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this way we would have some assurances that in the long term 
the accumulated surpluses would be invested in a wise manner.  We 
would offer some intergenerational equity with regard to how we 
deal with pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The performance of the fund could be evaluated on a regular 
basis to guarantee and ensure Canadians some transparency on how 
well it is being done. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we cannot afford to overlook certain realities. My point is 
that with all these efforts to set up a pension plan for the future, it 
is also extremely important for the government, for all governments but 
especially the federal government, to control its own spending if we 
again go in the direction Liberal Party of Canada is asking us to go, in 
other words, start spending again. These are not rumours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, I read in the newspaper that the Minister of Finance 
himself had a meeting with volunteer organizations and urged them to 
apply for federal funding. I am not making this up. 
This was the Minister of Finance, who is sitting just a few desks down, 
opening the flood gates and making this announcement to the public. It 
is as though he put up a sign saying: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“They were open for business.  Please come and ask for your 
money”.  It is signed by the Minister of Finance.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the government revamps the Canada pension plan, if spending 
is out of control, it will get nowhere at all. The government must take 
steps to keep spending under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must also plan for the increased demand for old age security, 
because even if we control spending, there will still be this annual 
increase. I wish the government would say it thought about this and has 
calculated, on an annual basis, what the additional cost will be to give 
these people the pension to which they are entitled. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to improve the security and returns of registered 
retirement savings plans.  The young men and women in the Chamber 
who serve Canadians so well as pages are the ones who will be the 
most affected by these decisions.  They also need to be able to 
plan for themselves beyond whatever government can do.  That 
means more flexibility in registered retirement savings plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing I would like to hear coming from the Minister of 
Finance is an ironclad commitment, a guarantee that the increased 
value of sheltered funds will never be taxed while they remain in 
RRSPs.  That is a commitment the minister has yet to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I raise this point today is that every time a federal 
budget is on the horizon and in the weeks that follow there are 
always rumours the Minister of Finance or the government of the 
day will make a tax grab on RRSPs.  Canadians have planned and 
saved and put this money aside for themselves.  There is never an 
assurance that one day the government will not turn around and 
change the rules, try to grab that money.  The government needs 
to speak very clearly on the issue and guarantee it will not 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing that needs to happen is an immediate increase 
of the allowable allowance for foreign content for RRSPs from 20 
percent to 50 percent.  The issue is quite simple.  Our market is 
too small.  It is fine to encourage Canadians to put their money 
aside, but the same Canadians should be allowed to get the 
maximum return on the money they are setting aside.  By limiting 
the foreign content to 20 percent the returns are being limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians who have any understanding of the markets and the 
way they operate will know that this is an untenable position. 
Not only should we move to increase the foreign content of RRSPs 
from the current limit of 20 percent to 50 percent.  We should 
move to zero by the year 2001 so that Canadians are allowed the 
full freedom they should be allowed to get the best return 
possible on their money rather than have the people down here 
telling them where they can and should invest.  The people up in 
the galleries are the ones who should be able to say where they 
want to invest their money, the money they earned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot forget seniors benefits.  We have to plan.  In this 
regard I want to know, as do other Canadians, the hidden agenda 
of the Liberal government. We have yet to find out the impact of 
the changes to seniors benefits for Canada's middle class.  What 
will be the impact on women, particularly older women who will be 
dramatically affected by changes to the seniors benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the government planned?  What numbers are available?  I 
assume it put some numbers out.  It cannot be proposing these 
changes without having studied the effects they would have on the 
middle class.  Surely it has not entered into the changes without 
considering the impact they would have on women.  We are all 
waiting anxiously to find out.  We certainly have a great deal of 
concern with respect to how it will affect women in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make reference to a concept we have not heard a lot 
about but will hear more about, the concept of intergenerational 
equity.  As the demographics of the country change it is 
important for us to accept that we are asking a smaller group of 
Canadians to carry a heavier burden than ever before with respect 
to retirement policies.  This will have a disproportionate effect 
on them, on their revenue and on the decisions they will make 
with respect to their own savings.  Ultimately it will have an 
impact on the decisions they will make with regard to where they 
want to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very much a global economy.  This is an economy where 
people who have certain skills are in high demand everywhere in 
the world.  We know how easy it is to travel on a Canadian 
passport.  The Government of Canada has certainly demonstrated 
that to us.

We did not mention this in our platform but this idea deserves 
some real study on how we can offer some tax relief.  We could 
target it at younger working individuals and self-employed people 
on whom we are going to rely.  Then there could be a stable 
predictable retirement system for Canadians in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
really quite incredible that the hon. member, the leader of the 
Conservative Party is standing in the House today attacking the 
government for taking action on an issue that for nine years when 
his government was in office it knew full well that the Canadian 
pension plan needed to be reformed, that the future of Canadians 
needed to be taken care of.  Year after year that government 
failed to take action on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member was on the government side for a period of nine 
years, why did he not ask his government to take action on such 
an important issue so that the Canada pension plan could be 
reformed in order to ensure that those who retired in the future 
would have a pension to rely on to help them carry on with their 
daily lives?  Why did he not take action on that?  Why will he 
not stand today and instead of attack the government, 
congratulate the government on finally cleaning up the mess of 
nine years of inaction by the Conservative government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for offering 
me the opportunity to respond to the member and the usual 
rhetoric of the Liberal Party of Canada.  I could understand that 
in 1994 after the election campaign of 1993 every time something 
would happen the Liberals would rise in the House of Commons to 
blame the previous government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has just demonstrated the usual overblown rhetoric 
used by the Liberal Party of Canada.  It is the party that rather 
than assume its responsibility continues to blame others. In case 
the member has not noticed, there have been two election 
campaigns that have brought Liberal governments to majority.  The 
government you are talking about was four years old, Mr. Speaker. 
When are you going to live up to your responsibilities and stop 
blaming others for decisions that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order.  The hon. member for Sherbrooke is 
an experienced member and knows he cannot cover his address to 
the Chair by saying Mr. Speaker and then saying you to somebody 
else.  The hon. member knows that and I invite him to address his 
remarks to the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is just that I hesitate 
to blame you personally for everything that has happened because 
you share some responsibilities for other members in the Chamber, 
and I know you recognize that Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Ottawa Centre might as well enjoy that overblown 
argument. I do not know whether he actually thinks that Canadians 
believe him.  I wonder when he says those things whether he 
actually thinks that Canadians who are listening to us today take 
him seriously or whether they do not sit in their chairs and ask 
“what is with these people?  They have been in government for 
four years.  They went through two election campaigns and they 
continue to blame others for things that are happening and for 
their own decisions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My advice to the member is that if he thinks that argument has 
any sway at all, keep on using it while he still can because the 
days are counted.  Assume your responsibilities and live up to 
the fact that you have a mandate and you are asked to deliver 
it— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Whenever the member appears to get to 
the end of his questioning he lapses into the thing I tried to 
have him avoid.  I know he will bear that in mind.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too was 
quite impressed by the remarks of the hon. member for Sherbrooke and 
leader of the Conservative Party, who said that, with the new pension 
plan, the level of taxation will rise by $11 billion over six years. It 
is strange to hear this expression of concern coming from the 
Conservatives. He spoke of the poor and the young and went so far as to 
suggest there is need to control and limit government spending.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Has he forgotten that, while the Conservatives were in office, 
Canada's public debt doubled from $250 billion to $500 billion? Does he 
not think that doubling the Canadian government's debt load and imposing 
a mismanaged GST on the Canadian economy, both actions having been taken 
by the Conservatives while in power, helped create many problems, 
including the pension problem? In other words, does he not think that 
increasing the Canadian government's debt load while they were in power 
added to the pension problem in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the member for 
Québec East is questioning my memory, because my memory of the period 
when the GST decision was taken is very clear, exceptionally so.  If I 
am not mistaken, there was a minister at the cabinet table, his name 
will come to me—what was it?  It began with a B—ah, yes, Bouchard, it 
was Bouchard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the ministers at the cabinet table when the decision to 
introduce the GST was taken was the former leader and founder of his 
party, now Premier of Quebec.  I assume the member for Québec East is 
not in disagreement with his leader.  Surely not; that would be too 
glaring a contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bouchard fought for these very policies, and finally won over 
his colleagues at the cabinet table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the member for Québec East was wondering about my memory, I 
will go back over the whole story.  What actually happened, objectively 
speaking, to the government in 1984?  What was the situation awaiting us 
in 1984 when we came to power?  We were looking at a situation where 
Canada's public debt, under the former Liberal government, had increased 
1,000 percent.  The member for Ottawa Centre likes to talk about 1993, but he 
forgets about the years before that.  The public debt had increased by 
1,000 percent under the former government.  Annual spending was increasing by 
an average of 14 percent annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We brought that down to within 3 or 4 percent of the rate of 
economic growth.  We managed to hold the line on spending and, in 
1987, the former government managed to create a surplus in the 
government's operating budget.  That is the real story behind all 
the rhetoric. Then we managed to lower the annual deficit from 
8.4 or 8.6 percent of the GDP in 1984 to almost half of that. 
That is the real story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who are interested, the real story is that all the 
measures to reduce spending put forward by the former government were 
shot down by the Liberals now in power.  The Minister of Finance who 
took the Conservative government to task for its restrictive Bank of 
Canada policy is now piling on even more restrictions.  It is these same 
people, including members of the Bloc Quebecois, who criticized the 
government's spending.

find it quite incredible to be sitting here in the House 
listening to a member of the Conservative Party. In fact the 
leader of the Conservative Party sat here in government for over 
nine years.  The Conservatives had a chance to fix the system. 
They knew full well then that it had serious problems. Now I hear 
this member putting on this caring, sharing concern for the 
Canadian public. This surprises me.  They like to talk, talk, 
talk, but no action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member had a chance to create some action in the House.  He 
had the opportunity to give up his gold plated pension, but did 
he do it?  No.  He can sit there and be eligible for over $4 
million in pension and talk about the public who will have to try 
and live on between $8,000 and $9,000.  I find this very, very 
intolerable.  I cannot believe that he could stand up here and 
say this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Say it again, $4.3 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  He will collect $4.3 million.  Talk about 
a two tier system, this is a two tier system.  This is a total

rising on a point of order.  I think he is rising on a point of

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Sherbrooke, a brief response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I was saying to the 
member for Okanagan—Shuswap and now I will say it to the member 
from Prince George, when you exaggerate to that point you render 
yourself insignificant.  That is certainly my advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that the member from Okanagan or even Prince 
George would actually get up in the House of Commons and address 
this issue, especially after he and his leader said that they 
would not move to Stornoway, the residence of the Leader of the 
Official Opposition, that they would turn it into a bingo hall. 
These are the same people who said to Canadians that they were 
receiving letters from Canadians telling them to move the 
opposition into Stornoway.  I can see it now.  There is probably 
a riot in front of your office of people saying “please move 
them in”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same political party that had a hidden expense 
account for its leader and his family who went out and sermonized 
other Canadians.  I can tell that some members of the Reform

there is a word for this. It is called hypocrisy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is my first opportunity to speak as the first 
member of Parliament for the new federal riding of Ottawa 
West—Nepean.  I want to take this opportunity to thank my 
constituents for the trust they have placed in me to represent 
them in this Parliament into the next century and for generously 
sharing with me their ideas and opinions during the election 
campaign in June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the 
hundreds of thousands of volunteers across this country who 
worked in this campaign, whether they made donations, knocked on 
doors, printed flyers or put up signs.  These are the people who 
keep democracy strong in this country and who make it possible 
for people of limited means to seek office and to serve in 
Parliament.  This is an extremely important part of having a 
Parliament that represents the people of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Half of my constituents are new to me.  They have been 
represented since 1988 by Beryl Gaffney as the member of 
Parliament for Nepean.  They are accustomed to a member of 
Parliament who is accessible, responsive and deeply involved in 
her community.  I shall do my best not to lower the standard of 
service to which Beryl accustomed them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beryl's legacy to Parliament is also important.  It is a 
reminder to all of us that we are not here to serve ourselves but 
to serve the greater good of our country and of humanity.  She 
especially reminded us that we are here to speak for those who 
most need the support of a caring, compassionate society, for 
children, for the poor and for those around the globe who are 
suffering the abuse of their human rights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's system of retirement income is one of the hallmarks of 
a country that represents the values Beryl Gaffney espoused, a 
country that cares for its citizens in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty years ago this country had a serious problem of poverty 
among its elderly.  Since then we have built retirement income, 
old age security, guaranteed income supplements, the CPP and 
public assistance to the tune of $14 billion a year to people's 
private retirement savings which has ensured each and every 
Canadian a retirement income which allows them to live at a 
modest level of dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Canada's system is one of the best in the world, major 
demographic and economic shifts are threatening its long term 
sustainability.  In particular the number of seniors will 
escalate dramatically when the baby boom generation starts to 
retire.  The proportion of seniors in Canada will rise from 12 
percent today to 16 percent by the year 2016, which is not as far 
away as it sounds, and to nearly 25 percent of the population by 
the year 2040. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important because at the same time there is a growing 
proportion of seniors in our population, there will be a 
shrinking proportion of working Canadians.  As we all know, the 
CPP is essentially a pay as you go system where the contributions 
of today pay the pensions earned in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Security in Canada's retirement income system has been a key 
priority for the government.  The reforms the government is 
pursuing in part with the legislation on the Canada pension plan 
today will maintain the three pillar retirement system.  The 
reforms will strengthen each pillar to ensure that all Canadians, 
including those who will not retire until several decades from 
now, will have an adequate, affordable pension which they will be 
able to count on when they reach retirement age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a large number of seniors.  One of my priorities in 
the last Parliament was to make sure that the views of my 
constituents were well understood and well represented to the 
government on pension reform.  Along with good health care, 
adequate income is essential to a decent quality of life in 
retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The level of public interest in this was demonstrated admirably 
when over 200 people turned out to an all day forum which I held 
in 1995 to hear from constituents of all ages.  Those individuals 
have continued to be involved.  We have kept them informed with 
follow-up meetings and mailouts on how the reform of the public 
pension system is developing.  Those individuals have shared 
their opinions with me.  They have let me know their views on 
what the government is planning to do.  In turn I have kept the 
ministers and the prime minister involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House some of the things I heard at the all day 
forum.  They have not changed their minds.  They are a very 
consistent bunch, the people of Ottawa West—Nepean.  They wanted 
to ensure the security of their income. Participants in the 
workforce also wanted to ensure that they could count on the 
Canada pension plan being there for them and being affordable 
throughout their working lives.  They wanted an assured benefit 
when they reach retirement age.  Those who are already in 
retirement wanted to be assured that their benefits would not 
diminish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over all, participants of all ages supported a publicly funded, 
reliable, sustainable pension plan which is affordable and which 
protects against inflation.  The participants insisted that a 
public pension system is instrumental in promoting fairness and 
alleviating poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also understood the significant demographic changes in 
Canadian society which are creating the need to ensure the 
sustainability of the Canada pension plan for the long term. They 
were also very concerned that those who are already in or near 
retirement not be affected because they had based their 
retirement planning on the expectation that the CPP would be 
there for them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government as a whole also consulted with Canadians across 
the country.  In co-operation with the provinces, hearings were 
held in 18 different cities.  Over 270 individuals and 
organizations made presentations.  Thirty-three sessions were 
held.  There were another 140 written submissions and over 6,000 
telephone comments from Canadians as we looked at how we could 
maintain our public pension system and what was needed to achieve 
that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of these consultations and subsequent 
federal-provincial discussions is the legislation that is before 
us today with respect to the Canada pension plan. I should point 
out that the agreement reached was endorsed by eight of the 
provinces, the territories and by the federal government. Clearly 
we have a strong national consensus to act in the interests of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically what we have is a three part approach to restoring the 
financial sustainability of the CPP and ensuring its viability 
for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First by increasing contribution rates now, they will not have 
to rise to the much higher levels predicted for future 
generations. Second we will improve the rate of return on the CPP 
fund by investing it prudently in a diversified portfolio of 
securities. The investment is to be managed by a new independent 
board at arm's length from the government. Third we will match 
the growth in cost to the ability to pay by tightening up on the 
administration of benefits and changing the way some benefits are 
calculated. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of the principal features of the CPP remain 
unchanged.  First, individuals currently receiving pension, 
disability, survivor or combined benefits under the CPP will see no 
change in their benefits.  Furthermore, people over the age of 65 
as of December 31, 1997 who chose to begin receiving CPP pension 
benefits after that date will not be affected by the changes 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, all benefits, with the exception of the death benefit, 
remain fully indexed to inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the retirement age remains unchanged. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 9.9 percent contribution rate now to be introduced over the 
next few years ensures that the CPP will remain affordable for 
Canadians into the future.  Canadians will not have to face the 
14.2 percent contribution rate projected in the 1995 actuarial 
report on the CPP. I know there are some who would like to 
pretend that does not need to be done, that we can just wait and 
leave it to another generation to worry about the pensions 15 and 
20 years from now.  We do not believe that is responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation also ensures the continuation of full 
indexation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of keeping the CPP sustainable will be shared more 
equitably under the legislation.  It will be shared among those 
who will benefit both in the short term and in the long term. We 
will not be carrying on paying out pensions now and leaving it to 
a future generation of Canadians to worry about how they will pay 
for their pensions then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we will be reviewing the CPP every three years 
ensures us that we will be well ahead of any changes and able to 
address any problems that are developing on a more timely basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about other approaches to pensions we have heard 
about in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has told Canadians that they want to throw away the CPP 
and set up some super RRSP system.  But what the Reform Party 
cannot tell us is how they will do it or at what price and what 
will be lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP provides more than just retirement pensions. It provides 
disability benefits to contributors who are no longer able to 
work for example. The CPP has other benefits that RRSPs do not 
have.  For example the time that parents spend out of the labour 
force to care for their children does not diminish their CPP 
pension, but it certainly does diminish their contributions to an 
RRSP.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party would like to see the government 
phase out the CPP.  What they do not tell Canadians is that if we 
decided to shut down the CPP today, we would still have 
outstanding obligations to current pensioners and those who will 
be paying into the system for the next 30 to 60 years. The cost 
of paying CPP's outstanding obligations on a year to year basis 
would be close to 8 percent of contributory earnings for the next 
10 years and then 6 percent to 7 percent for the following 30 
years, on top of the cost of setting up their new RRSP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the rhetoric that has been adopted by the 
Reform Party and the Progressive Conservative Party in the House, 
talking about CPP contributions as payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country has been built on the philosophy of sharing of 
responsibilities for one another, where we contribute.  The CPP 
was set up as a contributory plan. Today's paid workers 
contribute to the CPP to pay the pensions of those who have come 
before them and who have contributed to building their hospitals, 
their educational institutions and the quality of life we now 
have in this country.  These are employer and employee 
contributions.  I am quite happy to leave the payroll taxes to 
the neo-Cons on the opposite side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some unfinished business in the legislation before us. 
One of the proposals that was on the table in the latest round of 
negotiations was mandatory splitting of credits between spouses 
in CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe and it is legally enshrined in law in this country 
that the family is an economic unit.  Both partners in that 
economic unit deserve to share fairly in the money that is earned 
during the course of the marriage, whether one partner is working 
in the paid labour force or working for free at home, or both are 
working in the paid labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the provisions our government put on the table and which 
was supported strongly by the Government of Manitoba was to 
enshrine mandatory splitting of CPP credits. Much to my regret, 
and I challenged one of the NDP members on this earlier this 
morning, the Government of Saskatchewan and the Government of 
B.C. chose not to endorse this.  In fact the Government of 
Saskatchewan specifically allows a woman to sign away her rights 
to split her husband's CPP pension.  I am pleased to know that 
the issue of sharing pension credits between two partners in a 
household will be on the agenda two years from now when the CPP 
is revisited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When federal and provincial governments conducted their 
cross-country consultations on the future of the CPP, Canadians 
were unequivocal.  They asked us to preserve the CPP.  They asked 
us to strengthen its financing.  They asked us to improve its 
investment practice.  They asked us to moderate the growing costs 
of benefits.  They asked us to to keep it fully indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure my constituents and all Canadians that this is 
not simply a cost saving measure.  Our purpose is to ensure that 
Canadians have what they have enjoyed for 30 years, a publicly 
funded pension plan that allows everyone earning income—

maybe the member for Saint—Maurice can help us understand how it 
is that such an extraordinary grant was given to a hotel chain in 
his riding.  The $600,000 used came from the employment insurance

businesses together for the purposes of employment insurance and 
used by the Prime Minister in his riding to help a hotel chain.

Mulroney used to run the government like his own personal club,

<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister 
knew from the beginning of last March that allegations of influence 
peddling had been made with respect to an organizer of the Liberal Party 
of Canada and that these allegations were sufficiently serious that a 
minister of his government put the RCMP in the picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  What action did he take 
from that point on to ensure that neither he nor his ministers were 
compromised during the election campaign with someone about whom there 
were serious suspicions and who was under investigation by the RCMP? 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to reassure the opposition about this 
very important matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediately I got wind of the allegations in March, I turned to my 
officials and asked my deputy minister to assure me that the entire 
consultation process, a very broad and open process involving several 
stakeholders, such as the Government of Quebec, Ms. Harel, and 
government opposition members, as you know, in every riding across 
Canada, including those in Quebec, was fine.  My officials confirmed to 
me that the process was transparent.  We therefore went ahead with it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we never find it 
reassuring when the Minister of Human Resources Development is answering 
questions.  His answers are never very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was 
aware that there were serious suspicions about a Liberal Party 
organizer.  The most basic precaution for a government leader is to 
ensure that, during an election campaign, he and his ministers do not 
come into contact with someone under investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing that this was his responsibility, what did the Prime 
Minister do to avoid an unfortunate situation, that is, contact between 
this person and himself or his ministers?

simple.  I am trying to explain that there were a very large number of 
stakeholders as part of this broad, open and transparent consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many stakeholders were consulted, the very strength of our system 
being the broad and open process of consultations, which includes the 
Government of Quebec, Ms. Harel's department, members throughout Quebec, 
as wwll as the Société québécoise de la main-d'oeuvre.  The information

at a press conference this morning Dennis Coffey, a 25 year 
veteran of Revenue Canada, repeated his allegations of serious 
fraud, nepotism and abuse on the part of senior Revenue Canada 
officials.  Department lawyers have tried to muzzle Mr. Coffey 
and the minister has attacked his integrity, dismissing out of

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister said in the House that Mr. Coffey's 
allegations were not true, he must have had evidence to back up

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue,

Coffey for calling him a liar, for calling into question the

Minister of Human Resources Development told us about the action he took 
to ensure that the allegations we have been discussing for several days 
regarding Liberal Party fundraising would not lead to the spread of 
fraudulent activities. So he took action in his own department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to ask the Prime Minister, who did not answer these 
questions, what he did in the government as a whole, since there is more 
than one department that awards contracts, when the Prime Minister, as 
was his duty, intervened in cabinet to ensure that such activities did 
not take place during and before the election campaign? 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, all 
ministers were instructed that if charges of this nature are brought to 
their attention, it is their duty to inform the police immediately. That

over to the police, who are investigating the matter, and when the 
police finish their investigation, they will draw the appropriate 
conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These instructions apply to all ministers at this time. It is the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
considering that such allegations were made, did the Prime Minister 
himself or any of his ministers intervene to ensure that the individual 
or individuals in question were not involved with them in the process of 
awarding grants? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since he was aware of these allegations, did he inform cabinet that 
this kind of influence peddling was taking place during that period, as 
of March 6, 1997?

was supposed to do by informing the police of the charges, and the 
police will conduct their investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time the minister had no better course of action, and those 
were exactly the instructions he received, like the other ministers. 
That is the way to handle this, in other words, inform the police and 
let them do their job.

invested in the markets by a private sector investment board at

will in fact have a return commensurate with any private sector 
plan. Certainly that is a better return than that suggested by 
the Reform Party under the super RRSP given the fact that its 
administration costs are going to be the lowest of any pension

</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1996 report on the restructuring of the reserves found that 
reservists had a serious training deficit when compared with 
trades and ranks in the regular force.  Part of the problem is 
that reservists are unavailable for training, often due to the 
demands of their jobs or difficulty in scheduling time off to 
coincide with the training exercises and courses offered.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-2, an 
act to establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and to 
amend the Canada Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Resuming debate.  I 
believe the hon. member for Ottawa West—Nepean has something in 
the order of five minutes remaining. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will not use my full five minutes.  I did want to be 
here for questions or comments if any opposition members wish to 
raise them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has faced up to an increase in the senior 
population and a shrinking workforce and has taken the necessary 
steps to ensure that one of the fundamental pillars of the Canada 
pension system will remain healthy for decades to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have every reason to feel confident about the CPP 
again.  Those who pay contributions today can count on getting 
their pensions in the future.  Existing pensioners can count on 
continuing to receive their entitlement.  All Canadians can count 
on an indexed pension so their income and quality of life will 
not be eroded over time.  We can count on our contributions 
earning a fair rate of return, and we can count on not unduly 
burdening our children and grandchildren because this generation 
has failed to deal now with the needs of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the committee's discussion of this bill.  It 
is a large and comprehensive bill, and I am sure there may be 
some very constructive amendments coming forward.  I thank the 
House for its time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
studies produced by the Department of Finance, the Bank of 
Canada, and virtually every reputable economic authority in 
Canada and abroad indicate that payroll taxes reduce jobs and 
reduce job growth.  Does the hon. member think that this bill, 
which will increase CPP payroll taxes by 70 percent, by some $1,800 for 
self-employed individuals, by over $10 billion a year when fully 
executed, will help the government to achieve its objective of 
greater job growth?  Or does the hon. member concur with the 
evidence of all of the reputable economists in Canada that this 
massive tax grab, the largest tax increase in Canadian history, 
will in fact kill tens of thousands of jobs, taking away the very 
kind of economic hope that people of my generation so desperately 
need in order to pay the kind of tax burden that has been levied 
on us by the fiscal irresponsibility of this and other 
governments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously the member 
was not in the House when I spoke earlier or he would have heard 
me address this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made a very strong point of saying that I find highly 
offensive this characterization of contributions to a pension 
plan as payroll taxes.  It is contrary to the whole concept of a 
sharing, caring, compassionate society where programs are set up 
to ensure that people who have contributed to society throughout 
their working lives are able to live a retirement of dignity on a 
modest income that allows them to afford the necessities of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as job creation goes, the member is exaggerating somewhat 
when he says that there is absolutely no disagreement about the 
fact that employer and employee contributions to such a plan are 
job killers.  The member has not addressed the fact that we will 
now be setting up an $11.5 billion investment fund, of which 
80 percent 
will be invested in this country.  He has done nothing to analyse 
the positive impact of that private sector investment of people's 
contributions on the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After four and a half years of Liberal government the economy is 
in better shape than it has been in in a long time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I found 
the speech very interesting, and I would like to commend the hon. 
member. 
However, I found the last two or three sentences not only 
disturbing but literally frightening.  I think the comment made 
was that the plan that is being presented is there for my 
children and my grandchildren.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member to explain in detail just exactly 
how it is that this is going to happen when the premiums go up to 
about 9.9 percent, and I believe that is supposed to last forever.  We 
know where that kind of promise went the last time. It went all 
over the place.  However, what is more significant is that there 
is no corresponding increase in the benefits that will be paid to 
the people who will actually benefit from the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a 73 percent increase in the premiums but no change in the 
benefits.  How can that be a benefit to children and 
grandchildren? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again the member may 
not have heard my earlier comments before question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to anticipate.  We cannot just wait for it to happen or 
it will be a disaster for pensioners.  We have to anticipate that 
the baby boomer generation which hit our high schools throughout 
the sixties and put tremendous pressure on our school system, 
will, 10 years from now, hit the pension system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proportion of seniors in the population will grow from 12 
percent 
today to 16 percent shortly after the turn of the century to 25 
percent of our 
population. At the same time the proportion of income earning 
Canadians in the population will drop dramatically.  That is why 
we have to act now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can wait and do what the auditor general said would be 
necessary in the next century and increase the payments my 
children and grandchildren will have to pay to 15 percent or we can act 
now and ensure that we have a fund that will meet that growing 
bulge in the retirement population.  We can do it fairly over the 
people who are going to be contributing in those years, until 
that boom hits us.  Frankly that is a fairer way to do it than to 
turn a blind eye and leave it to the next generation to worry 
about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the member's comments.  I would like to ask her a 
question about what has been said in the House.  Many members 
have indicated that the current beneficiaries of the CPP are 
getting a high amount.  In fact the <I>Financial Post</I> 
indicated that current pensioners are getting about $7 out for 
every $1 in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member comment and assure seniors about what their 
status is, those who are presently drawing benefits who have 
reached age 65 by the end of this year.  What will this bill do 
with regard to those current beneficiaries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that has been one of 
the big concerns of people who have already retired, who have no 
capacity to increase their earning power, especially for those 
Canadians for whom the CPP was primarily intended.  Those who 
have had very modest incomes throughout their working lives have 
not been able to afford the $14 billion of public subsidy that is 
provided to people who can save for RRSPs and which the Reform 
Party wants to increase to the benefit of its wealthy friends. 
But those people will find that they will continue to have their 
benefits fully indexed so their pension income will not erode. 
They will not see a reduction in their benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address my comments to the member and draw on what 
my colleague from Calgary Southwest said about job killing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is job killing for the workers, but what about the small 
businessman, and the extra tax burden which the government does 
not want to call that, but it is a tax burden on small business. 
What about the small business, the extra tax on small business? 
It will kill many businesses that are borderline because of the 
high taxes of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about killing small businesses which will in turn kill jobs 
and will take livelihood away from small businessmen.  What about 
that?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what about the impact 
on those same small businesses if we close our eyes, say we do 
not have a problem, and leave it to 10 years from now to increase 
those rates to 15 percent?  What about the impact on small businesses if 
we cannot afford indexed pensions and more and more seniors slip 
further and further into poverty?  They will not be able to 
patronize small businesses.  They will not be able to afford 
groceries.  They will not be able to have their clothes cleaned 
or go out for an occasional restaurant meal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would have a far greater impact on small businesses than an 
increase in their contributions to a good pension plan. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, at a time when Canadians are brimming with energy, 
excitement and ideas, this Liberal government as tired, apathetic 
and unimaginative.  It continues to repeat the mistakes of the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens of the city of Calgary, I am proud to say, 
exemplify this new energy, excitement and ideas.  This is a city 
which returned a Reform member to every riding in the last 
federal election.  Its influence, and Alberta's influence, on 
national affairs through creative policy alternatives and new 
ideas that flow from the area, is considerable.  I salute the 
citizens of Calgary and Alberta.  I am proud to be a 
representative of that city and that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we begin debate on Bill C-2, which is a very poor attempt 
by the government to remedy serious flaws in the design and 
management of a major part of Canada's social security system. 
Bill C-2 is a good illustration of the government's tired 
thinking, lack of imagination and unwillingness to look at new 
and better options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the leader of the opposition, pointed out this 
morning in the debate the ways in which the government is eroding 
the retirement security of seniors.  Bill C-2 also illustrates 
the government's failure to consult with young Canadians and to 
look after their interests. Millions of young contributors will 
be financially brutalized—and that is not too strong a term—if 
this legislation passes in its present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of this debate I trust that Canadians will see and 
understand that Bill C-2 is poor legislation and that it should 
not be passed.  Canadians will see that there are alternate ways 
and better ways to save, to invest and to secure their retirement 
incomes and their futures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians dislike unfairness.  We dislike seeing the young, the 
disadvantaged or the infirm exploited.  Canadians dislike paying 
for inefficient government.  They dislike seeing funds poorly 
invested or hard earned dollars frittered away on foolish, made 
in Ottawa schemes.  Canadians dislike intrusive government 
meddling in their personal affairs.  They dislike being told by 
government how to manage their paycheques.  They particularly 
dislike being told by distant government what is best for them 
and how their earnings should be spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the House to consider these Canadian characteristics 
and then reflect on the legislation before us today.  Members 
will see that the legislation is grossly unfair to younger 
contributors, continues to perpetuate poor management and 
investment practices, and is out of touch with the needs, desires 
and aspirations of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation, if enacted, would result in a massive plunder 
of the earnings of younger Canadians.  Younger contributors to 
the plan will receive less back in retirement benefits than the 
value of their contributions.  Not only will they have to pay for 
their benefits, they will also have to pay for the massive debt 
accumulated through the errors of previous Liberal 
administrations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that younger Canadians will be asked to pay many times 
more for their CPP retirement benefits than their parents or 
grandparents is no longer news.  The dimensions of this rip-off, 
however, are not well known.  The cynicism of the government in 
papering over the cracks in this plan has not yet been exposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My job and that of my colleagues during this debate is to expose 
the magnitude of the plunder and to unmask the Liberal cynicism 
which underlies this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief actuary of the fund tells us that the CPP paid a real 
return after inflation of 22.5 percent for those retiring in 1979. 
But that falls by more than one-half to 10.1 percent for those who 
retired in 1994 and it falls again by more than one-half to 4.9 
percent 
for those retiring in 2013, and falls yet again to 1.9 percent for those 
retiring in 2053 and to 1.8 percent for those yet unborn.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those retiring in 2033, which are many people who have just 
entered the plan, their return will be, according to the chief actuary 
of the fund, only 2.5 percent.  These people will receive only a 2.5 
percent 
return for investing nearly 10 percent of their earnings in a pension 
plan. All this with contributions soaring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I realize that so many numbers are difficult to follow 
they must be in the parliamentary record in fairness to future 
generations.  It is no wonder that young Canadians are becoming 
outraged by these proposed contribution rates. The CPP is a 
shabby, unfair and unjust scheme for the young and those yet 
unborn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk about unfairness and political cynicism. What political 
party would design a pension plan that passes the massive debt it 
ran up on to Canadians too young to vote or even yet unborn?  I 
merely have to look across the Chamber to see such a calculating, 
cynical political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next time members opposite speak to their children or 
grandchildren, or their neighbour's children, tell them what is 
being done to their future, how they are being shackled for the 
rest of their working lives with the cost of this and previous 
Liberal government mistakes, mistakes that the previous Liberal 
speaker in this debate even admitted were well known in the 
1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP is a pay as you go pension scheme, and was not even 
properly funded to begin with. It provided the attraction of low 
contributions to those first in and a high rate of return 
exceeding what could be expected in any normally funded 
investment plan. That is how the Liberals got Canadians to buy 
into it in the 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you understand pyramid schemes or the chain letter concept, 
then you will understand the concept of the CPP design. Some 
writers refer to Canada's pay as you go CPP as a Ponzi type 
scheme.  For those who do not remember, Charles Ponzi was a small 
time but well known swindler.  He promised a 50 percent profit on money 
in 45 days, double that in six months.  Investors flocked to him. 
To maintain the promised rate of return he passed the funds of 
new investors along as dividends to earlier ones.  But when 
inevitably the number of new investors declined, the whole scheme 
fell apart and Ponzi ended up in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the architects of the CPP did not end up in jail, the 
poor design of the plan is glaringly obvious.  The government 
should admit this as a first step in removing the blinders and 
considering new and better alternatives to this defective plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there are enormous implications for the proposed 
Canada pension plan investment board and it needs to be 
thoroughly thought through.  I do not believe the government has 
even begun to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes to establish an investment board to manage the 
funds transferred to it from the Canada pension plan account. 
Eventually, this board will control enormous amounts of money, 
particularly in a country with such a small capital pool. 
Estimates suggest this fund will be over $200 billion in just 15 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investment board will be managed by 12 directors, including 
a chairman and each director will be appointed by, guess who, the 
cabinet on the recommendation of the minister. The board, 
therefore, and the fund will be susceptible to political 
manipulation.  After all, this huge pool of capital would be a 
great temptation to any government.  If anyone does not believe 
me, just look at the jobs transitions fund that is being misused 
with and the questions which arose in question period about that. 
That fund is not even close to $200 billion, but politicians 
cannot keep their hands off even small funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members will know, the CPP is a pay as you go scheme. The 
result is that millions of Canadians have been promised a pension 
but no fund of money is sitting there to pay them those pensions. 
We have a lurking disaster, a staggering debt of over $500 
billion, almost as much as the entire federal debt again, arising 
from the mistakes in the design and management of the CPP 
must be borne by all Canadians.

thing is clear.  This debt should not and must not be put on the 
backs solely of the young and the unborn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes that new thinking is required to save 
the CPP.  Our proposal calls for moving from the present pay as 
you go public system, to a fully funded system based on individual 
accounts while protecting the benefits of current seniors.  This 
means that individuals will own all the assets in their account 
and their retirement benefits will be substantially greater. When 
they die their children and their spouse will inherit the 
capital.  This would go a long way toward eliminating poverty for 
elderly widows, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If young Canadians knew that each dollar they put into a 
retirement plan would go into their own personal account and that 
they would receive it back, including a fair market return on the 
investment, they would gladly accept the plan and even leave some 
portion of their premiums to pay the present beneficiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government had the fortitude to ask young Canadians, 
certainly those in their 20s, 30s and 40s about their 
preferences, it would find an overwhelming number who would like 
to own their own retirement assets and not rely solely on the 
promises of a debt-laden government with a sorry track record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, like previous Liberal regimes before it, 
arrogantly believes it knows what is best for people and 
continues to introduce legislation that is not in the best 
interest of future generations and that is intrusive and 
inflexible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this legislation goes ahead as it is written, the CPP is 
headed for certain disaster because the young will not support it 
and they will eventually defeat it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform speakers will raise many other considerations that must 
be debated before we vote on this bill.  Countries around the 
world are following the example of Chile in moving from publicly 
to privately owned and managed pensions.  These include 
Australia, Argentina, Bolivia, Columbia, Mexico, New Zealand, 
Peru, Singapore and Uruguay.  Great Britain has already partially 
privatized its public pension system and is considering a more 
ambitious reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say again to Canadians watching this debate, and I 
hope that thousands of Canadians are watching it, that the issue 
before the House today and in the days ahead is tremendously 
important to the interests of all citizens of this country.  The 
future of the CPP is a question that every working Canadian and 
every retired Canadian needs to carefully consider because 
working Canadians will soon have an extra $700-plus every year 
taken from their income to keep this current scheme afloat and 
retired Canadians will also be watching carefully to make sure 
that their pension security is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the impact of the changes to the CPP go beyond the 
financial consequences now or even the security of our 
retirement.  I believe this debate will be a turning point in our 
children's attitudes toward our generation.  Their attitudes 
could have— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I call for a quorum count. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have a quorum 
call.  Do we have a quorum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have quorum.  The 
hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would think that 
government members would have enough interest in the Canada 
pension plan and the future of our security that they would at 
least be in the House to participate in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of changes to the CPP go beyond the financial 
consequences now or even the security of our retirement.  I 
believe this debate will be a turning point in our children's 
attitudes toward our generation.  Their attitudes could have 
significant consequences for society when our children and 
younger Canadians stand in our place and when it is their turn to 
make decisions affecting us.  I believe we will be judged in not 
too many years on the measure of fairness we show now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our economic security tomorrow will surely be influenced by the 
concern we demonstrate today for the interests of the next 
generation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bluntly stated, the proposed changes to the CPP are completely 
unfair to our children and to younger working Canadians in three 
ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it places on their shoulders most of the burden for 
paying for the disastrously poor design and past mismanagement of 
the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it misses a golden opportunity to allow them to get the 
best pension return possible for each dollar paid into the plan. 
The Liberal plan gives young workers a return so low that no one 
would ever buy into such a scheme of their own free will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it imposes a 73 percent increase in employees and 
employers CPP contributions.  This amounts to the biggest tax 
increase in Canadian history and is an enormous payroll tax hike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Liberals admit that payroll taxes kill jobs.  This 
whopper comes at a time when youth unemployment stands at a 
staggering 17 percent, and by some estimates is 25 percent in 
real terms.  Not only does the Liberal plan kill the hope of 
young Canadians for a decent pension when they retire.  It also 
kills their prospect for jobs today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the debate is critical and one with far-reaching 
consequences for all of us and for the future well-being of 
Canadian society.  Reform is urging the government to move toward 
giving Canadians ownership of their own pension contributions and 
restoring the belief, especially of younger Canadians, that the 
plan will deliver decent retirement security for reasonable 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes by the Liberals are immense and 
far-reaching and simply cannot be allowed to be rammed through in 
a hurry.  We will be insisting that public hearings be held 
across Canada before the government touches the Canada pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite Canadians to join with the Reform in addressing this 
vital CPP issue.  Canadians must have a considerable say in the 
future of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I quote a statesman from another parliament in 
another time but whose words are very appropriate today.  I hope 
the government will listen.  He said “A politician plans for the 
next election”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Liberals are doing.  They know there is a mess 
in the Canada pension plan.  They are simply trying to infuse it 
with more money at the expense of our children to keep it afloat 
until they can take off with their own gold plated MP pensions 
and not have to worry about it any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statement goes on  “A statesman plans for the next 
generation”.  We have a duty and an obligation in the House to 
plan for the next generation.  I urge us to take that obligation 
very seriously.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the member for Calgary—Nose Hill is getting a lot 
of partisan politics messed up in the CPP.  She is probably not 
aware of the fact that starting last year one-third of Canada's 
population was turning 50 at the rate of 500,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If CPP is to be there for the upcoming generation we have to 
make changes to it right now so that they can survive.  She has a 
lot of problems with the return coming out of CPP, but she is 
only looking at one of three pillars.  We have CPP, seniors 
benefits and the RRSP program which gives an 18 percent tax 
shelter on income.  She is obviously expounding their super RRSP 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPP is not only a pension plan but is a disability insurance 
policy.  It is a very comprehensive one and a very good one 
because it is backed by the Government of Canada.  Their super 
RRSP program is a typical Reform way of looking at things:  we 
will pay them money out of their RRSP program but if they are not 
able to contribute to it, tough luck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  That is not true.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  Could the member tell me what kind of 
disability insurance programs are incorporated into their super 
RRSP? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am surprised the hon. 
member opposite just figured out that a lot of people will soon 
be turning 50.  Surely we have been around long enough for this 
to have been obvious some time ago, to provide for our pensions, 
and to get this plan on track before now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, just after I was elected, I asked a question in the 
House of the Minister of Human Resources Development about how 
secure the plan was since we were having to dip into the 
contingency fund.  The minister essentially patted me on the head 
and said “Don't worry.  Be happy.  Everything is under control. 
No problem.  Don't raise any alarms here.  Everything is fine”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden the government figures out that people will be 
turning 50 and may want their pensions pretty soon.  I am 
outraged that we are in a crisis situation we should have known 
was coming.  Now the government is trashing any proposal to try 
to fix this situation in a sensible way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk for a minute about the disability portion of the 
plan.  The disability payments under the plan amount to only 17 
percent of the payout of the plan.  It is a small portion of the 
plan. It is not like there will be a huge amount of money to make 
up to ensure people have disability coverage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can make a couple of points.  The CPP for some odd reason 
takes over the disability obligation of private disability 
insurance plans.  A person cannot be doubly indemnified.  After a 
fairly brief period of time the CPP kicks in.  It takes 
precedence over the private plans.  Many Canadians have 
disability insurance but the CPP gratuitously and unnecessarily 
takes that over.  Even the amount the plan pays out in disability 
is not necessary in many cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If as Canadians build up their own capital account, their own 
pension plans, they unfortunately become disabled they would have 
the money to start drawing on.  The protection would be there. If 
people become disabled they would have to make use of his 
benefits earlier than anticipated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is every reason to think there could be measures put into 
place to protect people against disability.  We all know we could 
become disabled.  There are no guarantees for any of us.  We want 
to protect and we will protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nonsense to throw that red herring out and say that 
Reform's proposals are no good because somehow they will not 
handle disabled protection the same way as the Liberal's 
proposals will.  There are plenty of good ways to do it.  I urge 
the hon. member to get on with looking at some of them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciated the depth and the analysis of my colleague from 
Calgary—Nose Hill.  There has been a tremendous interest, not 
only an awareness, in the scam perpetrated on the public over the 
last number of years.  She called it the Ponzi scheme, which is 
not an unfair analogy.  I think she explained it rather well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real indictment not only on the present government 
but on previous governments.  The time has come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member explain exactly how it is that one 
generation must show a leadership role for the next generation? 
How can they be shown to prepare for the future, whether it is 
financial responsibility or responsibility for one's own life? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could she provide leadership, direction and guidance to the 
people who are coming up so that they will live a better life and 
not be the Ponzis as has been the case in the past? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is important that 
whatever we do with the Canada pension plan is fair to the 
present beneficiaries of the plan who were promised a pension, 
who paid in good faith and who now in many cases have done their 
financial planning on the basis that they would receive the 
promised benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must also be fair to the people who will have to pay the 
costs, to the people who are now being asked to double their 
contributions into the plan for no greater benefit, for actually 
less benefit than they were promised, for less benefit than 
present beneficiaries receive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan would simply take measures to top up the unfunded 
liability in the plan by sensible means.  There are many of them. 
We are exploring several, even though we are only the official 
opposition and do not nearly have the resources of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear the government is not getting on with the job with 
the resources at its disposal.  It is incumbent on someone to 
make sure that the people who are receiving their benefits will 
continue to do so, and at least to make sure that the amount of 
money left to go into the benefits of younger generations will 
give them the maximum bang for their buck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are promising them, as I said in my speech, is that those 
entering the plan now will get a whopping 2.5 percent return on that 
huge investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the premiums were invested over 30 years or 40 years at 
normal market rates of return and managed by proven money 
managers, the return would be incredibly higher than the 
government is proposing to give younger Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not at least let them get a maximum return while still 
protecting the current beneficiaries?  It does not make sense to 
ignore that proposal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are into a full blown debate on the issue now. 
During Liberal presentations we were told about the investment 
board that would look after the huge Canada pension plan premium 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  We are talking about a potential $200 billion. 
The most information we have heard about the management of the 
fund is that the Liberals will appoint an investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member for Calgary—Nose Hill.  Given 
the Liberal record of handling money, could we have any 
confidence in this new so-called arm's length investment board 
that the Liberals are talking about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member raises the 
question which I think is one of the least well considered in 
this whole scheme.  The more experts and analysts and opposition 
members start to examine this aspect of the plan, the more 
worrisome and the more troublesome it will become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing arm's length at all about the investment board. 
It is appointed directly by cabinet and serves at the pleasure of 
cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question there will be a lot of input and influence 
on this aspect of the plan.  The literature and the commentary of 
the government are already referring to regionally equitable 
investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again we see political considerations even before the thing 
is set up creeping into the direction given to the board.  We 
know from the QPP, public pension funds, the Alberta Heritage 
Savings Trust Fund, and other avenues of government managing 
money how unlikely it is that political considerations will not 
get in there sooner, later, last, first and always. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be very concerned and be very vigilant that it does 
not happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great intent that some of my colleagues are discussing Bill C-2 
respecting changes to the Canada pension plan board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with great interest to the member for Calgary—Nose 
Hill talk about the importance of a consultative framework.  I 
know from my fellow colleagues on this side of the House that we 
have already done this.   Years ago we went out and conducted 
town hall meetings in our ridings, asking the people of Canada 
what they wanted to do with the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conducted three of these meetings in my riding.  The 
conclusions of the people of Durham are very much part of this 
legislation.  In particular, they told us that they wanted to 
maintain the Canada pension plan.  Also they told us that they 
wanted to see a different investment format. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were concerned about the government directly investing it 
and giving money back to the provinces.  They wanted to see an 
independent board.  The bottom line is that we have been 
listening to the people.  That is exactly what the people of my 
riding, and I am sure many ridings, have told our government. 
They want this money set aside and managed in a businesslike 
fashion.  That is essentially what this act attempts to do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members have mentioned there is going to be an increase in 
the size of the fund.  Some talked about $100 billion and some of 
my colleagues who like to double everything are up to $200 
billion.  That is a substantial fund for this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that some members opposite talked 
about payroll taxes. When some of them spoke I had to reach for 
my Oxford dictionary because they referred to the CPP as a tax. 
Perhaps I could buy the members a dictionary because they do not 
seem to have one. I opened up my Oxford dictionary and it clearly 
says that a tax is a contribution to the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deductions for the Canada pension plan are either currently 
being paid to beneficiaries or invested in a fund.  They do not 
come into the general revenues of the Government of Canada.  By 
definition in the Oxford dictionary clearly they are not a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people talk about Canada pension plan contributions they 
somehow end the discussion at the payment of premiums.  Once 
again it is the same discussion Reform Party members often get 
into when they talk about spending, that somehow it is gone, 
ended and never heard from again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are talking about a $100 billion fund. We have to ask 
what does it mean.  What does the fund go into? The government is 
empowered to carry on normal market interventions much as mutual 
funds do now, purchasing equities in Canadian owned companies and 
bonds. I suspect this is going to have a double effect 
economically. It is going to provide more capital for small and 
medium size business.  As businesses expand they either borrow or 
raise equity. Businesses are expanding, building new buildings 
and plants and facilities.  Invariably when they do that they 
create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it is a circular argument that by paying these 
premiums we are going to lose jobs.  However, when we look at the 
other side of the argument of creating robust capital markets in 
Canada, we are creating jobs.  This is simple economics which the 
Reform Party often likes to look at, the bad side. The reality is 
there are a lot of positives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To take this one step further a lot of people are saying that 
they are concerned about the amount of money in the fund.  If we 
compare it to a privately managed fund today, the Caisse dépot et 
placement du Quebec has a fund which is now at about $57.6 
billion, the Ontario Teacher's College pension plan is at about 
$50.9 billion and the municipal employees fund is at about $25.9 
billion.  By definition those are some very significant funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the Canada pension plan we have to talk about 
the demographics, the fact that our population is getting older. 
As the fund becomes more robust, active and intervening in the 
private sector it could well have an impact on the reducing 
interest rates because it will make more capital available, 
looking for capital and it will be more competitive in the 
capital markets and thus may reduce interest rates for small and 
medium size businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this fund process the possibility is there for lower 
interest rates and also we have created the availability of more 
debt and equity capital for small businesses which will create 
jobs. The Reform Party is not interested in that because it is a 
very positive thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also heard the member for Calgary Southwest talk about other 
negative aspects of the plan. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing is Canadians want to know their funds are 
being invested.  As has been mentioned a number of times in the 
House, Canadians have said where did that money go, where is it 
in the system. Now they will be able to see where their money 
went.  There will be a quarterly report which will show where 
their money has been invested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform Party members often talk about the super RRSPs.  The hon. 
member for Calgary—Nose Hill said that only 1 percent of the 
payments from the Canada pension plan are related to disability. 
I suggest she read the financial statements.  She will see that 
Canada pension plan payments to the disabled amount to about 19 
percent.  The Reform Party has no plan to ensure that factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell hon. members opposite that there are many people in 
my riding who are living on disability payments.  It is hard for 
me to believe they are concerned about the hardships these people 
face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, members opposite have gone on and on about the 
intergenerational tax.  The hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill 
called it a rip-off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition was concerned about the clawbacks 
in the old age pension system.  Then the hon. member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill spoke about the 200 percent return on 
investment that some of these people are receiving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it going to be?  Are they going to be concerned about 
intergenerational transfers?  Are they going to be concerned 
about a 200 percent return on investment?  Are they going to be 
concerned about clawbacks to seniors pensions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is they cannot have it all ways.  They cannot 
argue out of both sides of their mouths all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member suggested, there would be a $500 billion deviation 
if we actually tried to fully fund that plan today.  I have not 
heard any opposition member tells us how they would do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went to the people and we asked them how to do it.  This is 
the plan they told us they wanted.  This is the plan which is 
acceptable to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of our younger people are worried that the premiums are 
going up, but everything is not absolute in history.  The reality 
is our younger generation has other benefits which have been 
given to it by government.  It has support in the educational 
system and other benefits from our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who knows in 20 years what the premium levels or what the 
benefit levels will be. It will depend on the demographic shifts 
in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has had the intestinal fortitude to look at a 
situation that was breaking up.  Many governments in the past 
have shifted this on to other administrations.  It would be easy 
for us to do just that, shift it on to another administration. 
The problem would get worse and worse.  However, we have faced 
reality and are dealing with the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this government has done.  This is good 
legislation.  I encourage all my fellow members to support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would commend the hon. member for his remarks; unfortunately 
there were several inaccuracies in his characterization of the 
Reform plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear to me that the hon. member, who I believe is an 
accountant and well acquainted with actuarial concepts, may not 
have done exhaustive research on this subject.  It is not merely 
the Reform Party which has proposed a mandatory retirement 
savings plan to replace this giant rip-off Ponzi scheme which 
Liberal and Tory governments have perpetuated for the last 30 
years.  Very credible independent think tanks such as the C.D. 
Howe Institute, the World Bank and even the Bank of Canada have 
made favourable comment on the concept of a self-funding, defined 
contribution, mandatory public retirement savings plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member has read any of the studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Name the countries that have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  The Chilean government has it. 
An hon. member mentioned some of the other governments which have 
adopted this kind of plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Chile did it.  It is an enormously successful 
plan which members from every stakeholder group in the economy, 
from labour unions to business to small business to taxpayers, 
have embraced.  The public opinion polls in Chile show 
overwhelming support for the self-funding pension plan 
established in that country.

contribution that will continue to be made to mandatory pension 
savings would go to fund the unfunded liability which this 
Liberal government has allowed to develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not think this is a responsible approach to 
meet the obligations we do have toward older Canadians?  Has he 
not looked at any of the very serious arguments put forward by 
credible organizations such as those I have listed?  Has he not 
looked at any of the international examples to see that this kind 
of plan actually can work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have a privately 
funded plan that already exists in our country.  I think this is 
where the member is looking at absolute jurisdictions like Chile. 
I have read some of those reports.  However, we have a three 
tiered system in Canada.  We have the basic social benefit, the 
Canada pension plan system and the tax assisted RRSP system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our RRSP system is one of the most generous in the world.  We 
have total limits of up to $13,500 of premium contributions as a 
tax assisted support for private pensions.  In the United States 
that same deduction is only $2,000.  The reality is we already 
have a privately funded system in the sense of a voluntary system 
through the registered retirement savings plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about are those other two tiers, the ones 
that the Reform Party keeps wanting to forget about, the people 
on lower incomes who are not able to take advantage of those RRSP 
levels.  We are talking about the basic integrity of our pension 
plan system.  The people of Canada told me and my colleagues they 
want to keep it, and so we are.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the member for Durham.  He covered many aspects of the CPP and of its 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aspect has been overlooked in this House.  I referred to it 
this morning and I would like to mention it again now.  Even if the 
necessary parameters are built in to ensure the viability of the CPP, 
with the best intentions in the world, this plan must still be wisely, 
appropriately and properly administered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, last spring the auditor general sharply criticized 
certain practices in the present administration of the CPP. Does the 
government intend to take the necessary action to ensure that the plan 
is properly administered, both with respect to its information systems 
and with respect to the criteria for certain benefits, including 
disability benefits?  I await an answer from our colleague, the member 
for Durham. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I understand the member's 
question, he is concerned about the accountability of that plan. 
I note, in reading the legislation, that there is a whole 
process, a board of directors as a corporation which falls under 
our general corporation provisions and the duties of directors to 
that corporation.  I noticed that there is definitely a 
requirement of external auditors so that the external people will 
basically review the operations of that and report directly not 
only to government but to the people generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a closed shop. We do not have a bunch of people 
holding on to this money in a back room somewhere.  The bottom 
line is the people who are going to be the beneficiaries of that 
plan will be able to see how their money is invested and will be 
part of the process not only directly through the public forum 
but also through their members and the fact that this is 
answerable directly or indirectly through the political process 
through the appointment of the board and so on.

mandate of this board.  I think basically that is what people are 
asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the old system we did not know.  We were not very sure where 
that money was going.  We had the idea that it was going back to 
the provinces and so forth, but nobody ever saw a financial 
statement actually showing clearly where the float of the Canada 
pension plan money was at any one time.  I think this is very 
much progress and an improvement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Liberals are saying to the Canadian people 
forget about the 30-plus years of gross mismanagement of the 
current Canada pension plan, which is shared by the Tory 
government, incidentally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are saying forget about the way they have mishandled the 
pension contributions of working Canadians to the point that now 
seniors who are existing on the Canada pension plan are so far 
below the poverty line with the pittance they get from Canada 
pension that they cannot even see the poverty line it is so far 
above them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is prepared to say to the Canadian people forget 
all that, trust it, this time it is going to get it right. “To 
give an idea of our plan, we are now going to charge double for 
premiums or 77 percent more, but listen to us, Canadian people, we are 
going to charge double but we are going to manage it so well that 
when you retire we will pay you less than what you would get 
today if you retired”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is Liberal economics.  I cannot imagine how this 
government, with the record of mismanagement it has had, can look 
Canadians in the eye, particularly young Canadians who are 
entering the job force, and say “trust us with your money, pay 
more, get less”.  That is the Liberal way.  “Trust us.  Give us 
a chance”.  How can they do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, mismanagement?  The first 
time we have not had to go to the capital markets to finance the 
operation of the government in 27 years is not mismanagement.  It 
is good management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to listen to the member.  One of his 
colleagues and said those people who are getting Canada pension 
are getting 200 percent return on their money.  Then the member 
says it is a mere pittance, we should give them more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not know that was the policy of the Reform Party, to 
increase Canada pension plan benefits.  I did not see that on any 
of its platform documents.  I have not seen that anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really have to commend it for recognizing that many seniors 
are living well under the poverty line and that we should be 
taking some notice of how to deal with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for realizing the importance of 
possibly increasing some of our social spending in those areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this will be 
my first speech in this new Parliament. Of course, I would like 
to start by thanking the voters in Mercier for having put their 
trust in me again. In return, I promise I will protect their 
interests with all I have got, candidly and perhaps a little 
impetuously at times, as I did today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At second reading, the Bloc Quebecois supports most of the bill 
before us and does so for several reasons. To help our listeners 
understand where the Bloc Quebecois' support comes from, let us review 
a bit of history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with some sadness that non-Quebeckers realize today that 
the Government of Canada and every province except Quebec should 
have taken Quebec's lead in 1964-65 when it established the 
Caisse de dépôt et de placement.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a moment to describe the Caisse de dépôt et 
placement, in whose likeness, although only partially, the Canada 
pension plan investment board will be established.  I say only 
partially because, when I read the terms of reference of the 
board in the bill and compare it with those of Quebec, I can see 
that the difference is fairly significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives me, the Bloc members and all members from Quebec here 
an opportunity to appreciate the extent of the vision of the 
political leaders, those who were working with them at the 
time—and I would mention Jacques Parizeau at the top of the 
list—in giving Quebec an instrument that ensured the people of 
Quebec the best return on their pensions and that provided for 
economic growth.  It is this second element, economic development 
and growth to ensure better revenues, that is lacking in the case 
of the investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am going to limit my remarks to Quebec's Caisse de 
dépôt et placement.  I will do so by quoting someone who was a 
Liberal and a federalist in Quebec's history, but he played a 
part in recovering Quebec's powers—and this person is Jean 
Lesage—his is one of a number of names associated with Quebec's 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years after leaving office, Jean Lesage was asked what his 
most important contribution to Quebec had been. He replied “The 
Caisse de dépôt et placement”. Mr. Lesage said, on June 9, 1965: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Caisse de dépôt et placement will become the most important 
and powerful financial instrument ever in Quebec. 
</UL>
<The figures, which are from back then, are interesting. He went on to 
say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally funded with deposits from the Régie des rentes, the 
Caisse should reach assets of $2.6 billion by 1976 and of over $4 
billion 20 years from now. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should immediately tell you about the current value of these 
assets, and I will do it again, because it is an impressive figure. Mr. 
Scraire, the current president and chief executive officer of the 
Caisse, wrote in his most recent report that the Caisse's current assets 
exceed $62 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, Mr. Lesage saw the Caisse as the most important and 
powerful financial instrument. He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, a considerable portion of Quebeckers' savings will 
be invested by a government organization. Under the circumstances, 
the organization must be geared to serve as effectively as possible 
the interests of those who will deposit part of their income in it. 
In this regard, the interests of Quebeckers are many. There is no 
question that we must provide deposits with the security expected 
from an adequately managed organization. We must, in particular, 
protect the accumulated moneys against the erosion caused by the 
price increase which, for many years, Canada, like the other 
countries of the world, has been unable to avoid. 
The Caisse de dépôt will thus provide an opportunity to invest a 
sizeable portion of assets in securities other than those of a 
fixed value. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has been strength of the Caisse de dépôt et placement. 
While Canada concentrated on security, at the Caisse, they wanted 
to diversify investments and also contribute to the development 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Mr. Lesage said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interests of Quebeckers go beyond the security of the money 
they set aside for their retirement.  Such considerable assets 
should be used to stimulate the development of the public and 
private sectors, so that Quebec's social and economic objectives 
can be achieved quickly and effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Briefly, the Caisse should not be considered only as an 
investment fund like any other, like RRSP's, for instance, but as 
an instrument for growth, a lever that is more powerful than 
anything we have had in this province until now. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And this is still according to Jean Lesage, in 1965. It is 
interesting to hear what he had to say about the management of the 
Caisse. He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot substitute for the government in any way whatsoever. 
It should concentrate on managing the investment resources Quebec 
needs for the greater effectiveness of government policy and that 
of the private sector. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, its independence must be clear cut. On the other 
hand, the operations of the Caisse must be co-ordinated with the 
general economic policy of the government. Lesage felt that this 
co-ordination should normally take place through the board of 
directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was very clear about it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Caisse was not designed to accumulate profits for its own 
sake but sooner or later would have to distribute those profits to 
its contributors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of having a common investment policy was to attempt, 
with the help of the best people in the field, whose integrity was 
absolute, to maximize the rate of return on the public's investment 
and achieve a better balance between safe and high yield 
investments. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There probably was a lengthy debate, but I am sure that today, 
some people would prefer to have more than 40 percent of their 
assets in stocks. The Caisse has been very effective with this 
kind of investment, but its purpose has always been to strike a 
balance between security and maximizing the rate of return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Caisse is involved in business financing, its purpose 
is not to take control of businesses or buy them outright. Later 
on we will see very briefly, through excerpts from Mr. Scraire's 
report, that this was not the case, although the Caisse did play 
an important role in a number of businesses in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I do not have much time, Mr. Lesage concluded his historic 
speech, saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec has developed such a set of tools over the 
past four years. By nationalizing private electric companies, we 
can not only have a more direct impact on energy prices in many 
parts of the province but also establish a crown corporation whose 
influence on industrial development is already remarkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The General Investment Corporation has been assigned the formidable 
task of transforming certain industrial sectors in Quebec. SIDBEC 
should normally pull along in its wake a series of secondary 
industries, which had been growing slowly, if at all in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SOQIP, the mining exploration company, will foster more systematic 
exploration and development of subsurface resources. Finally, other 
tools have been announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Caisse de dépôt et placement does not have as specialized a 
role as the organizations I just mentioned. It will, however, 
incorporate several specific economic policies and help fund the 
growth that should normally be experienced within a few years in 
several areas of our economy. The Caisse is expected to play a 
diversified and necessary role.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the very last paragraph: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These instruments will now make it possible to develop a badly 
needed general economic policy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This 1965 speech should be read over and over in Quebec, as it 
enables us to draw several conclusions, two of which I would like to go 
over for the benefit of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1965, the premier of Quebec—and I could also quote from other 
speeches by then natural resources minister René Lévesque—and Quebec 
leaders believed, on the basis of what they had just negotiated in 
Ottawa, that they had control over their economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 1965, and even more so after 1968, when Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau became Prime Minister of Canada, Quebec could no longer 
get its powers back.  In this vein, I think I can say, without 
any chance of being mistaken, that it was a good thing Quebec's 
National Assembly passed the legislation creating the Caisse de 
dépôt in 1965, because otherwise this powerful instrument, which 
was necessary for all the others in an unfavourable Canadian 
context, would never have seen the light of day. And I hate to 
think what Quebec would be like now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Lesage's polite remarks about the Caisse's role are summed 
up a bit more bluntly by Mr. Parizeau in a book of memoirs.  Mr. 
Parizeau, who was the architect and, some even say, the writer of 
the speech I just read, said that this large reserve of capital 
made it possible for the Government of Quebec to bypass St. James 
Street—let us be plain—because in the time of Jean Lesage, 
before the Caisse de dépôt, when the Government of Quebec wanted 
to pass a social policy, it had to convince the big boys in the 
financial district on St. James Street, who did not, I can assure 
you, speak French and who had no time for the future of Quebec 
and of Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, for the first time, the Caisse de dépôt gave the Government of 
Quebec, of whatever stripe, freedom from the control of the big 
financiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Caisse de dépôt became the sine qua non for 
progress in two areas of major importance: the development of 
businesses indigenous to Quebec, that is created and developed by 
Quebeckers, and the affirmation of the government's real power 
with respect to the central government, big financiers, and the 
financial community, real power resulting from its own finances.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of June 30, 1997, the assets of the Caisse de dépôt et 
placement du Québec are worth $62.4 billion. The return on its 
investments in Quebec businesses has reached the astonishing 
level of 41.2 percent, thus adding to the assets of its 
contributors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the five past years, Quebec stocks held by the Caisse 
have yielded 3 percent more than the total Canadian stock index, 
that is, 19.3 percent, and this has helped the Caisse not only to 
guarantee the security of its assets, but also to maximize the 
return on investments made to provide pensions for the workers 
who contributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several types of businesses in Quebec have made remarkable 
progress in recent months.  I think the Quebec business landscape 
would not have looked the same, if we consider investments made 
by the Caisse in Canam Manac, Québécor, Biochem Pharma, Groupe 
Vidéotron and Bombardier. This is also true of small businesses 
like, for instance, a business incubator on the South Shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will once again quote Mr. Scraire: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since its incorporation act was adopted by the Lesage 
government in 1965, the Caisse has invested the money of its 
contributors wisely and at the same time financed infrastructure 
projects in every region in Quebec.  Furthermore, it provided 
more than 500 businesses with the capital they needed for growth 
and expansion in new markets. The Caisse is also a prudent 
investor, active on all markets throughout the world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are against the Reform Party's amendment simply because, in 
Quebec, we feel that although the Caisse has had a better rate of 
return than has been the case in Canada, it is urgent to invest 
in strengthening the Caisse to ensure that young people will also 
be able to enjoy its beneficial impact on the economy and look 
forward to a measure of security when they retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an urgent matter. Those who argue in favour of closing 
the generation gap will have to hurry up and, as we intend to do 
in committee, take a critical look at the provisions of this bill 
and try to improve it.  The strength of the system in Quebec is 
at stake—we already have a bill on second reading to that effect 
in Quebec—and for Quebec and Canada this is about closing the 
generation gap.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the remarks of our colleague for Mercier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What excited me is the fact that a decision was made in Quebec 
32 years ago to develop a major financial tool, the Caisse de dépôt 
et placement, not only to provide good return on the investments of 
workers, but also to promote the development of the Quebec nation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reading the bill introduced by the Minister of Finance with 
its investment board, which is limited to obtaining a good return 
on investment, I believe the Minister of Finance is proposing a 
national mutual fund whose sole objective is to act like any other 
mutual fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a Quebecker and proud of the Caisse de dépôt et placement 
and of its role.  I find it sad that Canadians too cannot feel this 
pride over their own powerful financial institution that fulfils 
Canada's mission, like the one we have in Quebec that fulfils 
Quebec's mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my colleague for more details on the subject, 
because it supports the concerns she expressed a few minutes ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Portneuf 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objects, as stated in clause 5, are as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>b) to invest its assets with a view to achieving a maximum 
rate of return, without undue risk of loss, having regard to the 
factors that may affect the funding— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wondered how that could be.  I thought just now that this 
Canadian fund will be a powerful instrument of centralization and that, 
if the objective was comparable to Quebec's objective, the 
provinces—certain provinces—who, at this time, are showing an 
interest in taking 
charge of their own development, and who do not trust the central 
government, or not completely, could worry that this powerful central 
instrument is not to their benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I thought that, in any event, this is going to be 
a centralizing tool. 
Once again, I say “Thank goodness Quebec was able to acquire, in 1965, 
this tool which made it possible, despite other hostile factors, to 
bring about significant development of Quebec”.  Back then, Quebec did 
have all these businesses, with important businesses, even in certain 
cases multinationals, controlled and owned by Quebeckers.  It is 
generally known that businesses in Quebec, in Canada and in North 
America were foreign owned.

in me by re-electing me as their federal representative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks today will focus on a very important element of the 
legislation at hand, a new investment for the Canada pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This policy is critical to the sustainability of the CPP 
reforms.  It enjoys the support of all the provinces and all the 
pensions experts.  Even more important was the overwhelming 
support of Canadians during the public consultation on the CPP.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of key themes emerged from these consultations, which 
included 33 sessions in 18 cities across every province and 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we learn?  We learned that Canadians wanted to preserve 
the CPP.  They wanted to reduce its cost, to straighten its 
finances and to improve its investment practices.  All of these 
themes are mutually sustaining.  A better investment policy is 
vital to preserving the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ordinary Canadians and experts alike have made it clear that a 
better investment policy for CPP would be one similar to that of 
private and public pension plans.  CPP funds would have to be 
invested in the best interests of plan members, with a proper 
balance between returns and risks.  This would call for an 
effective government structure to be put into place in order to 
ensure sound fund management with the right measures of 
independence and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consensus in favour of this principle was clear.  In October 
1996 we saw the federal and provincial finance ministers adopt 
them as guiding principles for the new investment policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These principles will be turned into concrete reality by the 
legislation before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation proposes that in future CPP funds will be 
carefully invested into a diversified portfolio of securities in 
the best interests of plan members, like other pension funds.  In 
turn, the fund will be managed by qualified investment 
professionals at arm's length from government by a board of 12 
directors, the CPP investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure independence of the board, the legislation prohibits 
government employees from serving as directors and it requires 
that the board include a core of directors with financial 
investment expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 includes a conflict of interest provision for directors 
and officers of the board even more stringent than those under 
existing Canadian corporate law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question now is why this new investment policy is necessary. 
Why not continue with the existing policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present the CPP has a fund equal to about two years' worth of 
benefits.  Funds needed immediately to pay benefits are loaned to 
the provinces at the federal government's long term bond rate, 
which is slightly below the provinces' own cost of borrowing from 
financial markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it happens, this policy has given good returns until now. 
That is because much of the money was locked in at favourable 
rates in the eighties.  However, with the current financial 
environment such a policy cannot be expected to deliver the best 
investment performance over the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's chief actuary, responsible for evaluating the financial 
position of CPP, estimates that the old policy could be expected 
to yield a real rate of return, that is the rate of return minus 
the rate of inflation, to about 2.5 percent annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new policy the chief actuary considers the long term 
annual real return of about 3.8 percent to be realistic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly there is a lot at stake in the investment of the CPP 
fund.  This is why a great deal of care has been given to the 
vital matter of fund governance in the drafting of this bill. A 
CPP investment board will set broad investment policies and 
oversee the progress of the fund but will hire qualified 
investment professionals to manage the investments on hand on a 
day to day basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In setting investment policy the board will be subject to 
fundamentally the same rules as other trustees of pension funds. 
Most of the investment regulations under the Pension Benefit 
Standard Act will be applied to the board and the foreign 
property rule limit for pension funds will be strictly respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal-provincial CPP agreement of February 1977 does 
specify a couple of further parameters for the new investment 
policy.  For the first three years the board's domestic equity 
investment will be selected passively, meaning that the board 
will mirror one of the more broad market indexes instead of 
picking individual securities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fund that invests in this way tends to reflect the composition 
and the average return of the market as a whole.  This 
requirement is meant to help ensure that the CPP fund's entry 
into the equity market proceeds smoothly.  This investment 
approach is a common practice among Canada investment funds.  It 
still allows for significant investment discretion with respect 
to allocation. For example, the passive equity requirements will 
be re-evaluated at the first triennial CPP review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also under the new investment policy provinces will continue to 
have access to some CPP funds.  However, the practice of provinces 
paying interest on a new CPP loan below the cost of the old 
market borrowing will come to an end.  From now on when provinces 
borrow from the CPP they will pay the same rate of interest as 
they do on the market.  As a traditional measure provinces will 
have the option of rolling over their existing borrowing at 
maturity, at market rates, for almost 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first three years provinces will have access to half of 
the new CPP funds that the board chooses to invest in bonds at 
market rates.  After these three periods, to ensure that the 
fund's investment in provincial securities is in keeping with 
market practices, new CPP funds offered to the provinces at 
market rates will be in line with the proportion of provincial 
bonds held by pensions funds in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having spoken about the CPP fund's proposed investment practice, 
I would like to take a moment to reassure anyone who has wondered 
about the impact of the new fund on Canadian capital markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that the policy of passive investment in domestic 
equity will help smooth market entry for the fund. There are 
additional reasons to be confident that entry of the new fund 
will not disrupt capital markets.  Canada's capital markets are 
mature, well developed and growing.  Moreover, the new investment 
fund will grow gradually in its first few years. Even after 10 
years the size of the CPP fund would only be comparable to that 
of the Caisse de dépot and the Ontario teachers pension fund.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be remembered the the CPP will be reviewed every 
three years.  Hence there will be ample opportunity to evaluate 
the fund's impact on markets and to make any necessary 
adjustments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ensuring the independence of the CPP investment board is a very 
important aspect of today's bill.  However, just as important are 
the provisions designed to ensure that the board remains 
accountable not just to the federal and provincial governments 
but to the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investment board will keep Canadians well informed of its 
policies, operations and investment results in the following 
ways: making its investment policies, standards and procedures 
public, releasing quarterly financial statements, publishing an 
annual report, and holding regular meetings in each province to 
allow for public discussion and input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the ministers of finance and human resources 
development will prepare an annual report on the CPP which will 
include the financial statements of the CPP investment board as 
well as the report of the auditor general on those statements. 
This report will be sent to the provincial finance ministers and 
will also be tabled in Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the effect of the new policy I have outlined will 
be to treat the CPP as a true pension plan.  This is not just my 
view but that of experts in the pension field.  One of the most 
distinguished of them has written that a move to a market 
oriented, diversified investment policy would enhance 
intergenerational fairness, increase public confidence in CPP 
finances and also increase the CPP fund's prospective rate of 
return which in turn would reduce the long term cost of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the legislation before us will address a range of 
crucial objectives for ensuring that Canadians will be able to 
look toward their retirement years with greater confidence and 
security.

to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I hear a 
lot of talk in the House today about wanting an actuarially sound 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of a plan that is actuarially sound.  I heard about one 
tier, two tier and three tier.  The fourth tier they forgot to 
mention was the MP pension plan.  There were members across the 
way, people who used to be members, who are collecting $3.4 
million.  There are people across the way who are eligible to 
collect $2.8 million.  There are people in the Conservative Party 
who are eligible to collect $4.3 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are talking about something that is actuarially sound 
why do they not comment in terms of this pension, the one that we 
are going to be paying double into, 9.9 percent of our income? MPs pay 
only 9.5 percent of their income and yet they can collect millions. 
Canadians can only expect $8,800 a year for maximum contributions 
under the CPP.  Why do they not comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment and 
make some response on the present plan we want to bring in. Had 
we not brought in these measures within this pension plan it 
would have gone up to 14.3 percent.  This is almost the same as 
they are proposing to have as their super RRSPs.  I think 
Canadians have confidence in the government. Canadians want to be 
sure that when they retire there will be a pension plan there for 
them.  Canadians want to be sure that the future is more secure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member was talking about the MP pension plan. I think 
he has just been elected.  I wonder if he knows the policies of 
his own party.  As a matter of fact, there was a member here in 
the last Parliament who wanted to increase the pay of members of 
Parliament to $150,000.  I think he should be asking his own 
party some of those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put proposals in the House that address the issues of 
today and not of yesterday.  When he asks about pensions I hope 
he will stay here long enough to see the measly pension we will 
receive.  I hope he can stay in the House in order to qualify for 
it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel (Secretary of State (Science, Research 
and Development)(Western Economic Diversification), Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with attention to my colleague's remarks and 
there are two points I want to raise with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he please share with the House once again the expert's 
view on pension plans.  I would much prefer that rather than the 
rhetoric from the opposition whose only purpose is to try to 
ridicule and diminish something to which a lot of people have 
given a great deal of thought.  They are people with a whole lot 
of background.  They are people with a great deal of expertise 
and people who know what they are talking about.  Perhaps my 
colleague could mention that.  I would like to contrast that 
response to that which I have just heard, which was pompous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. friend 
for the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am hearing across the floor is funny.  It is always the 
same rhetoric for the haves.  Let us remember the Canadians who 
were not able to accumulate savings, the Canadians who were not 
able to take care of themselves.  This gives them that 
opportunity.  I fear to ask him what would happen to the people 
who did not accumulate savings for their own pensions, how they 
would be when their retirement age comes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government plan is to assure that every Canadian regardless 
of his pocket book, when he or she retires, will have the 
opportunity to live with dignity and not to live in poverty as 
the hon. member from across the floor would have it. Every 
Canadian should live in dignity for the long hours and days they 
have worked.  They should be able to know that some security is 
there for their old age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an additional reason for us to do this expeditiously. 
The federal and provincial governments are joint custodians of 
the CPP.  The proposed new rules will need the approval of at 
least two-thirds of the provinces representing at least 
two-thirds of the population before they can come into effect. We 
have to give the provinces the time to do this.  They could come 
into effect within a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking with this policy, with this bill, is not only 
that the federal government be the custodian but also the 
provinces.  They have to agree.  We are not asking, as is claimed 
across the floor, that we should let those who have live in 
comfort at the expense of those who have not as much.  Later on 
in life some of us might need to have a government that will 
protect us.  It will not be a pension plan that is exuberant but 
a pension plan that is realistic.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy to have an opportunity to say a few words on Bill C-2, an 
act to establish the Canada pension plan investment board and to 
amend the Canada pension plan and the Old Age Security Act and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is quite a mouthful but it is important that the people who 
are watching Parliament recognize that we are speaking to Bill 
C-2, about the Canada pension plan.  The soon to come new 
seniors' benefit package, which has major implications for future 
retirees, will come at a later date but today we are talking 
about amendments that the government is suggesting to the Canada 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put my comments in context I have two sons in their twenties. 
When I chat with them and their friends I hear that they are 
concerned about the future and whether there will be pension plan 
for them.  It is fair to say that for a large number, in spite of 
the rhetoric and the promises that they hear, they are of the 
mind that there probably will not be a pension plan for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk to seniors they are concerned about the future.  I 
think it is fair to say that there will be a Canada pension plan 
in the future and those people who say that there will not be are 
simply fearmongerers.  They are trying to appeal to people who 
feel vulnerable at the moment.  But what we are doing today as a 
result of these proposals is to do whatever is necessary to 
ensure that the Canada pension plan continues into the future and 
that people in the following generation will be assured of a 
Canada pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not say that life is going to be great for people. 
Already we know that if people rely on the Canada pension plan 
and old age security as their sole income in their retirement 
years, that is a very modest income.  As a matter of fact it is 
fair to point out that thanks to the public pension plan of 
Canada that the number of seniors living in poverty has decreased 
over the last number of years and I think it is fair to say thank 
you to the Canada pension plan, thank you to our pension plans 
generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is with a great deal of sadness that we have to admit 
that one out of every five elderly people in our country live in 
poverty.  One out of every five people who built this country are 
living in poverty.  I suspect that as active members of 
Parliament we are in touch regularly with seniors who are having 
a difficult time getting by, who are have a tough time making it 
on the meagre pensions that they receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask right from the start, are these changes to the 
Canada pension plan going to result in more money for Canada's 
seniors dependent on CPP?  I am reluctant to say it but the 
answer is no, that people will actually receive fewer benefits in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the various benefits that are attached to the 
CPP people can expect over the next number of years to have about 
a 10 percent reduction in the level of benefits.  That is going to 
impose incredible hardship on a lot of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of living increases every year, although modestly, and 
for retirees who are in trouble today financially, things are 
going to be worse actually in the future. That is what this 
legislation says.  It is a modest reduction but nevertheless a 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back and talk a bit about the Canada pension plan 
and how we got into this situation.  It was established in 1966 
to provide all members of the paid labour force and their 
families with a base on which to build their retirement income as 
well as benefits in the event of serious disability or death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, let us just pose a question rhetorically, will people 
receiving death benefits get a better deal in the future?  With 
this legislation the answer unfortunately is no.  Will people 
with a disability get a better deal in the future?  The answer to 
that as a result of this legislation is also no. The legislation 
makes it more difficult for people suffering from a serious 
disability to apply for and receive Canada pension plan benefits. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT75"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT75"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this something that we actually want to do as members of 
Parliament?  If someone is experiencing a serious disability and 
is unable to work, do we really want to make it more difficult 
for them to receive benefits?  And fewer benefits at that. There 
seems to be something wrong with some of the basic logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to acknowledge the fact that one out of five 
seniors is living in poverty.  We would like to see an increase 
in the CPP, but in fact with this legislation we will see a 
marginal decrease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask ourselves what kind of a country we have that 
does not care well for its elderly.  I forget who it was that 
said a few years ago that you can tell an awful lot about a 
society when you see how it cares for its children and its 
elderly. There are 1.4 million children living in poverty.  One 
out of five seniors is living in poverty.  We have a long way to 
go. I regret to say that this legislation will not improve the 
situation significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was this legislation required?  When it was set up back in 
1966 the economy was different.  There were some assumptions 
built into the benefit levels and the premium levels.  Things 
have changed.  We were informed, accurately so, that this plan 
could not continue as it is without getting into serious 
financial difficulty.  I do not think there is a single Canadian 
who would argue against that. Canadians were calling on the 
government to change the system. They do not want to do away with 
the system, as some would suggest.  However, we have to make the 
necessary changes to ensure that the Canada pension plan is there 
in perpetuity. To be fair, this is an effort by the government to 
do just that. Whether it accomplishes that is another question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some good points and I want to identify them before I 
get into some of the concerns which New Democrats have.  One is 
the fact that transparency will be built into the system.  That 
is a positive feature of the legislation.  Another is the fact 
that Parliament will have an opportunity to review the system's 
effectiveness on a regular basis.  That is also positive.  Also, 
seniors will receive on an annual basis a statement on the state 
of health of the Canada pension plan.  That will be helpful.  The 
fact that it does not touch existing seniors' packages is also 
helpful.  People who are retired today will not have to be 
concerned about some of the matters we will be raising in the 
next few minutes because they will be exempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there are positive features to the legislation.  Perhaps 
most importantly, it makes a serious effort to ensure the 
viability of the Canada pension plan.  For that we must all be 
pleased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are some of the concerns? Of course we will address these 
concerns when the legislation is considered in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns we have is that it would appear that this 
may have a very detrimental impact on job creation in the 
country.  If we take $750 annually in additional payments out of 
each person's pocket, that removes a lot of disposable income 
from our citizens.  When $700-plus is taken for every employee in 
a firm, that takes a lot of money from that firm.  It will take a 
lot of dollars out of Canadian communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a calculation for one of the communities I represent, the 
city of Kamloops.  The amount of money which will be taken out of 
the local Kamloops' economy as a result of individual 
contributions and company contributions which match them will add 
up to approximately $80 million annually.  That money will be 
plucked out of that one small local economy.  It will not be 
there to circulate time and again between businesses and so on. 
That will make a very major dent into the employment situation in 
that community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take that right across the country into every community, 
large and small, what will that do to those seeking employment 
today?  Will it give them a better chance?  The answer is no. 
What about those who are in insecure job positions today?  Will 
this give them some confidence?  The answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will it give consumers more confidence to go out and purchase 
goods and services? 
The answer is no.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has to be a concern.  Do we know what we are doing when we 
pluck that kind of money out of a local economy, about $80 
million annually out of Kamloops, B.C., once the program is fully 
into place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the impact particularly on small and medium size 
businesses where I think it is fair to say times are not great 
for many, an increasing amount of underground economy will be 
encouraged.  Employers will be more inclined to hire people on a 
contract basis so that they do not have to make contributions to 
the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not talking about only small or medium size.  Some of the 
larger businesses in this city that hire thousands of people use 
that approach already.  Many of their employees are now on a 
contract basis to enable them to escape payroll tax.  It is a 
payroll tax by any definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember being in the House a few years ago when the 
Conservatives brought in five or six increases to the Canada 
pension plan.  Every time the Liberals in opposition would rise 
in a howl about the increase in payroll tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the sides have flipped a bit and the Liberals are suggesting 
it is not necessarily a payroll tax.  It looks like a payroll 
tax, tastes like one, smells like one, and probably is one.  I 
think it is fair to say this is a major payroll tax increase. 
What impact will it have on the ability of the country to produce 
jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern we have as New Democrats is that changing the 
way the fund is invested from providing funds to provinces into 
an investment fund will have an impact on some of the poorer 
provinces of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If some of the more wealthy provinces were not able to get lower 
rates from the Canada pension plan, they will go on to the 
regular bond markets.  The poorer provinces will have to pay more 
for the money they borrow, which again will pose a hardship on 
certain provinces of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at the fund.  We can debate its merits and the way 
it is constructed.  The 12 person management board will manage 
funds in a very diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds 
including provincial bonds and so on.  The anticipated cost will 
be about $500 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to be providing a fund perhaps as high as $126 billion 
in six years, that fund generated by the citizens of Canada ought 
to go into helping those firms that will create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the fund is invested in the safest bet it will probably buy a 
lot of bank stock.  Will it actually help the Canadian economy by 
having the fund hold bank stocks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at the Quebec government plan.  It has a very clear 
directive to the Quebec pension plan to invest moneys that will 
create jobs in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seems to be a very honourable motive.  If we as 
parliamentarians are to use $126 billion of taxpayers' money in a 
fund, it would not be inappropriate for us to say we want the 
funds invested in secure areas.  After all it is a pension fund. 
It should invest in areas that will result in some additions to 
the economy in terms of new jobs, new research, various 
affirmative action programs or programs to assist young 
entrepreneurs or young people to enter the job market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very clear direction should be given from the Parliament of 
Canada that we want the fund invested in useful ways as opposed 
to a fund that will perhaps buy bank stocks which will have 
marginal impact on assisting the Canadian economy generally. That 
is another concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the fact that these premiums will increase about 73 
percent over the next six years mean in terms of disposable 
income for people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not convinced that a 73 percent increase is necessary. 
When members look back at the reports on which the present 
legislation is based, they will see that the government assumed 
the worst case economic scenario in terms of worst case interest 
rates, worst case inflation rates, worst case economic growth, 
worst case unemployment levels and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting we should take the glorious side, but when 
making projections over a 20 year period it is fair to say that 
we should not always take the most pessimistic scale.  We should 
take the medium scale or a scale that will be reasonable over 
that length of time.  Then the increase in premiums could be 
significantly lower.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some serious concerns about the legislation.  I 
emphasize the impact on those who are disabled.  It will make it 
more difficult for people with serious disabilities to qualify 
for the Canada pension.  Is this really the kind of legislation 
we want to introduce? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that most members of Parliament working in their 
constituencies inevitably spend a good deal of time with people 
who are having difficulty qualifying for Canada pension 
disability.  We go to bat for people and help make their cases. 
Almost universally they are rejected the first time they apply. 
Then they try again.  Many months go past with people living in a 
marginal fashion and then being either granted or denied Canada 
pension disability.  The legislation will result in making the 
process even more difficult for people and the benefits less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that really what we want to do?  I think not.  If people are 
taken out of the workforce through no fault of their own, either 
as a result of disease or an accident, and cannot provide for 
their family, will we as serious, caring, compassionate people 
make it tougher for them to qualify under the Canada pension 
disability program?  This legislation says we will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if we appreciate what a person receiving Canada 
pension plan disability would get.  It is less than $9,000 a 
year.  I would like to see anybody raise a family on $9,000 a 
year.  The legislation will make it more difficult for people to 
access it and they will receive even fewer benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously I could talk about a number of other items.  We will 
have an opportunity to raise these concerns in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, Canada is distinguished from many other country by 
the way we treat each other, the way we care for each other.  It 
is fair to say that as a result of the old age security program 
and other pension plans like the Canada pension plan we can take 
pride in that fact major steps in the past have ensured that 
Canada's elderly are able to live out their lives in dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the changes being proposed, will that be the case in the 
future?  I think of my previous colleague, Stanley Knowles, and 
many others who have worked hard to ensure that the standard of 
our plans in support of seniors continue to increase and improve. 
I wonder if this regressive step is appropriate for the 
government and parliament to take at this time.  I obviously 
think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next weekend I will be sitting down with my dad who is in his 
late 90s and my mother who is in her late 80s.  They are probably 
listening to me speak today.  I will have to tell them that we 
are looking at legislation that will result in diminishing their 
pensions.  I know how they will respond.  They are very generous 
people who live a very modest lifestyle.  They will scratch their 
heads and wonder if we have gone crazy.  Why on earth would we as 
a parliament want to make the lives of seniors more difficult in 
the future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in the richest country in the world.  It seems to me 
that all our seniors ought to be able to live out their lives in 
dignity.  The fact that one out of five seniors lives in poverty 
is immoral and we ought to change that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members to gives some thought to the concerns my 
colleagues and I will be raising.  Let us change the Canada 
pension plan to make it a plan for the future that will enable 
people to live out their lives in dignity.  For goodness' sake, 
let us not amend the plan so that the lives of seniors will 
actually be made worse in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the member 
for Kamloops.  Over the last four years I have known him to be a 
member of Parliament who really cares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was happy to hear that he agrees with certain parts of the 
CPP.  Of course there are parts that he does not agree with. When 
we take the bill to committee we will tinker around to see if we 
can make it agreeable to everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to question the member on his thought about the 
increase in CPP causing unemployment.  That could be a concern. I 
have raised the issue of CPP disability before.  I raised it with 
a member of the Reform Party as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently 300,000 Canadians are receiving CPP disability. 
Another 50,000 in Quebec are receiving QPP disability.  For 1997 
that will amount to $10,597 a year or $833.17 a month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If CPP does not exist in the same way, what would an insurance 
policy cost to replace those benefits?  The whole workforce would 
have to become involved in it.  If they did not have an insurance 
policy they would not have coverage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member's 
preamble, with all due respect, but I do not quite understand the 
question.  Could he repeat it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if we change CPP, one of 
the changes could be the disability benefit part.  If it is to be 
replaced it would have to be with an insurance policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the cost of that insurance put jobs in jeopardy?  I do not 
think we could get it as cheaply as we are paying out for 
the same benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know what it would 
cost to provide disability insurance under a private plan.  I 
really could not say.  I would have to look at the actuarial 
tables and attachments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we as members of Parliament think that by increasing premiums 
to individuals and businesses to the tune of $700 annually will 
not have a major detrimental impact on a lot of the local 
communities in the country, we are dreaming in Technicolor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Kamloops for backing up so 
many of the concerns of the Reform Party.   We have been saying 
for months that the CPP increase was simply an increase in 
payroll taxes.  The member for Kamloops just confirmed that, and 
we appreciate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also talked about and will continue to talk about the 
detrimental effect this tax hike will have on jobs.  The member 
for Kamloops agrees.  He knows very well that taxes kill jobs. We 
thank him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also talked about people having much less disposable income 
and not having as much money to spend in their communities.  We 
thank him for that.  Perhaps we should invite him over to sit 
with us.  He sounds so much like a Reformer that I had to look 
twice to see who was doing the talking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did voice some concerns.  The Reform Party has come up with a 
very credible alternative to the government proposal.  As 
mentioned by the member for Calgary—Nose Hill, it has been 
submitted to think-tanks and the C. D. Howe Institute.  They have 
all said the numbers work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Precisely what alternative plan, if any, has the NDP Party 
created that it can offer as a viable and rational alternative to 
the disaster the Liberal Party has come up with?  What 
specifically?  Is there a plan?  Does the NDP have a plan or is 
it just simply criticizing, hoping to come up with one as soon as 
it can?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I first want to indicate to 
my hon. friend that the super RRSP solution is in our judgment 
not the answer.  Somehow there is the implication that the super 
RRSP would not be a cost to the Canadian taxpayer.  It would be a 
huge cost.  Even the present RRSP system is costing $18 billion a 
year in terms of lost revenue to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer my friend specifically, if he listened carefully he 
would have heard me say that the assumptions on which Bill C-2 is 
based were based on a model that we believe is incorrect.  We 
feel it is inappropriate that Reform based its recommendations on 
what we feel is a worst case economic scenario over the next 20 
years.  A much more modest set of changes along these lines would 
be acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in the public pension plan system.  My friend would 
know that while his plan was based on an example in Chile, we are 
suggesting what almost every European country that has gone 
through this process has adopted.  It is fair to say that the 
lifestyle in Europe is somewhat superior to the lifestyle in 
Chile without saying anything negative in particular about that 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in a public pension plan.  We believe that the Canada 
pension plan has worked well until recently.  The changing 
economic times require some changes.  I have yet to find a single 
Canadian who says they are not prepared to provide more premiums 
if they are guaranteed a pension when they retire.  Let's face 
it, the modest increases over the years have not kept up with the 
realities of the economy and the growth in the pension fund, but 
I find Canadians by and large quite accepting of this notion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the government has gone excessively too far.  That is 
why I say that we have a number of concerns we want to see 
addressed in committee.  We want to see the bill come back to the 
House after committee with a set of changes much more in 
tune with the economic reality of the future of the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
modifications that are proposed to the CPP will of course shrink 
a certain number of benefits.  Happily this is not so with the 
Quebec pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is with the Canadian pension plan super mutual fund 
that the government will put in place to manage those moneys. 
Our colleague from Kamloops rightly mentioned that taking $80 
million out of Kamloops will certainly affect the local economy. 
The only way that jobs will not be lost is to reinject that money 
in that area through this kind of mutual fund.  If they funnel 
the money to Toronto we will be in a lot of trouble throughout 
Canada, Quebec being a special case because we have our own 
organization there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does our colleague react to that?  Is he afraid Toronto will 
get it all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when you look at the way 
the federal government normally does its business, yes that is a 
fear in terms of patronage allotment of funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is we have to be more confident in the ability of 
the management team that will be there.  That is why I believe it 
requires very clear directives from Parliament in terms of how 
these funds are to be used.  I would think they should be 
directed to those areas of Canada that have experienced 
particular difficulties, in the smaller communities and the more 
rural areas, the more remote areas and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say with a great deal of satisfaction that we can look as an 
example to how the province of Quebec has used its investments 
with very clear direction to its management board as to how these 
funds ought to be utilized to the best benefit of Quebec business 
again with job creation as a major function of these investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to do that then a great deal of the $80 million that 
is being extracted from a community like Kamloops will be 
reinjected to assist local businesses and create the jobs that 
probably would have been lost by that removal of funds.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-2. 
I would like to speak to my constituents and to Canadians about 
the Canada pension plan. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians are concerned about the Canada pension plan. They 
are concerned about its features, about its security. Sometimes 
they get confused about how it relates to employment insurance, 
old age security, the GIS, RRSPs, RIFs and all of the other 
financial instruments that seem to be part of our daily dialogue 
in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also hear things like the plan is bankrupt or it will not 
be there for them when they get to retirement age.  These things 
are not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to start my comments to this House by assuring all 
seniors in Canada who are currently receiving benefits under the 
CPP system, whether they are survivor benefits or disability 
benefits or whether they have reached retirement age and are 
collecting benefits, that under the proposals before the House 
those benefits will remain unchanged. They will continue to be 
fully indexed and will continue to be there for them so that they 
can enjoy the security and dignity of their retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to clarify a few of the facts about the Canada pension 
plan system.  I have this concern that Canadians do not know 
enough about our Canada pension plan system, the very basics of 
what it is all about.  I want to review a bit of the background, 
a bit of the history, so they can have that level of confidence 
improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan which came in in 1966 has as its 
hallmark the fact that it is a universal program.  It is not an 
income redistribution program.  It is not like the OAS or the GIS 
which are available based on your level of income.  The CPP is 
available for participation by all working Canadians from the 
ages of 18 right up to 70.  It is a plan that requires 
contributions by an employer and an employee on a matched basis, 
and the self-employed individual pays the full amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should also know that the Canada pension plan system 
is a joint responsibility between the federal government, the ten 
provinces and our two territories.  Anything that happens in CPP 
requires the approval of two-thirds of the provinces, 
representing two-thirds of the population.  Canadians should be 
assured that the best interests of all Canadians in all regions 
are being taken care of as we move forward to renew the Canada 
pension plan system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the plan came in back in 1966 it had to respond to the 
realities of the day. Who was retiring in the mid-sixties?  It 
was Canadians who came through the depression of the thirties, 
through the war in the forties.  These are Canadians who had a 
totally different dimension of Canadian life during what we would 
consider as their prime working years.  It meant they did not 
have the kind of savings they otherwise would like to have had 
for retirement, and they had very little.  As a consequence of 
the plan's being set up in a way that would allow benefits to 
reach full pension entitlement by 1975, it was accelerated. 
Because of that acceleration and because there were so few people 
working and making contributions there was no possibility of 
fully funding the plan.  There was no possibility of asking 
Canadians to immediately put in dollars they needed for food and 
for basic subsistence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan first paid out in 1967 to those who were 68 years old, 
and the first pension paid to a 65 year old occurred in 1970. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan system is not just a pension.  Possibly 
it is misnamed.  Everyone knows that on reaching retirement, and 
you do have the option to retire early, currently you can get a 
pension of about $8,842. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the ability to retire early, up to age 60, and 
receive a reduced pension of 5 percent for each year of reduction.  A 
person can increase their pension entitlement by 5 percent each year if 
they defer their pension to age 70.  There is some flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very important tax planning point for all Canadians is that 
one spouse can split up to 50 percent of their Canada pension plan 
benefits with their spouse.  That is very important if the other 
spouse stayed at home to manage the family home and care for 
preschool children and, therefore, does not have a sufficient 
number of working years.  Possibly they did not work.  It allows 
the income to be split.  It is an important opportunity for 
Canadians to consider whether the income splitting of their 
pensions will reduce the tax burden on the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the pension portions there are important 
insurance components of the CPP.  There is a survivors benefit. 
If a spouse passes away there is a continuing benefit to the 
surviving spouse even if they are under 65 years of age.  There 
is also a benefit to the surviving children of $2,000 a year up 
to age 18 and up to age 25 if they are students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important components of the Canada pension plan 
system is the disability feature.  It means that Canadians who 
are in the unfortunate situation of having had a stroke or who 
are otherwise unable to earn an income can receive a disability 
benefit from the Canada pension plan.  They will receive the 
disability benefit until they reach age 65, at which time they 
will commence collecting the normal pension payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan is secure, it is indexed and Canadians should know 
that it is not just a pension.  We do not have to look simply at 
the money we put in and the pension we will get out. The plan is 
much more than simply a pension.  It is an insurance program.  It 
is there to protect Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my colleagues have talked about the funding as being pay 
as you go.  That is basically because in the start-up period that 
is exactly what was appropriate for that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have also noted that we have two years' worth of 
benefits.  There is some $40 billion of Canada pension plan 
contributions invested in provincial bonds at a federal rate. 
Members might be interested to know that in 1996 those bonds 
generated a return of 11 percent.  That is not nominal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the discussions we have had today have been around the 
investment board.  Canadians should understand that we are 
talking about getting into a more diversified portfolio of 
investments so there is a possibility to earn even higher rates 
of return.  The more income the fund generates within itself, the 
more dollars are available to keep the costs to the employee and 
employer down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue which I wanted to touch on briefly and 
that is the issue of the unfunded liability.  Because of the way 
the plan was structured, there is no money waiting to pay the 
benefits.  In fact about 30 years of benefits would have to be in 
place, which is a very substantial amount of money, and that 
cannot happen very quickly.  The compromise is to move to fuller 
funding than we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to talk a bit about the problems.  The chief actuary in 
this plan requires a 25 year schedule of rates which employees 
will pay.  The chief actuary has basically advised Canadians that 
although we pay at a rate of 5.85 percent, which is split equally 
between the employer and the employee, this rate will have to 
increase to 10.1 percent by about the year 2015, and by 2030 it will 
have to be raised to 14.2 percent.  Those are the mathematics which are 
in place now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members would agree that the 14.2 percent is much too high a burden 
to ask current workers to pay to fund their future pension 
entitlements. Fairness and equity are important issues and 
important challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to make comparisons we would note that Sweden has a 
21 percent contribution rate.  France has a 19.8 percent contribution rate. 
Admittedly they do not have old age security or the GIS. However, 
we can see that if there is a need to provide benefits and we 
have not planned that rates can go very high.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should understand the important thing is to determine 
how we can modify and how we can massage the current Canada 
pension plan system so that benefits will be there for each and 
every generation to come on a fair and equitable basis.  We do 
not want to pit seniors against youth and women against men or 
social groups who want all kinds of benefits which they feel they 
are entitled to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not here to pit Canadians against each other because of 
the difference in their age or the difference in their income 
level.  It is a universal program.  It is there for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  A gentleman whom I know very well, Mr. 
Phil Connell, who lives in my city of Mississauga appeared before 
the public hearings on this CPP review.  Mr. Connell said that 
his contributions to the Canada pension plan up until he retired 
some seven years accumulated to about $9,300.  He said “Yes, I 
get the employer's share which makes it $18,000 and that $18,000 
was earning some income”.  Mr. Connell also told the panel that 
his seven years of benefits from the CPP were $54,287, about five 
times more than he put in.  He called it scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand very well that as the plan grows, matures and 
things change that we do have to deal with that.  I repeat, 
Canadians, our current retirees, have to be assured that their 
benefits will not be affected by what we are doing in this place. 
They are going to continue at the current levels and they are 
going to continue to be indexed and they are going to continue to 
be there to protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some factors which have changed which we have to take 
into account as we make these changes. First, Canadians are 
living longer than they did in the past.  In fact we are living 
3.1 years longer in retirement.  In addition, it is expected that 
by the year 2030 we are going to live a further 1.4 years.  In 
total, Canadians will live about four and a half years longer in 
retirement than current retirees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously because of medical technology and so on, it means that 
Canadians as a whole are healthier and we are going to live 
longer.  That means retirement pensions are going to be drawn for 
longer periods of time.  It means that it is a higher burden on 
the Canada pension plan system to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The baby boomers are coming.  Everyone knows that.  There are 
going to be more seniors.  In fact today we have five workers for 
every pensioner. By the time we get to the peak we will only have 
three workers taking care of one pensioner. We see that these are 
natural things that have nothing to do with anybody's whim or 
whimsy.  It just happens to be the demographics of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan was planned to have a rate of somewhere 
around 5.5 percent but we have had changes. The low birth rates that we 
have had in Canada and people living longer have added another 
2.6 percent. We also have had slower growth in our worker output, lower 
interest rates in the sixties and even though it has risen in the 
seventies and eighties to around 6 percent it was very low in the early 
years. That has added an additional burden of about 2.2 percent. We have 
also enriched benefits for Canadians by indexing the Canada 
pension plan in 1975 and also providing survivor benefits in 
1975. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who could deny the disability benefits that are applicable? 
There are more claimants now and the claimants are for longer 
periods of time than ever was anticipated.  That has also added 
about 1.5 percent. All of these things have contributed to put pressure 
on the Canada pension plan system so that now is the time for us 
to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians are not deciding what we should do and why. 
There were public consultations and they happen every five years. 
There were some 33 sessions of public consultations between April 
15 and June 10 right across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People had all kinds of very interesting input.  I would like to 
highlight for members what the results of those consultations 
were.  First, the consensus was that the CPP system was worth 
saving.  That is very important. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, they said that the CPP should remain as a program that 
is not for redistribution of income but rather universal and 
available to all.  Therefore, it is not going to be income 
tested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, they said that it has to be fair across the generations 
and between men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, they said that it had to be affordable and sustainable 
for those future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, they asked that the administration be tightened up to 
make sure that it is efficient and that the 1 percent cost of 
administration is kept at that level or lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, they do not want ancillary benefits to jeopardize the 
principal benefit, being the pension income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh, they recommended that any future enhancements or 
enrichments of the CPP program must be fully funded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just some of the results of the cross Canada 
consultations that took place involving the federal government, 
the provincial governments and the territories.  These are the 
results of consultations with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is before the House are important recommendations for 
improvements and changes to the plan to make sure that it is fair 
and equitable among generations, that it is sustainable and that 
we do the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the act do not affect all present retirees as 
well as those on disability or who have survivor benefits.  Their 
pensions will remain indexed.  The ages for retirement will 
remain unchanged, despite the fact that there were rumours of the 
retirement age rising two, three, four or five years. There is no 
change in retirement age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to move to a fuller funding.  It will not be fully 
funded but there will be more funding than we have had in the 
past.  Instead of just two years of reserve, there will be up to 
five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also going to create the investment board.  That means 
that we will have professionals who are going to manage that fund 
to make sure we get a competitive return with other investors in 
the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contributions will rise over the next six years to 9.9 percent.  It 
will be on a gradual basis, not in one shot.  It will be on a 
gradual basis because that is the Canadian way.  We want 
Canadians to have a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I want to assure all seniors who have always been the 
targets of the unscrupulous and those who would take advantage of 
seniors because they may not understand what is happening.  I 
want them to know, on behalf of all parliamentarians here, that 
based on the consultations we have had across Canada we are here 
to act on behalf of the best interests of all seniors, of all 
youth and everyone in between.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Markham. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, when the Minister of Finance tabled his bill to amend 
the Canada pension plan last February, he claimed to have guaranteed the 
future of the three pillars of our retirement income system. Those three 
pillars are the Canada pension plan, old age security and the guaranteed 
income supplement, and the fiscal support mechanisms for retirement 
savings, such as the registered pension plans and RRSP's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has indeed proceeded with some major changes to our 
retirement income system, but like most of the things it did in the 
course of its first mandate, these changes are full of inequity, lack 
vision and are an unprecedented attack on those people who most deserve 
help from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding old age security and the guaranteed income supplement, 
the government announced in its 1996 budget that it would replace these 
two measures by a single seniors benefit. The government made a 
commitment at the time to introduce a bill and start public 
consultations on the new benefit in the fall of 1996. A year later, 
still no bill, still no consultation on legislation that will affect 
many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not want to proceed with thorough public 
scrutiny of the seniors benefit before the election. What was it afraid 
of? 
It was afraid that the truth would be revealed and Canadians would 
realize that with the new seniors benefit, single seniors with an income 
exceeding $31,000 would be disadvantaged, as would couples with a 
combined income of $26,000.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was also afraid we would discover that recovery of 20 percent of 
the benefits combined with the current rate of taxation would 
result in a real rate of taxation of 60 percent for middle income seniors. 
Nobody would want to save anymore for their retirement anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of tax breaks for retirement savings, the Liberals 
received $300 million in new taxes from seniors by deciding that 
the old age tax credit would be included in income.  Furthermore, 
the 1996 budget requires Canadians to convert their RRSP in the 
year they reach 69, whereas in the past they could wait to do so 
until they were 71. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also twice cancelled planned increases to RRSP 
contribution ceilings. 
The government has also considered more than once the possibility 
of taxing RRSPs.  Canadians have no choice but to take other 
measures to ensure long term retirement income before the end of 
their active life.  An ever growing number of Canadians have 
already understood and are contributing to registered retirement 
savings plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because of the regulations governing RRSPs, they are 
unable to get the best return on the market for their money. 
Restrictions on foreign holdings prevent them from creating a 
portfolio varied enough to reduce financial risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government is asking us to approve the principles of 
these changes to the Canada pension plan.  Although everyone agrees 
on the need for reform of our pensions, the government's approach 
contains some very disquieting elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Minister of Finance, the current CPP 
contribution plan should be changed in response to the concerns of 
the plan's chief actuary. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that Canadians will have to pay $11 billion more a 
year in CPP premiums without the benefit of other tax cuts to 
offset this hike.  In fact, this was such a contentious issue 
during negotiations with the provinces that the agreement, which 
was supposed to be reached in 1996, was only announced in 1997 by 
the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa's refusal to bring down EI premiums at the same time as 
CPP rates go up had been the biggest barrier to an agreement. 
Self-employed Canadians will be hard hit by this accelerated hike 
in premiums as they have to bear the burden of the combined 
employer-employee tax rate.  This means they will have to pay 
$3,270 a year in 2003, thus removing financial incentives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Self-employed individuals should be provided with greater tax 
assistance on what normally would be the employer share of 
contributions.  Premium increases also place a greater burden on 
the working poor which include women and young people. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, there are five people of job age for every retired 
person.  In twenty years or so, this will have changed to four workers 
for every retired person and, when today's young people retire forty 
years from now, the proportion will be three for every one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Future generations will bear the cost of the changes, because they 
will have to pay higher premiums, while receiving lower benefits.  The 
cost of changes will not be borne equally by the different generations, 
and this should be unacceptable to a government that says it is 
concerned about the future of young people.  Many of them have no faith 
in a public pension plan and who could really blame them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government promised that retired people and those over 
65 on December 31, 1997 would not be affected by the change.  The 
government also promised that those now receiving disability benefits 
would not be affected by the measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we know that 4,000 people are now waiting for their 
application for disability benefits to be heard by the CPP appeal 
tribunal, we are entitled to wonder whether the government is not trying 
to drag out the process so that people will receive reduced benefits 
under the new rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may well not be the government's intention, but we must point 
out that it is unacceptable that those waiting for disability benefits 
must wait up to four years for a settlement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This mismanagement does nothing to give the public faith in the 
ability of the present government to administer the CPP.  This lack of 
faith now extends to the government's proposal to modify substantially 
the structure, financing and investment of the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will forgive me for not believing what the government says 
about the benefits of reform.  I do not question that it is sincere in 
wanting to rectify the problems facing the CPP.  I just question its 
methods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to review the impact these changes will have 
on the most disadvantaged and to take action to ensure that the cost of 
restoring the viability of our pension plan is borne equally by all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
problem in terms of the baby boom generation coming up and 
creating a bulge in the Canada pension plan is something that has 
not been hidden from anyone.  It is something which has been 
obvious for years. The whole idea of the baby boom population 
burst has been talked about for at least a decade, certainly 
within my frame of reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the party across the way and the government have both 
been responsible for the boondoggle that has happened with regard 
to the CPP.  The way they set it up was intrinsically flawed.  It 
was set up as a pay as you go system rather than somebody's 
individual earnings and payments going into the plan to look 
after them in their retirement. It is a pyramid scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they were in government did they not realize this was 
coming to fruition?  Did they not see these things? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if we had been given a 
chance, I think we could have changed it in a positive way.  Our 
party believes there is a need for change in the system, but it 
is how the changes will be made and how they will affect 
Canadians, low income earners, youth a women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the government a while ago say that there was no 
problem because there was a lot of money in the fund.  We 
have heard it say no problem before.  We heard it with the last 
referendum in Quebec. We heard it with the EI, that there was no 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding in New Brunswick I have seen what the EI reform did 
to the citizens there. It was detrimental.  We want to make sure 
that the government listens to what Canadians have to say and 
make sure that Canadians are consulted.  There are problems in 
the way the plan is being presented.  Believe me, if it does not 
listen it will have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying to the government today to make sure that 
consultations continue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to welcome the new member for Madawaska—Restigouche to the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that having been here in the previous Parliament I should 
clarify some of the misconceptions which he expressed in his 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned that there were no consultations on the CPP 
changes. That is simply not true.  Members will know that the CPP 
is a joint program of the federal and provincial governments and 
the law requires that both agree.  Last spring a member of the 
government led consultations in every major city across the 
country.  Not only was he present but other members from the 
government side were present and their counterparts of the 
provincial governments came to hear the witnesses with them. 
Those witnesses included representatives of most seniors groups, 
and even some young people came to make their views known. 
Consultations were held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad that the member agrees that there is a need for 
reform. I feel that it is too bad that other members of his party 
when they had the chance to bring these reforms about 10 years 
ago did not see the light as he has.  He complains that we only 
brought forward the reforms in 1997 when they were due in 1996. 
There was an opportunity in 1986 to begin these changes which 
would have meant less dramatic changes had it been done then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member agrees that perhaps his party when it was 
in power should have moved then in order to lessen the burden 
today.

but not all cities were affected by the consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of my riding in northern New Brunswick did not hear 
about the consultations. All Canadians have a right to be 
consulted if it is going to affect their wallets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member says that consultations have been ongoing since 
1996.  If that is so, why are seniors throughout Canada very 
nervous about the changes being made to the CPP? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the effect which changes to the EI had on the citizens of 
Atlantic Canada.  We want to ensure that does not happen again. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the amendments 
proposed in Bill C-2 are simply not acceptable to the party to 
which I belong.  However, I agree that we have to decide on a 
course of action quickly. We should not prolong or delay the 
deliberation of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also sure that many Canadians will agree that the proposed 
changes will harm their retirement years. I would like to address 
three main points which arise from the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPP premiums will rise at a faster rate than originally planned. 
Taxpayer disposable income will be negatively affected as their 
budgets will need to be altered once again.  Changes in the way 
benefits are calculated will slightly reduce the pensions of 
future beneficiaries, reduce health benefits and make it harder 
to qualify for disabled benefits. This means that present 
contributors will be forced to pay more while being told they 
will receive less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 sends out messages to three groups.  First and perhaps 
most relevant are the working Canadians who over the next 20 
years will pay out more in CPP premiums and in the end receive 
less in benefits.  Even if current forecasts are incorrect, the 
previous pay as you go system which had today's workers paying 
for today's pensioners will be overhauled to become a fuller 
funding system, where today's workers will pay for today's and 
tomorrow's pensioners and will have nothing for themselves. It 
used to be a privilege for Canadian citizens to receive the CPP. 
Now it has become a burden for working Canadians as they must pay 
more and more as premiums increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the proposed changes in the legislation will force 
working Canadians to rely more heavily on workplace pensions and 
RRSPs.  Higher CPP premiums imposed on Canadians leave less 
disposable income for individuals to manage their own private 
retirement portfolios. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that benefits received will be based on the average of 
the past five years' earnings instead of three means that for 
most recipients pensions will be 3.7 percent lower than in the present 
system.  Therefore the need for private pension plans is even 
more relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I am concerned for the self-employed worker who will 
consequently be hit hardest by the changes proposed in Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that small businesses in Canada are stressed with 
payroll deductions, but now they must face yet another hike in 
expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are self-employed will be excessively strained for 
cash as they must contribute 100 percent of the proposed increases.  The 
self-employed individual must contribute both his or her portion 
plus the employer's contribution, who in this case is one and the 
same.  This means that by the year 2003 an additional $3,270 must 
come out of the pockets of small business owners based on the 
proposed figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What financial incentives do we offer Canadians who are 
self-employed or who are considering self-employment?  I would 
argue none.  This is a time when the self-employed are driving 
the economy, creating jobs and growing rapidly.  Self-employed 
individuals should be offered greater tax assistance on what 
normally would be the employer's share of the CPP contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to CPP benefits should not only impact on future 
generations but also on individuals currently collecting the 
Canada pension plan as well as those nearing pension 
eligibility.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working Canadians and future generations will be hard hit by both 
reduced benefits and increased contribution rates.  It is 
imperative that the government strive for fairness with the 
pension system.  This means that changes must be applied fairly 
to all Canadians. Higher contributions mean less disposable 
income, disposable income that could be used to save smartly for 
retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women will be hit hard by the proposed amendments.  It is a fact 
that not only do more men than women have workplace pensions, 
they also have more in those pensions.  Most women have very 
little disposable income to invest in RRSPs.  Economists have 
found that a small percentage of men and women will be 
financially secure upon retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are in need of legislation that secures future needs 
but will not rob them of their independence to manage their 
present and future plans.  Premium increases place greater burden 
on the working poor than on wealthy Canadians.  This is not a 
fair deal for Canadians as current recipients will not be 
affected but future benefits will be lower for Canadians taking 
into consideration inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our youth are another group that will be affected by the 
proposed legislation put forth by the government.  As I have 
alluded to, the cost of this fund will not be shared equally 
among the generations.  The burden of this tax grab will fall 
most heavily on young Canadians just entering the job market. 
Taking into account inflation and any possible changes in 
policies, today's young Canadians are faced with small or even 
negative real returns on their retirement investment under the 
Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must consider the following points with respect to the 
proposed amendments.  Canada pension plan premiums will rise at a 
faster rate than originally planned.  Changes in the way benefits 
are calculated will slightly reduce the pensions of future 
beneficiaries, reduce the death benefit and make it harder to 
qualify for disabled benefits.  The plan no longer will lend 
funds to the provinces at preferred rates. Those proposed changes 
offer nothing to make the Canada pension plan self-financing. 
They do nothing to offer CPP premiums with tax cuts and do not 
encourage greater RRSP savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians realize that it is imperative for them to begin 
planning for retirement in advance.  More and more we see that 
Canadians are striving to ensure stronger financial security in 
retirement via retirement savings plans.  However, it is becoming 
extremely difficult due to the rules governing RRSPs which are 
preventing Canadians from getting maximum potential returns on 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Restrictions on foreign content hinder diversification in a host 
of investment opportunities required to minimize financial risk. 
Our current government has twice reduced the annual contribution 
limits and is moving even closer to taxing RRSP savings.  This is 
unacceptable to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current foreign content limit of 20 percent reduces Canadian 
pension earnings by about $700 million per year.  If this rule is 
removed the market value of CPP could potentially increase by 20 percent 
to 25 percent.  The side effect of a foreign content rule reduces the 
competitiveness of Canadian companies as they have less incentive 
to be efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments to Bill C-2 raise questions as to the 
amount of money the current government can pull from the pockets 
of the middle class when at the same time it is cutting future 
retirement benefits.  The Liberals have no overall plan for the 
retirement of Canadians.  Honest working Canadians pay more 
today, receive less later and have less disposable income to do 
responsible planning for their retirement years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not rush into a plan without clearly knowing what the 
long term repercussions are.  The Canada pension plan must be 
fair and equitable to all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have one question for the hon. member with 
regard to the speech made earlier today by the leader of the 
Conservative Party.  He would increase the pension plan and 
contributions to the plan but at the same time he must give tax 
breaks in other forms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Conservative Party, of which 13 members are from 
Atlantic Canada, help us, the New Democratic Party, in pushing 
the government for a reduction of the HST?  The Liberals thought 
we were not bad enough off with the GST so they threw the HST on 
us as well. 
Will they assist us to get a reduction in the HST to help the 
pensioners and those with low incomes in Atlantic Canada?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know that we will help 
reduce the premiums for EI payments.  The HST which is the 
harmonized sales tax and the GST are performing a function which 
replaces the manufacturing tax.  I would like to see as we get to 
a balanced budget the revenues from the HST used to reduce the 
debt.  That is what I thought it was initially set up for.  In 
the long run by reducing the debt and the debt servicing costs we 
can reduce taxes for all Canadians.  That is what we must strive 
for. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
heard the comment of the leader of the Conservative Party that 
any increase in the rates of the Canada pension plan system would 
have to be offset by tax breaks. The leader of the Conservative 
Party did not articulate exactly what taxes he was talking about 
and how much.  It is an important question which has been raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we consider that the Canada pension plan premiums are 
contributed by those who are working, that is a defined set of 
people.  We should then also look at who is affected by tax 
breaks.  For example if there was a tax break on personal income 
taxes, there are people who do not work but have a lot of income 
because of investment income or other sources which are not 
insurable earnings. There are retirees as well who are paying on 
their corporate pension plan entitlements, CPP et cetera. Tax 
breaks would apply to a different set of people than those who 
are paying the rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member clearly explain to the House how we can match 
tax breaks specifically to cover the rate increases without 
creating a significant charge against expenditures or increase 
the deficit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Canada pension plan is a 
payroll tax and so is the EI premium.  What we are saying is that 
for a tax reduction, taking the $5 billion surplus of the EI and 
offsetting it against the deficit should stop now.  As we get 
into the balanced budget benefit that is supposed to be 
forthcoming, that should be done on its own.  To create jobs 
maybe we should reduce the premium on the EI and offset it 
against the Canada pension fund which workers and organizations 
will have to pay.  Both are payroll taxes.

the retirement policies and plans of all Canadians.

two-thirds of Canadians do not believe that it would be

</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to meet the responsibility, our government has heeded 
the concerns of the plan's chief actuary that the unbalanced

the long term sustainability of the plan must be addressed. 
“Changes are needed”, he said, “if we want to ensure the 
Canada pension plan's ability to meet the income security needs 
of Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Expert analysis has shown us that the rules of our plan need to 
be updated to reflect the realities of today's world as well as 
tomorrow's.  We are not only fixing today's problem. We are 
putting in place a plan for the future. We cannot continue to 
operate as though we are living in an economic and demographic 
situation that existed some 30 years ago when the plan was first 
introduced.  We need to meet today's economic and demographic 
demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government we accept the responsibility of securing the 
future of the Canada pension plan.  We are not afraid to take the 
challenges of responsibility.  We took the challenge of dealing 
aggressively with the deficit and we met it.  We took the 
challenge of government program review, the challenge of getting 
government right, and we met it.  Now we are taking the challenge 
of securing the future of the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the Canada pension plan contained in this bill 
will enable us to meet that challenge.  With the support of this 
House, we will meet our responsibility to Canadians to make sure 
that the Canada pension plan will be here for them when they need 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize that we have not developed these proposed 
changes in isolation.  These amendments are the result of a long 
and wide ranging process of consultation that began in our last 
term of office.  This process of consultation included talks with 
the provincial governments, our counterparts, territorial 
governments, actuarial and insurance professionals, 
representatives of social planning organizations, seniors, youth, 
persons with disabilities and a large number of others who had 
something they could bring to the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, we have consulted broadly with Canadians on the future 
of the Canadian pension plan and on the need for change.  One of 
the clearest messages that we received during the consultations 
is that Canadians want and need the Canada pension plan.  We were 
told in no uncertain terms to keep the CPP.  Change it if 
necessary but keep it. So that our objective is met to keep the 
CPP but also to make the changes necessary to make it 
sustainable, the plan now before us and in the future is here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan's chief actuary has told us that if we do not rebalance 
the relationship between contributions on one side and payouts on 
the other, the fund will not last beyond the year 2015.  Put 
simply, current contribution rates are not sufficient to sustain 
the current benefit payouts now or in the future. Let me express 
that again.  Current contribution rates are not sufficient to 
sustain the benefits and payouts now or in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To keep the current benefit structure, the chief actuary has 
told us that we will need to increase contributions to 14 percent of 
income by the year 2030. Fourteen percent of one's income is too 
high and we know that. Once more, Canadians are unwilling to pay 
14 percent. Therefore to have rebalance in a relationship between what 
Canadians can reasonably expect to pay and the plan 
contributions, we must plan reasonably the form that this benefit 
is taking.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member across the way asks when did we realize this. It is 
very clear.  When we came to government three and a half years 
ago, we realized there was a problem and so we did these 
consultations.  We have been working on this issue.  We have been 
doing the things necessary while the other government previous to 
ours left it.  It did not have the nerve to straighten things out 
and correct things. Quite clearly we have done a great deal of 
consultation and we are moving forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That rebalanced relationship is very important to where these 
benefits are going and what is happening.  As it is, Bill C-2 
addresses this by proposing marginal increases in contribution 
rates to be phased in over a period of seven years.  In this way 
contributions will increase by .4 percent this coming year or about $24 
and will go up to 9.9 percent of income by the year 2003.  This is 
compared to the current rate of 5.85 percent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues opposite have described this increase as a 
tax grab.  I want to be very clear on the record that this is not 
a tax issue.  CPP contributions are not a tax. They are 
contributions toward pensions.  I guess they do not understand 
pension contributions but that is what they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premium payments will not go into the government's general 
revenue.  They will not be used in any form other than CPP. In 
fact the bill states that the savings will become part of a 
separate investment fund to be managed and invested on behalf of 
the plan by an independent body.  CPP contributions represent an 
interested investment by Canadians in their own future.  It is 
not a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contributing to CPP is not paying tax.  It is planning prudently 
for the future of Canadians.  CPP contributions are like 
insurance premiums. They are invested to provide for future 
needs. Contributions to company pension plans are not taxes. They 
are deductible in a similar way that CPP contributions are tax 
deductible investments in the future. I think it is important 
that Canadians understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having cleared up one of the mistaken impressions, I would like 
to turn now to clearing up another.  That is the mistaken 
impression that the benefits under the revised plan are going to 
be cut drastically.  Anyone who studies the bill will realize 
that the changes being proposed to the benefits are modest.  In 
many cases benefit payouts would not change at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example CPP retirement pension disability benefits, survivor 
benefits or combined benefits currently paid are not affected by 
these amendments.  Also anyone over 65 as of December 31, 1997 
who elects to start receiving a CPP retirement pension after that 
date will not see the pension affected. All benefits under the 
CPP, except the death benefit, would remain fully indexed to 
inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ages of eligibility for retirement, early, normal or late, 
would be unchanged.  Canadians would continue to be eligible for 
early retirement starting at age 60, normal retirement age would 
be age 65 and late retirement eligibility would continue up to 
age 70.  There would be no impact on the child benefits either 
for current beneficiaries or future ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These basic features of the CPP would remain the same but there 
are some changes that are being proposed by the legislation.  We 
cannot bring the program back into balance without making some 
adjustments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During our consultations we were told that we should go easy on 
making the changes. Canadians recognize the need for adjustments 
but they did not want to see a drastic change.  We listened to 
the advice and have given some thought to all of the approaches 
we could take to balance the system.  We believe we will 
accommodate that concern through this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we recognize the proposed changes should not 
impact unduly on anyone or any group in society.  Thus the impact 
of the changes will be shared among future retirees, future 
survivors of retirees and recipients of disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As noted earlier, anyone currently in receipt of retirement 
pension under the CPP will not see that pension change.  However, 
retirement pensions for future beneficiaries would change since 
the calculation would be based on five years of maximum 
pensionable earnings instead of the current three years.

<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in a 1993 Liberal Party press release the prime minister 
described the decision to purchase much needed maritime 
helicopters as a colossal waste of taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since he made that statement his government has slashed health 
care transfers to the provinces by 35 percent.  Simultaneously he spent 
over a billion dollars only to delay the necessary replacement of 
Canada's aging Sea King and Labrador helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our health care system is viewed by many as the best in the 
world.  It is one of the most important achievements in our 
history and a cornerstone of Canadian society.  Preserving and 
improving health care are top priorities for Canadians and must 
be judged as important to every government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last three years the current government cut health care 
funding to every province and territory.  It has hacked more than 
one-third out of health transfers to the provinces and 
territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last three budgets of the Minister of Finance these 
federal transfers were cut by more than $6 billion.  This has put 
extra pressure on provincial governments, health care 
institutions, health care providers and, most of all, patients 
and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As provincial and territorial governments struggle to absorb the 
federal spending cuts and community hospital cuts, many Canadians 
fear the health care system they has come to count on may not be 
there when they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That begs a question.  Has the government taken every measure 
necessary to secure funding for our health care system?  Has the 
government spent taxpayers' money wisely and only cut health care 
transfers as a last resort?  The answer unfortunately is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, in the heat of an election campaign, the prime minister 
made a hasty campaign promise to scrap the purchase of 43 
maritime helicopters needed to replace the Department of National 
Defence aging Sea King and Labrador helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision to cancel this purchase was not made on sound 
judgment as part of an overall strategy for Canada's military. It 
was not a decision based on what is best for the value of 
taxpayers' money.  It was made for purely partisan political 
reasons.  The prime minister made the unwise decision but 
Canadians have been paying the price ever since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Liberal government took office there have been more 
than 511 emergency landings for the Sea Kings and 259 emergency 
landings for the Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original deal on helicopters was not just a purchase but an 
opportunity for Canadians to co-develop proprietary technology 
for the EH-101.  Canadians have lost forever the 10 percent job 
royalties guaranteed to them from all international sales of 
EH-101 helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deal would have created 4,000 person years in new, high paid 
technology driven jobs.  Instead the government must deal with 
the additional cost of lost jobs, closed companies and lost tax 
revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, after four years of delay, the government is poised to 
announce two new helicopter contracts to replace the Sea Kings 
and Labradors.  The price of this delay, we now know, is more 
than a billion dollars to Canadian taxpayers in cancellation 
fees, additional maintenance costs and lost jobs and tax 
revenues. 
What did we get for $1 billion?  Nothing, not a single 
helicopter.

care transfers.  This is a time when government must make hard 
choices about how to use scarce health funds.

money that could have benefited our health care system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government 
understands that Canadians want their tax dollars well spent 
whether on health care or defence.  The government is committed 
to ensuring that Canadians get the most value for their dollars. 
This means in part making sure that Canadians forces have the 
right equipment for the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces are often called upon to perform difficult 
and sometimes dangerous work.  If they are to do what Canadians 
expect them to do, they must have the tools to do the job at a 
price we can afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the international commitments Canadians are well aware of 
and justifiably proud of, our forces first and foremost carry out 
a full slate of missions at home.  Among the more important of 
them is the national search and rescue service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Search and rescue is of paramount importance to thousands of 
Canadians from those who make their living in the remote regions 
of the country, be it at sea, on land or in the air, to the many 
Canadians who simply enjoy boating, camping, fishing and the 
great outdoors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 50 years Canadian forces provided primary search 
and rescue helicopter services to Canadians.  They have truly 
established a tradition of excellence and have saved many lives 
over the years.  This success can be attributed directly to the 
unselfish effort of highly skilled and dedicated search and 
rescue personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can cite a few examples of the last couple of years to 
highlight their achievements.  They have provided vital 
lifesaving, morale boosting and support during the devastating 
floods in the Saguenay and the Manitoba Red River Valley in July 
1996 and the spring of 1997 respectively.  These success stories 
are remarkable, particularly when we think of the unique 
challenges we face in Canada.  Our geography comes immediately to 
mind, a huge land mass and one of the longest coastlines in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces must be able to operate in extremely harsh 
conditions including the Arctic.  They must be prepared to 
respond to emergencies anywhere in the nation.

<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to bring light to the crisis facing the 
east coast fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question last week to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
was for him to call a judicial inquiry into the past and current 
practices and policies of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
With all four opposition parties plus scientists and bureaucrats 
from within the departments, plus the Department of the 
Environment, not to mention thousands of fishers in Atlantic 
Canada and Quebec calling for the same inquiry, it appears to all 
of us that only the minister is opposed to calling an inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His position reminds me of a line I heard in a movie which 
indicates to me that he cannot handle the truth.  Only an open 
judicial inquiry would allow scientists from within the 
department to state openly their concerns without fear of job 
retribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only an inquiry will be able to find solutions to the crisis not 
only on the east coast but on the west coast as well.  Our stocks 
of various species of fish are reaching dangerously low levels 
and without strong measures may never recover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of human resources announced the other day that he 
has hired an individual to look at the concerns facing the 40,000 
fishers on our east coast as the income supplement known as TAGS 
runs out one year prematurely in May 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that he did this to deflect certain criticism bound to 
come to the government from the upcoming attorney general's 
report.  The report coming out this week is sure to be very 
critical of the government's handling of not only the TAGS 
program but the management, or should I say mismanagement, of the 
groundstock species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A system such as the individual transfer quotas or ITQs have 
taken 50 percent of the total quotas away from individual fishers and 
moved them into the hands of a handful of corporations.  As well, 
20 percent of additional quotas are sold from individual fishers to the 
corporations.  In truth the corporations control 70 percent of the total 
allowable catch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the modern high tech methods incorporated in today's 
fishing industries, tonnes of fish can now be caught 
indiscriminately within a matter of hours using no more than a 
couple of dozen fishers, where before fish were caught more 
selectively using hook and line methods, using the services of 
hundreds of fishers and smaller vessels.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nets used by draggers on the huge trawlers sometimes break 
away from the ship, lying on the ocean floor, indiscriminately 
killing anything in their path, not to mention the trawler gear 
that rips up the ocean floor, destroying precious corral and reef 
habitats.  Just last week two whales off the east coast were seen 
tangled up in nets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other examples of concern are the dumping of by-catches which is 
still ongoing.  As well, the number of gun-toting fishing 
officers is ever increasing.  It is also true that with the 
hundreds of different organizations involved in the fishing 
industry there are hundreds of different ideas of what should 
happen to cure the ills affecting the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I ask all parties involved in the fishery on all three 
coasts to put aside their differences and work together to come 
up with a viable long term sustainable solution not only to bring 
back the stocks but to provide long term employment for as many 
Canadians as possible.  I believe this process would be greatly 
enhanced by an inquiry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, most of the points 
raised by the member opposite speak to the need of the government 
to provide good conservation and management of the fisheries. 
That is certainly what this minister of fisheries is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the TAGS issue, first and foremost, the Atlantic 
groundfish strategy is under the purview of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.  The prime minister has recently appointed 
the minister of HRD as the lead on the post-TAGS issue. The 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will be working very closely 
with Minister of Human Resources Development providing fisheries 
advice to him and his officials on options as they are developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government announced TAGS in April 1994 and promised $1.9 
billion in income support and adjustment measures under the 
program.  The government is living up to that commitment. 
Unfortunately, because of the larger than expected number of 
participants, TAGS will end in May 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government remains very concerned about the impacts of the 
end of TAGS on individuals and communities and last May promised 
a post-TAGS review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday the Minister of HRD appointed a senior HRDC official 
to lead this review of the post-TAGS situation, starting 
immediately.  Mr. Harrigan will be looking at the situation as it 
affects the five eastern provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The review will focus on the impact of the end of TAGS program 
on clients and help the government and our other partners develop 
forward looking solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for us to reflect on the human dimensions 
of this crisis on individuals and communities.  We look forward 
to working with all our partners, including industry and the 
province, to address the solution of Atlantic fishers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the reason we are here today at what we like to call the 
question period late show is that we have been unable to get any 
straight answers from the government for a solid week on the 
matter of Canadian passports being used by Israeli agents in 
Jordan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day we have stood and asked straightforward 
information-gathering questions of the prime minister, of the 
foreign affairs minister, of whomever the files seemed to be 
pawned off on that particular day.  One day we even heard from 
the Secretary of State for Latin American and Africa, a mistake 
only remedied when the government finally realized that neither 
Israel nor Jordan are in Latin America or Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, they have been evasive, sloppy and inaccurate.  They 
have embarrassed our country at home and on the world stage in 
their handling of the matter.  After more than a week our 
questions remain outstanding and unanswered.  They have been 
asked in good faith on behalf of concerned Canadians both at home 
and abroad and deserve a reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the issue is delicate, that Israel and Canada are 
strong allies economically, culturally, politically, and of 
course allies in the fight against international terrorism. 
Canadians believe in the State of Israel and its right to defend 
itself against attack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concerns have centred on the fact that Canadian passports 
have been used to engage in covert operations.  By using Canadian 
passports as part of their cover, Israeli agents have made 
Canadians unwitting players in a very dangerous game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian passport like the maple leaf is a trusted symbol of 
our country.  Our passport enjoys unparalleled respect the world 
over, undoubtedly a reason that the Mossad found it useful. 
Using Canadian passports may be good for counter-terrorist 
missions, but it unfortunately jeopardizes the reputation of our 
passport and of Canadians who travel abroad every year.  That 
means it jeopardizes the safety of those Canadian travellers as 
well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the House that we have taken actions to protect

Israel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can confirm to the hon. member that the Israeli minister of

that as a Canadian he should stay indoors because his safety 
might be threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked to Ron four or five times, almost every day, to 
find out how things have changed. Ron did contact foreign 
affairs, both over there and here in Ottawa.  He called the prime 
minister's office for action.  When he received no answers, he 
contacted the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After communicating with Ron we were shocked to find that so 
little had been done to protect Canadians in Jordan and elsewhere 
in the Middle East.  In fact, we can think of nothing that was 
done at all. Ron says that the only help he received was the same 
advice he got from the police:  Stay inside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jordanian acquaintances told him there was talk of killing 
westerners.  Meanwhile, he said, the embassy would not even pay 
for him to call the foreign affairs department in Canada. When 
Ron Ready really needed the foreign affairs department, foreign 
affairs was inept and unavailable for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very least, Ron thought the Canadian government should 
issue a travel advisory so that other Canadians would not wander 
into the situation, but foreign affairs refused to do it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When an incident takes place anywhere in the world and Canadians 
are at risk I believe that the government should do what it can 
to help them.  Instead of taking action the government stalled. 
Instead of thinking about how life would be for Canadians stuck 
in this situation, the government was only hoping that no one 
would ask the difficult questions that would embarrass it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the media and the official opposition did not push for 
answers I doubt the government would have told us about this 
situation at all.  The government waited for days, hoping no 
questions would come.  It did not even think for a moment about 
the implication and the threats this placed on Canadian passport 
holders travelling abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think the government owes it to Canadians to get an assurance 
from Israel that our passports will not be used in covert 
operations ever again.  A Canadian passport is too important to 
be muddied doing the dirty work in undercover operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government what specific actions it will take to 
ensure this will not happen again. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can assure the House 
that the government is very concerned about the safety of 
Canadians travelling abroad.  We have taken significant action 
to protect the integrity of our passports and the safety of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs at the United Nations last week 
had extensive consultations with Arab governments and the Arab 
language press to assure them that there was no complicity on 
the part of Canada in this incident. As a result, the Arab 
governments and the Arab people realize that Canada was not 
involved in the attack in Jordan and will not hold us 
responsible.  This diplomatic effort was the most important step 
in ensuring the safety of Canadians travelling and living in the 
Middle East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Travel reports on eight Middle Eastern countries: Egypt, Israel, 
Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Yemen were 
updated on October 5 to inform the public of the recent incident 
in Jordan, to clarify Canada's non-complicity and to remind 
Canadians to be prudent and vigilant when travelling in the 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the prime minister told the House, it is unacceptable to the 
Government of Canada for anybody authorized by a foreign 
government to use Canadian passports to perpetrate an illegal 
act.  The hon. member will be aware that we have recalled our 
ambassador to Israel for consultations. This is a very serious step in 
international law and diplomacy designed to send the signal that 
we will not tolerate the fraudulent use of Canadian passports. We 
do believe this message has been heard in Israel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs has obtained a commitment from 
the Israeli foreign minister to set up a consultative process 
with us to ensure that we can have a common understanding to 
prevent misuse of Canadian passports in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
again I would like to raise the same issue we have been talking 
about, the seriousness of the passport problem we have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It amazes me that the parliamentary secretary, although I 
appreciate the effort he is making, has written answers already 
to questions which he did not really know were coming.  I am 
rather amazed by that.  He was not sure what the questions were 
that were coming but he has full blown written prepared answers 
for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for him with which I want to preface some of 
my remarks.  I trust he will throw away the prepared text and 
give me a real answer for a very real question.  This is the 
whole idea of a question period which is a little fuller and 
called the late show.  The comedy of errors that we have seen 
over the last few days here in this Chamber leads me to believe 
that David Letterman is really the guy who is in charge of 
foreign affairs over there because of the absurdity of some of 
things we have seen come forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition does understand the importance of 
supporting our allies in the fight against terrorism.  We 
understand that, we know it and we support it.  But as Canadian 
members of Parliament our first duty is to make sure of the 
safety of our citizens, which means protecting the good 
reputation of our passport everywhere in the world, every day of 
the week, every month of the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we first raised this issue in the House just several days 
ago, the prime minister assured us that no Canadian agents were 
involved in this anti-terrorist mission or the illegal use of 
Canadian passports.  That is an important thing for us to find 
out but of course there have been questions arising from that. 
After all if Canada does have a secret agreement with other 
countries to help fight terrorism that changes things.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, if Canadian agents were involved in this mission somehow 
then that puts this Jordan operation in a different light as 
well.  We need to find those answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very first time we put the question to the prime minister he 
said that Canadians had nothing to do with this mission.  When 
the Leader of the Opposition asked whether or not Canada had been 
asked for permission by a foreign country to use our passports he 
said: “I have never been informed of any such request by any 
government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we find out that CSIS agents did indeed meet with the 
Mossad agents on the very eve of the mission.  Surely in a 
meeting between Israeli and Canadian spy agencies on the eve of 
such a mission this issue might have come up in the conversation. 
Yet the prime minister told us in this House that it never came 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the parliamentary secretary is very simple.  I 
trust that he is going to give us a straight answer here, not off 
prepared notes because he did not know what the question was. The 
question is simple and straightforward.  There has been a 
flip-flop on the government side.  First the prime minister said 
he had never been informed of any such request by any government 
and then we find out that the CSIS and the Israeli agents are 
talking to each other on the very eve of this mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the parliamentary secretary how in the world can they 
expect us to believe that the subject of this major raid against 
Hamas did not even come up in their meeting? 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would advise the hon. 
member that I have been briefed on this matter for fully a week. 
The answers that I am giving reflect the knowledge of facts such 
as they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have some personal interest to me as somebody who has 
advised numbers of governments on international terrorism and its 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we first became aware of this matter we were advised by the 
Jordanian government of the arrest of two persons carrying 
Canadian passports, and Canadian diplomatic consul officials in 
Jordan made contact with these people through the offices of the 
Jordanian government and offered the usual diplomatic consular 
help, the offer of legal assistance and the like.  It was refused 
categorically at that stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will stick to facts because we cannot get into hypothetical 
situations.  We were shown the passports by Jordanian government 
officials in the early stages of the investigation.  Our 
examination then indicated that the passports were forgeries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to inform the hon. member that we have now obtained the 
two passports used in Jordan.  We have submitted them to our own 
forensic examination and that has confirmed the initial 
evaluation that the passports are forgeries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have, from the facts as they are already known, indicated our 
concern to the Government of Israel and we have spoken loudly 
and clearly to the Government of Israel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member will be aware that we have recalled our 
ambassador to Israel for consultations.  It is not a formal step. 
It is a very serious step in international law and diplomacy and 
it is intended to send a signal that we do not want Canadian 
passports tampered with in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am informed that 
we do not have points of order in adjournment proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted.  Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.59 p.m.)
