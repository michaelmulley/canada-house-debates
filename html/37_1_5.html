<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 1 consideration of the motion 
for an address to Her Excellency the Governor General in reply 
to her speech at the opening of the session and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is the first time I have rise in the House 
since your election.  I am delighted to see you in the chair. 
You have demonstrated great skill in the role as the Deputy 
Speaker.  We look forward to one of the most productive 
parliaments that one could possibly expect as a result of your 
leadership and your skills as Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise to speak on the Speech from the Throne.  As 
Minister of the Environment it is my particular responsibility to 
concern myself with Canada and our natural heritage from coast to 
coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are blessed to live in a country that is rich in nature, 
wilderness and ample resources.  This rich natural heritage is a 
sacred trust passed from one generation to the next.  Indeed, as 
former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau used to remark 
“geography and nature defines us as Canadians”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians, we understand that protecting the environment is 
not an option.  It is a must-do. Nothing is more fundamental in 
this country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why one of the key planks in the government's plan for 
its third mandate is to ensure a clean, healthy environment for 
Canadians and the preservation of our natural species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For its part the Government of Canada has already made 
significant investments in the environment by supporting 
community initiatives, funding research, facilitating the 
development of new environmental technologies, supporting 
international environmental initiatives, and strengthening 
measures to reduce air and water pollution. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our work is paying off.  Just last month at the world economic 
forum in Davos, Switzerland, a study was released which shows 
that, together with Finland and Norway, Canada is one of the top 
three countries in environmental sustainability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada ranks third on an environmental sustainability index, the 
most comprehensive global report comparing environmental 
conditions and environmental performance across 122 countries. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can be proud of that progress, but we should not be content 
to rest on our laurels.  I would like to speak today to how the 
government intends to build on this and other environmental 
achievements to ensure the preservation of our vast landscape and 
the wealth of our natural resources for future generations to 
come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically I will address clean air and clean water, the 
conservation of Canada's parks and species at risk, health 
protection and climate change. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is to help Canadians push the frontiers of 
environmental science and technology.  Let me stress that 
science must be the foundation of all our environmental 
policies. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not have the science right we obviously will not get 
the policies right.  By investing in our science capacity and 
sustainable practices we can harness the power of science to 
support our environmental goals and to protect and promote the 
health of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Science is already showing us that children do not react the 
same way as adults to toxic substances.  They are not small 
adults.  They are at the most delicate stage of development and one 
of the most at risk groups. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its third mandate the first key step for the government will 
be to fill critical research gaps that exist now so that we can 
assist in developing the appropriate standards to safeguard the 
special vulnerabilities of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our science also tells us that some 5,000 Canadians annually die 
prematurely because of air pollution. 
Hundreds of thousands of others suffer from aggravated asthma, 
and I am one of them, bronchitis, and other respiratory 
illnesses. Now we are learning that air pollution affects our 
health at lower levels than we previously thought.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has already launched the beginnings of a clean air 
strategy.  It addresses transboundary pollution, vehicle and 
fuel standards, industrial sectors and the science of air 
quality.  In so doing, it engages Canadians and the communities 
in which they live to become part of the solution. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also reached other important national and bilateral 
agreements related to air pollution.  In December I had the 
pleasure and privilege of signing on behalf of Canada the ozone 
annex to the 1991 Canada-United States air quality agreement, 
committing both our countries to significantly reducing the 
creation of smog causing pollutants in the eastern half of this 
continent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our new mandate the Government of Canada will move quickly to 
implement that ozone annex and to extend it to the western part 
of the continent.  The annex complements many other initiatives 
already underway to improve air quality in Canada itself, 
including the Canada-wide standards for particulate matter and 
ozone agreed to by the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments only some six months ago. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quality of our air is rightly one of the top concerns of 
Canadians.  So is the quality of our water.  Indeed, the quality 
of our water is now preoccupying Canadians from all walks of 
life and all levels of government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to working with all 
partners and all levels of government to protect Canadians from 
the dangers of polluted water.  During their June 2000 meeting 
the federal, provincial and territorial ministers of the 
environment agreed to establish three task groups to deal with 
water management issues including water quality, demand, use 
management and preventable measures for water hazards such as 
flooding.  We have put some $135 million into supporting 
municipal projects through the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities that protect the environment such as waste water 
treatment and solid waste management. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne commits the government to do more and 
to take leadership in developing stronger national guidelines 
for water quality.  Drawing on expertise within the government 
and across Canada we will significantly strengthen the role of 
the National Water Research Institute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will invest in research and development to protect surface 
water and groundwater supplies from industrial and farming 
activities.  We will fund further improvements to municipal 
water and waste water systems. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also taking action to protect fragile ecosystems.  We 
have created seven new parks.  We have also provided Parks Canada 
with an additional $130 million over four years to establish new 
parks, manage the existing ones and build on our scientific 
capacity within the parks system.  My neighbour, the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, will no doubt be saying more on this later in 
this debate.  I look forward to hearing her remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Government of Canada is committed to protecting 
species at risk through strong and effective legislation, 
stewardship to protect habitat, a productive recovery process in 
partnerships with provinces, territories, stakeholders and 
aboriginal groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress the importance of effective legislation.  Duplicating 
less effective legislation elsewhere simply because it appears to 
be stronger is not the way to go.  Let us learn from the mistakes 
of others, craft something totally Canadian and effective on the 
ground, which is where we can protect species and the battle 
lines can be drawn. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be reintroducing the species at risk act in the House 
today, but I want to point out that our strategy to protect 
species at risk is already producing good results.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation is supported on the ground through voluntary 
activities by conservation groups and individuals who are taking 
action to help protect species, protect habitat and conserve 
biodiversity where it matters most:  on the land, in our streams, 
oceans and forests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our strategy balances strong regulations with voluntary measures 
and incentives.  When Canadians, for example, donate ecologically 
sensitive lands to an environmental group, they can now benefit 
from a 50% reduction in capital gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the Minister of Finance for his recognition of the 
importance of this measure in getting the goodwill and 
co-operation of landowners in the battle to protect habitat of 
species, endangered and otherwise. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn now to the issue of global warming.  Canada is 
extremely concerned about climate change, and with good reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The North, and our country is a northern country, is the area 
which perhaps is experiencing the most severe impacts of climate 
change.  We see that the ice is melting.  Polar bears are 
starving.  The traditional lifestyle of aboriginal peoples is 
threatened.  The fauna and flora are highly disturbed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a northern nation we are on the frontline of the impact of 
climate change.  We have taken action to respond and will take 
more action throughout the coming decade.  We are beginning to 
see results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Kyoto we have succeeded in decoupling economic growth from 
emissions growth in Canada. Indeed that has dropped to one-fifth 
of what it was before.  Previously for every 1% increase in gross 
domestic product we would see a 1% increase in emissions.  Now 
for every 1% growth in GDP we see one-fifth of that.  Indeed that 
is a dramatic change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has become a leader in the science and modelling of 
climate change.  Last fall we adopted the first national climate 
change action plan. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This $500 million action plan captures many of the best ideas 
that came out of a consultation process with representatives of 
industry, environmental organizations, aboriginal people, 
municipalities, academic institutions and other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We engaged all our provinces and territories in the effort.  All 
relevant federal departments were involved in preparing the 
action plan. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No other country in the world has gone through such an extensive 
process to develop its national plan.  This means that once the 
decisions are made we will have an already high level of buy in 
and acceptance and hence, we trust, a smoother path to 
implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The action plan targets key sectors that will provide both 
environmental and economic benefits.  As a result Canadians will 
enjoy cleaner air and water.  They will save money from energy 
efficiency and increased use of renewable energy technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately our climate change action plan will make the Canadian 
economy more innovative and more competitive on the world scale. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When fully implemented, the plan will take Canada one-third of 
the way to achieving the target established in the Kyoto 
protocol.  It will reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 
about 65 megatonnes annually during the commitment period of 
2008 to 2012. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a major step forward that sets the stage for future 
reductions and reflects the seriousness with which Canada takes 
its international commitments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the world stage we have championed a comprehensive approach 
to climate change that will lead to practical action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must confess disappointment at the results of the meeting in 
The Hague where inflexibility on the part of the European Union 
did not allow for an agreement between the United States and the 
countries of the umbrella group and the European Union. 
Nevertheless that is a minor setback.  We will continue to play 
the role of bringing people together on climate change and other 
key environmental issues because Canadians have told us they 
want Canada to take a leadership role in protecting the global 
environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn now to an important tool to promote 
development that is sustainable, and that is environmental 
assessment. By bringing the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act into force 
in 1995, this government has ensured that the environmental 
effects of our actions are fully considered before decisions are 
taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year the Government of Canada assesses almost 6,000 
projects each with the potential to affect our air, our health, 
our water, our wildlife and natural spaces.  Project by project, 
and step by step, we are using environmental assessment to avoid 
adverse effects of development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will report to the House soon on the outcome of the recent

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I will tell a story that captures the essence of 
these issues.  It demonstrates the holistic nature of 
environmental issues today, and the need to embrace new ways of 
thinking and new alliances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Georgia Basin ecosystem initiative from the west coast of 
Canada, an area which we share with the United States, is a 
partnership among the federal and provincial governments, 
business and industry leaders, first nations, citizens

</I></B></P><P align=left>The initiative tackles environmental issues such as clean water 
and air and species at risk.  At the same time, it addresses the 
social and economic needs of communities within the Georgia 
Basin. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one of their projects, they have developed an interactive

Community members have had the chance to plug in their choices 
and see the kind of world they can create for the Georgia Basin 
by the year 2040. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like that project for a number of reasons.  First, it is a 
great management tool that will be useful for decision makers. 
Second, it is a motivator of ordinary citizens.  It gets people 
involved and shows them the consequences of their potential 
actions.  In that way it allows a higher level of debate about 
society and its goals. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the months and years ahead, as we struggle to protect the 
myriad aspects of our environment, we need to use all the 
available tools.  We need to embrace innovation, whether it comes 
from a computer model or an aboriginal elder.  Finally, we need 
to promote the notion of personal stewardship among all 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our ancestors have thrown us the torch.  It is for us to hold it 
high, to keep it burning brightly and to pass it on to our

are committed to that task.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the environmental 
situation that the minister has pictured is as rosy as he would 
lead us to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage every interested member of the public to obtain a 
copy of the environmental commissioner's report.  It excoriates 
the federal government on its actions and its failure to deal 
with a wide range of environmental challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister if there will be any obligation on the 
government to deal with private landowners and the provinces to 
protect critical habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that Canada is the third largest conduit for the 
trafficking of endangered species products around the world, a 
multibillion industry threatening species as far ranging as the 
Siberian tiger, the black rhino, and many fish of the sea, will 
the minister work with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the 
Minister of Justice to develop a plan of action to address this 
serious problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Speech from the 
Throne is a general outline of approaches which I reiterated in 
my speech.  In response to the first question of the hon. member 
from Esquimalt, I indicated that within the last week Canada has 
been named third in the world with respect to the environment and 
its protection.  Finland and Norway are ahead of us, and both are 
small Scandinavian countries in terms of population and area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could pluck a myriad of reports out of the air to support 
this.  However, it is the most prestigious of the various reports 
dealing with Canada and its position with respect to the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has plucked out another report which says that 
in the view of a certain group we are not doing enough.  I tend 
to prefer the type of report which analyzes objectively on the 
basis of some 66 criteria reduced to 22 headings and dealing with 
122 nations.  I tend to prefer that objective approach and 
analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say, as I said in my speech and which the hon. 
member appears to have missed, that we should sit back and say 
nothing more should be done, we are doing well, who cares. Not at 
all.  Third is not good enough.  We wish to be first.  We will 
continue to work.  We know that many other countries have the 
same objective, so it will be a tough race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is demonstrating, like so many members in the opposition, 
that a Canadian optimist is someone who says things could be 
worse.  There are times, when it comes to issues such as this 
one, when we should sit back and say we are doing well.  The next 
thing to say is we could do better and where we can do better. 
Let us not always bring forward the negative, negative, negative, 
because that discourages people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned in my speech that we work with large numbers of 
people throughout Canada on voluntary co-operative efforts. 
Occasionally we should point out to them that their good work on 
the ground is recognized at the highest levels internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point raised by the hon. member is CITES.  I will 
certainly work closely with the Minister of Justice and the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs.  This is a major problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be putting resources where we think they are most 
effective.  Just as with many other smuggling issues around the 
world, it is extraordinarily difficult to deal with it simply at 
the borders.  We will have to deal with it in some of the markets 
of Singapore or Hong Kong or elsewhere in the world.  We will 
have to deal with it in concert with other countries.  This is 
not simply a question of more and more heavy enforcement at 
border points.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before dealing with the legislation the Minister of the 
Environment is introducing today, the species at risk act, I 
want to come back to the issue of climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister engaged in a lot of rhetoric and bragged about the 
government's record on the environment. He even went as far as 
changing the whole concept of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
to the 1990 reference levels. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the real comparison base, not the ratio of the reduction 
of greenhouse gas emissions to Canada's GNP. I thought it was 
important to remind people of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is a very simple one. The minister just told us that 
he will be introducing this afternoon an act respecting the 
protection of wildlife species at risk in Canada. Is the 
minister aware that in 1989 the government of Quebec passed 
legislation to protect species at risk? When introducing his 
bill today, will the minister take into account all the 
expertise and the work already done on this issue so as to avoid 
any overlap with the 1889 legislation, which was passed by 
members of the national assembly, some of whom are federal 
Liberal members sitting in this House today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking about the hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine and the hon. member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry, who were sitting in the national assembly 
when the act was passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister intend to abide by the Quebec legislation on 
endangered species? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I can assure him that we will indeed table the bill on 
endangered species this afternoon, at least I hope so. I 
appreciate that we should wait before discussing a bill that we 
have not yet seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said something very important regarding greenhouse gases. We 
are working together with the provinces and I salute everything 
that Quebec has done. It has been very well done. It can serve 
as an example for many other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that everything is perfect or that we have 
reached our ultimate goal. Not at all. I am saying we must work 
with the federal government within the federal jurisdiction, 
with the other provinces and territories, and with other 
countries in the world. 
The efforts made by the Quebec government have really been 
appreciated at the federal level and we are working together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the same objectives and I hope that with this 
co-operation between the federal and provincial governments, with 
the Quebec government and the other provinces and territories we 
will succeed. I am sure that the targets set—6% below 1990 
levels—we can reached. This objective is not so out of reach that 
it impossible to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that with the co-operation of all jurisdictions and the 
awareness of the Canadian people, we will be able to achieve the 
Kyoto objective, which was a 6% reduction by 2010.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
would the minister elaborate on his relationship with the 
environment departments at the provincial level.  I am 
particularly concerned about the Newfoundland government's plan 
for development on the Main River which is a heritage river in a 
pristine environment and the home of the pine marten.  There is 
some concern that the government is not being sensitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his concern for species at risk, how does the minister look 
upon the disagreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be answering the 
member's question in more detail when we discuss the species at 
risk legislation.  However, I can assure the hon. member that if 
a province or territory fails to take adequate measures to 
protect a species at risk, the architecture of the legislation 
suggests that we should step forward.  I will be happy to give 
more details when the legislation is before the House.  I 
appreciate the member's concern and it should be flagged.

priorities: clean air, clean water and the conservation of 
Canada's natural spaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last December the Government of Canada signed an agreement with 
the United States to significantly reduce emissions that cause 
smog.  The spinning wheel turns.  How do those statements square 
with the minister's apparent lack of resolve to send a strong 
signal regarding the Sumas 2 power project? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of just letting bureaucratic processes roll on, will the 
minister send a strong signal that Sumas 2 is not on?  The 
Americans get the electricity and we get the pollution.

plant is under investigation by the energy facility site 
evaluation council of Washington state.  I have had discussions 
with the governor of Washington on this matter.  It would be 
thoroughly inappropriate for me to take the NIMBY approach of the 
hon. member before the body which has been given the task of 
analyzing the impact of Sumas 2 reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to succeed on issues of this nature we must be 
realistic as to the process.  We must submit our interventions 
respectful of American jurisdictions and of American agencies 
that are charged with the task of analysis.  If we do not show 
respect for the system, if we simply raise our hands and scream 
and say that nothing is acceptable, we will not have them 
considering our views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member that the change in fuels in the Fraser 
Valley due to the increase in the price of gas has had 30 times 
the impact on the air shed of the Fraser Valley as would have the 
proposed Sumas 2 plant.  That is not to say that Sumas 2 should 
go ahead.  It is just to point out how important it is to be 
consistent in what we do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Yves Roy (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
wish to inform you that I am splitting my time with my colleague 
from Mercier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to begin my first speech in this House by an introduction 
and acknowledgements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, I wish to describe to you my riding, Matapédia—Matane. 
I can say without false modesty, and I believe that all my 
colleagues will agree, that Matapédia—Matane is one of the most 
beautiful ridings if not the most beautiful riding in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Even more than Champlain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Yves Roy:</B> Even more than Champlain, as my colleague just 
said. Matapédia—Matane has more than 60 towns and villages and a 
population of almost 75,000 people, some 55,000 of voting age. 
Matapédia—Matane borders on two regions of Quebec: the Lower 
St. Lawrence and the Gaspé Peninsula. Two regional county 
municipalities, Haute-Gaspésie and Avignon, are part of the Gaspé 
Peninsula region, while the Matane and Matapédia RCMs are part 
of the Lower St. Lawrence region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a huge area of more than 743 kilometres around and 
covering 17,000 square kilometres. Incidentally, the well-known 
expression “one day per riding” finds its full meaning here 
because it actually takes a full day to go around the riding. 
And it is not even enough to cover all the area, which is as 
large as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy of my riding is, so to speak, uneven because the 
socio-economic situation and recessions of the last decades have 
taken their toll. 
Moreover, the fact that the federal government has abandoned 
communities like mine does not help economic recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I wish to say in this House how proud I am of 
representing the great riding of Matapédia—Matane. The population 
that I represent is, without a doubt, extremely worthy and 
noble. The men and women and young people of my riding are 
deeply attached to their area, their legacy and their heritage. 
This country was built by men and women and it is an area worthy 
of being inhabited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now for a few acknowledgements. First of all I would like to 
thank the man who came before me as member for Matapédia—Matane, 
Mr. René Canuel, who for seven years devoted his life to the 
service of his fellow citizens. 
Thanks go also to my election team, as well as to all those who 
voted for me, my party and our agenda. It is something I am 
proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I forgot to thank my spouse, Louiselle, and 
my children, Stéphane, Lucie and Frédéric, who have lost a full 
time father but got a member of parliament. I would also like to 
congratulate my opponents in the last election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to address a message to the population of the 
riding of Matapédia—Matane: I will endeavour to help them to the 
best of my knowledge and capacities with my team: Francine, 
Thérèse and Raynald. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all ready to tackle the hard work coming up our way, as 
we say back home. My staff have faced such difficulties in the 
past with courage and persistence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, they are ready for action and determined to forge ahead. 
Tomorrow, the people in our ridings will judge our actions as 
parliamentarians and they will be in a good position to attest 
to what this government wants to do and can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Understandably I now wish to comment on the Speech from the 
Throne made last Tuesday by the Governor General. The throne 
speech was both arrogant and devoid of meaning. Arrogant, for it 
outlays the plan of a government that failed to boost the 
economy of my riding, the plan of a government that managed to 
hurt my fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last electoral campaign, voters from Matapédia—Matane 
not only showed what they thought of what the liberal government 
did or neglected to do, they also sent a very clear message 
about the present government's agenda which is to deny our 
existence and compromise our future. The government's agenda 
must be profoundly changed. It must include communities like 
mine and regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic recovery of our regions requires, commands a 
radical change of direction. We should begin by doing away with 
the arrogant notion that we live in a prosperous Canada with a 
strong and healthy economy. This is an illusion where I come 
from. It is a complete illusion in my area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But such statements are not surprising since the Prime Minister 
did not even bother visiting our regions during the last 
campaign. 
Maybe he was afraid he would not be welcomed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If isolated areas are really included in the government's 
development plan, how can we explain its absence, its failure to 
respond to the call for help of a whole community? A few months 
ago my community's feeling of alienation led to the creation of 
a grassroots movement, the Action des Patriotes gaspésiens, 
which is now 12,000 members strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That movement came about because a population felt abandoned, 
pushed aside and completely ignored. The organization's 
popularity reflects the deep despair of a community which firmly 
believes that the present government does not want to hear or 
see its situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I declare that the Speech from the Throne is a scandal. It is 
outrageous to hear or to read that the government intends to 
continue to deny, forget and abandon regions like mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The examples of this are legion.  I will speak of just two that 
are very striking.  First, there is unemployment insurance—that 
is right, unemployment insurance, not employment insurance—a 
program that has literally pillaged the most disadvantaged 
members of our society, the honest and courageous workers who 
have struggled and yet not accumulated enough hours to qualify 
for this program which is rife with injustices, so they end up 
on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, this program particularly prevents the youth in 
our regions from benefits.  They are required to have 910 hours 
of work the youth in our regions from benefits.  They are 
required to have 910 hours of work before drawing employment 
insurance for the first time, whereas our economy is based on 
four major industries that are more than 80% seasonal.  This is 
a disgrace.  The young workers are entitled to equal and 
equitable treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote the spokesperson for the coalition chômage Gaspésie les 
Îles, “the changes announced in the bill to be introduced this 
afternoon are but a drop of justice in a whole ocean of 
injustice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regional development is another example of this government's 
arrogance and of the scandal of the throne speech.  Regions such 
as mine have been totally abandoned by this government. 
Economic Development Canada is one concrete example of this 
abandonment; the government response to the serious crisis 
facing my community was a meagre $35 million, spread out 
moreover over three long years, and with no action plan to boot. 
There is no clearly defined strategy.  Those are beautiful, or 
horrible, examples of the arrogance and scandal of this 
government, which wants to pursue its policy of abandonment of 
the regions. 
My response to this is no.  The response of the people in my 
area, the people of my riding of Matapédia—Matane, to such a 
policy is no.

not to throw in the towel; they are determined to take action

by this government. Again, we are opposed to abandoning the 
regions. If necessary, the lower St. Lawrence, the Gaspé 
Peninsula and the Magdalen Islands will become symbols of that 
battle, of that struggle for dignity and a better future.

going to provide more details on the issues I intend to fight 
for in the months and years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to my primary duties as member for Matapédia—Matane, 
my leader, whom I congratulate on his brilliant performance 
during the last election campaign, has given me other 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, I will be the associate critic for fisheries and oceans 
and, without necessarily getting into the details of my mandate, 
perhaps I could point out to members that I will fulfil my 
mandate with four main points in mind: first, I will demand a 
true management policy for Quebec fishers, followed by a true 
groundfish strategy, a real improvement of port infrastructures 
and, of course, a true employment insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also sit on other committees to help achieve the global 
objective of our political party. 
We Bloc Quebecois members are here to protect and promote 
Quebecers' interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may add that another responsibility was recently bestowed upon 
me in that I am the chair of the eastern Quebec caucus. I intend 
to meet this new challenge just like the other ones, with 
determination and hard work. We are here to serve our fellow 
citizens. We are here to build a better future for Quebecers.

that is sovereignty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to congratulate the new member for 
Matapédia—Matane on his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because I know him personally, I know that he has developed 
considerable expertise in running a riding office in recent 
years, and we all know how important that is.  To this is now 
added the responsibility of representing the people of 
Matapédia—Matane.  I am certain that he will carry his new duties 
off with great aplomb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to elaborate a bit on the situation of people 
in his region, specifically with reference to the Prime 
Minister's statement during the election campaign to the effect 
that there had been serious errors in the EI regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the residents of Matapédia—Matane, I would like to 
know just what these important factors are that need correcting, 
that we expect to see corrected and that we want to see 
included in the bill the government intends to introduce this 
afternoon.  Does the member intend to make this a major part of 
his mandate for the people of Matapédia—Matane? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Yves Roy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question.  Obviously, the situation in the riding of 
Matapédia—Matane is unique.  It is the same for the Gaspé.  The 
two RCMs of Matapédia and Matane were always considered part of 
the Gaspé for the purposes of the Coalition-chômage, because the 
situation was very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our regions, the official rate of unemployment is 22% or 23%, 
but 40% to 50% of the public relies on employment insurance or 
income security in the winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we desperately want in our region is a real employment 
insurance regime that will cover people not just for 38, 42 or 
44 weeks, but for the whole year.  When people manage to work at 
least a certain number of weeks, it should be possible to 
provide them with security that will last 365 days of the year. 
That is what we want. 
We want a real employment insurance regime.  The regime was set 
up to protect such people, but it is not doing so right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add, for the benefit of my colleague, that another very 
important issue, one which I intend to fight for personally, is 
that of young people.  As I was saying earlier, in the riding of 
Matapédia—Matane, the major industries are forestry, agriculture, 
fishing and tourism.  These are all industries where work is 
almost exclusively seasonal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When young people graduate from tourism courses, particularly in 
my colleague's riding, where there is an institution offering 
such training, they can never collect employment insurance 
because they are never able to accumulate the required number of 
weeks.  So they leave the region and head for places where they 
can find work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
start with I would like to congratulate my colleague, who will 
be a welcome addition to our caucus. I have a couple quick 
questions for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he tell us why people should visit his area? Mr. Speaker, 
you yourself might be looking for a place to go to on your 
summer vacation. I would like our colleague to extol the virtues 
of his beautiful area and tell us what tourist attractions that 
can be found there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also I would like him to tell us a thing or two about the 
vibrant social fabric of his community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Yves Roy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for this 
opportunity to promote my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four MRC municipalities in my area. First, there is 
Avignon, or Carleton, on Chaleur Bay, which is known worldwide 
as a tourist destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the MRC of Matapédia, which is more agricultural. 
There is a bit of tourism too, mostly in the wintertime of 
course, but also in the summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side, there is the MRC of Matane, famous for its 
fisheries and major industries. It too is a very nice area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the upper Gaspé, further on, which relies mainly 
on fishing, is increasingly developing its tourism industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is almost exclusively a coastal area, stretching over 
nearly 743 kilometres. 
On the one side there is Chaleur Bay, and on the other the St. 
Lawrence River; in the centre is the Gaspé Park with many 
outstanding tourist attractions such as the delightful Gîte du 
Mont-Albert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleague for this opportunity to promote my riding. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also want to 
take this opportunity to thank my constituents for re-electing me 
a third time. To get such strong support for a third time is 
both moving and challenging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that we have to do the utmost to express what our 
constituents need to make their lives better. There is no better 
time than an election campaign to go out and meet the people 
where they live and where they shop and to understand how huge 
the problems they face are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a responsibility we have to deal with every day and my 
constituents can be assured that my colleagues and I will do our 
best to live up to their expectations. I also want to spend as 
much time as possible in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For someone like me, the throne speech is truly offensive. It is 
offensive in the way it describes the reality in Quebec and in 
Canada, because that is what it is supposed to do. Yet what it 
describes has nothing to do with what is really going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, or shall I say the executive branch of 
the federal government, talks as though it were the only true 
government, the main government in charge of culture, education, 
the economy, the environment. It talks as though it were the 
major stakeholder. In fact, this is far from the truth.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is offensive to see that, since 1993, this government has 
been bent on reducing the deficit without making sure to do so 
in the least possible harmful way. Sure, such an exercise was in 
order, but the government conducted it without caring about what 
was happening, particularly in Quebec, and even though it knew, 
I am sure, what the impact would be in our province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suffering—and I say it again because this is just 
that—endured by citizens in health, education and other areas, 
not to mention of course the services that were cut by the 
Quebec government, are the result of the drastic federal cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we see in that document? That the Government of Canada 
will invest, that it will care about improving Canadians' 
health, that it will make sure young people succeed at school 
and that it will be a leader in the protection of the 
environment. This is very upsetting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is the one responsible for these serious 
problems in the health sector. Sure, an agreement was signed, 
but not one penny will be paid before April, when it will take 
effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No indexing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde:</B> And no indexing, with the result that 
instead of being at 20%, we will be at 14%. So, the situation 
remains very serious in the health sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In education, there is the issue of dropouts. Dropouts are not 
good for the new economy. 
I realize that. But why do dropouts drop out of school? It is 
often because they have problems at home and because their 
parents are unemployed or do not have an adequate income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment level has gone up and we are proud of that—Quebec 
worked hard to improve the situation—but the unemployment rate is 
still high and the underemployment rate is extremely high. The 
result is that a large number of families do not have what it 
takes to live decently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people drop out of school because they live in families 
that have difficulties, but also because the schools were also 
subjected to a rigorous regime. When there is a shortage of 
teachers, when everyone is overworked, it is harder to make sure 
that young people can keep up with the rest of the class.

fundamental freedoms of belief and conscience, assembly and 
association, expression and information; that an exercise in

fact, Liberal governments both past and present have always 
supported the advancement of women in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was under a Liberal government that Canada saw its first 
woman Speaker of the House of Commons and the first woman 
Governor General.  It was under our Prime Minister that a Liberal 
government appointed a woman as Canada's first Chief Justice of 
the Supreme Court, the Right Hon. Beverley McLachlin.  It was our 
present Prime Minister who appointed the first woman Commissioner 
of Official Languages, Madam Dyane Adam.  Also, since taking 
office our Prime Minister has made sure that half of all 
Canadians appointed to the Senate are women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again our Prime Minister made history.  On January 15, 2001, he 
appointed the first woman to occupy the position of chief 
government whip, the hon. member for Ottawa West—Nepean.  I 
congratulate both the Prime Minister and the member for Ottawa 
West—Nepean for this milestone.

the phone, talk to the administrator of the program and tell him 
to get the dollars out, yes or no?  Will he also release his 
negotiators in the area of pulling down subsidies, which are far 
too high, and the user fees that the government continues to

myself.

been done and Mr. Knyazev either would have been convicted or 
thrown out of the country long ago.  Instead, his drunk driving 
charge was ignored the first time, covered up the second time, 
and it was not until the third incident, after he had killed a 
Canadian citizen, that action was taken.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I do not think I have any information to indicate,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

written after the arrest by the police and suspension of this

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department finds the actions of the Ottawa-Carleton 
Regional Police unacceptable and wishes to apologize for this

withdrawn.  The Embassy will be reimbursed for the incurred

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

response to a diplomatic note from the Russians.  We have taken 
the unusual step of making this exchange of notes available to 
the opposition and to the media so that they know what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the apology did reflect the fact that a diplomat was 
treated not in accordance with the Vienna Convention, but at the 
moment that is of less significance to me than the fact that we 
need to see justice done in the case that arose subsequently.

Mr. Speaker, it has been my priority right from the start, on

if possible, that such a thing never happens again in 
Canada.

Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a symptom of a larger problem 
of the government falling asleep at the watch.  The government 
has allowed Canada and Canadians to fall into the lowest third of 
all developed nations in their access to top of the line 
essential health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very simple.  Why has the minister allowed sick 
Canadians to fall to the bottom of the heap among the developed 
nations in their access to new lifesaving technologies? 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member would do well to look at just where the responsibility 
lies.  The Government of Canada furnishes the funds to the 
provinces to provide for the health care system.  The provinces 
then deliver the services and the required equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many provinces have already reported publicly how they are using 
their per capita allotment of the medical equipment fund to 
purchase things like MRIs.  We have not yet heard from Ontario. 
I, too, have read the troubling reports of the waiting lists in 
Ontario.  It was raised yesterday by one of our colleagues from 
Nepean—Carleton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon the government of Ontario to do the right thing with 
the additional money and buy and put the MRIs where they are 
needed.

remain so.  As a result, acting on information received and on 
the advice of scientists, today the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency will announce 
the suspension of beef imports from Brazil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For its part, and consistent with that suspension, Health Canada

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sumas 2 gas fired electric plant has British Columbians

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I know this will come as a surprise to the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made representations to the energy facilities site 
evaluation council of Washington state.  That was done on May 2. 
We pointed out there was insufficient information on air quality

shows.  He is hiding behind the bureaucrats, and that is not good 
enough.  The science is clear, yet the minister is hedging.  In 
fact he is implying that approval of Sumas 2 is possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If ever there were a test for the government to resolve to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I pointed out that the environment and scientific

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why the opposition talked earlier about the 
softwood lumber agreement and the need to have one Canadian 
voice.  It has played fast and loose with the interests of the 
people of the Fraser Valley and the interests of Canada on the 
issue of Sumas 2. It is outrageous that we have had this 
behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to play the cards as best we can, in the right 
form and in the right order.  We will not simply go out there, as 
he and his fellow members of the Canadian Alliance Party have

unacceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion for an address to 
Her Excellency the Governor General in reply to her speech at 
the opening of the session and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is always 
hard to break off, especially when the subject is the Speech 
from the Throne, and to resume cruising speed in a very 
emotional speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our viewers, I mention that I started by pointing out that 
the throne speech was offensive, because in it the federal 
government set itself up as the main government, if not the 
important government, the only government of a state that is 
becoming increasingly unitary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also offensive because this speech sets out an idyllic 
vision of Canada and of the role of the government, which wants 
to promote health, reduce the student dropout rate, make Canada, 
which is currently in fifth place, one of the world leaders in 
research and development and a leader in environmental matters, 
whereas the facts are quite different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of health care, education, research and the 
environment, cuts and a lack of policy have led in many cases 
to a dramatic situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must target my remarks, since I will be short of time.  I want 
to point out that, with respect to poverty, the fight against 
student dropout, the fact that children need families and that 
early childhood will be one of the important issues of this 
government, what we have learned in the past 30 years, what we 
now know and what we rediscovered during the Canada wide tour by 
the Standing Committee on Human Resource Development, is that 
social policy must be integrated if it is to be effective and 
achieve its objectives.  They must not go all over the place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing is Canada wanting to intervene in a sense, 
while—and I will speak of Quebec with pride—the government of 
Quebec has for years had a family policy which is becoming 
increasingly integrated and may be effective, but for which 
Quebec is lamentably short of money because of the cuts made 
everywhere due to the federal government's refusal to negotiate 
parental leave.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is really serious about its goals, it will 
have to change the way it deals with Quebec in terms of these 
plans. It is all very well to state in the throne speech what 
one's intentions are, even though they seem to be going all over 
the place; in fact, for policies to be effective—money being 
scarce—they must be complementary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to child poverty, one must look at the parents' 
income as well as social housing policies. One must also make 
sure there are enough teachers in the classroom, and that 
services are provided after school to help children with their 
homework. 
The very minimum of course is to have a decent income. 
Quebec has shown leadership. It has done more than pay lip 
service to child policy. Resources have to be set aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this throne speech very disheartening because we can only 
expect further battles about being able to use, in the most 
efficient manner, our own tax money, which unfortunately has to 
go through Ottawa before it can come back to us, not only 
covered with little red flags, but also with strings attached, 
which may be go entirely against our own goals and wishes, and 
in the end be counterproductive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not surprising that so many Quebecers are in favour of 
sovereignty and want to run their own affairs. We are going to 
keep working toward that end. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member. She mentioned that, in the throne 
speech, the government is moving towards a unitary state. I find 
it hard to believe that she would even suggest such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not recognize that the government system in 
Canada is one of the most decentralized systems in the world? 
Can she not compare our system to that of other countries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I said “in an increasingly 
unitary direction.” I would remind the House that in 1867 John 
A. Macdonald wanted a unitary state, but George Étienne Cartier 
as well as the New Brunswick representatives were against the 
idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what we point out is that, not counting the 
Constitution—because the Constitution gives some powers to the 
provinces—what is starting to truly hinder Canada is the central 
government's unrestricted spending power. The Meech Lake 
agreement would have solved this problem, albeit in a somewhat 
modest and timid way however for now there is no limit to the 
spending power of the federal government nor to its power to 
levy all the taxes it wants, regardless of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That gives the federal government a disproportionate edge, 
because it can interfere  at anytime and anywhere, and impose 
conditions for every $10,000 it hands out to any group, just 
because it is the one with the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, what was supposed to be a confederation at the 
very start and turned into a federation has now increasingly 
becoming a unitary state, with some decentralization or 
concentration in regions that have nothing to do but cash 
cheques. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
two short questions for my colleague from Mercier who has been 
very much involved in social issues, both in the labour 
movement, in the past, and as a member of parliament. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could she remind the House why it is important that Quebec 
should have an integrated plan of parental leave, and why the 
Chrétien government should accede to Quebec's demands in terms 
of numbers and eligibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I know this is a new parliament, but we 
should never forget that hon. members should be referred to, not 
by name, but by their title or the name of their department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize. I did refer 
inadvertently to the Prime Minister by name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was my first question. My second question to the hon. 
member for Mercier is this: would she remind us why the national 
vision the Bloc Quebecois is pursuing is most relevant, and why 
it will be important in the coming years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, these are two short questions 
requiring two long answers, but I will try to get to the basic 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first case, Quebec—more than other provinces, if they 
want it—needs, not a favour from the federal government but 
payment of the portion of employment insurance to which it is 
entitled for parental leave so that it could, not only as is now 
provided by the legislation, grant leave with 55% of earnings to 
women who are eligible for employment insurance, but to all those 
who need it and are self-employed workers or other workers. This 
would ensure that they get a decent income because, even with 
the extension, few women will be able to take advantage of 
parental leave because their earnings are inadequate. What 
we are talking about here is eligibility and income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does Quebec need it more than any other province? Because in 
Quebec there is a serious demographic problem because of a drop 
in the birth rate. Consequently, it is essential that the 
Canadian people and the Quebec nation be able to grant decent 
parental leave.

<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
be splitting my time with the hon. member for Mount Royal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After an absence of three and a half years, it is a great honour 
and a privilege to return to the House today and to convey on 
their behalf the concerns of the constituents of Halifax West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to talk about some of those concerns today, but first let 
me tell hon. members about my constituency of Halifax West.  It 
is comprised of the western portion of the Halifax regional 
municipality.  It is a riding of great diversity, from the 
suburbs to the seaside, from places like Clayton Park, Spryfield 
and Bedford to Peggy's Cove, Hubbards and Seabright, a beautiful 
area along the sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the fastest growing area in Atlantic Canada and it is of 
great concern to people in my riding that there is not the 
infrastructure needed to support that growth throughout Halifax 
West.  As a result, we have congested roadways, aging and 
overcrowded schools and a need for new and more schools, and a 
shortage of recreational facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout Halifax West, there are hard-working people.  The 
unemployment rate in the metropolitan Halifax area is something 
around 6%, lower than the national average.  We have a strong and 
in fact a booming economy.  There are many young families, who 
are concerned about education, health care, recreation and taxes. 
There are students coping with rising tuition and trying to 
handle debt loads.  There are empty nesters who are struggling to 
save for their retirement.  There are retirees on fixed incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past few months, particularly during the federal 
election campaign, I have talked to thousands of people.  I have 
knocked on their doors and visited them in meetings around the 
riding.  I have heard their concerns, their priorities and their 
frustrations.  They are very pleased to see the progress that has 
been made over the past seven years on issues like the debt, the 
deficit and taxes.  However, they certainly still face problems 
and they still have concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, at my office this week I have heard a lot about 
the high cost of home heating as people try to make ends meet 
during a difficult winter with high heating costs.  I have passed 
on those concerns to the Minister of Finance and to other members 
of the government.  I have made their concerns very clearly 
known.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that Halifax West is the fastest growing area 
in Atlantic Canada.  The Halifax metropolitan area is one of 
great growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the sources of that growth?  The first and most well 
known source would be the Sable gas program, which has had a huge 
positive impact on the economy of Nova Scotia in recent years. It 
is only beginning.  We have seen the development of one field 
near Sable Island. More fields have already been discovered which 
we will see developed in the near future and will bring 
tremendous benefits to Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns I heard during the election campaign was 
about the royalty scheme for the benefits generated by Sable 
offshore gas and other gas resources off the Nova Scotia coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the eighties the governments of Premier Buchanan in Nova 
Scotia and Prime Minister Mulroney in Ottawa made a deal on gas 
royalties whereby the province of Nova Scotia receives 30% of the 
royalties and the Government of Canada receives 70% of the 
royalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In comparison, western provinces at their inception received 
huge areas with great natural resources.  They have been able to 
benefit from those resources.  I would argue that Nova Scotia 
ought to have the same kind of benefit from its offshore 
resources, as should Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will examine the situation with regard to 
the royalty scheme and consider a more equitable scheme for 
royalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The port of Halifax is another source of great growth in the 
Halifax area.  It is the major east coast port for Canada and the 
only east coast port that is ice free.  No ice breaking is 
required for the port of Halifax.  Yet a concern that has been 
raised in the past is that fees paid by Halifax shippers have 
subsidized ice breaking in the St. Lawrence Seaway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The port is a key economic engine for the metropolitan Halifax 
area and for the Atlantic economy.  Last year, just in containers 
alone, 548,404 container units went through Halifax. That is an 
increase of 18.5% over the previous year.  I am not talking about 
roll on, roll off cargo, bulk or break bulk cargo but about 
containers.  We see tremendous growth in that sector of the 
port's activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The port must remain competitive and it needs the government's 
attention and involvement.  I was pleased that a couple of years 
ago the Government of Canada committed, as part of the bid that 
Halifax made, to win the business of Maersk Canada Inc. and to 
spend $75 million if Halifax were to win the bid to develop a 
super terminal for post panamax vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should maintain its interest in that matter.  I 
hope there will be support for growing the port and building a 
new terminal when the time comes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Halifax is also a thriving high tech community with companies 
like InfoInteractive in the information technology field and 
MedMira Laboratories in the biotechnology field, both of which 
have developed in exciting ways with new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen many companies developing in Halifax.  There are 
now over 200 companies in the high tech sector.  Many of them 
have developed because of developments in research at 
universities and other institutions of research in the Halifax 
area.  That is why it was so important when last June the 
Government of Canada announced the Atlantic investment 
partnership, part of which is the Atlantic investment fund that 
provides $300 million to increase the research capacity in the 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dalhousie University, DalTech, Saint Mary's University and Mount 
Saint Vincent University will benefit from that kind of research, 
as is the community as a whole because those companies provide 
good paying jobs with good benefits.  That is so important for 
families in our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Halifax is also the home of a vibrant east coast music scene. 
It is a great centre for nightlife, music and the arts.  There is 
also a growing film industry.  Nova Scotia has been the site of 
the filming of many feature films in recent years.  It has an 
excellent supply of people who are trained in working on films.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The navy is another major employer in Halifax.  It is the east 
coast home of Canada's navy and the arrival of the Oberon 
submarines is very important to Halifax.  Residents of the area 
are appreciative of the government's decision to purchase the 
Oberon submarines.  They are also anxiously awaiting the swift 
replacements for the Sea King helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipbuilding is another important industry in the area.  Like 
aerospace, shipbuilding faces stiff competition from subsidized 
yards around the world.  Until recently, the Halifax shipyard has 
been very active, however, lately it has been a little less 
active because of the competition.  Many families, who rely upon 
the employment generated by that shipyard, are looking to the 
Government of Canada to come forward with a shipbuilding policy 
that will be positive for the future of this shipyard, as well as 
others across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also many people who are employed in the health care 
sector.  That was probably the top area of concern that I heard 
about during the election campaign.  People were pleased to learn 
of the health care accord, with $21 billion being invested into 
the system and transferred to the provinces over the next five 
years. They were pleased to see that the government has paid 
attention to this important concern and are now anxious to have 
the provincial government manage these dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that people want their concerns to be 
heard by government.  I feel it is my responsibility to come here 
and convey the concerns that I hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to go back to the riding and listen to the 
people.  That is why I have begun a series of meetings called 
“Let's Talk”, which I had when I was previously a member of 
parliament.  Last week, I started with a meeting in Spryfield in 
my riding.  I hold these meetings because I believe in our 
democratic process.  I believe the public must have a role in 
policy making.  I think it is a challenge that all of us need to 
face and take on in order to engage our citizens in policy making 
in a meaningful way.  I challenge my fellow colleagues to find 
new ways to involve those who have been voiceless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us like to hear ourselves talk but not everyone does. We 
need to hear from those who do not have that particular 
inclination. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Halifax West commented on the issue of offshore gas, 
the distribution of that gas and the net benefit to his province 
and to other customers who may avail themselves of that resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It raises the whole thorny issue of the production and 
distribution of energy resources.  I am sure Nova Scotia, with 
its Sable Island offshore resources, is starting to wrestle with 
the issue of who will be getting the net benefit from energy 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Alberta has staked claim on absolute ownership 
of what is under its soil.  Many Canadians actually feel that it 
is part of our common wealth, that energy resources are not 
theirs but ours, and that it is part of our birthright as 
Canadians to have access to it and share in the benefit that it 
offers Canada in terms of economic development possibilities, 
namely the revenue and the sales that it generates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to address that, we need some real leadership from the 
federal government.  Would the member agree that the federal 
government does have a role to play in trying to bring some 
semblance of order to the production and distribution of energy 
resources?  Would he support the idea of a regulatory body set up 
by the federal government, an energy price commission, that would 
be charged with the responsibility of regulating the price, so 
that Canadians are not as furious about the seemingly arbitrary 
fluctuations in energy costs, home heating fuels and gasoline? 
Does he see a role for his Liberal government to intervene now 
and establish a regulatory body such as an energy price 
commission? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Geoff Regan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure the hon. member 
is familiar with the constitution and will be aware that this is 
an area that is the responsibility of the provinces not the 
federal government.  It would be encroaching on provincial 
jurisdiction for the Government of Canada to create such a body. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the member for Halifax West for a very 
good speech and one which I think all members of the House 
listened to intently because of the merits that were contained 
therein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want talk a little bit about the government's plans.  The 
Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, the cabinet and caucus 
are working toward a very good system of tax cuts that are 
starting to kick in right now.  They will have an impact not only 
on ordinary Canadians but, in a macro sense, on the entire 
country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member for Halifax West can comment on the 
precise nature of the impact of those tax cuts.  What will it 
mean for Canadians no matter where they live?  What will the 
impact be on the country as a whole, especially as we move more 
and more into a globalized economy where the interconnectedness 
is very much in play?  I would like to hear the hon. member's 
comments because I know he is a seasoned veteran and has great 
wisdom in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Geoff Regan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his generous and kind words.  The tax reductions committed to by 
the government will be of great benefit to our country. I heard a 
great deal about it during the election campaign in my riding of 
Halifax West.  Many people in that area were concerned about the 
level of taxation and were anxious to see taxes lowered.  They 
are very pleased to see that as of the first of this year tax 
cuts have already begun.  These tax cuts will continue over the 
next five years and amount to a total of $100 billion.  That will 
be a lot of dollars back in our pockets and it will help the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians are concerned right now as they watch the U.S. 
economy.  The government is also concerned about the slowing of 
that economy and will watch it closely.  However, it is important 
to note that our economy remains very strong and in good shape. 
The fact that we are having these tax cuts at this particular 
time will help to strengthen our economy and encourage people to 
spend, buy products and support the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we will probably see interest rates come down some more 
over the next year.  That will also boost the economy.  I think 
we can expect a soft landing.  There are many other factors, but 
I think we are near very good things with more good times ahead. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Irwin Cotler (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take 
this opportunity to thank my family for their engagement in my 
work, and the electors of Mount Royal for their renewed 
confidence and trust in me, and both for their espousal and 
support for the human rights agenda which will be the burden of 
my remarks today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne and in yesterday's address by the 
Prime Minister, the Prime Minister spoke of Canada's deep 
commitment to democracy and human rights.  The Prime Minister 
mentioned that we have become a model for the world and that 
international involvement will be a main theme of this 
parliamentary mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will share with members a series of principles and policies 
which may underpin such a commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, combating hate speech, hate crime and hate movements. We 
are witnessing today a growing trafficking in hate from central 
Asia to central Europe and North America, reminding us that we 
have yet to learn the lessons and are repeating the strategies of 
50 and 60 years ago.  As the Supreme Court of Canada put it in 
upholding the constitutionality of anti-hate legislation, “The 
Holocaust did not begin in the gas chambers, it began with 
words”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty years later, this teaching of contempt and this demonizing 
of the other has led us down the road to genocide in the Balkans 
and Rwanda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so necessary today is a culture of human rights as an 
antidote to a culture of hate, a culture of respect as an 
antidote to a culture of contempt, including in particular, 
respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, respect for 
the equal dignity of all persons, respect for the right of 
minorities to protection against group vilifying speech, respect 
for our international treaty obligations which remove incitement 
to hatred from the ambit of protected speech, recognition of the 
substantial harm caused to the targets of hate speech and hate 
crimes, be they individuals or groups, and respect for the 
underlying values of a free and democratic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the communications revolution, the Internet as a 
transporter of the best and the worst.  Television, radio and now 
the Internet, all have incredible power to move people to act. 
As with most technologies, there is power for good and potential 
for evil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, the Internet can be used for human rights 
education as a means of organizing human rights defenders, as a 
means of accessing human rights violations and mobilizing the 
international community to act.  Urgent appeals and public 
campaigns can be received instantly and can prevent further 
abuses. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the information highway can transport the best, it can 
also transport the worst.  The ability of the Internet to reach 
out to people on a grand scale is what attracts not only the 
human rights defenders and civil society generally, but also the 
terrorist, the child molester, the hate group leader and the 
pornographer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hate on the Internet, particularly cyberhate, also seeks to 
target and recruit children.  We have seen a proliferation of 
hate sites from just one in 1995 to over 2,500 today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we find now is that while technology races, the law lags. 
Once again the scientists are beating the lawyers.  We need a 
strategy of cross-commitment, an imaginative use of legal remedy, 
education, anti-racist education, heightened awareness, media 
exposure and community advocacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third is the combating of xenophobia and discrimination in the 
multicultural societies of the 21st century.  Xenophobic, 
discriminatory and exclusionary attitudes and policies toward 
refugees, migrant workers, minorities, immigrants and les 
étrangers, the stranger generally speaking, characterize 
multicultural societies of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a watershed issue in the 1980s was the right to emigrate, 
particularly for those behind the iron curtain, then a watershed 
issue as we begin the 21st century is the right to asylum and to 
protection against discrimination generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth is the global struggle against torture.  Torture, be it 
through rape, mutilation, beatings or any form of cruel and 
degrading mental or physical punishment, finds expression today 
in at least 150 countries, three-quarters of the world states, 
while children are tortured in at least 50 of those countries. 
People have died from torture alone in at least 80 countries in 
the past three years.  The unconditional and absolute right to be 
free from torture, one of the most basic rights of all of the 
human rights, is under international assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must become a leader in this crucial global struggle 
against torture.  Working against torture should become a central 
piece of our foreign policy, a commitment we bring to all of our 
dealings with other states in the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth is the rights of children.  The convention on the rights 
of the child was ratified more quickly by more countries than any 
other treaty in history.  The international community recognized 
that children, the most vulnerable of the vulnerable, need to be 
protected from the violation of their rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last year alone, three international conferences were 
held on war affected children, culminating in Canada in the 
Winnipeg conference where 132 governments issued a resounding 
call to action on behalf of children affected by conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne should be commended for its emphasis 
on the rights and needs of children.  As my own daughter put it 
when speaking to me on human rights, “Daddy, if you want to know 
what the real test of human rights is, always ask yourself, at 
any time, in any situation, in any part of the world, if what is 
happening is good for children.  That is the real test of human 
rights”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth is the rights of women.  The genocide in World War II and 
the ethnic cleansing and genocides since have included horrific 
crimes against women.  Moreover, these crimes have not only 
attended the killing fields or been in consequence of it, which 
would be bad enough, but now become in pursuit of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are witnessing 50 and 60 years later once again violent 
crimes against women in armed conflict.  The lessons of those 
days need to be relearned and acted upon.  The struggle for 
international women's rights in all its expression must be a 
priority on our human rights agenda.  The notion that women's 
rights are human rights and that there are no human rights 
without the rights of women must be not only a statement of 
principle but an instrument of policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As UNICEF recently reported that discrimination against women 
was an injustice greater than South Africa's apartheid.  As the 
women's rights movement has put it, significant numbers of the 
world's population are routinely subject to torture, starvation, 
terrorism, humiliation, mutilation and even murder, simply 
because they are female. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh is the plight of indigenous people.  If we look at the 
Speech from the Throne we see its commitment to the question of 
the dignity and welfare of aboriginal people.  What is needed 
here is a new cultural sensibility, a respect for difference, a 
politics and policy of inclusion, a recognition of aboriginal 
people's right to self-government, a recognition of their unique 
status by reason of their historic presence as first nations, a 
generous rather than a grudging or recriminatory respect for 
their aboriginal treaty rights and land rights, a radical 
improvement of economic and social conditions on reserves, a 
reform of the Canadian justice system to accommodate the 
distinctiveness and sensibilities of aboriginal culture, and the 
adoption of the draft UN declaration on the rights of indigenous 
peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighth is the struggle against impunity.  The 20th century has 
been characterized by crimes that have been too terrible to be 
believed but not too terrible to have happened. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1250
<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also characterized by the impunity that has accompanied 
the commission of these atrocities.  Establishing accountability 
is not only a moral imperative but a practical one.  The adoption 
of the international criminal court in 1998 was a watershed in 
the fight against impunity and in the struggle for accountability 
in protecting the rule of law while deterring those responsible 
for the commission of the worst of atrocities, be it genocide, 
war crimes or crimes against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly the struggle against impunity requires that we 
recognize that states have an obligation to prosecute or 
extradite the most serious of international crimes.  It requires 
that we invoke the full panoply of remedies at our disposal 
internationally and nationally to bring those responsible for war 
crimes and crimes against humanity to justice in Canada and 
elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada should lead a campaign for the necessary ratifications to 
bring the international criminal court into being.   We should 
continue to take the lead in engendering justice both at the 
international criminal tribunals for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda 
and the prospective International Criminal Court.  We should 
develop mechanisms for the protection of civilians in armed 
conflicts, refugee camps, security, and the integration of human 
rights into peacekeeping missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close with the reminders of my own constituents.  We can 
best give expression to the struggle for human rights in the 
understanding that each one of us has an indispensable role to 
play in the individual struggle for human rights and human 
dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each one of us can and does make a difference.  Human rights 
begins with each of us, in our homes, in our workplaces, in our 
human relations, in our daily capacity for active care and 
compassion.  We are each, wherever we are, the guarantors of each 
other's destiny. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, congratulations on your new post. I 
would be remiss if I did not begin by congratulating the hon. 
member on his courageous stand with respect to Falun Gong.  I 
know his work has saved the life of at least one individual and 
has brought the attention and attraction of the international 
community on this terrible situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The points that he articulates about human rights abuses, 
torture, the rights of children and conflict are well known. The 
amount of conflict taking place in the world today has been 
exploding over the last few years.  The international community 
has been ill able to deal with this in a preventive fashion.  I 
was very happy and encouraged to see in the throne speech an 
explicit reference to the prevention of deadly conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the things we have seen that the hon. member mentioned 
in his speech about abuses to children, torture, et cetera, are 
products of conflict in many cases, so I will confine my comments 
and questions to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member and his government look at international 
organizations and how we can prevent conflict?  Will he advocate 
conditionality on World Bank activities in certain countries such 
as Tibet, Chad and Angola? Will he put pressure on companies in 
the international communities and countries to ensure that their 
resources will be applied to primary health and education instead 
of war efforts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite the specific example of Angola.  It receives a $3.5 
billion infusion of capital every year from international 
organizations and companies while their people are living in 
abject poverty and are dying.  One-third of the children in 
Angola die before the age of five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he fight for conditionality in loans from the World Bank, 
in actions by the IMF, and in CIDA's activities internationally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Irwin Cotler:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question 
goes to the heart of what a human rights foreign policy is all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned just yesterday the fact that China in the year 2000 
has been the recipient of $1.67 billion in loan assistance from 
the World Bank.  We need to review the policies of the World 
Bank, the IMF and international financial institutions to ensure 
that we are not licensing or rewarding human rights violations, 
be it in Angola, China or elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the question of my involvement in these issues, 
my whole approach with regard to human rights foreign policy, 
including not only international financial institutions but 
corporate involvement, is that we cannot have a situation where 
corporations are themselves, however inadvertent, acquiescing in 
those violations.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need more than just voluntary codes of conduct.  We need to 
review whether we can regulate the character of our corporations 
when they are carrying out mandates that are effectively given to 
them by the Canadian government in the manner in which they 
relate to other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to where the Export Development Corporation may 
be assisting corporations acting in countries that are committing 
the most egregious of human rights violations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will need to review our whole pattern of both corporate 
involvement as well as assistance by international financial 
institutions to human rights violator countries. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague in commending the member for 
Mount Royal.  I think that he is a model member of this place in 
his passion, intellectual honesty and commitment to issues of 
conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to ask him two questions.  First, will he join 
with me in encouraging the Prime Minister and ministers who will 
be travelling to China this month to raise as a top priority 
Canada's very grave concern about the continued atrocious human 
rights record of the People's Republic of China? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he join with me in raising concerns about the labour camps, 
not just the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners but minority 
Christians, Catholics, evangelical Protestants, Muslims and other 
religious minorities, and the people of Tibet? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question touches on what the member passionately said 
at the outset of his remarks in terms of the need for greater 
sensitivity about hate speech and hate crimes.  Will he agree 
with me that it is very potent language, that it must be used 
with great care, and that we must use the most potent language in 
our rhetorical arsenal against those who are guilty of such 
crimes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he therefore join with me in regretting the remarks during 
the recent campaign of his colleague from the riding of 
Thornhill?  Although my party, according to the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>, had the distinction of having the highest number of 
ethnic minority candidates of any party, the member for Thornhill 
ascribed to it the inclusion of many “bigots, racists and 
Holocaust deniers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Irwin Cotler:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the matter of human 
rights in China generally, I would refer the hon. member to my 
Standing Order 31 today.  I identified a list of human rights 
violations in China in addition to the matter of the Falun Gong. 
I also recently identified 10 categories of human rights 
violations by China, which I take to be performance criteria by 
which we measure the character of China's standing in the 
international community. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to rise in the opening session of this 
new parliament and begin by thanking the constituents of Calgary 
Southeast for their renewed confidence in my representation here. 
I was honoured to receive an increased majority.  I would also 
seek permission from the Chair to split the balance of my time 
with the member for Peace River.  It is a particular honour to 
come back here with a larger majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address the balance of my remarks to the question of the 
lack of real economic vision presented in the throne speech. 
Economic and fiscal questions at a time of increasing economic 
uncertainty were unfortunately excluded from any serious 
discussion in Her Excellency's speech.  That reflects a general 
attitude of carelessness from the government when it comes to the 
economic prospects we face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but note in the recent exchange I had with the 
honourable and esteemed member for Mount Royal that he failed to 
address my second question.  I hope that at some point, when it 
is appropriate, he will do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the right place for us to completely rehash the last 
election.  However, issues and comments that are raised during an 
election campaign which are of profound importance to the tone 
and tenor of public discourse should be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope he will agree with me that it was very regrettable that a 
member of his caucus and a member of cabinet who continues to be 
supported by the Prime Minister engaged in the most foul, 
defamatory and scurrilous sort of remarks that are possible in 
public discourse. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT36"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT36"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1300

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset of this parliament I for one want to put on the 
record how deeply hurt I and many of my colleagues were by those 
remarks made by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.  I 
furthermore want to say that a substantive and not merely 
rhetorical commitment to human rights and civil rights such as 
that expressed by the member for Mount Royal is a tremendous 
thing and a great value to this place.  However, members opposite 
would have greater credibility in addressing such issues if they 
were to identify the kind of language which frankly is hateful in 
itself and inflammatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put on the record that I think the member for 
Thornhill stepped beyond the bounds of anything close to civil 
discourse and impugned herself as somebody who is willing to 
direct frankly hateful thoughts toward honourable, civil and 
tolerant members of this place and many who participate in our 
national politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having addressed that regrettable matter, I turn to the issue of 
the growing economic uncertainty which we now face.  Yesterday we 
heard reports from Statistics Canada that manufacturing orders 
and production will be declining even further in this quarter. 
This matches the reduced output being seen in the United States 
in reduced consumer demand.  This also comes at a time when the 
principal economic authority in the developed world, the U.S. 
federal reserve board, has decided to reduce its prime rate by 
100 basis points in three weeks, an unprecedented action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this gives credence to those very credible voices and 
economists who suggest that our largest trading partner is now 
likely in the midst of a recession and that Canada may very well 
be headed into a similar recession.  I note on the front page of 
one of our national newspapers today an economist being quoted as 
saying that we are in at least a brief recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recession means two successive quarters of negative growth.  We 
asked the government what it plans to do, how it plans to respond 
and whether it plans to act on this very troubling new economic 
development which will inevitably impact the standard of living 
of all Canadians and the fiscal projections and incoming revenues 
of the government.  The government refused to do so.  It is back 
to the don't worry, be happy theme which the Prime Minister is so 
adept at striking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last October the government introduced not really a budget but a 
statement, really a political statement, which had been done very 
quickly.  Finance department officials were given very short 
notice by the Prime Minister to produce an election statement 
that was not able to take anything into account with respect to 
the recent developments in the U.S. and Canadian economies.  The 
government is planning to maintain a fiscal plan right through to 
March of next year based on an outdated political document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that some of my Liberal colleagues, those who came of age 
in the 1960s, still have a strong streak of anti-Americanism and 
they still do not appreciate the degree to which we are reliant 
on the American economy.  Let me explain that we export to the 
United States more of our manufactured goods than we consume 
domestically, so when consumer demand goes down in the United 
States, manufacturing output will go down in Canada.  That will 
inevitably affect our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our economy is negatively affected and we see a reduction 
in growth, according to some projections, of .1%, which is 
substantially lower than that projected in the fall statement, or 
potentially negative growth according to some economists, we will 
see government revenues decline.  When government revenues 
decline, especially when the government is increasing spending in 
all sorts of unidentified areas, the conditions exist for 
potential deficits.  That is precisely what the second most 
heavily indebted country in the OECD does not need to incur at a 
time of economic uncertainty, yet government members put their 
heads in the sand.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset of this parliament we call on the government, not 
out of a sense of partisanship but out of a sense of prudence, to 
introduce in the spring, as is our convention, a comprehensive 
budget that takes into account all of these factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me suggest some things the government might want to 
introduce in that budget.  First of all it might want to review 
the $52 billion of new spending outlined in the fall statement, 
much of which was not identified.  It may care to identify the 
costs, which it has so far refused to do, of the 14 specific new 
spending commitments outlined in this week's Speech from the 
Throne and of the 51 other vague commitments to and promises of 
new spending programs.  It may also wish to outline precisely how 
it intends to accommodate the Prime Minister's red book 
commitment to spend 50% of future surpluses.  This is a figure 
clearly not accounted for or anticipated in the finance 
minister's fall economic statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have contradictory directions.  We have the old spending, 
welfare state, Trudeau Liberal in the person of the Prime 
Minister, who is promising to spend, spend, spend.  We have the 
finance minister suggesting continued fiscal prudence.  We have a 
potential recession coming on.  With all of these contradictions 
and this atmosphere of uncertainty, there is no action.  There is 
no precision.  There is no response.  The government cannot even 
tell us how much it plans to spend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important question, because as spending rises and a 
recession comes on we will continue to see our productivity gap 
grow.  As my colleague, the Leader of the Opposition, reminded us 
the other day, our standard of living, which is measured by real 
disposable income per capita, has declined from 70% of the U.S. 
average in 1990 to just over 63% in the year 2000.  We have moved 
to the rank of 24th out of 25 OECD countries in the last decade 
in terms of growth in per capita GDP.  Ireland has doubled its 
per capita GDP in a time when we have seen ours shrink. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do see a diminishment in our standard of living.  We see it 
in the fire sale prices of Canadian companies, such as the recent 
purchase of the Montreal Canadiens.  We see it in the continued 
impoverishment of the Canadian currency, which affects our 
standard of living.  We see it in the brain drain, with tens of 
thousands of bright, mostly young, talented Canadians leaving 
this country to pursue brighter economic opportunities elsewhere. 
We see it in the fact that Canadian taxes are on the whole 
one-third higher than they are in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these issues need to be addressed.  The opposition has, 
and will outline through the course of this parliament, its 
comprehensive plan for tax relief, debt reduction and spending 
restraint.  We invite the members of the government to do just 
that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank the voters in Etobicoke North for supporting 
me again and giving me the opportunity to represent them in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member from Calgary Southeast has heard of the 
concept of the self-fulfilling prophecy.  In spite of that, he 
and his colleagues stand in the House and pick out every tiny 
shred of negative comment that might have come from the United 
States or from selected economists.  It is almost like they are 
wishing that the economy would go into a significant downturn.  I 
think that is scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from an independent, reliable source, the 
International Monetary Fund.  The report is dated January 26, 
2001.  Today is February 2, 2001.  This report says many things, 
and paragraphs and sentences of it have been quoted.  One thing 
it does say is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strong policy framework in place (in Canada) has positioned 
the real and financial economy to cope with any new major 
economic shock, including a slowdown in U.S. growth.  The 
Canadian authorities are to be highly commended for their policy 
accomplishments. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had a mini budget in October and introduced the 
largest single tax cut in Canadian history.  In fact, in the year 
2001, at around $17 billion in tax savings, it is the largest 
single monetary tax cut in Canadian history and is coming right 
at a time when there is somewhat of a slowdown.  However, most 
reasonable, educated economists are saying that even a slowdown 
in the United States will be a temporary slowdown and that the 
economy will start to pick up at the end of the year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding that, the government has consistently built 
prudence into its economic forecasts and estimates.  There is 
prudence in its budget planning.  The finance minister said that 
this situation is being monitored and that he will take action if 
required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the hon. members would look at something more positive. 
Instead of being the doomsayers and feeding a self-fulfilling 
prophecy, why do they not talk about the realities in Canada 
instead of the myths? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps the member 
opposite does not believe that the OECD is a credible economic 
source when it says that our standard of living has fallen over 
the past decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps he does not believe that his colleague from the riding 
of Markham was an honest and thoughtful economist when he said in 
October of last year “I believe in being honest” and “the mini 
budget is firm but other promises might have to be delayed a year 
if the economy is not as good as what we believe it will be”. He 
went on to talk about the fact that there was a $2.6 billion hole 
in the Liberal budget promises.  That is what one of the member's 
own colleagues said.  I do not know what source he would find 
more pleasing than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is this:  no amount of hot air opposite will turn 
around the reality of the uncertainty we are facing right now. 
The hon. member did not make a case for the lack of a 
conventional, full spring budget.  All he told us is that he 
hopes and expects that the recession which we may now be facing 
will shortly be curtailed.  That sounds an awful lot like Michael 
Wilson and Don Mazankowski in this place 12 years ago, when they 
denied for a full year that we were even in a recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments do not want to face up to economic prudence.  We 
believe they should do so by accelerating meaningful tax relief 
so that we can increase consumer demand, investment in the 
economy and productivity, and so we can see our dollar appreciate 
over time and our standard of living go up with it, unlike the 
decline we have experienced over the past decade of Liberal 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in listening to the members 
opposite, I was remembering Trudeau saying that the land was 
strong, and we all know what his economic record was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague calls on the government to act, but beyond just 
calling for a real, comprehensive budget, what elements does he 
think would be wise for Canada to take on in view of changing 
realities?  I can think of four:  reduced spending, creating a 
low tax environment, long term debt reduction commitments, and 
balanced budget legislation.  Perhaps my colleague can elucidate 
a little on what would really be wise for this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleague identifies 
debt reduction as an important long term priority.  In the fall 
economic political statement, there was no outline of a long term 
debt reduction strategy.  The government's attitude is that maybe 
if we are lucky, maybe if we run a surplus and do not use the 
contingency fund, if the minister for heritage and her big 
spending colleagues like the minister for HRD do not get their 
hands on it, we might allocate it to debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a legislated debt reduction strategy, which some of the 
provinces have successfully implemented, and major tax relief, 
which we can afford and which will keep us competitive even after 
the Bush tax cuts are passed by congress this spring.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to respond to the Speech from 
the Throne as the industry critic for the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to thank the electors in the Peace River 
constituency who have returned me for a third term and who in 
doing so again placed a responsibility upon me to carry out their 
interests in Ottawa.  I intend to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to respond to the Speech from the Throne, I think we 
need to examine the government's proposals to help Canadian 
industry through the looming downturn in the economy by 
increasing Canadian competitiveness in the new economic 
environment, which is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to do that, we need to look at Canada's historical 
position in terms of what we have done in the economic area in 
the last several years.  We have to ask what went wrong in the 
past and evaluate whether the proposals in the mini budget and 
the throne speech are adequate to see us through.  I would like 
to make the case that these are not the right formula.  The 
formula the Liberal government has in those two areas will not 
see us through adequately and will not put us back into a 
competitive position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister and the industry minister both maintain 
that everything is okay, and we heard it from the parliamentary 
secretary too. 
It is sort of a head in the sand approach that has become all too 
common from the Liberal government; everything is going to work 
out, do not worry about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at an historical review.  Last spring the Standing 
Committee on Industry tabled a report regarding Canada's 
productivity.  The study was initiated in response to concerns 
expressed by many prominent economists and business leaders who 
warned of an alarming productivity gap developing between Canada 
and the United States, particularly over the past decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These leaders confirmed through statistical evidence what 
Canadians instinctively already knew.  Our standard of living had 
fallen over the past 30 years and the rate of decline had 
accelerated in the 1990s.  Witnesses told the committee that on 
average Canadians earn $9,000 less per capita than their American 
counterparts.  This illustrates how Canadian productivity has 
impacted on our standard of living.  That is what this is all 
about.  It relates to our standard of living; are we better off 
or worse off than we were a decade ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1996 and 1998, the U.S. increased its productivity at 
double the rate of Canada.  No wonder the 1990s were called a 
dec-a-dis hor-ri-bil-is by the hon. member for Markham when he 
was the chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada.  All of a 
sudden he has completely changed his tune.  I wonder why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to Canada's productivity and why did we slip out 
of the game?  We went from being number two in 1976 but we 
slipped badly.  In fact, from the 1950s to the mid 1970s we had 
tremendously high rates of growth of productivity in this 
country.  In 1976 Canada was second only to the United States in 
terms of productivity among the G-7.  While the United States 
remains number one, Canada no longer holds that second place 
position.  By 1997 we were in fifth place.  Italy, France and 
Germany have all passed Canada by and more countries will do so 
if we do not get our fundamentals right.  Members might rightly 
ask how did this happened.  We need to pursue this further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues related to Canada's loss of productivity and weakened 
competitiveness are complex, to say the least.  Many factors, 
including external shocks to the economy of a country can cause 
disruption.  However, the United States was better able to adapt 
and restructure their economy.  The restructuring which took 
place in the U.S. during the 1980s enabled the Americans to lead 
the way in growth for much of the 1990s, as is the case today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did it happen?  How did it happen?  I suggest that it is 30 
years of bad public policy in Canada that has caused that to 
happen.  I see a denial happening in government ranks again that 
they do not recognize what happened and therefore cannot make the 
shift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to argue that the fundamental shift in government 
policy in the 1960s and 1970s, specifically major social programs 
that were introduced and the federal government expansion during 
those years, created the conditions that led to Canada's decline 
of productivity and currency devaluation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might ask whether it was a coincidence that the Canadian 
dollar has had a 30 year decline, that Canada's productivity has 
had a 30 year decline and that the investment in Canada had a 30 
year decline.  I suggest that at the same time taxes went up, the 
debt went up.  There is no coincidence.  It is bad public policy 
by the Liberal and Conservative governments of the day which has 
led to the decline and currency devaluation that we are suffering 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, changes to the employment insurance program moved 
it away from the concept of an insurance program to more of a 
social program function.  The result was an increase in 
unemployment rates, several points higher than that of the United 
States over the last 30 years.  It remains there in good times or 
bad times.  It is just an example of growth or government 
expansion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal government spending continued to grow every year, which 
had to be financed by tax increases and deficits.  The result was 
a $585 billion debt.  It was largely glossed over until about 
1993-94 when we had to finally admit that we were virtually 
bankrupt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the government's response at the time?  That was a 
brand new Liberal government and many of the members here today 
came in at that time.  The newly elected Liberal government 
raised taxes and cut transfers to the provinces to get itself out 
of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did it cut its own spending?  Very little.  Program spending is 
starting to grow again, which shows the Liberals do not recognize 
what needs to be done.  They increased excise taxes on gasoline 
which added to transportation costs.  They hiked capital gains 
tax in those years which discouraged investment.  They allowed 
the discounted Canadian dollar to insulate Canadian exporters 
from restructuring and improving their own productivity through 
investments in technology and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder the Canadian standard of living was slipping away and 
our best and brightest were leaving for better opportunities in 
the United States and other countries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what the finance and industry ministers are saying 
today, Canada is not well positioned as a low tax jurisdiction. 
We just have to look south of the border.  We have not even 
caught up to them from the last time.  Now the Republican 
government of George W. Bush is moving the yardsticks again with 
lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the overdue tax cuts in October's mini budget were 
welcome, their value is hampered by long phase-in periods and 
other half measures.  For example, the corporate tax rate was 
reduced by a mere 1% this year.  The planned seven year reduction 
will not be fully achieved until 2005-2006. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I maintain there is a very real danger that Canada will become 
the incubator economy for the United States and our people will 
be lost to foreign multinationals.  Why does this government not 
learn from the experiences of Ireland, the Netherlands, Georgia, 
Michigan, Ontario and Alberta.  They cut taxes and within a year 
or two saw their revenues grow as an increased growth in the 
economy quickly made up for those cuts.  Canada's national debt 
right now is roughly $565 billion; 25 cents out of every tax 
dollar goes just to pay interest on debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what is happening in Washington.  It is moving again to 
cut taxes.  In fact, it is telling us that the U.S. debt is going 
to paid off by the end of this decade.  Where is the finance 
minister of Canada's plan to pay down the debt?  At the rate he 
is going it will take him 190 years.  That is simply not good 
enough.  We are not sending the right kind of signals to our 
business community for investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this begs the question.  Where is Canada's plan?  I do 
not see it in this throne speech.  I did not see it in the mini 
budget and I do not think they have one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the low Canadian dollar?  Defenders of the low 
Canadian dollar argue that it helps exporters and therefore 
creates jobs.  It begs the question.  If a 66 cent dollar is 
great, why do we not move to 50 cents?  Would that not be better? 
The answer is no because it does not encourage investment by 
Canadians and foreigners in our country.  What it does encourage, 
I would suggest, is other people from other countries coming up 
and buying up companies like the Montreal Canadiens and taking 
them outside the country because our dollar is so weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at investment.  Currently, I think the real 
problem in Canada is the lack of private investment, especially 
investment in research and development.  Canada is currently 
ranked 15th amongst OECD nations on how much it spends on R and D. 
U.S. venture capital investments were 12 times that of Canada in 
1995 and have moved to 18 times what Canada spent on venture 
capital in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going the wrong way.  Public money under the Prime 
Minister's leadership cannot fill that void.  It has to be filled 
because we need to have investors confidence that they will get a 
return on investment.  I would argue that that is happening 
because we have an unfavourable tax climate which has caused lack 
of confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, it is simply a matter of bad public policy.  I am 
concerned that that bad public policy is continuing.  We have had 
30 years of decline and it is not over yet.  Canadian industry 
needs the government to finally pay attention to getting the 
fundamentals right and creating the business environment so 
Canadian companies can succeed on their own.  They need to boldly 
cut taxes to get not just the same as the United States but more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My belief is this is a very weak, timid response.  We have to do 
much better.  I would encourage the Liberal government to bring 
down a budget to that effect as soon as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the previous speaker for pointing out many of the 
obvious shortcomings of the Speech from the Throne and many of 
the obvious flaws in the reasoning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the specifics he dealt with was the problems with the EI 
system.  It was very timely that he pointed this out and I am 
glad he did.  Today a new bill was introduced, allegedly to try 
and repair the completely dysfunctional and broken unemployment 
insurance system in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member spoke to the fact that the system is so broken 
that it ceased to become an insurance system at all.  It does not 
provide insurance benefits to unemployed people.  What is the 
point in having an unemployment insurance system if it does not 
provide insurance to the unemployed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really common sense.  The fact is that less than 40% of 
unemployed people qualify for any benefits whatsoever.  If the 
person is a woman that figure is 25%.  If the person is a youth, 
the figure is 15% of unemployed people who qualify for any 
benefits, even though they are forced to pay into it.  They have 
no choice.  It is a mandatory deduction off your paycheque. 
As a result, the government is getting a surplus from the EI fund 
of $500 million a month, not per year, per month.  That is really 
another tax off the paycheque.  It is not an insurance system any 
more.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The negative nature of not having an employment insurance 
system has added to the profound economic difficulties that some 
regions in the country find themselves in.  Just how much of an 
impact has the absence of any meaningful insurance program had on 
the hon. member's riding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess I would maintain 
that I do not think any employment insurance program can 
substitute for a job.  Most people want to have a job.  That is 
their number one criteria.  I suggest that the moves the Liberal 
government is taking to correct the fundamentals are not good 
enough to allow that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last 30 years we have had chronic unemployment in the 
range of 5% to about 12%.  That is going to vary.  I am 
suggesting, and the analogy I was making, that up until about 
1970 the business cycles of Canada and the United States could be 
charted on a graph.  We could look at the two of them in good and 
bad times.  The economic indicators were always the same.  We 
could put them together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the same with employment insurance and the unemployment 
rate.  However, starting in the 1970s we had a divergence because 
we expanded the employment insurance program to become more of a 
social program.  I do not think that was the right method because 
we built in a penalty for Canadian business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member from Winnipeg that there are many 
shortcomings in the employment insurance program.   He raised the 
example of a person who has to pay into the program but cannot 
collect benefits.  Canadian farmers are in that category as are 
lots of people.  It should be one way or the other.  If a person 
is not going to get benefits from the plan, he or she should be 
exempt from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overtaxing workers and employers to build up large surplus funds 
for general revenue for the government to squander away on its 
priorities is not good enough.  We need to have a true insurance 
program where we have dedicated revenue, not where it is going 
into the general revenue for governments to fritter away. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with some interest to the member for Peace 
River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about bad public policy.  Since when is bringing 
interest rates down, since when is bringing unemployment rates 
down, since when is bringing in and delivering the largest single 
tax decrease in Canadian history of $100 billion and since when 
is reinvesting strategically in things like health care, children 
and poverty bad public policy?  Since when is paying off debt and 
reducing the deficit to zero bad public policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I object to is those members opposite always need to bring 
in the Americans.  They are lovers of the Americans.  Listen to 
how they invoke the name of George W. Bush. Look at how they 
always want to cozy up to American cultural, economic and social 
ways.  Canadians object to that.  More to the point, they reject 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it bad public policy for a person who has carved out his 
career by saying that taxpayers' dollars should be used wisely 
and then turn around and use $800,000 of Albertan taxpayers' 
money to do something that $60,000 could have done?  I ask the 
member for Peace River if that is  good public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to ask the member for Peace River— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I regret that with only five minutes 
for questions and comments, I am trying to be as co-operative as 
I can be with all members on both sides of the House.  I will 
give the floor to the member for Peace River for one final 
minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I suggest that it was 
largely the Liberal government that put us in this terrible mess 
to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was Brian Mulroney's government that was elected to go in and 
clean up the mess which had been created.  The failure of the 
Conservative government to do that was the reason why the Reform 
Party and the Alliance were formed.  It did not listen to the 
huge majority and clean up that mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the lawsuit, I would like to talk about Pearson and 
Airbus.  I believe over $2 million of taxpayers' money went to 
pay for Mr. Mulroney's expenses when the Prime Minister and the 
current Minister of Health had to admit that there was no 
evidence to back up their accusations.  They had to publicly 
apologize to Mr. Mulroney.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Simcoe—Grey.  Let me begin by joining all my colleagues in 
congratulating you on your election to the chair. We look forward 
to your presence in the chair during this session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also take this opportunity to thank the people of 
Parkdale—High Park who re-elected me for a second term.  They 
have renewed their trust and confidence in me to represent their 
interests in the House of Commons.  I am truly honoured by the 
privilege which they have again bestowed on me and I undertake to 
continue to work on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the day the election was called I told my constituents I was 
proud to run on the record of the Liberal government and on the 
policies and programs that have assisted individuals and 
communities in my riding.  I unequivocally repeated this message 
on election night.  Today I once again confirm how proud I am to 
be a member of the Liberal government and of the Prime Minister's 
team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will address the government's commitment in the Speech 
from the Throne to a vibrant Canadian culture and how this 
commitment is integral to fulfilling our government's other 
commitments to creating opportunity, investing in innovation, 
connecting Canadians, investing in skills and learning, and 
helping our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 in my first speech in the House of Commons I spoke about 
the fact that I truly believe we must invest in programs, 
opportunities and partnerships which support our arts and 
culture.  I said then and still believe today that this is one of 
our greatest responsibilities.  I am proud to say that in the 
Speech from the Throne and in the Prime Minister's contribution 
to the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne we made a 
commitment to fulfilling this responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Prime Minister and the government on its 
commitment to innovation by not only increasing federal 
investment in traditional research, institutes and granting 
councils, but also by committing to a reinvestment in arts and 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne clearly states that the focus of our 
cultural policies must be on excellence in the creative process. 
Investing in the creative process is what Canadians need and what 
our children and grandchildren will need to participate in the 
new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by applauding the government's renewed support for 
the CBC to assist it in fulfilling its distinct role as a public 
broadcaster serving all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC is truly one of Canada's national institutions.  It 
connects Canadians from sea to sea to sea.  It speaks to 
Canadians by Canadians about Canadians and provides the Canadian 
perspective to national and international issues at home and 
abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC provides services in English, French and aboriginal 
languages.  It also opens up opportunities for our creative 
people, our artists, directors, set designers, lighting designers 
and writers, just to name a few.  It provides a venue for 
independent producers to produce Canadian content that is not 
only generic and exportable but is important to Canadians and 
talks about our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been very impressed with the public response to 
the history series on television.  The Minister of Canadian 
Heritage recently said that it was a type of project that could 
not be undertaken by the private sector and really ties in with 
the core mandate of telling Canadian stories.  I am very proud to 
say that the producer of the history series, Mr. Mark Starowitz, 
resides in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to the arts in the new economy.  In June 2000 the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development released 
an analysis on why the new economy was arriving sooner in some 
places.  In trying to pinpoint the driving forces of the new 
economy so that governments can nurture them, the OECD 
highlighted the importance of innovation.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For governments the OECD offered a menu of what is quickly 
becoming standard advice:  foster competition, encourage startups 
and venture capital, invest in research and shape education and 
immigration policies to enhance human capital.  It also noted 
that wiring schools will not be enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in the House the Minister of Industry confirmed that 
Canada had surpassed the United States in being the first to 
connect all its schools, and said that the government would 
continue to connect Canadians and provide them with fast, high 
speed efficient broadband. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this connection of Canadians is very laudable, I would add 
that it is simply not enough.  In the Prime Minister's address in 
reply to the Speech from the Throne, he clearly stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a globalized society, in a universe of hundreds of channels, 
in the age of the Internet, it is more important than ever to 
support Canadian culture. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Prime Minister for his commitment thereafter to 
provide significant new support to ensure that our cultural 
institutions, our performers and our artists can play the 
critical role of helping us know ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Minister of Industry spoke about the importance of 
our scientists and their innovations.  Today I want to talk about 
the importance of our artists, writers and creators and their 
innovations.  We need to encourage creativity and innovation, and 
our artists are well suited to play an important role in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer my colleagues to an article written by Robert 
Everett-Green that appeared, unfortunately, on the front page of 
the arts section of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> and not the business 
section.  It was entitled “Art, not IBM, makes kids smarter”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to remember that the arts provide essential 
training for a more creative world.  I too believe that arts, not 
computers, make kids creative.  Many studies have found that 
children exposed to music at an early age score much higher on 
scholastic entrance exams than those who are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne also talked about the important role 
the arts play in our communities.  It also noted the role they 
play in improving our quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech to the Canadian Club in Toronto last September, 
Piers Handling, director of the Toronto International Film 
Festival Group, spoke about the importance of the arts to quality 
of life.  He urged the arts community to articulate the idea 
that, controversial as it might sound, culture is as important as 
health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Handling reminded everyone that the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao 
transformed a once run down port in northern Spain into a vibrant 
city that attracts millions of tourists each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we do not have to look to Europe for examples.  We need 
only look to Stratford, Ontario.  It was on the verge of dying as 
a town after the demise of the steam engine.  What happened?  Tom 
Patterson, with the assistance of the town council and $100, went 
to New York, obtained the necessary rights to produce theatre, 
and made Stratford what it is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is Stratford a wonderful city to visit and a major 
tourist attraction, it has also served, and continues to serve, 
as a training ground for our wonderful artists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be glad to speak about the importance of the arts for 
Canada's future.  However, I will end now with a quote from Jane 
Alexander's book <I>Command Performance</I>, which recounts her 
term as chair of the National Endowment for the Arts.  The quote 
explains why the arts are so important.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we teach a child to sing or play the flute, we teach her how 
to listen.  When we teach her to draw, we teach her to see.  When 
we teach a child to dance, we teach him about his body and about 
space, and when he acts on stage, he learns about character and 
motivation.  When we teach a child design, we reveal the geometry 
of the world.  When we teach children about the folk and 
traditional arts and the great masterpieces of the world, we 
teach them to celebrate their roots and find their own place in 
history. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who knows if we will remember the F-22 400 years from now?  I 
submit that we will still be reading Carol Shields, Margaret 
Atwood, Michael Ondatjie and Mordecai Richler.

need a healthy environment.  We need a good medical system.  We

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised when the government talked about its grand plan 
for going to Kyoto and holding Canada out as an environmental 
standard for the world.  It went to Kyoto without a plan or a 
cost estimate, and yet it promised the world to all the other 
nations there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government came back to the House we asked how it would 
finance its plan and carry it out.  The government did not know 
because even at that time, after it made its promises, it did not 
have a plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The K word is missing from the throne speech, K being Kyoto. Yet 
there are statements about the environment which are quite vague 
and meaningless.  It seems reality has caught up to the 
government in terms of its Kyoto promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the Kyoto agreement and the promises Canada made are so 
significantly absent from the throne speech, where exactly do the 
Liberal government's ill-conceived environmental promises stand 
on its agenda now?  Could the hon. member tell us in detail? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I love to address 
questions on the environment because the issue is very important 
to the people in my riding.  I have worked very hard with a 
number of environmental experts who live in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spoke about the Kyoto protocol.  Yes, it is true we have not 
signed it.  However that does not mean we have not acted on it. 
We have acted on it.  We have worked at reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have worked with the provinces, the territories and the 
municipalities to ensure that we have clean air and water.  We do 
not need an agreement to act on what we have agreed to.  We will 
work with other countries to ensure we all sign the Kyoto 
protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot look to Germany as an example just because it was the 
first to sign the Kyoto protocol.  Germany was able to close its 
industries, but we are not able to do that.  However we will work 
together in partnership with the corporate sector, the labour 
unions and the private sector to ensure that all of our protocol 
targets are met. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Parkdale—High Park is truly an 
expert when it comes to things cultural and things related to the 
arts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was astounded during the election when those reform alliance 
people wanted to privatize the CBC and strip it of the great 
unifying effect it has on the country.  I was shocked when those 
members opposite wanted to get rid of small theatre grants, 
destroy French immersion schools, and strip every cultural venue 
in our great country that makes us strong.  It is a disgrace even 
to hear them today echo the fact that they were prepared to do 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member be so kind as to outline the kind of 
activities that she has been involved in on a personal basis?  I 
know she is a cultural icon in Toronto.  What she needs to do for 
the House is tell us a little about what she does on a very 
grassroots, personal level to make this an even better country, 
unlike what the Alliance people— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I cannot imagine 
where I am going to find the time for the hon. member to do all 
that, but in 30 seconds or less will she please give the House 
the short version? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me tell you what the 
arts does for my community in my riding of Parkdale—High Park. 
Every year the Canadian Stage Company, of which I am a former 
chairman and director, produces Dreams in High Park, which is a 
venue that provides experience through training for actors and 
directors.  They actually have an opportunity to perform 
Shakespeare and practise classic theatre.  What else does it do? 
It also makes the park safe.  It makes people come out into the 
community.  It makes our community safe and prosperous, so we see 
another role for it, as Mr. Handling said at the film festival. 
It works to build our community. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
an absolute pleasure to rise in the House today to provide my 
reply to the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I do so, I want to take a moment to offer my thanks to 
the residents of Simcoe—Grey for once again establishing their 
confidence in my party, my Prime Minister and myself in the 
election this past fall.   They have bestowed on me incredible 
honour and responsibility and I once again take this opportunity 
to tell them that I do not take that honour and that 
responsibility lightly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my family, friends and supporters, I could not possibly say 
thank you enough for their help and the confidence that they have 
shown in me.  I take this job very seriously.  I tell them from 
the bottom of my heart that I do appreciate their confidence and 
I will not let them down.  I know that my Liberal colleagues will 
not let them down either as we focus on the future of this great 
country to ensure that our generation and future generations 
enjoy a higher quality of life than those which have proceeded 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to send a special thank you to my wife Sandi and my three 
children, Amy, Alex and Matthew.  Without them, it certainly 
would have been incredibly difficult.  Sandi certainly has done 
an incredible job in allowing me to come here and represent the 
constituents of Simcoe—Grey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also be remiss, Mr. Speaker, if I did not offer my 
thanks and congratulations to you.  The citizens in your riding 
are certainly well served by one of the most effective and 
honourable men in the House of Commons.  I want to offer my 
sincere appreciation for the help and guidance you have provided 
to me over the last three and a half years.  In my first term of 
parliament your experience was called on by me on numerous 
occasions, and you never ceased to direct me in the appropriate 
way to best serve my constituents.  I appreciate that from the 
bottom of my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To Her Excellency, our Governor General, Adrienne Clarkson, I 
offer my thanks.  Her Excellency has provided a vision for Canada 
that all Canadians can buy into.  She has set bold goals and bold 
visions.  She has made a very bold statement as well, that is, 
that all Canadians will, as they have in the past, come together 
to make sure that Canada will continue to be the best place in 
the entire world in which to live.  I offer my thanks to her for 
making such an incredible statement in such a few short minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what Canadians will do.  We will work together, 
because that is the type of people we are.  We are a caring and 
compassionate community.  We certainly appreciate tolerance and 
diversity, but we build on our weaknesses to create strengths. We 
have done it in the past and we will continue to do it under this 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Liberals, as Canadians, we will seize the opportunities. With 
those opportunities in this ever changing global economy will 
come challenges.  We recognize those challenges on this side of 
the House.  We work very hard with our cabinet colleagues and 
with the members in the caucus to make sure that Canada overcomes 
all of those challenges, whether we are dealing with 
agricultural, cultural or industrial issues, all of the aspects 
that the House and our committees deal with.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done a very good job of trying to make Canada 
the best place in the world in which to live.  It could not have 
happened without the 30 million plus Canadians who joined us in 
that fight.  They have joined us in the fight to make sure that 
the next generation has more advantages and is better positioned 
to carry forward in this new age economy.  This government has 
been successful.  The last election speaks very clearly to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians were loud and clear.  They told us that they wanted a 
balanced approach.  They told us they wanted government to work 
with the people, the provinces and the municipalities and to make 
sure that it is not simply the strong that move forward, to make 
sure that as the country moves forward as a whole we take the 
weakest with us as well.  The throne speech has done exactly 
that.  It has laid out a course.  It has laid out a vision that 
the country as a whole can buy into to ensure that as we in the 
country move forward the weakest are not left behind.  It is not 
the Canadian way to leave the weakest behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what some of my friends in the Alliance might think, 
it is incredibly important for the federal government to play a 
key role in the everyday lives of Canadians.  There is a need for 
a strong federal presence in the country, from coast to coast to 
coast.  Through the delivery mechanisms and bureaucracies we 
have, we are doing that, and we will do a better job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can cite numerous examples within my own riding.  There is 
Human Resources Development Canada, without doubt one of the 
hardest working bureaucracies we have in government today.  I 
take this opportunity to thank the dedicated men and women who 
have been delivering the programs that have made a difference in 
the lives of people in my riding.  My hat is off to those people, 
because despite the scurrilous accusations that have been made in 
the House and outside the House toward some of those individuals, 
the federal government has made an incredible difference through 
these bureaucracies, with the support of Canadians throughout our 
great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that touched my heart in the throne speech, 
perhaps because I have three children of my own, is the focus on 
a national children's agenda.  I was moved when the Governor 
General talked about the new challenge for Canadians.  “Seize 
this challenge” was the statement.  We were told to come 
together and make sure that there are new opportunities for our 
young people, not simply for those in the upper or middle 
economic classes but for all young people.  When I hear those 
kinds of things, I get terribly excited.  I think we can make 
another big difference in this coming 37th parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot has been done.  I am looking across the floor and people 
are nodding.  These people recognize that the government has done 
an incredible job with the young people of the country.  I 
certainly appreciate the fact that they are acknowledging that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we talk about Canada's national child benefit program, 
the $2.2 billion investment signed in September 2000, or the 
extending of parental leave for new parents, the Liberal 
government has made a big difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what is very clear in the throne speech is that there 
is still a lot of work to be done and a long way to go to make 
sure that things gets better.  That is the government's 
responsibility:  to make sure that as we move forward as a 
society the weakest are not left behind.  I have heard the Prime 
Minister say that we will not leave the weakest behind.  I have 
heard cabinet ministers say it.  I have heard my colleagues say 
it when I have visited their ridings and they have visited mine. 
We will make sure that this is a country founded on one country 
moving forward, not on parts of a country moving forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech also touched on a variety of other topics, 
many of which will play a very critical role in the development 
of my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, having visited it in the past, my 
riding has an economy made up of three separate and distinct 
things:  agriculture, tourism and industry.  I was extremely 
pleased to see that all three areas were touched on in the throne 
speech because that provides an opportunity for municipal 
councils, non-profit organizations, agricultural groups and 
private sector companies to know in just what direction the 
government is heading.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has clearly outlined a path for positive growth. 
It does not hoard negativity.  it does not use fear mongering. 
Rather it lays out a vision for Canada of which I know everyone 
in the House is extremely proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some questions have been raised in the House over the last 
couple of days about how the throne speech will position the 
Canadian economy in relation to the downturn in the U.S. economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not thank our finance minister for 
the wonderful job he has done in ensuring that our youngest 
Canadians have an incredible foundation, a secure foundation, 
which is a complete change from seven or eight years ago.  Based 
on that foundation, Canada will move forward.  It will be a 
global leader, not only economically but, unlike my friends in 
the reform alliance party, it will be a leader socially as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tip my hat to the Governor General, the Prime Minister, my 
colleagues, the newly elected members and to you, Mr. Speaker. I 
will enjoy working closely with them to make sure the 37th 
parliament is the best parliament in Canadian history and that we 
achieve the results to which the Liberal government is committed: 
a stronger and more united Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my colleague on the other side seemed to dwell on the 
economy and stated that things were going very well in his 
riding.  I am very happy to hear that things are fine in his 
riding and that Canadians are in good hands.  His riding is 
fortunate to be represented by him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He gave a very nice speech using flowery words.  We would all 
like to see those things happen, but there are clouds hanging 
over the economic scene and throwing cold water on the 
projections they have made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the tug-of-war between ministers taking place on 
that side of the House.  It is a cause of concern for us, 
especially on the question of international trade.  I heard the 
Minister for International Trade talk about Canada following WTO 
rules and Canada needing a rules based system because that is 
where our prosperity lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then another minister throws cold water on Canada's stand of 
following a rules based system, which will have a long term 
impact.  We can see the war beginning in Brazil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned that in his riding the economy is doing well but 
there are clouds on the horizon.  I would like him to comment on 
the tug-of-war that is taking place on his side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. 
member that there are clouds on my horizon.  As I look across and 
see the Canadian Alliance it is always cloudy.  It is always 
gloom and doom.  That is not the reality in the country. It is 
not about negativity; it is about being realistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is very well positioned to weather any economic storm. 
When one looks at the economy and what has been achieved in the 
last seven years, it is an absolute economic miracle.  Those are 
not my words.  Those are the words of the <I>Financial Times</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my colleagues in the reform alliance getting upset because 
they do not have a plan to deal with these kinds of issues.  They 
do not want to talk about positive growth, what has been done to 
reduce debt or the most massive tax reduction strategy in 
Canadian history.  They do not want to talk about an incredible 
shoring up of our social programs.  They want to talk about gloom 
and doom in the U.S.  There are times when I am not totally 
positive whether I am debating with members of parliament or 
congressmen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell Canadians that Canada is very well positioned to 
lead the way in this new age technology globally.  We will do it. 
We will continue based on the track record and on the historical 
evidence the government put forward today.  I am proud to say 
that I will be part of that parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
hon. colleague from Simcoe—Grey mentioned that it was important 
for young people to have faith in their country and to have 
something to look forward to.  I wonder if he sees that going 
beyond just the opportunity for cultural endeavours, which I 
agree is equally important, but also to educational 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think it is important to have faith in a democratic 
system that allows the people of Canada to express their 
disagreements with the Government of Canada and to have the right 
to express by open demonstrations their beliefs that not 
everything the government is doing is okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to the issue of free trade not being mentioned a 
great deal within the budget.  We have seen a situation where we 
agree that trade is important, but free trade seems to be open 
season on labour rights, environmental rights or human rights 
within the different countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am specifically referring to Canada talking about trade 
agreements but not making any stipulation that the countries with 
which it will trade will ensure that human rights violations are 
not taking place and that environmental standards are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to give an insight into this matter, I have a list in front 
of me of 77 Columbian trade unionists who have been assassinated 
over the last year by paramilitaries.  I wonder if Canada is 
making sure that those countries it trades with are treating 
their people fairly as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is quite obvious by the 
member's statements that she is truly concerned about not only 
the plight of young people here in Canada but those abroad as 
well.  There were many topics touched on in her comments.  I 
might have to relegate myself to one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She spoke about the opportunity for youth.  I would like to 
provide an example of where we can really make a difference with 
youth but not simply on the cultural side of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a program under Youth Service Canada and delivered 
through Human Resources Development Canada.  It has made an 
incredible difference in the lives of young people in my riding. 
It has provided them with the necessary lifestyle skills and the 
necessary job skills to secure full time permanent employment in 
our society.  Those young people have become productive and happy 
members of society.  In that regard, I think the government has 
done an incredible job in making sure we deal with the problems 
our young people face.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Jonquière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the start of my third mandate, I am very pleased to rise for 
the first time in this House.  As a member elected with the 
support of 60% of the people, as a sovereignist and an MP, I 
want to say that there are pressing social concerns.  I am not 
saying that those who voted for me were all sovereignists, but I 
know they supported someone they knew to be one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, members 
will not be surprised that my attention is drawn particularly in 
the throne speech to the section on celebrating Canadian 
citizenship. One sentence struck me considerably, and I quote it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was born of a noble vision and an act of will. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Noble, people might think so, but I would say a pragmatic vision in 
which four provinces decided to form an organization that suited 
them.  However, in their act of will, they made a serious 
mistake, namely, and among others, giving the federal government 
spending power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This creature born of the provinces has worked systematically to 
become the government of all the people living in Canada. 
Today, in the throne speech, we have a specific example in which 
the government regularly and systematically denies the 
responsibilities of the provinces and the very foundations of 
our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, there were two founding peoples.  Even here, in 
parliament, we have doors symbolizing this.  Today, the federal 
government is categorically denying this fact by its action and 
its vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it swept away not only the protection of Quebec 
society but all of the French fact within the country.  As 
regards the proportion of francophones, we need only compare the 
situation as it was in 1867 with the situation today to see that 
there is an operation underway to assimilate francophone 
communities.  Today, the government refers to them as 
“sustainable francophone communities”, which means there are 
some that are not.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should refrain from boasting too much. Many signs point to 
the fact that we are not in an ideal society. I think this will 
only be possible when it is recognized that there are two 
nations in Canada, that Quebecers have a right to their 
sovereignty, and that the Canadian federalism is not the best 
way to foster better relations between these two nations. That 
is my response to the very basis of what the federal government 
wants to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, there is a profound lack of 
vision in this throne speech. 
There is no mention of the challenges of the future or the kind 
of Canada we want in the next 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why have we not been given more details, in a transparent way, 
on what to expect in the next 20 years? We will have a free 
trade area that will include the three Americas. We will 
probably have a common currency. And we will have, willy-nilly, 
an even stronger emergence of nationalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need vast political spaces in order to develop 
markets. Canada became a large political entity when, because of 
protectionism, large countries were necessary in order to 
develop sizeable markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, with free trade, this is no longer the case. 
Small political entities can set up democratic organisations 
capable of acting rapidly and efficiently. We see that 
particularly in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Speech from the Throne lacks vision. It contains some sort 
of grocery list of things that the government would like to do 
in the short term. I think that, ultimately, when history judges 
this Prime Minister's governments, this will probably be the 
main criticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are often mentioned in the throne speech. We are told 
they will be given priority. We first have to see who is 
responsible for what. In my opinion, the federal government's 
responsibility in this matter should be to give money to the 
provinces to help them manage their education systems properly, 
and not to create new programs on top of the ones already in 
place for early childhood development and for children at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time the government interferes in education like that, it 
creates duplication. Of course, this can be very interesting 
from a visibility point of view. This is probably the main 
reason why the Speech from the Throne is putting all that 
forward. However it would have been much more efficient if the 
government had actually said it was going to use the surplus 
money it has collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government collects much more money in income tax 
than it needs to fulfil its responsibilities. It would have been 
much better to use these surpluses to lower income tax or to 
give the money back through its redistribution of wealth 
function, so that the provinces could have the money they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec and Canada there are indeed areas where the programs 
that should be set up are not those announced by the federal 
government, but those the local governments want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If federal money went directly to Quebec, the province could in 
turn give more autonomy to local school boards. That means they 
could have money to keep the small village school open. For our 
rural communities this is often a priority, much more so than 
programs put forth by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, I believe the federal government does not 
assume its responsibilities. It tries to increase its visibility 
by intervening in areas outside its jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing with regards to children. Fundamentally, 
I find this a major problem. The government keeps talking about 
programs to help children. On the other hand, for the past 
five years, we have had an employment insurance scheme that has 
been creating poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are not poor per se. They are poor because their 
parents are poor. Eligibility rules have been tightened; benefits 
have been cut; young workers need 910 hours of work to qualify. 
The same applies to women re-entering the labour market. All 
these measures have resulted in an increase in child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the government says it is going to issue cheques for 
children, but their parents will remain trapped. I find this 
behaviour unacceptable. 
It cannot continue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne provides for many intrusions in 
education. It would appear that the federal government is sorry 
that it does not have a department of education. Now, with 
globalization, it feels it is important to properly train 
people. The problem is this is not its responsibility. It 
belongs to the provinces. The government should accept this fact 
by withdrawing from taxation sectors and to allow the provinces to 
deal with this issue more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was satisfied with a part of the minister's answer, yesterday, 
when he said that, on the lumber issue, the priority will be to 
return to free trade when the agreement expires. 
I find that in this industry the federal government has been 
slow to act. It might well, for a lack of time, have to renew 
part of the current agreements or reach compromises with the 
Americans, to the detriment of some Canadian regions covered by 
the current agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that four Canadian provinces are covered by 
this agreement, but not the others. In the export trade this is 
very prejudicial, for example to my riding, the Témiscouata 
area where many sawmills export lumber. Both owners and 
employees want us to revert to free trade in the lumber 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, and I will conclude on this, there is concrete evidence 
that the Speech of the Throne is sometimes devoid of substance. 
On page 11, it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when losing a job also meant immediate loss of 
income for workers and their families. And so Canadians created 
Employment Insurance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That program generated a surplus of $30 billion.  Today, the 
government is introducing a bill which should be a logical 
follow-up to this policy statement.  However all it does is confirm 
that the  government wants to grab that $30 billion surplus. 
The government does not want to put the money back into the 
program even though some young people and some women are not 
eligible and even though seasonal workers do not have an income 
throughout their period of unemployment, in spite of the 
economic prosperity we are experiencing. This is totally 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, I think people will understand that we 
cannot vote in favour of such a Speech from the Throne.  This 
applies to people of Quebec of course, because the speech is a 
denial of Quebec as such, but it also applies to all those who 
care for social justice because, in this Speech from the Throne, 
there is no basis to ensure the proper distribution of wealth 
that we ought to expect. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague 
just pointed out 
how people confuse things in the House. I have been here 
since the beginning of the week and I have been listening 
carefully to find out what is going on. We have heard some 
incredible things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent nine years in the Quebec National Assembly. We had some 
idea of how we were treated. However I am shocked to hear some of 
the things that are being said here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is constantly and increasingly trying 
to interfere in Quebec's jurisdictions—I am here to protect 
Quebec's interests—but that is also true for all the provinces. 
The government is trying to create confusion. When we criticize 
the government for not taking its responsibilities, for example 
as regards the environment, we are told that this is a 
provincial jurisdiction. On the other hand, when the government 
should leave the money to the provinces to fulfil their 
responsibilities, it gets involved. This is truly scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member who just spoke. Two things 
are confused. The government talks about tax cuts and employment 
insurance reform. Tax cuts will help the rich get richer, while 
employment insurance reform will make the poor poorer. These two 
issues are discussed together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quickly give an example. 
Under the most recent tax cut, a person earning $100,000 will 
save about $2,000 in taxes. 
If that same person, or his brother, earned $35,000 under the 
same conditions, he would save seven times less or about $350.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member: Could he tell me if he has figured this 
out? I would like him to explain this to me. Why is the 
government creating confusion? Is it to fool people or is it 
because it does not really know the different impact of these 
two issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Champlain mentioned 
a major concern about the current system and the way the federal 
government wants to achieve equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that if a worker earning $100,000 is 
eligible to EI he pays premiums on the first $39,000. He does 
not pay any premium on his income over $39,000, while workers 
earning $39,000 pay premiums on 100% of their income. This is 
the money that was used to eliminate the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a tax cut, we tell high income workers:“We have 
eliminated the deficit on the back of workers who earn less than 
you and now we can give you a rebate”. This is unacceptable in 
my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not mean that we do not need to cut taxes or to put 
money back into the taxpayers' pockets. What we see however is a 
very unfair approach for those who need a better EI system to 
achieve equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal workers earning $15,000, $18,000 or $20,000 a year, and 
their families, do not necessarily need a tax reduction more 
than they need EI benefits that will give them the money they 
need while they are unemployed. That would be the right way to 
achieve equity in our society. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to have 
the opportunity to speak today.  Before I begin, I would like to 
thank the people of Jonquière for renewing their confidence in 
me this past November 27.  I can assure them that I am going to 
focus all my energies, as I have in the past, on meeting their 
needs.  My thanks to the people of Jonquière, Lac Kénogami, 
Shipshaw, Larouche and Laterrière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak today in response to the Speech from the 
Throne.  I witnessed the throne speech masquerade this past 
Tuesday, and today I have just witnessed another with the 
introduction of the bill on employment insurance reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and Quebecers will no longer be fooled.  This is the 
last time the government will manage to pull the wool over 
their eyes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had an election this past November. 
The Prime Minister took everyone by surprise, calling an 
election after only three and one-half years in office.  No one 
expected the government, with its boasts about its surplus, its 
so-called good management and its claims to have settled all the 
problems of Canadian society, to call an election. 
Unfortunately it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was there on the legislative agenda on wich to build a 
campaign? 
The government said it was going to share the wealth 
between the poorest and the wealthiest.  I attempted to discuss 
this matter of the distribution of wealth with the Liberal 
candidates in my region, but none had any idea what this was all 
about.  They all realized that the government was lying by 
telling the public that the wealth was going to be distributed 
between the richest and the poorest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the Prime Minister called an election because he 
knew that the leader of the Canadian Alliance was not ready to 
go out on the hustings.  We can no longer be taken in by this 
sort of arrogance from a party that walks all over the working 
class and the disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Jonquière, many workers are soon going to lose 
their jobs with large companies, such as Abitibi Consolidated 
Inc.—not to name names—which have decided to modernize their 
operations, 
which will lay off 250 workers aged 55 or older. 
They are called older workers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1420"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT52"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT52"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1420

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the three and a half years I have been in Ottawa, I have put 
questions to the Minister of Human Resources Development.  There 
used to be a program for older worker adjustment known as POWA 
to help older workers. This program made it possible for them to 
look forward to a decent retirement, to head into retirement 
with benefits under the EI plan. They had, after all, paid 
premiums throughout their working lives, without ever reaping 
the benefit. For three and a half years, the minister has been 
telling us that these people should take job retraining, be 
mobile and change their line of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of these people do not have much education. In my 
region at that time, it was easy to get a job.  Right after 
second or third year high school, young people went to work in 
the factory and were sure of staying there until they retired. 
The situation has changed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they ask them to do it, but they have no money for these 
people.  However there is money in the employment insurance fund. 
This year alone there is a surplus of $6 billion in this fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government doing with the employment insurance fund? 
In the latest bill it has tabled, it is returning 8% of the 
$6 billion to the contributors.  Only four out of ten will get 
benefits.  What is it doing with the remaining 92% of the fund? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I know, we do not contribute because our salaries are 
above $39,000.  The Government of Canada does not contribute a 
cent to the EI fund.  Only workers and employers contribute. 
Why does the government give itself the right to dictate the 
rules and why has it the power to decide who will and who will 
not draw benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the coming years, I think there will be real problems, as the 
result of what is happening in Ottawa.  These problems will 
arise because there is no respect for the legitimacy of the 
ordinary people, people who manage to provide decent social 
conditions for themselves with the little they earn, but when 
they pay insurance, they cannot draw on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill the Minister of Human Resources Development has just 
tabled is no different from the one tabled before the election. 
I think we will do a real job on them, in the Standing Committee 
on Human Resources Development. We will make them abide by their 
promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport and the 
Minister of Public Works come to my area with the Minister of 
Regional Development and say to the people of the 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean “We will listen to you and we will amend the 
act. Rest assured of that and vote for us. If you vote 
massively, we will satisfy you all”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see today that this was only cheap talk to get votes. 
No, ordinary people will not be deceived again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk about the Speech from the Throne, which 
completely ignores the status of women. Last spring we had the 
women's march. Women marched on Ottawa. 
I marched with them. They came to make demands. There is no 
mention of those demands in the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the chairwoman of the Fédération des femmes du Québec, 
Françoise David? Why has she not come to Ottawa to berate the 
government, which does not care about women? Most of these women 
are single parents. I will not tolerate this any more as a woman 
and as a citizen of Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's arrogance must come to an end. I cannot see 
how I can do anything but vote against this Speech from the 
Throne.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I listened to the fine speech by the Minister of 
the Environment. As members know, I was the Bloc Quebecois 
environment critic during the last parliament. I would always 
tell the minister in committee and elsewhere “By gosh, you make 
good speeches; but you never deliver”. People always say “Ah, he 
is very good at delivering good speeches”. Today I listened 
very carefully to the minister. Things have not changed at all. 
The government is still infringing on provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec municipalities are the creatures of the provincial 
government. Municipalities come under the municipalities act. 
Now the federal government is creating programs that are 
directly geared to these municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the government do with endangered species? We opposed 
the bill during the last session. It could not be passed by the 
House because, again, the government wanted to interfere in 
provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Habitat is a provincial jurisdiction. We all know that birds and 
endangered species go together. The federal government has its 
own jurisdictions, its parks, but it does not act. It wants 
to tell others what to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sometimes difficult to look at one's self. It is 
easier to tell people “Do as we say, but not as we do”. The 
government is very good at governing in an arrogant manner by 
telling others to do as it says, but to ignore what it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next three, four or five years, I will keep a very close 
eye on this government. 
I am currently concerned with regional development, which is 
another interesting issue. The government will have to stop 
creating in the regions needs that do not meet the 
expectations just because it wants visibility. Enough is 
enough. We are entitled to a tax refund. We pay federal taxes 
and the time will come when this government will have to meet 
our needs with our taxes. 
This is just the beginning. I will vote against the throne 
speech.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Jonquière for raising the important 
issue about the state of the employment insurance system and how 
it is failing Canadian workers in every respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member pointed out something that is very important and 
I am glad she did.  She pointed out that the federal government 
does not pay into the employment insurance fund anymore.  It 
stopped doing that in the late 1980s.  Only employers and employees 
contribute to the fund.  Where then does the government get the 
right to use the surplus for anything other than income 
maintenance for employees, which is what it was designed to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member not agree that if we deduct something from 
people's paycheques, tell them that it is for a specific purpose 
and then use it for something completely different, that it is, 
in the very best light, a breach of trust?  In the worst light, 
it is out and out fraud.  An absolute fraud is being committed on 
working people because they are paying faithfully into an 
employment insurance program but are being denied benefits. No 
wonder there is a surplus, no one qualifies anymore.  Less than 
40% of unemployed people, less than 25% of women and less than 
15% of youth qualify even though they have to pay into the 
program because it is mandatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding, the third poorest riding in the country, the 
changes to EI cost $20.8 million a year in benefits that would 
have come into the riding.  Can members imagine what they would 
do if a company wanted to move into their riding with a $20.8 
million payroll?   They would pave the streets with gold to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member to tell us the situation in her 
riding and the impact the cuts to employment insurance have had 
on the unemployed people in Jonquière. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold: </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
hon. member of the New Democratic Party.  All ridings are having 
to cope with an extremely serious problem relating to employment 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a saying in our area “Piquer, c'est voler”.  That means 
if a person goes into another's pocket and takes his money 
it that is considered stealing until proven otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this government is doing at the present time in the matter 
of employment insurance is dipping directly into the workers' 
pockets.  This is a serious matter, and I will respond to the 
member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a heavily unionized region.  I believe that 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean is the most unionized area of Canada and of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the last federal election, there was a movement in our 
area that rallied together hundreds and hundreds of workers who 
took to the streets to protest the employment insurance bill. 
They even told the minister of revenue, who is also the minister 
responsible for 
regional development, “Hit the road back across the Parc des 
Laurentides; you are not wanted here”.  He had to pack up his 
bags and head back home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had great plans for the construction of the Alcan plant at 
Alma, where hundreds of thousands of workers were employed.  Now 
these people have no work and they will end up on employment 
insurance. 
There are no measures whatsoever to help them, no structured 
programs that will let these workers gain some benefit from 
what is rightfully theirs or to allow them to be directed into 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this needs looking into.  If I had any more time, there 
is much more I could say. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It being 2.30 p.m., this House stands 
adjourned until Monday next at 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
