(Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today with good news for 
businesses in my riding of Cambridge, and congratulations for the 
Royal Bank and the Business Development Bank of Canada. These 
organizations recognized the needs of businesses in the industrial 
heartland of southern Ontario. They announced on March 1 that 
they are forming a strategic alliance to provide financing for small 
and medium size businesses.
<P>
	The program will provide loans in the range of $50,000 to 
$500,000, filling a recognized gap that exists in traditional lending 
patterns. This financing program is targeted to businesses in the 
expansion phase, especially those in information technology, 
telecommunications, biotechnology, medical devices, plastics 
processing, auto parts, advanced manufacturing technology, new 
materials and the agribusiness and food processing industries.
<P>
	I applaud the Royal Bank and the Business Development Bank 
of Canada for providing this tangible support for small and medium 
size businesses, the backbone of the Canadian economy.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage has suggested the time has come for 
a review of the CRTC mandate. The fact that the government has 
intervened so many times in the last 18 months, obviously the 
review is long overdue.
<P>
	The minister has suggested this review would be internal, a 
review conducted on the CRTC by the CRTC. Surely, this is a joke.
<P>
	Last year the cabinet had no difficulty intervening in the CRTC 
process when satellite licensing became an issue. I suggest that was 
because Power DirecTv, also known as Desmarais, also known as 
the Prime Minister's son-in-law, was a licence bidder. In spite of 
cabinet interference, Power DirecTv still had to walk away from its 
licence.
<P>
	Yesterday the cabinet was asked again to intervene with the 
CRTC on the satellite licensing process. It probably will not 
intervene this time because the Prime Minister's relatives are not 
involved.
<P>
	This statement is an alert to the news media. Watch for the 
heritage minister to slip this cabinet non-decision passed you 
during the turmoil generated by today's budget story.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans,

Quebec, Tran Trieu Quan, has been unfairly held in Vietnam, even 
after the Canadian Prime Minister's visit to that country. The Prime 
Minister merely inquired about the situation instead of demanding 
that Mr. Tran be released.
<P>
	On behalf of the people of Quebec, we urge the Canadian 
government to realize that the diplomatic representations made to 
obtain the release of the Sainte-Foy businessman were 
unsuccessful.
<P>
	We therefore call for the immediate suspension of any economic, 
cultural or social assistance to Vietnam until Mr. Tran is reunited 
with his family.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is very important that the government be aware of 
the need to protect Canadian citizens travelling abroad whether as 
business people or as tourists.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring 
to the attention of this House the deep concerns of many fishermen 
across the Scotia-Fundy area. I have been meeting with the 
fishermen in this area and on Monday I attended the round table in 
Dartmouth, Nova Scotia with the fishermen and officials from 
DFO.
<P>
	For decades the fishing industry has been the backbone of many 
local communities in Atlantic Canada. The new fishing policies 
such as licence fee increases, a new professional core fishery, 
ITQs, and Bills C-98 and C-115 have threatened the very survival 
of the hand-line fishery. Serious flaws in the Oceans Act as well as 
the Fisheries Act must be addressed.
<P>
	I call on this government before it proceeds any further to allow 
the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans to travel from 
coast to coast so that fishermen can be heard and changes 
implemented before a way of life is destroyed.

the intimidating tactics being employed by China off the coast of 
Taiwan. Why is it that superpowers cannot resist the urge to act the 
bully when it comes to small islands in their so-called sphere of 
influence.
<P>
	The People's Republic of China should give up the notion that 
Taiwan is somehow part of China. Let China be China and let 
Taiwan be Taiwan. The Taiwanese people, including its aboriginal 
population, have a history and identity that is independent and 
distinct from the mainland. Any dispute of this fact must be 
resolved peacefully and with utmost respect for the democratically 
expressed wishes of the Taiwanese people.
<P>
	It is time for China to put the political residue of the civil war 
behind it and realize that Taiwan, especially now that it is a 
democracy, is a country of its own and should no longer be seen as 
a refuge for the losers of a bygone battle.

major dailies report that child prostitution is on the rise in some 
parts of the country.
<P>
	This situation is totally unacceptable and we must vehemently 
condemn this undermining of Canadian  children's basic rights. All 
those working with children must be made aware of this plague and 
co-ordinate their efforts to put an end to the activities of these 
exploitative and depraved individuals.
<P>
	Current legislation must be vigorously enforced so that those 
who commit these repugnant crimes will be punished as they 
should be. If we need to take additional measures or to adopt 
amendments in order to make the fight against child prostitution 
and sexual abuse more effective, we should do so without delay.

Canadian businesses, which are contemplating setting up an 
in-house training program for high school, college and university 
graduates.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	According to program officials, this program will create 50,000 
entry level jobs for young people and help restore hope to a 
generation that would be only too pleased to play an active role in 
our society.
<P>
	Also noteworthy is the fact that all funding for this program will 
be provided by the companies, to the tune of $12,000 per trainee 
per year. Only administrative expenses will have to be covered by 
the Canadian government.
<P>
	This is a good move worth mentioning, especially after our 
Prime Minister recently called for greater co-operation between the 
private sector and government to promote job creation.

equality here in Canada and around the world.
<P>
	Canada is respected as a world leader in advancing women's 
equality. One of our priorities is the recognition of human rights as 
the foundation of women's equality. Human rights are universal, 
inalienable and indivisible.
<P>
	The International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic 
Development has chosen International Women's Day, March 8, to 
present the first Florence Bird award. It is an honour that 
recognizes efforts to promote women's rights as human rights in 
the media. It is a fitting tribute to the remarkable Canadian 
journalist and activist who headed the Royal Commission on the 
Status of Women almost 30 years ago.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week, Stéphane Dion, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, travelled to British Columbia, where he 
tried to sell the distinct society concept to the people of this region, 
who are bitterly opposed to it.
<P>
	In an attempt to reassure them, he stated that recognizing 
Quebec as a distinct society confers no additional powers on 
Quebec and, therefore, does not take anything away from other 
Canadians. What is the use of talking about distinct society if it is a 
meaningless concept? Will Mr. Dion keep talking about a worthless 
clause? Some other weekend, will he try to convince Quebecers 
that a distinct society clause could bring about the changes 
promised by the no side in the days leading up to the October 30 
referendum?
<P>
	Frankly, Mr. Dion should stop using the phrase ``distinct 
society'', which has become trite and has lost any meaning when he 
uses it. For the moment, he should focus on how the federal 
government could change how the powers are shared.

	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
talk about slash and burn. Some disabled Canadians, through no 
fault of their own, have found themselves indebted to the federal 
government.
<P>
	Revenue Canada changed the forms for claiming the federal 
disability tax credit. These disabled Canadians, after submitting the 
new forms, were deemed ineligible for the credit as they were no 
longer considered to be disabled. Figure that one out. They were 
also told to refund to the government the credit they had received 
from previous years, with interest.
<P>
	One constituent whose husband is severely disabled wrote to me 
saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Revenue Canada wrote us February 2, 1996. They stated that our disability 
deduction had been disallowed for 1994 and we owed them $1,200 including 
$100 interest. The amount had to be paid by February 20, 1996 or more interest 
would be added-$1,200 is an entire month's paycheque for us.</BLOCKQUOTE>

the concept of gender equality is at the very heart of the values in 
which Canadians firmly believe.
<P>
	We recognize that women face particular problems which must 
be eliminated in order to ensure equality. Since women are 
confronted to situations that differ from those that men face, the 
federal government pledged to take these differences into account 
in the development, review and implementation of federal 
initiatives.
<P>
	The guide to policy development, which is based on a 
comparative analysis between the two sexes and which was 
released earlier this week, will be a key component in the 
fulfilment of our commitment.
<P>

women to our society's success. Together, let us make sure that 
women and men can co-operate as equals in the building of a better

During International Women's Week we are invited to reflect on 
women's progress in all fields of achievement.

	In keeping with our lead role in talks at the Beijing conference

making. Too often, hearings in front of federal boards and agencies

Drunk Driving, known as SADD, ably led by Jeremy Elder is 
planning a  march to be held in Humboldt on Friday, March 15, 
1996.
<P>
	The purpose of the march is to draw attention to the social and 
economic costs of impaired driving. Stated like that, the 
consequences of drunk driving do not seem that consequential, 
much less horrific than when expressed in human terms. Consider 
instead the grief of a parent who loses a child to a drunk driver, or 
the fear of a small child waiting alone in the dark in a car outside 
the local beer parlour wondering if Dad will be able to make his

<P>
	But women are vulnerable. For example, 52,000 North 
American women die of breast cancer each year. In the ten years of 
the Vietnam war, 48,000 women died on the battlefield. Over the 
same period, more than 300,000 American women died of breast 
cancer. This terrible disease is usually hereditary, but no one is 
safe.
<P>
	Last year, in Vancouver, more than 3,000 people showed that 
they care about other people's lives by taking part in the walk

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CUBA">CUBA</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
conflict between the U.S. and Cuba is heating up. Canada is now 
caught up in it, as the target of the virulent attack by Senator Jesse 
Helms. The crisis now developing between Canada and the U.S. is 
liable to have very serious economic repercussions.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Does he agree that the 
American reaction affects Canada first and foremost, because 
Canada is Cuba's principal trade partner, according to recent 
figures?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I had the opportunity to discuss this problem with the 
President of the United States last week. I informed him that it was 
unacceptable to Canada that legislation passed by the U.S. 
Congress could apply outside that country.
<P>
	On Monday and Tuesday, I had an opportunity to discuss the 
same problem with 13 Caribbean heads of government. In the joint 
press release issued at the conference, it was stated unanimously 
that laws with extraterritorial jurisdiction are unacceptable under 
international law.
<P>
	Obviously, Mr. Helms' statement speaks for itself. My 
conversations with the president indicate that he is aware of 
Canada's objections, and that the bill is currently before Congress. 
We hope that people will become aware of the long term 
consequences if, at the international level, all countries took the 
same kind of initiative as the U.S. has.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given 
the current protectionist atmosphere in the U.S., does the Prime 
Minister not feel that, over and above the conflict with Cuba, we 
are dealing here with a challenge to the very terms of the Free 
Trade Agreement?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think that this bill reflects the atmosphere in the 
aftermath of the Cuba-U.S. incident. As the House is  aware, we 
have clearly expressed our disapproval to the Government of Cuba 
concerning their attack on civilian aircraft flying outside Cuban 
territory. At any rate, the International Civil Aviation Organization 
is addressing the problem today in Montreal.
<P>
	I have learned from experience that U.S. pre-election fever often 
leads to statements that are more heated than they would be at other 
times. After the election, perhaps Senator Helms or others will be 
more approachable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Minister for International Trade made a statement 
here in this House in which he expressed a hope that the president 
will use the discretion available to him to reduce the impact of the 
bill. Should that hope not be fulfilled, however, what action plan 
does Canada have in mind to protect the thousands of jobs that 
would be affected?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after a law is passed in the United States there is always 
room for the administration to take some precise action. I discussed 
that possibility with the president and he will look into it. We do 
not think this law will be in operation for many months to come, 
not before the end of the summer.
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
commission of inquiry on Somalia is just as muddled as the events 
it is investigating.
<P>
	On February 29, the Minister of Justice said in this House that, in 
order to avoid a conflict of interest, and I repeat, in order to avoid a 
conflict of interest, he had asked certain individuals to be 
represented by counsel of their choice rather than counsel from the 
Department of Justice.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Finance explain the fact that the 
highest ranking officers currently under investigation, that is, 
Lieutenant-General Gordon Reay, General James Gervais, General 
John de Chastelain and Admiral John Anderson along with the 
former deputy minister, Robert Fowler, continue to be represented 
by counsel from his department?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it should be remembered that the 
commission itself, when it  undertook its work, said it would focus 
the inquiry on the senior members of the forces.
<P>
	In recent months it has interviewed some of the more junior 
ranking officers and enlisted personnel. This matter came up in the 
House last week and I take this occasion to repeat what I said then. 
The fundamental principle on which we have operated is that where 
interests conflict separate representation will be afforded.
<P>
	In 13 cases so far we have arranged to have separate lawyers 
retained and paid for by the Government of Canada so that 
individual interest can be represented.
<P>
	Whenever in the course of an interview or in the course of 
testimony it becomes clear that there is a difference between the 
interest of that person and the institutional interest of the 
government, we ask that the proceedings stop and we advise the 
person of the right to separate counsel. If the person makes that 
choice, we arrange for them to get a separate lawyer.
<P>
	As I said last week, if the hon. member is aware of any case in 
which justice is not being served because that process is not being 
followed, I encourage them to tell me about it so that we can 
redress it immediately.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
Minister of Justice does not consider this a flagrant conflict of 
interest, what does he think of the fact that lawyers from his 
department are concocting both the prosecution and the defence of 
the senior ranking officers and that, moreover, they are sitting at 
the same table during the hearings and regularly consulting each 
other about the course the hearing is taking?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am afraid I do not understand the 
point the hon. member is trying to make. I hear words being used 
but they do not add up, at least in my mind, to an effective criticism 
of the process.
<P>
	The commission is represented by separate counsel, not 
government counsel, paid for by the people. The government and 
the Department of National Defence are represented by justice 
lawyers.
<P>
	As I have said, if others appear who happen to be present or 
former employees of government who have a different interest they 
will be separately represented.
<P>
	The lawyers acting for the commission are not government 
lawyers, not justice lawyers. If the hon. member has a specific 
concern in mind I invite her to write me about it. I will look into it 
and I will respond to it directly. However, at the moment I am not 
able to see in anything she said today grounds for complaint.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of Canadians and constituents of Reform 
members particularly I again state our condemnation of the 
shooting down of two private U.S. planes by Cuba. I also state our 
equally strong condemnation of the American anti-Cuba trade bill 
that encroaches on our sovereignty and the anti-Canadian 
statements by Senator Jesse Helms.
<P>
	Surely it is time for the government to do more than wring its 
hands and do something decisive to protect Canadian interests from 
these disturbing American actions.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister explain why his personal appeal to the 
U.S. president and the personal intervention of his trade minister 
have failed to produce any support for the Canadian position in 
Washington, thereby placing Canadian interests, jobs and trade at 
risk?
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to see the hon. leader of the third party 
supporting our position. We have made all the representations we 
think are appropriate at this time.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs will talk with Mr. Christopher 
later this week. As Mr. Helms is good a friend of Mr. Gingrich, 
perhaps the leader of the third party could call Mr. Gingrich and ask 
the Republicans not to vote for that bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the protectionist speeches given in the American 
Congress are a carbon copy of those made by Mr. Turner and others 
in this country in 1988. Perhaps the Prime Minister could arrange 
for those speeches to be burned-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> The actions the Prime Minister has mentioned 
here today, phone calls to the president, media releases, 
negotiations at the highest levels, are essentially political actions to 
deal with this problem.
<P>
	When the government has taken the political route to dealing 
with trade disputes the U.S. has usually been the winner, as with the 
grain imports case. When Canada has used the practical and 
business like dispute settlement mechanism in NAFTA Canada has 
tended to be the winner.
<P>
	Has the Prime Minister instructed his trade minister to launch an 
immediate challenge to the Helms-Burton bill under the dispute 
settlement mechanism of the NAFTA?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the bill has not been passed. We should let the bill pass, 
see what the president will do with the bill and how it will be 
applied.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	In terms of trade relations with the United States, we have done 
very well. At this moment we have the biggest surplus we have 
ever had with the United States.
<P>
	The biggest trade relations in the world are between Canada and 
the United States and so there are always problems of this nature. 
We have been reasonably successful at resolving them. Sometimes 
we refer disputes to panels under the NAFTA. We might use this 
route if needed once the bill is passed. Then we will see the effects.
<P>
	However, we have done what we can to this point. I am delighted 
that the leader of the Reform Party is supporting this government. I 
will send a copy of <I>Hansard</I> to Newt Gingrich.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is quite evident why Canada's trade interests are not 
being properly represented. If the Prime Minister would go back to 
the NAFTA and read the dispute settlement mechanism he would 
see what it says: ``The dispute settlement provisions of this chapter 
shall apply whenever a party considers that an actual or proposed 
measure of another party would be inconsistent with this 
agreement''.
<P>
	It is quite clear that the Helms-Burton bill in the American 
Congress is a proposed measure in violation of the NAFTA.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister not direct his trade minister to file 
an application to the dispute settlement mechanism with respect to 
this bill?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the bill not been passed yet.
<P>
	When we formed the government there were 130 grievances 
between the two governments. The number is down to below 10 at 
this moment because we have done it in the proper fashion. We 
believe that if we have a civilized discussion with the Americans 
we will probably have a better result. Then it will be time to move 
if we feel we are going nowhere.
<P>
	However, I do not think Canada will gain a lot in losing its cool.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
1990, the voice of Radio-Canada was silenced in the regions, and in 
1996, if the government decides to eliminate advertising, as 
recommended by the Juneau report, the voice of Radio-Canada 
affiliates in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, eastern Quebec, the 
Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean, the Mauricie and the Eastern Townships 
will be silenced.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage. Since the recommendations of the Juneau 
report will likely result in the closure of Radio-Canada affiliates, 
will the Minister of Canadian Heritage categorically reject these 
proposals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, contrary to the request of 
the Bloc, we will not reject all the recommendations of the Juneau 
report, because there are good things in them. I would like the 
member opposite to get involved in a good debate to find ways to 
provide long term funding for Radio-Canada instead of dumping on 
the Juneau report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the three recommendations in the Juneau report are even identified 
by the report's author as the weakest ones.
<P>
	Given that Radio-Canada's contract with its affiliates ends 
March 31, does the Minister of Canadian Heritage intend to calm 
the fears of the people in the affiliate stations by declaring a 
moratorium on the recommendations that affect them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the member opposite's 
proposal is unreasonable. He is asking us to reject the 
recommendations of the Juneau report, when one of them was long 
term funding for Radio-Canada. Clearly I am not going to reject the 
recommendations of the report. I am in fact working to have it in

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the 
Prime Minister has learned to keep his cool.
<P>
	It is an election year in the U.S. and it has decided Canada is an 
easy target for its bravado and bullying. Not only have Canadians 
had to put up with the Jesse Helms anti-Canadian rhetoric, but 
today on CBC a U.S. congressman said Canada had violated 
international law by imposing fees on the inside passage, which 
puts us in the same category as Cuba.
<P>
	When will the Minister of Foreign Affairs stop allowing Canada 
to be a patsy to the bravado and bullying of foreign politicians and 
forcefully defend Canadian sovereignty on trade and on our 
territory?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

<P>
media.  They do not reflect the policy of the U.S. government or its 
administration.
<P>
	Furthermore, we have made it very clear, as we have been doing 
for the past many years, that the inside waters are our waters and 
that there will be no payment to the United States of any 
compensation. Those waters are ours to determine what will 
happen within them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government 
has caved in on softwood lumber. It has failed to stop the 
Helms-Burton bill and when the Americans unilaterally declared 
the B.C. inside passage to be international waters, the Liberal 
government, as we heard yesterday, simply sent a message. This is 
some defence of our sovereignty.
<P>
	The Liberal red book said: ``A Liberal government will end the 
Conservative's junior partnership relationship with the United 
States and reassert our proud tradition of independent foreign 
policy''.
<P>
	What happened between the writing of the red book and what we 
are observing now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what seems to have happened is that the reform party was 
down holding hands and making sweet talk with the Republicans in 
the U.S. Congress and perhaps got the false impression that the 
entire Canadian public reflects the position of the Reform Party 
that there is no sovereignty in Canada.
<P>
	The reality is that the Prime Minister has taken the lead in 
mobilizing Caribbean and Latin American countries. We have the 
European Union on our side. The Russians are on our side and 
countries around the world are on our side. We are leading the 
charge against the extraterritoriality of that bill. We just wish 
Reform would get on side.

<P>
	Two days ago, the defence minister stated in this House that the 
suicide rate in the Canadian Forces is, and I quote: ``about half the 
rate of Canadian society as a whole''.
<P>
	The reality is as follows: in the last four years on record, the 
Canadian average was 13.2 per 100,000 people, compared to more 
than 20 for the same number of people in the armed forces.
<P>
	In light of these facts, does the minister still stand by the 
statement he made two days ago in this House denying any 
problem in the armed forces?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

<P>
	The minister is still trying to play down this scourge. Will he

<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

presented to the House.

uses that kind inflammatory language he look specifically at the 
so-called U.S. legislation, the fishermen's protective act. It does 
not authorize the United States to use the coast guard against 
Canadian fishing boats. That is called a finding. It has no legal 
impact or legal authorization.

that Canada has full rights, which we have exercised and continue 
to exercise, and full sovereignty over our inside waters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the language is 
the same as in 1985. Yesterday the transport minister said: ``You 
cannot win with the Americans with rash and foolish behaviour''. 
He should have given that advice to Brian Tobin before he slapped 
a transit fee on the Americans.
<P>
	Negotiations over salmon with the U.S. broke down yesterday. 
There is no sign of an agreement. Now the U.S. has turned a fish

damage that could result in a violation of Canadian sovereignty?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

of fisheries, now the distinguished premier of Newfoundland, is 
one of the most ardent and effective representative this country has 
had in defending Canadian interests. We know full well that the 
present minister of fisheries from Newfoundland will follow in that 
tradition.

question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	On February 12, the Bloc Quebecois demanded that the 
Canadian government suspend all deportations of refugee 
claimants to Algeria, a country on the brink of civil war. Yet, as 
recently as yesterday, immigration officials were still deporting 
people to that country.
<P>
	Does the minister agree that it is unacceptable to continue 
deporting people to Algeria and essential to review the cases of all 
Algerian nationals in light of the explosive situation prevailing in 
that country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you know, there is an 
advisory committee that examines conditions in countries to which 
people are to be deported. Whenever this committee meets, it 
reviews the situation as a whole, what is happening inside the 
country, how past deportations went, whether the situation changes 
from day to day, and whether or not deportations should be 
temporarily suspended. In summary, every time someone is 
deported from Canada after having exhausted all avenues of appeal 
provided for in Canadian legislation, we assess the potential risks 
of sending this person back to his or her country. If we do send 
someone back, it is with the assurance that this person will be able 
to go home without facing persecution.
<P>
	At this time-which does not mean that the situation will not 
change in a few days, next week or next month-we are still 
deporting people to Algeria.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given 
the climate of violence prevailing in Algeria, does the minister 
recognize that Algerian nationals should benefit from a suspension 
of deportation measures just like the citizens of Rwanda, Burundi

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and

own merits. Again, the situation is reviewed on a periodic basis. 
Even in the case of Burundi or Rwanda, the situation will be 
assessed regularly week after week. All deportation suspensions 
are temporary. In this case, there is no temporary suspension for the

Mr. Speaker, the provision of emergency services in the tributaries

ice-breaking services in the tributaries at the request of the Quebec

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Canada has a long tradition of meeting its obligations to the 
United Nations in full and on time. It was $270 million last year. 
Thanks to political manoeuvring in the Security Council, Canada is 
going to be stuck with the full cost of sending additional troops to 
Haiti for four months, $24 million.
<P>
	Under those circumstances, will the minister consider 
withholding $24 million from our other UN assessments in order to 
compensate us for this unjust cost?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I regret very much the attitude demonstrated by the hon. 
member.
<P>
	The initiative taken at the United Nations a week ago to arrange 
for an agreement with the security council to continue and extend 
the UN presence is one of the most important contributions Canada 
has made to the UN for the rebuilding of that country. Haiti is 
desperately struggling to rebuild a democracy where there has been 
a dictatorship for the last several decades.
<P>
	For the hon. member of the Reform Party to cast aspersions and 
say that we should find some way of denying the value of that 
contribution really demonstrates his misunderstanding of the value 
that Canada places in the UN, on the building of democracy in our 
hemisphere and in ensuring that we have a stable, orderly system in 
the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope you award prizes 
for irrelevant answers to serious questions because I sure heard one 
there.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	Since the hon. minister wants to roll over and play dead on my 
first suggestion, in 1994-95 Canadian foreign aid to China was 
$162 million. Since it was China that blocked the security council's 
vote on the funding of the Haiti mission, would the minister at least 
consider  withholding $24 million of aid from that country, which 
by the way has a vibrant economy and is in no way a legitimate 
target for our largesse?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are two parts to my reply. First, if the hon. member 
took the time he would recognize that China has become in the last 
several years one of the most important trading partners for 
Canada. We have several billions of dollars engaged with it. Much 
of that has been generated by the fact that the foreign aid 
development budget has been used to help Canadian business with 
startup funds which will lead to much broader contracts at a later 
date. It has been one of the best investments we have made.
<P>
	Second, the other part of that aid has provided major assistance 
in the development of institutions to aid women, children and 
judicial institutions in China and to help in exchanges for education 
and training.
<P>
	The attitude displayed by the hon. member is the worst kind of 
isolationism that I have heard in this House in an awfully long 
time.

	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	The largest petition in the history of the Alberta Legislative 
Assembly was presented last week. Eighty thousand Albertans 
representing 458 towns, cities and villages demonstrated 
overwhelming support for the five basic principles of medicare. 
They rejected two-tier health care and called for the maintenance of 
national standards.
<P>
	What will the minister do to protect Canada's publicly funded 
health care system and to ensure that the principles of the Canada 
Health Act are honoured by all provinces, even Alberta?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for her question. The House should extend 
congratulations to those 80,000 Albertans who signed petitions in 
hockey arenas, shopping malls and homes across that province to 
give support to what we know as medicare.
<P>
	The members of Parliament from that great province realize 
fully that 75 per cent of its population support the five basic 
principles of the Canada Health Act. They do not support the 
two-tier system which is being advocated by the Reform Party of 
Canada. They support unquestionably the principles of 
universality, access, affordability and free access to all Canadians. 
It is high time that the Reform Party got on side with the general 
population of the province of Alberta.

decided, recently, to stop publishing the French edition of its 
magazine <I>Explore</I>, which, for reasons of economy, would only be 
available in English, from now on.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Foreign Affairs explain the fact that an 
agency for which he is responsible is contravening the Official 
Languages Act, and does he intend to reverse that decision as soon 
as possible? If he does not, it is clear that francophones will once 
again be the ones affected by federal cuts.

<P>
	The ministry yesterday said that the internal trade document was 
going to settle the problem but that document is two years old. Last 
September it was supposed to have a draft agreement on the energy 
sector and that did not happen. Meanwhile $2 billion a day is going 
down the tubes and Labrador is being shafted.

government, provincial governments and utilities involved have 
met to continue discussions in relation to this issue.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development.
<P>
	The minister has said that forestry will be transferred to the 
Yukon government on April 1, 1996. I would like to ask the 
minister if this is still the department's intention and if so, what 
kind of negotiations have been finalized with the Council for 
Yukon First Nations and the Yukon government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows we 
had a lot of difficulty with the forestry because the price was 20 or 
30 cents per entity which would normally have cost $20 or $30 in 
B.C. or Alberta. Over a period of time we increased the stumpage 
rates and put some of it into what is called the Elijah Smith 
Sustainable Fund which was named for an elder in the Yukon, as 
she knows.
<P>
	The problem is that the First Nations in the Yukon do not feel 
that they had been adequately consulted in the process of 
devolution, so I have slowed down the process. If I am going to err, 
I am going to err on the side of the First Nations in the Yukon.

	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	Last year the federal government received $60 million in GST 
revenues as a result of the spending of sports anglers on the Great 
Lakes. At the same time the exploding population of sea lamprey in 
the lakes has the potential to eliminate sports fishing.
<P>
	Can the minister advise the House whether his department is 
proceeding to decrease, maintain or increase Canada's contribution 
to the binational Great Lakes Fisheries Commission which controls 
sea lamprey programs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wish to assure the hon. member that the government 
is very interested and concerned about the control of sea lampreys 
in the Great Lakes.
<P>
	In this fiscal year we will be contributing $3.8 million which 
basically restores the level to that of earlier years. There was an 
increase last year but we are going back to earlier levels.
<P>
	It is the view of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans that in 
all fisheries the use of public resources, particularly those managed 
by public expense, should really command a licence fee. To that 
end, we are dealing  with the province of Ontario to look for ways 
to further assist in the control of predators like the sea lamprey, for

	She said: Madam Speaker, this is a bill on self-defence. At the 
present time, the Criminal Code allows the instigator of a fight to 
claim that he acted in self-defence, even if he kills his victim. That 
anomaly has resulted in a controversial decision being handed 
down by the Supreme Court on February 23, 1995.

illogical and absurd results, since the worse the aggression is, the 
more the instigator can use the wider ground of defence. Under my

use that defence when the victim dies. Only individuals who do not 
start the fight would be able to say that they acted in self-defence.

petition on behalf of my constituents as well as those from 
Assiniboia, Regina Beach, Pilot Butte, Riceton, Fort Qu'Appelle 
and Saskatoon, all in Saskatchewan. The petitioners are very 
concerned about the price of gas. They are very concerned because 
the increases have not been justified.
<P>
	They are asking the House of Commons and the government to 
set up an energy price review commission to keep gasoline pricing 
and other energy products in check.
<P>
	My second petition is also from many constituents in

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JUDGESACT">JUDGES ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (for Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-2, an act to amend the 
Judges Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am very pleased to be able to speak to the House on Bill C-2, an 
act to amend the Judges Act.
<P>
	I wish to express my very sincere thanks to the member for 
Saint-Hubert and the member for Crowfoot for their approval of 
the amendment to the act and their facilitation in assuring its 
passage through the House.
<P>
	As members of the House are aware, under the Constitution of 
Canada it is the duty of Parliament to fix and provide salaries, 
allowances and pensions of federally appointed judges. To assist 
Parliament in exercising that responsibility a process was 
established under the Judges Act in 1981 for the review of salaries, 
pensions and other benefits payable to these judges.
<P>
	Every three years a commission is appointed by the Minister of 
Justice to enquire into the adequacy of judicial remuneration. 
These triennial commissions are currently under statutory 
obligation to report to the minister within six months of 
appointment. The Minister of Justice in turn is under a statutory 
obligation to table a report in Parliament within 10 sitting days 
after receiving the report.
<P>
	The rationale of having such commissions is obvious. Triennial 
commissions provide the government on a regular basis with 
non-binding advice which is objective and independent in nature 
with respect to determining fair compensation for federal judges. 
The process respects and enhances the independence of the 
judiciary according to our constitutional traditions. The Supreme 
Court of Canada has affirmed that this independence of the 
judiciary is grounded on both security of tenure and financial 
security.
<P>
	The six-month reporting period has proven to be a very short 
time for the triennial commission members, who serve part time, to 
complete their onerous responsibilities. They need to invite and 
receive briefs on behalf of the public from judges' groups and 
others. They need to publish notices in the press. They need to 
acquire and study highly technical information. They need to await 
and study written submissions. They need to conduct public 
hearings. They need to prepare and translate the report. All of this 
is within six months of  appointment. This puts undue pressure on 
the commissioners and barely allows them the time necessary to 
approach the job methodically and produce a well considered 
report on compensation issues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="371"> 371 </A></B>
<P>
	The judges' organizations, the Canadian Bar Association and 
others making submissions to the commission have generally 
found the present six-month reporting period to be insufficient. The 
chair of the commission which is currently under way, Mr. David 
Scott, Q.C., as well as the main judicial organizations and the 
Canadian Bar Association are in favour of extending the reporting 
period by six months.
<P>
	Bill C-2 would do just that and nothing more. It would merely 
extend the reporting period for the triennial commissions from six 
months to twelve. The cost of this amendment would be nil. The 
bill would have no bearing on judges' salaries, which continue to 
be frozen like those of everyone else in the federal public sector.
<P>
	I urge honourable members to approve the quick passage of this 
minor amendment to the Judges Act. I once again wish to extend 
my sincere thanks to the member for Saint-Hubert and the member 
for Crowfoot.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am tabling the budget documents, 
including notices of ways and means motions. The details of the 
measures are contained in the documents.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to an order of this House, I will introduce today a bill 
seeking borrowing authority for the 1996-97 fiscal year. I am 
asking that an order of the day be designated for consideration of 
these motions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is as clear today as it ever has been that Canadians do not want 
rhetoric from their government. What they want is action, real 
progress. These are the standards that Canadians have set, and 
these are the standards by which this government wants to be 
judged.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	Seldom in our history have so many experienced such anxiety. 
Canadians feel our very way of life is at risk. They look at medicare 
and feel it is threatened. They look at the pension system and 
wonder if it will be there for them in the years to come. They 
consider the economy and they worry that the gale force winds of 
competition and change will carry away their jobs. Canadians think 
about their children, our youth, and ask what kind of opportunities 
will be left for them.
<P>
	If there is one obligation before government today, it is to do its 
part to address these deep concerns. It is to do what we must so that 
confidence can overcome anxiety and hope can replace despair. In 
short, we must act now to help Canadians secure their future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In short, we must act now to help Canadians secure their future. 
We all have our part to play in this undertaking.
<P>
	It will require the concerted efforts of individual citizens, their 
governments, business and others for our country to tackle these 
challenges effectively.
<P>
	What Canadians want from their government is for it to set the 
goals, to have a plan and then to work as hard as it can and as long 
as it must to help get the job done.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This budget is our third in a comprehensive and determined 
drive to restore fiscal health to this country. In this budget we are 
keeping on course. We are maintaining our pace. We are not letting 
up. Indeed, this government will never let up. The attack on the 
deficit is irrevocable and irreversible. Let there be no doubt about 
that. We will balance the books. Furthermore, we will put the debt 
to GDP ratio, what we owe as a percentage of what we produce, on 
a constant downward track year after year after year. Nothing, I 
repeat nothing, will cause this government's conviction to change.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We announced in November that we had bettered our deficit 
target for 1994-95. It is now clear that our target for 1995-96 will 
be achieved or bettered and that we are on track for our 3 per cent 
target for 1996-97. This is proof of the profound impact of the 
actions set in motion in our first two budgets.
<P>
	Moreover, today, we will make it clear that our deficit target for 
1997-98, $17 billion or 2 per cent of GDP, is also secure.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will hit the 3 per cent deficit target. We will hit the 2 per cent 
target announced last November. Indeed, we are announcing the 
actions today which will enable us to go beyond these targets to 
keep us moving toward budget balance.
<P>
	To that end, we are cutting our own departmental spending by 
almost $2 billion to take effect in 1988-89, I mean 1998-99. I am 
going backward; I sound like the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> This is over and above the 
substantial savings secured in our first two budgets. Most 
departments will have their budgets cut by at least a further 3.5 per 
cent in 1998-99; some are cut much more.
<P>
	Spending on defence and international assistance will be further 
reduced. The growth of spending on Inuit and Indian programming 
will be restrained. The dairy subsidy will be phased out over five 
years and the postal subsidy program reduced.
<P>
	This budget, together with our last two, will contribute $26.1 
billion in savings to secure our 2 per cent target for 1997-98 and a 
further $28.9 billion of savings for the following year 1998-99 to 
continue the downward deficit track and to give the debt to GDP 
ratio the downward thrust it needs.
<P>
	In 1993-94 government spending on programs, that is to say 
spending on everything but interest on the debt, stood at $120 
billion. By 1998-99 we will have reduced that to $105.5 billion. 
This will mean six consecutive years of absolute decline in 
program spending.
<P>
	Measured relative to the size of the economy, the decline is even 
more dramatic. By 1998-99 program spending will have been 
reduced to 12 per cent of GDP. This is down from close to 20 per 
cent just over a decade ago. In fact, it will be at its lowest level in 
over 50 years.
<P>
	Because we are focusing on spending cuts, not tax increases, 
over the three budgets taken together, we will have cut seven 
dollars in spending for every one dollar in new revenues. Let me 
say that in this budget we are not raising excise taxes. We are not 
<P>

raising corporate taxes.  We are not raising personal taxes. In fact, 
we are not raising taxes.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are pleased to announce that, in this budget, we are not 
raising taxes. In fact, this government has never relied on tax 
increases to hit its deficit targets. Nor has it relied on rosy 
forecasts. We are maintaining the prudent approach we have 
adopted from the very beginning.
<P>
	Our economic assumptions are once again deliberately more 
cautious than those of most private sector forecasters. As in both 
previous budgets, we are backing up our economic assumptions 
with substantial contingency reserves. These reserves do not exist 
to be spent on new initiatives, or new programs. They are there to 
handle unforeseen changes in the economy. If we do not need them, 
they will not be spent. They will go to reducing the deficit even 
further.
<P>
	As we have always said and as we have now proven, meeting our 
targets is the least we can do. It is not the best we will do.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the payoffs in hitting our deficit targets is the dramatic 
decline in the amount of new money the government must borrow 
on financial markets each year. This indicator, financial 
requirements, is the way most other major economies, the United 
States, the United Kingdom, Italy, France and Germany, calculate 
their deficits.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	In the year 1993-94, the year we came to office, Canada's 
financial requirement stood at 4.2 per cent of gross domestic 
product, or $30 billion. By 1997-98 our financial requirements will 
drop to only 0.7 per cent of GDP, or $6 billion. Relative to the size 
of the economy, our new borrowing requirements will be at their 
lowest level in almost 30 years. Measured on this basis, Canada 
will have the lowest fiscal shortfall projected of any G-7 central 
government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today's fiscal progresses do not result from a federal effort only, 
they are due to a national effort supported by Canadians from 
across the country and from all political affiliations.
<P>
	One of the primary goals of all provinces and territories is to 
return to fiscal health. In fact, eight provinces are expected to 
report a balanced budget, or even a surplus, for the fiscal year 
ending this month.
<P>
	The results are striking. For instance, in 1993, Canadian 
businesses and governments borrowed $29 billion abroad. That 
was reduced to $13 billion in 1995, and it will be reduced again 
next year and the year after that. In short, Canadian economic 
sovereignty is being restored.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In comparison with most other countries and in the arcane world 
of statistics, we are doing quite well. However, that being said, in 
the real world where we all live we know that despite gains being 
made, Canadians continue to worry very deeply. The reason is not 
hard to identify.
<P>
	Whatever the numbers might say, many do not see evidence of 
improvement in their own lives. They see sacrifice. They want to 
know whether their sacrifice will bring positive results and when it 
will end. Therefore the job before us is clear. It is to build on the 
progress we have made, to see it translated into good jobs, into 
sustained growth and social programs suited to the millennium that 
lies ahead.
<P>
	This budget is about consolidating the gains we have made. It is 
about addressing problems before they arise. It is about managing 
ahead, continuing to put in place new building blocks for security 
and prosperity. It will show how we will sustain the federal 
government's commitment to health care and our social programs 
into the 21st century. It will put forward a plan to restore 
confidence in the public pension system. It will enhance the 
protection of the most vulnerable in our society and it will 
reallocate spending to invest in the economic future of the country. 
In short, as all budgets must be, this is a budget about the present; 
however, it is also a budget for the future.
<P>
	Canadians want to know that the principles guiding government 
are the ones they share. Here are our principles. First, governments 
created the deficit burden and so governments must resolve it first 
by focusing in their own backyards by getting spending down, not 
by getting taxes up.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Second, our fiscal strategy will be worth nothing if at the end of 
the day we have not provided hope for jobs. We must focus on 
getting growth up at the same time as we strive to get spending 
down.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Third, we must be frugal in everything we do. Waste in 
government is simply not tolerable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Fourth, we must forever put aside the old notion that new 
government programs require additional spending. They do not. 
What they do require is the will to shutdown what does not work 
and focus on what can. That is why a central thrust of our effort is 
reallocation. Whether on the spending side or on the revenue side, 
every initiative in this budget reflects a shift from lower to higher 
priority areas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="374"> 374 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, we must always be fair and compassionate. It is the 
most vulnerable whose voices are often the least strong. We must 
never let the need to be frugal become an excuse to stop being 
fair.
<P>
	Let me now address the issue of the pace of our efforts. This pace 
has been constant from the outset. It was established deliberately. 
We will not alter it. It is our view that chronic deficits constitute a 
clear and present danger to this country, to our way of life, to our 
future. Chronic deficits put the disadvantaged at risk. It is they who 
suffer when the financial strength of government is so weak it can 
no longer reach out to those in need.
<P>
	However, this does not mean we share the view of those who 
think we should be going to a zero deficit overnight. Draconian 
budgets are not difficult to write; the arithmetic is painless but the 
human consequences are not.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In our view, durable progress requires adaptation, adjustment 
and understanding. A measured strategy lets that happen. A 
measured pace ensures that short term savings will become long 
term savings -à a downpayment towards restored fiscal health. 
Indiscriminate cutting, on the other hand, raises the real risk that 
short term savings will become long term costs.
<P>
	Our goal is clear and firm: to get the deficit down permanently -à 
not temporarily. We want to solve the problem once and for all. 
This requires considered and careful reform.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will balance the books and we will do so in a way that is 
measured, deliberate and responsible. That is our plan, that is our 
course. This is a question of costs, it is a question of consequences; 
but so too it is a question of values. We simply do not believe it is 
necessary to toss aside fairness in the quest for fiscal success. That 
has not been the hallmark of this country and it will not be the 
legacy of this government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have always made it clear that while fiscal progress is 
crucial, equally important is the redesign of government itself. 
What we need is a government that not only spends less money -à 
but spends more wisely. If there is one area where we must never 
let up, it is the effort to root out waste and inefficiency.
<P>
	Government should be focused on the needs of citizens -à not the 
needs of bureaucracy. Canadians want their governments to 
co-operate, not compete. And they want better service delivered at 
lower cost. Duplication wastes businesses' time and government 
resources. We want to put an end to such waste.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, legislation will be introduced that will allow for the 
creation of fewer, more effective government agencies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the best ways to reduce costs is to reduce overlap and 
duplication. This was one of the goals inherent in our program 
review exercise led by the current President of the Treasury Board. 
Surely we can all agree in the House that it is simply silly for a food 
processing company to have a federal meat inspector, a federal 
health inspector, a federal fish inspector, not to mention a 
provincial health inspector and a provincial food inspector, tripping 
over themselves on the same day in the same plant doing 
essentially the same things.
<P>
	What small business has not had the experience of a federal 
income tax auditor, followed by a federal sales tax auditor, 
followed by a provincial corporate tax auditor, followed by a 
provincial retail tax auditor, all asking for the same material 
organized in a slightly different way? This is why we are 
proposing, for instance, a single food inspection agency that will 
consolidate the activities currently spread around several federal 
departments. This in turn will allow us to offer a new partnership 
with the provinces which would lead to a more efficient joint food 
inspection system.
<P>
	For the same reason, the Minister of National Revenue will also 
create a national revenue agency, the Canada revenue commission. 
The creation of this commission will facilitate the development of 
a closer partnership with the provinces in revenue administration. 
Canadians know full well that there is only one taxpayer. A number 
of provinces have asked us with justification why should there not 
be only one tax collector as well.
<P>
	In the same vein we are working very hard to replace the federal 
sales tax. We believe this is crucial to increase fairness for 
consumers and respond to the concerns of small business while 
saving taxpayers money through more efficient administration. We 
are working with a number of provinces to achieve this end. If 
successful in getting provincial agreement, the government will 
take such steps as are necessary to implement harmonization. In 
addition, a significant package of measures is being readied to 
streamline and simplify the federal sales tax.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Fiscal health is not an end. It is a means to an end. It gives us the 
strength to move forward on everything else. As we continue to 
address the anxiety of Canadians over the fiscal health of their 
country, we must also look ahead to address other problems before 
they arise.
<P>
	Clearly, one of these priorities must be to preserve and 
strengthen our social programs for the next century.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="375"> 375 </A></B>
<P>
	These programs -à support for health care, for post-secondary 
education, for assistance to the poor speak to the spirit of our 
country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In last year's budget the Canadian health and social transfer was 
created. It was designed to put federal transfers for these important 
areas on a sound footing to allow the provinces more flexibility to 
better deliver these programs. In 1997-98 the CHST will be a $25 
billion transfer composed roughly equally of tax points and cash.
<P>
	Since transfers to the provinces and territories represent an 
important part of our total spending, we could not put federal 
finances on a sustainable basis without addressing them. That is 
why in last year's budget we announced funding arrangements for 
the new Canada health and social transfer covering the fiscal years 
1996-97 and 1997-98. Those arrangements will remain unchanged.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	With the framework of the CHST in place, our challenge and 
commitment is clear. It is to provide, as the Prime Minister 
promised, a long term funding arrangement with a CHST transfer 
that is stable, predictable and sustainable.
<P>
	To this end, we are announcing today a firm funding 
commitment for the CHST to cover the five-year period from fiscal 
year 1998-99 through to 2002-03. For the first two years of that 
period we will maintain the overall CHST entitlement, that is the 
value of the tax points and cash combined, constant at its 1997-98 
level of $25.1 billion. For the remaining three years of the 
framework, total transfer entitlements will grow each and every 
year at an increasing pace.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In addition, we will provide a legislated guarantee that the cash 
component of the transfer will never be lower than $11 billion at 
any time during this period. This will put an end to the decline of 
cash that occurs automatically as the value of the tax component 
grows. The provinces will benefit, not only from the growing value 
of the tax component, but from the cash guarantee as well.
<P>
	Based on an evolving formula tied to economic growth, overall 
CHST entitlements will increase over this period from $25.1 
billion in 1999-2000 to approximately $27.4 billion in 2002-03.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a result of these assurances, Canadians can have confidence 
that as we enter the next century the commitment of their national 
government in support of health care, post-secondary education 
and assistance to the poor will be intact and will be strong. As part 
of that, we will remain opposed to the imposition of residency 
requirements on social assistance recipients who move  from one 
province to another, and we will be steadfast in upholding the 
principles of medicare.
<P>
	This budget also addresses our commitment to provide a new 
approach to allocating the CHST among provinces, one that 
addresses the funding disparities resulting from the limits on 
Canada assistance plan transfers imposed on certain provinces by 
the previous government.
<P>
	The new allocation will be phased in during the course of the 
new five-year transfer arrangement. As a result, current disparities 
and per capita funding levels among provinces will be reduced by 
half. We are willing to examine with the provinces further 
refinements to the allocation that may be appropriate beyond this 
framework.
<P>
	Finally, on the issue of health care, this budget takes additional 
action. The Minister of Health will be announcing the 
establishment of a health services research fund under the auspices 
of the Medical Research Council of Canada. The federal 
government will provide an unconditional $65 million over five 
years. The goal is to bring together governments, health institutions 
and the private sector to fund research identifying what works best 
in our medical system, what does not and what possibilities might 
exist to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of our health 
care system.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One of the greatest pride and achievements of this country is to 
have provided a decent level of retirement support for our seniors. 
As a result of our public pension system, millions of seniors today 
enjoy a standard of living that is substantially higher than was the 
case for their parents. Our obligation today is to take the action 
necessary to safeguard that achievement for our children.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is widespread anxiety, particularly among the young, that 
the public pension system will not be there for them when they 
retire. Confidence in the pension system must be restored. The 
party that put pensions in place for this country must now act to 
preserve them. The challenge is clear: It is one of sustainability.
<P>
	First, the Canada pension plan must be put on a sound financial 
footing and done so in a way that is sustainable, affordable and fair. 
This government does not share the view of those who believe the 
CPP cannot be fixed, that it should be abandoned. We believe that 
the right to a secure retirement should be available to all and not 
become the preserve of only those who are well off.
<P>
	However, the findings of the chief actuary make it clear that 
changes are needed to restore the CPP to health. Clearly, 
governments should have acted some time ago to address this 
problem. We believe the role of government that is responsible is to 
act to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="376"> 376 </A></B>
<P>
prevent  problems rather than letting them become crises. And so, 
together with the provinces and the territories, we are acting.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The second pillar of the pension system à- old age security and 
the GIS -à is funded out of general government revenues. Here too, 
rising costs have led to concerns that these public pensions are at 
risk. Our obligation is to put those concerns to rest.
<P>
	In our last budget, we set out the principles of reform. Today, we 
are proposing a new seniors benefit to take effect in the year 2001. 
This benefit will be a central element of fulfilling our commitment 
to Canadians to ensure they have a secure and sustainable pension 
system now and into the future. Such was our commitment to 
Canadians.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister said many times, today's seniors have the 
right to know that their retirement is secure. They have the right to 
know that they will always get at a minimum what they receive in 
pension payments today. Our proposal guarantees that. In fact, 
many seniors will get more.
<P>
	Furthermore, younger Canadians have the right to know that, in 
the future, government pensions will be there for them. Our reform 
guarantees that as well.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This reform will make the pension system sustainable. We will 
do so by targeting help to those who need it most. By slowing the 
rate of growth of public pensions, the danger of crowding out other 
essential programs and services is being addressed.
<P>
	The new seniors benefit will be fully tax free. It will be 
completely separated from the tax system. It will incorporate the 
OAS, GIS, pension income credit and age credit.
<P>
	Furthermore, under the new system, the benefit and the threshold 
levels will be fully indexed to inflation. This is an important 
improvement for all seniors who worry about eroding benefits. 
Thus, the partial indexing of the clawback threshold will cease to 
be an issue.
<P>
	The new seniors benefit will be paid monthly. In the case of 
couples it will be divided equally between each spouse. Each will 
receive a separate cheque.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	This will be a fairer system. It will be based on total income, as 
the GIS always has been. We believe that since the incomes of low 
income couples are currently combined to determine eligibility for 
additional help, it is also appropriate to combine the incomes of 
higher income couples to determine their level of government 
support.
<P>
	The new benefit will be designed to fully protect low and modest 
income Canadians. Almost all of them will receive slightly more. 
In fact, all those who currently receive the GIS will receive $120 
more per year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Overall, our reform will ensure that 75 per cent of seniors will be 
at least as well, if not better off than they are today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Under the new seniors benefit, 75 per cent of seniors will be as 
well or better off; in fact most will be better off. For instance, 
nearly nine out of ten single senior women will be better off under 
the new system. High income seniors will receive somewhat less. 
The more income they have from other sources, the less they will 
receive. The very highest income seniors will no longer receive 
government benefits.
<P>
	In this House the Prime Minister has promised Canadians that no 
current seniors will have their OAS and GIS payments reduced as a 
result of this reform. In fact, our proposal goes one step further. Not 
only will the pension benefits of every senior over age 65 today be 
protected, but so too will the pension benefits of every Canadian 
who reached age 60 before January 1 of this year and their spouses 
no matter what their age. The government will give these 
Canadians a choice of whichever system is more advantageous to 
them: moving to the new seniors benefit five years from now, or 
maintaining their existing OAS-GIS pensions.
<P>
	The purpose of this reform is to assure Canadians that the 
pension system will be there for them in the future as it has been in 
the past. Fairness, sustainability and security: that is what 
Canadians seek and that is the hallmark of this new public pension 
system.
<P>
	The next issue concerns children. There are many more single 
parent households today than ever before. Canadians know that too 
often the needs and the rights of children following family 
breakdown are not being protected. The fact is there is too much 
hardship, tension and distress resulting from the current child 
support system. It has added to the uncertainty and anxiety that 
many Canadians feel.
<P>
	Our view is that children should be first in line. Child support is 
the first obligation of parents. It is not discretionary.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government promised to improve the child support system. 
Today, that action is being taken. The Minister of Justice will be 
elaborating on these measures in the days ahead. The first change 
we are making in this regard concerns the tax treatment of child 
support payments.
<P>
	Currently, child support payments are taxable for the recipient 
and tax deductible for the person paying. In our view, this is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="377"> 377 </A></B>
<P>
wrong. We believe these payments are there to provide support for 
children. They are not income for parents.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, for all new child support awards and all existing 
awards that are varied on or after May 1, 1997, support payments 
will not be included in the income of the custodial parent for tax 
purposes nor be tax deductible for the payer. This approach will 
ensure that the children who need support the most get it, and 
eliminate the need for complex tax calculation and planning by 
parents.
<P>
	Second, the method used for determining levels of child support 
is being improved. This will result in settlements that are fairer and 
more consistent. It will reduce conflict between parents and keep 
money now spent on lawyers and courts in the hands of the parents 
for the benefit of the child.
<P>
	Third, a wide range of measures is being introduced to help 
ensure that child support orders are enforced -à that support is paid 
in full and on time.
<P>
	We are targeting chronic, wilful defaulters. Because enforcement 
is primarily a provincial-territorial responsibility, these measures 
are designed to complement and bolster their efforts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We believe more should be done to support children. Therefore 
we are increasing the working income tax supplement under the 
child tax benefit. This supplement assists low income parents to 
meet some of the expenses resulting from work such as child care, 
transportation and clothing. It also helps to make up for the benefits 
lost by parents who leave social assistance and re-enter the 
workforce. Therefore I am pleased to announce that the maximum 
annual benefit is being doubled in two steps. It will increase from 
$500 to $750 in July of next year, and to $1,000 in July of 1998.
<P>
	When fully phased in this will result in an additional $250 
million in support annually to some 700,000 low income working 
families, one third of which are headed by single parents.
<P>
	Finally, we believe the current age limit of 14 on the child care 
expense deduction should be raised to 16 to provide more support 
to parents, in particular to single parents whose jobs require them 
to be away from home at night.
<P>
	Increasingly large numbers of Canadians are providing in-home 
care for adult children and other relatives with disabilities. This 
work is both invaluable and difficult. Therefore this budget 
proposes to increase the value of the infirm dependent credit from 
$270 to $400 and to raise the income threshold for the reduction of 
this benefit from $2,690 to $4,103.
<P>
	A number of groups including the Standing Committee on 
Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons have asked that 
we examine measures over the course of the next years, including 
those in the tax system, that have an impact on people with 
disabilities. I am announcing that we will do so because we believe 
it is important to constantly assess the mechanisms through which 
we provide assistance to persons with disabilities.
<P>
	Every day in every community Canadians give freely of their 
time and money to support the work of non-profit voluntary and 
charitable organizations. These countless acts of individual 
commitment are a powerful collective response to meeting 
pressing human needs, especially in this time of fiscal restraint.
<P>
	Governments must support Canadians in their effort. Therefore 
we are adopting the recommendation of the Standing Committee 
on Finance and the Canada Council that the annual limit on 
charitable donations be raised from 20 per cent to 50 per cent of net 
income. That limit will be increased to 100 per cent for gifts willed 
to charities in order to encourage charitable bequests. In addition, 
to encourage donations in forms other than cash, the same limit 
will be raised to 100 per cent on the portion of a donation of 
appreciated property that must be included in a donor's taxable 
income.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	Clearly the case has been made that more can be done. Therefore 
over the next year and in consultation with the charitable sector we 
will examine ways to further encourage charitable giving and 
charitable activities. We will focus on ways to ensure that increased 
government support leads to activities of direct benefit to Canadian 
society.
<P>
	One of the greatest challenges facing Canadians and their 
governments is the changing nature of work. Around the world on 
every continent we are facing a revolution whose scope and depth 
rival that of the industrial revolution itself. The contours of that 
revolution are clear. Distance is losing its meaning as barriers to 
trade and investment collapse and communications become 
instantaneous. The pace of change is accelerating as technology 
makes possible daily what once was only the substance of dreams.
<P>
	Some see this as a revolution about new opportunities. Others 
fear it is a revolution about opportunity lost. We must ensure 
Canada is on the vanguard of this revolution, not one of its victims. 
We must now work together to make sure the new economy is also 
an economy with new jobs.
<P>
	Canadians understand that the jobs of today and tomorrow will 
come from the thousands of Canadian businesses created every 
year, and we agree. Therefore the question is what is the role of 
government? We believe it is to provide the private sector and all  
Canadians with a framework for growth, the kind of growth on 
which job creation depends.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="378"> 378 </A></B>
<P>
	Clearly, despite our problems the economic climate in this 
country is getting better. The nation's balance sheets are 
improving. As a result interest rates have come down by 3 
percentage points in the last year. Inflation is the lowest it has been 
in 30 years, and Canada's economy is more competitive than ever.
<P>
	The point is in this world of globalization, of competition, of 
rapid change, focusing on getting the fundamentals right is 
absolutely necessary but by itself not sufficient. It is in this context 
that one must view the numbers on job creation. This is the most 
important statistic of all. In the last 13 months 263,000 private 
sector jobs have been created. Since November alone 123,000 such 
jobs were created, the majority of which were full time. These are 
good numbers but they are not nearly good enough.
<P>
	The proof lies not simply in the numbers of unemployed but in 
the increasing length of time it takes the unemployed to find new 
work. The effect of change is being felt by every segment of society 
in every part of the country from our biggest cities to our smallest 
communities.
<P>
	For instance, it is clear that rural Canada faces a particularly 
acute challenge of adaptation. While major metropolitan areas are 
often the focus of attention, it is absolutely essential that we 
continue to pursue policies to address rural anxiety as well, that we 
develop policies designed to meet the diverse needs of both urban 
and rural Canada, needs which remain essential to our economic 
well-being, our way of life and our future.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In other words, if our future is to be brighter, we must invest in 
it. And so, in addition to consolidating our fiscal gains and securing 
the future of our social programs, we are strengthening three areas 
of government emphasis that will help Canadians manage toward 
the future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Following the recommendations of the cabinet committee on 
jobs and growth headed by the minister of agriculture, we are 
making strategic investments in our youth, in technology and in 
trade.
<P>
	Let me emphasize that while we are announcing new initiatives, 
none of the funding required represents new money. All of it is 
sourced from a reallocation of existing resources.
<P>
	The economy of the future will belong-

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard): </B>Mr. Speaker, the success of our 
economy will very clearly depend on our young people, just as 
their success will depend on their ability to participate fully in all 
the economy has to offer. There is a clear role for government in 
helping our young people to prepare for a rapidly changing 
economy through the acquisition of the right skills and the 
provision of opportunities to gain work experience.
<P>
	And so in this budget we are providing an additional $165 
million over three years to be funded through reallocation within 
the tax system so that students and their families will be better able 
to deal with the increased costs of education.
<P>
	First, to recognize the non-tuition costs of schooling we are 
increasing the education credit from $80 to $100 per month. 
Second, in order to support parents or spouses who help underwrite 
the education costs for students we are raising the limit on the 
transfer of tuition and education credits from $680 to $850 per 
year.
<P>
	Third, to encourage parents to save for their children's education 
over the long term we are proposing to increase the annual limits 
on contributions to registered education savings plans from $1,500 
to $2,000, and the lifetime limit from $31,500 to $42,000.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Fourth, as we have said, we are broadening eligibility for the 
child care expense deduction. This measure will assist parents to 
undertake education or retraining. Single parents will be allowed 
the same deductions that today are only available to couples. And 
for the first time, the child care expense deduction will apply to 
those completing high school, not only post-secondary education.
<P>
	For our youth, learning is the first step. But increasingly, 
education alone is not enough. What is required is the opportunity 
for them to gain experience on the job. To help reach this goal, the 
government is reallocating $315 million over the next three years 
from other spending in order to help create youth employment 
opportunities. This is in addition to our existing funding provided 
through such programs as youth internship Canada and youth 
service Canada.
<P>
	Some of these additional funds will go to substantially 
increasing our support for student summer employment. Summer 
employment not only provides young people with the opportunity 
to earn the money they need to complete their education, it can also 
supply critical job experience.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="379"> 379 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, we are doubling our assistance for summer 
employment for 1996-97, from $60 million to $120 million.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Another part of the $315 million will be used to assist young 
Canadians who have left school to find work. The details of all of 
these youth initiatives will be provided in the near future by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	In summary, we are eager to enter into a new partnership 
between the public and private sector to create entry level jobs for 
the young. Government and business have worked well together on 
trade as Team Canada abroad. Let us now, business, labour, 
educators and government work together even harder at home for 
jobs for our youth.
<P>
	Our ultimate challenge is to change the very economic culture of 
the nation, to make Canada one of the most innovative countries in 
the world. Some may think that innovation applies to only one 
small sector of the economy, to those who write software, who surf 
the net. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is not about 
part of our economy. It is about all of our economy. From small 
business to large business, from coast to coast to coast, from 
mining and oil and gas, from agriculture and forestry the 
application of technology has become essential.
<P>
	Clearly it is the job of the private sector to innovate because it is 
its survival and growth that are at stake. But government too has an 
important role, in levelling the playing field against foreign 
competition, in forming partnerships to invest in areas of basic 
research of high risk, and where the scale of investment is simply 
too large for the private sector itself to carry alone.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To that end, the Minister of Industry will be announcing the 
creation of technology partnerships Canada. This program will 
encourage the development of environmental technologies, 
advanced manufacturing and materials as well as biotechnology. It 
will also help maintain jobs in the aerospace sector, which is 
subject to very heavily subsidized foreign competition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This marks an important departure from past practice. Both the 
risks and the rewards will be shared with the private sector. The 
government's investment should not exceed one-third of the total. 
The emphasis is on partnership, not unilateral federal action. The 
reallocated resources provided in this budget, together with the 
existing Industry Canada funding, will enable Technology 
Partnerships Canada to grow to about $250 million by 1998-99. 
This will lever substantial additional investment by the private 
sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In addition, the government is injecting $50 million into the 
Business Development Bank. This equity will in turn allow the 
bank to provide an additional $350 million in loans to 
knowledge-based, exporting and growth businesses that would not 
otherwise have access to the commercial banks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Minister of Industry will also accelerate efforts to bring the 
benefits of information technology to the whole country. By 1998 
through school net we will have connected every school and library 
in the country to the information highway. By the same year 1,000 
rural communities will also be connected through the community 
access program.
<P>
	In order to bring to small business the advantages of access to 
the information highway, we are instituting a program in which 
2,000 computer students will connect some 50,000 small 
businesses to the Internet, not only installing those systems but 
advising their owners on how best to use them.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	Our financial institutions have a key role to play in facilitating 
the growth of Canadian business. Over the past year, the banks 
have made progress in dealing with the concerns of small business. 
More needs to be done.
<P>
	To ensure our financial institutions provide the best possible 
financing for growing export and knowledge based businesses, the 
government will work with business and all financial institutions, 
including the banks and the insurance companies, to ensure that 
further progress continues.
<P>
	Finally, we are currently reviewing the legislation governing 
financial institutions. We are doing so with a view to improving the 
framework that was established in 1992. We have concluded that 
the financial sector has yet to fully adjust to this framework. 
Therefore, the present restriction on banks selling insurance will be 
maintained.
<P>
	The present framework for selling insurance through agents and 
brokers will be preserved. The white paper covering this and all 
other aspects still under review will be released in the coming 
weeks.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let me conclude this section by discussing trade. Canada's trade 
performance has been extraordinarily good. No one can deny that. 
The export sector has been the fastest growing sector of our 
economy, expanding at an average 8 per cent per year over the past 
decade. Our merchandise trade balance has soared, reaching a 
record surplus of $28.3 billion. And as a share of the economy, our 
current account deficit is at its lowest level in ten years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="380"> 380 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Trade will continue to be a major thrust of the government's 
economic policy. The Team Canada approach established by the 
Prime Minister has proven to be a major success and will remain a 
centrepiece of our strategy.
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade will continue our 
determined drive to secure new agreements for more open markets 
around the world, building on the exemplary work of his 
predecessor, the Hon. Roy MacLaren.
<P>
	Export financing is critical to ensure that Canadian companies 
can fully realize the opportunities before it. And so in this budget 
we are providing $50 million of new equity to the Export 
Development Corporation in order to support new export sales 
financing vehicles and new partnerships with exporters in the 
commercial banks.
<P>
	In addition, we are reallocating resources from subsidized loans 
for foreign borrowers to non-subsidized loans under an improved 
system to manage risk. This measure will increase the amount of 
financing available for Canadian exporters by as much as $500 
million per year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would now like to deal with the question of government 
revenues.
<P>
	No one is ever happy with the tax system. That is why we must 
do everything we can to ensure that it is fair and that the system as a 
whole is as effective as possible.
<P>
	Taxes are clearly higher than any of us would like, but the issue 
is not simply one of rates. Il is also important to ensure that the 
system is supportive of the nation's goals. To this end, the budget 
announces the following additional revenue measures.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is to announce the following revenue measures. The 
revenue we realize from many of these has been reallocated to 
provide tax incentives that will assist students, help the infirm and 
support charities.
<P>
	Let me begin with the provision of tax assistance to encourage 
Canadians to save for their own retirements through RRSPs and 
RPPs. We are proposing a number of changes that will better target 
this assistance to modest and middle income Canadians while 
limiting the cost to taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First, we know that many younger Canadians have a difficult 
time finding the money to make full RRSP contributions. This is 
often due to other pressing obligations, including education or 
raising a family. We  want to give them the maximum opportunity 
later in life to help make up for that lost time.
<P>
	Therefore, we will allow Canadians unlimited time to make up 
for any years when they were unable to make their full 
contribution. Thus the current seven year limit on carrying forward 
any unused contribution room is eliminated.
<P>
	Second, the contribution limit for RRSPs is being frozen at its 
current level-$13,500-until the year 2003. The limit will then 
increase to $15,500 by 2005.
<P>
	Third, we are reducing the age limit for contributing to RPPs and 
RRSPs from age 71 to 69.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In order to improve the effectiveness and the fairness of the tax 
system, a number of additional measures are being announced. In 
order to see them established, the government put in place 
incentives for investment in labour sponsored venture capital 
corporations. These incentives have worked. These funds are now 
very well established. Therefore, we are proposing several 
measures to reduce the unique incentives in place for these funds.
<P>
	Next, the budget provides a variety of measures related to the 
resource sector. In relation to oil, gas and the mining industries, we 
are clarifying and tightening rules related to the resource allowance 
following the review announced in our last budget. While revenue 
neutral, this will result in a more consistent and stable tax structure.
<P>
	We are announcing as well changes to the accelerated cost 
allowance rules for new mines, including oil sands, so that all types 
of oil sands recovery projects are treated more consistently.
<P>
	For mining flow-through shares, the current 60-day rule is being 
extended to one year while the eligibility rules for these shares are 
being tightened for the mining and oil and gas sectors.
<P>
	We believe that environmental health and economic 
development should be complimentary not contradictory concepts.
<P>
	To that end, this budget announces income tax changes that will 
provide an essentially level playing field between certain 
renewable and non-renewable energy investments. This is part of 
the base line study of possible barriers and disincentives to sound 
environmental practices initiated earlier.
<P>
	One measure is to create a new Canadian renewable energy and 
conservation expenses category in the tax system. A second 
measure is to extend the use of flow-through share financing, 
currently available for non-renewable energy, to similar costs for 
certain renewable energy and energy conservation projects.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="381"> 381 </A></B>
<P>
	A temporary tax on large deposit taking institutions, including 
the banks, was included in last year's budget. It will be extended 
for a further year.
<P>
	Finally, and of import, an effective business tax system should 
not only raise revenue, it should be designed to help create jobs. We 
believe that it is time for a comprehensive look at this issue.
<P>
	In order to identify any obstacles to job creation currently 
contained in the tax act and to suggest needed reforms, we are 
announcing today the establishment of a technical committee of 
outside experts who will report to me later this year to be followed 
by public consultations. If the creation of secured jobs is our 
objective, then every effort of government, including the tax 
system, must be directed toward that end.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That concludes our description of the measures contained in this 
budget. They reflect our desire to put in place the strongest 
economic framework possible for sustained growth and jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We spoke at the outset about the anxieties that grip our country. 
This budget is about doing what we can to help Canadians put those 
anxieties to rest. But let us be clear. A budget is only a small part of 
the answer. The full response lies in recognizing where we are in 
the evolution of a country and where we are in the evolution of the 
world beyond our borders.
<P>
	It is time to turn the page. Because the fact is that success for 
countries is no different from success for families or communities 
or individual citizens. It is based, above all, on one thing: the 
constant setting of goals and the meeting of new challenges. 
Successful countries do more than occupy a place on the map. They 
live in the souls of their people because they are relevant to the 
betterment of their lives.
<P>
	And so for Canada it is time to set goals anchored in our shared 
values and our shared aspirations. We have done that throughout 
our history, in the days when we dared speak of a national dream 
and then built it; in the days when we aspired to a kinder society 
and then created it.
<P>
	Now it is time to move forward once again, to arrive not simply 
at a common understanding of what we are, but a common vision of 
what we can be. Our challenge today is to make Canada a place of 
great expectations, a country once again where our children believe 
that they have the opportunity to do better than their parents.
<P>
	We must set great national challenges, not small ones, because it 
is only by reaching as high as we are able that we will discover how 
far we can go.
<P>
	The issue is, why can we not decide together in the House and in 
this country that 10 years hence, Canada will be regarded as the 
world leader in the new industries of the new economy, in 
biotechnology, in environmental technology, in the cultural 
industries of the multichannel universe? Why not decide together 
that 10 years hence, increasing child poverty rates will be a thing of 
the past, that illiteracy will be erased from our communities, and 
that when it comes to international tests, our students will not 
simply do fine work but in fact will be the very finest.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Why can we not decide together that medicare, ten years hence, 
will not simply survive, but be the most successful system in the 
world, a system that is second to none? Why not decide together 
that ten years hence our streets will be the safest they can be -à not 
because we have the largest number of prisons or police, but rather 
because we have faced squarely the sources of crime?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If we want to open new doors for our children, there is literally 
nothing standing in our way. We are a society that mirrors the 
diversity of an entire planet. We are already building on a great 
foundation. Now it is time to draw on that foundation, to write a 
new history ourselves.
<P>
	And so I would ask, let us act, not as special interests, but as 
stewards of the national interest. Let us follow in the footsteps of 
those who came before, who saw challenge as a rallying cry to 
move forward, never as an excuse to give up.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	Let it be said by those who come after us that we set the goals, 
that we met them together, that we propelled Canada forward into 
the new millennium, still and always among the front ranks of the 
nations of the world.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance's 1996-97 budget tells us nothing 
except that last year's bad news will apply this year as planned, and 
that all of the negative measures will continue, and will be even 
worse.
<P>
	The government will continue along the same path. As far as 
dumping the deficit on the provinces is concerned, the government 
will continue its drastic cuts to social programs, to the tune of $7 
billion over the next two years.
<P>
	The government will continue to make use of the surplus from 
the unemployment insurance fund, $5 billion yearly, when it has 
not contributed to that fund for a number of years.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="382"> 382 </A></B>
<P>
	The government will keep on going without any significant 
measures for job creation. That is what it has told us today.
<P>
	The worst part of all this is that the Minister of Finance is patting 
himself on the back for having restored healthy public finances. He 
is patting himself on the back for having applied the precepts of 
sound public financial management when, during his time at the 
helm of the Department of Finance, he has managed in two years to 
add over $113 billion to the cumulative debt of the federal 
government.
<P>
	Not everything in this budget is bad, however, and I would like 
to start by pointing out one positive element, the measure 
concerning child support payments. I would like to take this 
opportunity to express my personal appreciation and that of my 
colleagues to Mrs. Thibodeau for her monumental battle to gain 
equality for women.
<P>
	Since this measure will bring in tens of millions of dollars in new 
taxes, I cordially ask the Minister of Finance and the government to 
consider the following proposal: he could use these funds for 
transfers to the provinces, transfer part of it to the Government of 
Quebec, which has family policy levers to help the most 
disadvantaged families and children in Quebec and Canadian 
society.
<P>
	My congratulations, however, stop here, because a closer look at 
the budget reveals that the minister deserves no congratulations.
<P>
	It reveals first and foremost that the minister has given up in the 
fight against waste, duplication and overlap, because this budget 
contains no new measure to trim government machinery. We have 
been looking at this government for two and a half years, and God 
knows there is an enormous amount of wastage. On the basis of the 
report by the Liberal majority on the finance committee the 
government is abandoning its fight against waste.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Our second criticism is that the Minister of Finance did not 
speak the whole truth about the old age security system. The 
minister's proposals run headlong into 50 years of women's 
struggles for equality and financial independence, since the family 
income will now be the basis for determining old age security 
benefits and all the credits for seniors. It is disgraceful.
<P>
	As regards taxation, we are pleased to some extent that the 
minister gave in to arguments about the unfairness of the tax 
system, particularly corporate taxation. After two and a half years 
it was high time he did. It took him two years and a half to realize 
that the tax system was giving undue preference to big business, 
which makes good use of outrageous loopholes, and to accept a 
forceful argument from the official opposition for an in-depth 
review of our tax system.
<P>
	But, as I said, the minister only went part of the way, because he 
is now calling for a closed review of the corporate tax system, a 
process which is open only to great tax experts, great corporate tax 
lawyers who, at this very moment, are advising big corporations on 
the means to avoid paying their fair share of taxes to Revenue 
Canada.
<P>
	But there is more. Some of the members on this new technical 
committee represent companies which also have affiliates in 
countries considered as tax havens. That takes some nerve. Among 
the members of this committee will be representatives of 
companies that have affiliates in countries considered as tax 
havens, companies that benefit from special tax rates and avoid 
paying what they would normally have to give Revenue Canada.
<P>
	That is not what we were asking the government to do. We asked 
for a more open process. We asked for a special parliamentary 
committee made up of government members, members of the 
official opposition and members of the second opposition party 
who would have to be accountable to elected representatives, to the 
public, to all those who expect us to be responsible and to disclose 
the inequities in our tax system. Instead, the Minister of Finance 
opted for a process behind closed doors.
<P>
	We are also deploring the fact that, after announcing in the 
throne speech that a Canadian Securities Commission would be set 
up, a commission that would interfere in an area of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction, the Minister of Finance now wonders 
``Why should there not be only one tax collector in Canada? Why 
not set up a national revenue agency?''
<P>
	Is it not a way of isolating Quebec once again? Is it not a way of 
forcing Quebec to fall back into the line? Is it not a way of telling 
Quebec that it must let go of all the financial and tax leverage that it 
has been fighting for for 35 years to make way for a national entity? 
Is it not a way of establishing an institution to manage the proposal 
made by the government regarding a single, Canada-wide, sales tax 
to replace the GST? That proposal is unacceptable.
<P>
	When we are talking about eliminating duplication and overlap, 
it is funny to see how the government is always willing to take 
away some of Quebec's powers and keep them for itself. That is 
easy to do.
<P>
	It is also easy for the government to go after small investors, 
those in Quebec in particular, with the kind of measures proposed 
in this budget that will weaken one of the instruments we are proud 
of, namely the Fonds de solidarité of the FTQ.
<P>
	The government prefers to go after small investors, to go after 
tools which primarily serve to create jobs, rather than taking on big 
business taxation.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="383"> 383 </A></B>
<P>
	Here is another measure against Quebec: the government speaks 
of eliminating the milk subsidy even if it knows full well that 40 
per cent of the subsidy goes to Quebec. Attacking Quebec is easy.
<P>
	In conclusion, the 1996-97 budget of the Minister of Finance is 
only cosmetic, it is rather election-minded. It glosses over the 
negative effects of the last budget. It glosses over the government's 
inability to reduce its rate of expenditure. It glosses over the 
government's true intentions as regards taxation reform. It glosses 
over the government's inability to give a boost to the job market. It 
glosses over this government's desire to make Quebec toe the line. 
For these reasons, I will advise my colleagues to vote against the 
budget.
<P>
	I move, seconded by the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie:
